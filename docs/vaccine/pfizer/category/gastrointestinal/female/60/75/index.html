                                                Looked like an encephalopathy; Face was all swollen; Head swelled; Glands swelled; Fatigue; Headache/ So much pain in my head; Couldn&#39;t talk; Complete brain fog; nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. This 60-year-old female nurse (Patient) reported that received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation, Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune. Concomitant medications included Metoprolol at 12.5 mg for Atrial fibrillation and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN). No diabetes, no hypertension. None of the usual common diseases. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was &#39;weird&#39; sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday. What happened it looked like an encephalopathy but my head swelled, my face was all swollen, complete brain fog, fatigue and I couldn&#39;t talk. I was in so much pain in my head resulting in (incomplete sentence).&#34; Lab work included the only thing is the PCR swabbing. No blood test. Registered Nurse further stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know if that is important. But I will tell you and if it is you can send me the questions. I do have a history of Autoimmune. So my Physician thought that this was just like an enhancement of like my bodies reaction I have Chronic Lyme and I have lupus like my ANA has always been stressful. But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body&#39;s reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.&#34; Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I just wanted to let you know what happened and the intensity of what it was because normally I would expect a headache. But this was a &#39;go dated&#39;. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I guess the only question that I have is so do my work has this question and I was going to call my doctor tomorrow may be might know it better. I know that I have to take the second dose. But I understand the second round can be worse than the first. Is there anything that they are recommending that I can do may be prior to ease the reaction?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported clinical manifestations including swelling face and head swelled, which was suspected as encephalopathy by the reporting nurse, was probably related to the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), due to temporal relationship.  The subject&#39;s underlying Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune were likely the risk factors to the onset of the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The outcome of the event bruise at injection site was unknown, of the event leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out was recovered around 05Jan2021 21:00, the outcome of other remain events was recovered on 06Jan2021 12:00.  The reporter considered (method of assessment: Global Introspection) that all the events were related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: All the reported events were possibly related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship. However, it is worth noting that the 60-year-old female patient had car accidents history and had surgeries. All the events started when she worked nightshift, including leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out, nauseous, threw up twice, pain through whole body, tremoring and transient deafness. Patient did not get rest after vaccination may a risk factor to the onset of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears.

Her thighs were burning at 03:30 on 12Jan2020. It was persistent weak and burning. She can barely walk.

Nothing concerning, just more curious. With second vaccine, developed chills within one hour and went to bed. Upon awakening, had headache, nausea, chills, kidney area pain, chest discomfort from irregular heart beat. This resolved for about 18 hours, then started again and lasted for 1 week. Chest pain became sharp at times  spreading to arm with mild shortness of breath. Having had a full heart workup last year, did not pursue tests. wanted to see if would pass on it&#39;s own. After one week, only have occasional chest discomfort. Arrhythmia has returned to baseline occasional PVC. No further chills, headache, nausea or other pains.

                                                fever; nausea; general feeling of unwell; soreness at site; redness; whole upper arm was swollen after the injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient, Respiratory Therapist) reported that a 61-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE , Batch/lot number: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 around 6:00 PM in left upper arm at 0.3mL single dose for COVID Prevention. The patient&#39;s medical history was covid at the end of Apr/May2020 with shortness of breath, seasonal allergies and allergies to &#34;some anitbiotics.&#34; The concomitant medications was reported as none, received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced soreness at site, redness and swelling, fever, nausea, general feeling of unwell 3 days. Patient stated, &#34;I had covid at the end of April/May with shortness of breath. I thought I would have less reaction from the vaccine. I know someone who was out of work for a while week after the vaccine.&#34; States that she read that the 2nd dose is supposed to have worse side effects than the first. If she had bad side effects from the 1st dose, will the 2nd be worse? Also asking if the side effects are the immune system reacting or just an allergic reaction. Patient was anxious about getting her second COVID shot on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that she had all the side effects listed, for three days. Patient stated that she didn&#39;t mind the side effects at the time, she had fever, soreness at the injection site, nausea, and a general feeling of unwell, but Patient stated that she could not work like that. Patient stated that her question was, statistically she has read that the side effects from the second shot are supposed to be worse than the first shot, but she was wondering, if she had bad side effects from the first shot, will her side effects be worse after the second, or will they maybe be lessened because she already had bad side effects. Patient reported that she did fill out the VSafe significant because she had to work on the third day after her shot, which was Christmas Eve, and work, was so busy and she did not feel well. Patient stated that she does have two days scheduled off work after her next injection, but it is the third day that she was worried about because she does not want to work feeling like that. Patient stated that the arm soreness started that same day (21Dec2020). At first, Patient reported that the arm soreness resolved, but then she states that it is still a little sore to the touch. So Patient confirmed that it is ongoing but improved. Patient reportsed that the fever started the day after the injection, 22Dec2020 and it has resolved. Patient reported that the last day she recorded a fever was on 24Dec2020. Patient  stated that she woke up on 24Dec2020 and her temperature was normal, so she went to work and she did not feel so well at work, but they were so busy that she barely noticed, and then when the Patient  went home that night, she took her temperature and it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient reported that the nausea started on 22Dec2020, which was mild at times, but then she got to where she did not want to eat. Patient reported that the nausea has resolved but she was not entirely sure when it resolved because she had been so busy at work on 24Dec2020, and it was hard to tell what she was feeling because she was non-stop busy that day. Patient stated that she was nauseous for a full three days, and she remembered that she did not eat much on the 24th either. So Patient stated that her nausea may have resolved on the third day after her injection, but it is unknown to her what day exactly that it resolved. Patient was also experiencing the general feeling of unwell from 22Dec2020 for a few days, but stated that by 25Dec2020 she felt okay. Patient also included that her left arm was also swollen, like her whole upper arm was swollen after the injection in Dec2020. Patient stated that she also experienced redness, there was a like a red mark that was further down her arm than the injection site in Dec2020. The outcome of soreness at site was recovering.  Patient confirmed that both the swelling and redness had resolved in Dec2020.The outcome of fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The outcome of general feeling of unwell and nausea was recovered on 25Dec2020.

On 07Jan2021, she woke up at 2:00 in the morning, she had a high temperature, she was chilled, she had a severe headache, nausea, fatigue, and body aches. She got up and took ibuprofen (ADVIL). She was basically in bed, she had to cancel all her appointments in the morning, she just laid in bed and the following afternoon her fever broke at about 4:30 in the afternoon then she just had a low grade temperature and a dull headache, nausea through the next day, Friday the 08Jan2021. She still has a very dull headache and just not right, kind of like a flu bug. She had no fever; she had not had any fever after Friday afternoon or Saturday.

She was back to work now she just has a dull frontal headache. The reporting nurse assessed all the events, except of &#39;Doesn&#39;t feel like eating&#39;, serious for disability. She stated she may have had usual tenderness but nothing like this. The patient had recovered from the event fever on 08Jan2021 and from the event &#39;chills/chilled&#39; on 07Jan2021; the patient was recovering from &#39;nausea&#39; and &#39;severe Headache/Dull headache/Frontal headache&#39;, while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.

                                                After waiting 15 mins  I developed a dry throat and walked to my car (8-10 mins later). Began to develop difficulty swallowing by the time I reached my car.  Waited a few minutes and it did not abate and continued worsen,. Went to hospital&#39;s ER and was seen by Dr. At that time, my voice had become coarse and gravely. Was given oral steroid and a Benadryl.  Symptoms lessened a bit and were gone after about 2 hours. While at first I thought my breathing wasn&#39;t affected, after symptoms cleared, I realized that my breathing was easier. Symptoms did not reoccur.

                                                Slightly sore left deltoid, cleared up in a few days.  16 hours after shot, experienced the dramatic sensation of tilting while sitting on a couch.  Had I been driving, this would likely have caused an accident.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this feeling.  There were 2 or 3 other episodes of feeling like I was falling.  2 of this happened while lying down.  They were sudden sensations that made me gasp.  Spent most of 1 week in bed with fatigue, vertigo, and 2 times vomiting.  Vomiting occurred day 2 post vaccine.  Fatigue was continuous for about a week.  At day 16 now, certain movements still illicit vertigo.  All vertigo symptoms have lasted under 1 minute. However, some have been back to back, such as after repositioning multiple times in bed.  Ears have felt very full for almost 2 weeks.  Certain head positions or movements, still illicit sensations of the room moving.  There was no specific headache, but my head did not feel good for about 2 weeks.  There was no fever, but there was chilling one night, a couple of days after the vaccine.  I don&#39;t know if getting 2nd vaccine is wise.

At the walk in clinic they tested me for flu, covid and strep and on the rapid the result was negative but when done the PCR it came back positive (around 12/29/20). I did not have any respiratory issues on this one. I do remember having diarrhea.

                                                I am not sure this is what i shoud be filling out - just wanted to report what seemed like pretty bad symptoms on first dose by all info i have found. The actual shot was given by another facility than listed previously. I recieved the first dose of Pfizer at  Health Dept . No other location information was provided by them.  When i got the shot, a blood vein and possibly a nerve was hit. The nurse did everything properly i think to correct and notify other RN. It caused immediate pain in left fingers and arm felt heavy. That continued for days, but not too bad and injection site itself really was not very sore. My concern was how sick I felt starting within 6 hours of the injection and how long it lasted. I had pretty much instant nausea- no vomiting- mild but persistant, severe fatigue and general overall uneasy/sick feeling. Joint pain started within the 6 hours, along with a few odd pains in neck and right abdomen.  Was extremely chilled for hours, pretty bad tension /tight feeling headache, jittery feeling and foggy. I took a 500mg Tylenol about 8 hours after the shot, and it helped to relieve most symptoms to a degree that was nagging, but tolerable. I pretty much went through this for about the next 3 days and off/on to the 5th day

After the second dose, 3 weeks later, the symptoms appeared later but held on to day 5 or 6, except the more extreme dizziness which I still have. It is worse on some days and there is some nausea in the mornings with headache. I have never had vertigo but this is what I imagine it to be.

Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3302, NDC number/expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm (also reported as upper left arm) on 13Jan2021 at 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; the patient was a healthcare worker and was trying to protect herself. The vaccination facility type was reported as a drive thru site. Relevant medical history included previous neurological problems, which included history of underlying migraine with paresthesia/chronic paresthesia (ongoing) and tinnitus. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no other vaccine received on the same day of the Pfizer suspect or 4 weeks prior. She never had any problems with vaccines in the past. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was reported as none. Initially, the patient was asking if there were any reports of paresthesia, serious neurologic adverse events, tinnitus, hearing loss, or abdominal tightness in the studies for the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccine. After the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021, she experienced an exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus. She also reported experiencing some abdominal tightness on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient reported she was scheduled for her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, but had concerns because she was still experiencing tinnitus and it was &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss&#34; on an unspecified date. The patient further reported that she was due for the next dose the following day at the time of the report (03Feb2021). She had previous neurological problems and did not know if this did exacerbate things or not. She had migraines, tinnitus, and paresthesia and was wondering how many other patients with neurological problems reported this and was this a common side effect or adverse event reported. One doctor told her not to get the second dose and another one told her to get it and she wanted to know what she should do. The patient had headaches/migraines on the evening of vaccination on 13Jan2021 that were fairly mild and 3 days after that on 16Jan2021, they got bad and was accompanied with nausea with increased tinnitus. The migraines and nausea had gone, and the chronic paresthesia was the same as she always had, but the tinnitus was a lot louder and worse. The patient also mentioned that her migraines usually go away, but this one had lingered. The AEs did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. There were no investigation assessment. The patient recovered from the event &#34;nausea&#34; on an unspecified date, she was recovering from the event &#34;exacerbation of migraine/ headaches/migraines,&#34; she was not recovered from the events &#34;exacerbation of paresthesia and tinnitus/increased tinnitus, while the outcome of the events &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss and some abdominal tightness&#34; was unknown. The reporter assessed the events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; as serious, other medically important conditions. The relatedness of drug to the reactions/events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; was unknown as per the reporting pharmacist (Method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 61-year-old female had relevant medical history included previous neurological problems. The reported neurological events and partial hearing loss were more likely due to pre-existing conditions, and less likely related to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  Event nausea was likely due to the first dose of bnt162b2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Full viral panel including COVID-19 was not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 08Feb2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 13Feb2021. Acute pupil exam changes in the early am hours of 15Feb2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. The events were all serious. The patient outcome of the events was fatal. The patient died on 15Feb2021.  It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported event may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Blood pressure high diagnosed a couple years ago. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) for COVID-19 immunization on 29Dec2020 and unspecified flu shot last fall, she thinks in Sep or Oct2020, but she has never had problems with those. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient called and said she had reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 12 hours after her second dose and wanted to report it. She said also this past weekend, on Sunday, on 24Jan2021, she started to develop a localized rash that has like a border to it. She added that she got her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021 at about 01:30 PM in her right arm. She said that she woke up the next morning, 20Jan2021 at 03:00 AM with a high fever, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and rapid heart rate. She said that the high fever that started the temperature she took was 103 initially, she says she took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and it came down to 101, and the next day it was probably 100 most of the day, then it broke that evening. She said the Tylenol, the dose was the extra strength, unknown if it was 500 mg, they were capsules. She says she normally doesn&#39;t keep it around, the in-house nurse suggested it so she went and got a sample thing and took a couple doses, she doesn&#39;t have it with her as she is at work and is not at home. She said that the nausea and vomiting subsided after the first day or second day, she had the on and off fever and slept most of the day both days. She said that she doesn&#39;t have a fever now. She said that she doesn&#39;t have her exact heart rate from when she was having the rapid heart rate, she just felt it in her chest. She added that the only reason she said anything was because she called in sick last week on an unspecified date in Jan2021. She said that the rash started developing after that and it is now probably the size of a 16 oz or 60 oz cup, unable to clarify number with caller, she said that it is definitely big but it doesn&#39;t bother her, though she is concerned it is there. She clarified that it is a couple inches in diameter and kind of looks like the state of (State Name), on her injection arm which was her right arm. She said her arm is not sore now, it was after the shot on an unspecified date in Jan2021, if she pressed where the injection was it is still a little sore. She said that the hospital said to report it. She said she also has a concern if she should she get another shot if they decide this is needed for more than two vaccinations. She said that she knows they are still gathering information at this point, so she thought she should better turn in, hopefully there will be solution later on. The outcome of the events localized rash, dizziness, heart rate increased and sickness was unknown. The outcome of the events fever, nausea and vomiting was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021 while the outcome of the event vaccination site pain is recovering.

Aleve (2 tablets) at 7 am the next morning with little, if any, relief but perhaps prevented it from becoming worse and another at 2:30 am on Monday morning (the second day). Slept, although not always well, for the better part of 32 hours, with less than 3 hours of being awake and up, trying to eat little. Was able to make it through a nine hour shift on Monday, still with no appetite and a bit off (attributed to not being truly rested despite 32 hours in bed).

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that the patient vision wasn&#39;t as good. She also had glasses to read (eyeglass wearer and ongoing) and behind her eyes they were dry one (left) mostly. Concomitant medications included unspecified beta blockers. On 11Mar2021, she got chills on the same day. Right as she got the shot, she wanted to vomit also and got shaky. On 12Mar2021, she woke up with whistling in her breathing for a few minutes then it was done. At the same moment, her eyes were changed eventually. She had mucus in my eyes as her vision wasn&#39;t as good and behind her eyes, they were dry one eye (left). So, watching TV wasn&#39;t as good and became bothersome. She later noticed, the black in here eye was taken up most of her eye (as if her eyes were dilated). Her eyes and hearing were sharp also now sharp as she was reading better (without my read glasses) and had to turn down the volume in her TV. She also felt like she was getting hemorrhoids for a few days but then it went away. She also had black stool, then constipation (harder stool) eventually went the day right after the shot (12Mar2021). Then around 5pm, she had feeling like she had too much sugar and was dry which she needed water. Once she sat down, her living room door seemed like it was so much further away, stairs the spindles were larger in size, it was if she was high on something. It was different nothing but this injection. She was also experiencing a feeling of peace and calm. As if nothing was wrong, no stress (stressing about something) she couldn&#39;t even think of- everything was gone, a calming effect. It was high feeling. The next day (13Mar2021), she had a super watery bowel movement then went into clay like and drier consistency but still dark (she never had stool this dark). In Mar2021, she also stated that there was a movement under her skin like a pre-herpes or a pre-shingles. She mentioned that she knew herpes and the movement under her skin was shingles feeling. Her skin was also extremely dry. On 17Mar2021 (a week after the injection), she woke up to my heart spasm. It was beating real fast (beating like right under her skin), no pain and heart attack but more than a heart flutter. She didn&#39;t know whether it was going to beat or stop. She also woke up with a loud whistle (louder than before) out of a dream. She stated that during the day she doesn&#39;t get the stressed, but in her dream, it was magnified and woke up in a violent vicious fury. She had 3 nights of this (uncalm coming into my dreams viciously, morbidly gross) started on 14Mar2021. The heart spasms come as a few seconds and goes away but that&#39;s happened twice which it scares her. She also stated that there was feeling of hardness in her lower abdomen and heart area (belch) in Mar2021.  The injection almost reversed her beta blockers (which keep it in the 50s) it went to 79 (same as it was before she started taking beta blockers) but her blood pressure was normal 121/something (that was a good thing). She also mentioned that her energy was so much more while other people woke up early, cleaning up -would get sleepy and a little tired. But this (injection) gave her energy. Her injection site for the first 2 weeks also had an itch, that would come up (not constant) almost like a yeast infection which had an extreme itch. There&#39;s pain was there on touch (no throbbing pain) it took over a week before it was gone. She also mentioned that the chills were off and on for 4 days. The vaccine also did something to her weight as she was expecting to lose weight, but she didn&#39;t. One day, she gained 3.2 pounds then the next day lost 3 pounds. Her tooth also broke (but no pain in her tooth) even she had a sensation of her teeth being weak which she could feel it. Her tooth broke eating a tortilla chip and that&#39;s weird. She wanted to know if other people had called in with the symptoms that she had experienced. The patient recovered from breath sounds abnormal and constipation on 12Mar2021; cardiospasm, chills and vaccination site pain in Mar2021 while the remaining events were unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. Information on the lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

I continued to bleed for hours (only when  cramping) and ended up going to an ED for severe abdominal pain, bleeding, nausea and general weakness. The ED doctor said it was from internal hemorrhoids and the diarrhea and was not sure it was related to the Covid Vaccine and possible being an intestinal flu but I felt like I needed to report.  I also had nausea and vomiting the evening of 12/26/20 lasting about 12 hours. It took me a few days of Zofran and Imodium to get it in control and the bleeding did stop by 12/27/20.

                                                10:23pm felt a slight headache and nausea.  Left work at 10:43pm since didn&#39;t feel good.  While on road, my tongue started to tingle and then my lips started to tingle and both sides of face felt numb. This started around 10:50pm?  Went to bed and woke up Sat with same tongue, lip tingleling and face numbness.  Lips felt very swollen. Felt that way throughout the weekend.  On Monday, went back to work place injection area and requested someone talk to me.  Nurse practioner came out and spoke to me, asked about balance of facial features, no problem breathing or swallowing and gave me 25mg benadryl to take 3 times a day.  Did nothing but make me sleepy.  She calls me Tue am and told me to make an appt with PCP.  Made phone appt  for Wed.  Dr calls me Wed am and gives me presciption for 60mg Prednisone to take for a week (at this time symptoms are the same).  the first 3 days taking Prednisone the intensity of tingleling seems to lessen day by day.  But on 4th day, the symptoms stopped lessening.  Finished the meds anyway. Last 3 days, i&#39;ve also had that mild headache back in addition to the numbness from face traveling up to my ears. Past few days the tingling in tongue isn&#39;t confined to just the edges of the tongue.  It started with the first 1/4 of whole  tongue and is today tingleling in the front half of whole tongue.  One good thing so far is the past few days, my lips feel way less swollen and tingleling is lessening. So, riding this out, hoping it will  end sometime this year.  Will not be getting the second shot.  Just so you know.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1284), intramuscularly in the left arm on 29Dec2020 at 06:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); both taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date.  The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, influenza vaccine (FLU VACCINE) for an immunization on an unspecified date (received within two weeks of vaccination).  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: muscles felt really tightened up and stiff when getting out of bed and throughout the day (worst complaint) (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight nausea/nausea (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight fatigue (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight headache (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slightly stiff neck (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, right arm pain (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, back pain (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, the muscles knot up under her rib cage/muscle tightness (non-serious) in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown.  The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020 at work, and she had been experiencing adverse events since. The worst side effect she was experiencing was muscle tightness. At the time of the report, the patient got up at 09:00, and her &#34;back was killing her.&#34; The patient was achy. The patient would tighten up really tight under both rib cages, and it made her nauseous. The patient had been taking ibuprofen (ADVIL) and ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN since she received the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in her left arm, but her right arm hurt the next day. The next day after that (30Dec2020) she woke up and the right side of her back around the kidney area hurt. It was the right side lumbar. The next morning after that, &#34;her entire back was killing her down the middle of her spine. From her head all the way down.&#34; Since then, it came and went. The patient could not say if it was persisting, improving or worsening for any of the symptoms. &#34;It just grabs her.&#34; The day before the report, the patient thought she was doing better. The patient cleaned the house, and then sat down to eat. The past two nights, it had &#34;hit her really hard during supper time.&#34; Both of her sides of her back would tighten up; &#34;tense up like waiting for an impact before a wreck.&#34; The patient&#39;s back would seize up. The patient could not get comfortable; and would start pacing. Then, she would try to lay down. Last night, it took a half an hour to loosen back up. &#34;It knots up like crazy. It was bad enough, she thought she was going to pass out.&#34; The patient did not know if it was the combination of eating supper or what. The patient thought if she got up that maybe she would feel better. The patient started pacing around. The patient went outside because she thought maybe fresh air would help. When it would tighten up under her rib cage, it made her nauseous. The patient did not know if it was a &#34;vagus nerve thing or what.&#34; The patient was close to throwing up. The muscles knot up under her rib cage. The patient&#39;s back felt like she fell off a horse. It was weird to her that her left arm never bothered her. &#34;Nothing stays the same.&#34; Sometimes it was her entire arm or part of the arm that hurt. Like on top of her forearm. The patient thought she was doing good and then it would come back. When she moved her arm upward, she felt it. The patient said she could deal with the arm pain. It was the knotting up pains that were the worst. The patient tried calling an institute (name withheld) because it happened while eating dinner the other night. The institute (name withheld) &#34;nurse was useless.&#34; The pain was across her sacroiliac area. The patient had been &#34;living on Advil and ibuprofen for her back pain.&#34; The patient had been taking them together. The patient worked nights, and she was planning on going to work the night before the report, but she had to text her boss and tell her she could not come in. The patient was in good health; had perfect blood pressure and her sugar was normal. The patient was not diabetic. The patient&#39;s labs were always normal. The patient was really dreading that second shot. &#34;The flu shot kicked her butt for a couple of days, but this was way worse.&#34; The patient started reading up on the COVID vaccine, and it said usually younger people had severe side effects. That old people have less of a response. The patient did not know why she was experiencing such side effects. At the time of the report, it was day 7 or 8, and she was still feeling bad.  The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

I left work at 8:00am on the 18th with no fever ( I checked three times during the midnight shift ) I went home to bed and woke up at 6:00pm with 100.8 fever ( I never run a fever ) had fever chills and joint pain in the upper body no respiratory issues .Within 48 hours  the fever was gone as well as the chills but I continued to be sick to my stomach for another two days.I wanted to report this delayed reaction because of my underlying HIV and given the fact no individuals with HIV were included in the initial study. I tested negative with the nasal swab test on the 20th.

EMTs were called but I didn&#39;t go to the hospital.  My son picked me up and took me home because I was unable to drive.  On the way I experienced loss of vision and speech for about 5 minutes.  When I got home, my legs were so shaky that I had to have help walking.  I started getting severe chills that took 3 hours to get warm (2 heavy blankets, space heater, and heating pad).  I was very fatigued and felt bad the rest of the day.  (Saturday)The next day I had flu-like symptoms; headache, joint aches, chills, nausea, extreme fatigue.  Sunday was better but still had to rest most of the day because when I would stay up for over 30 minutes, the symptoms would return.  Monday-  stomach cramps, headache, fatigue  but went to work (30 minutes late due to stomach) and left 30 minutes early.

                                                I had to get cleared by a allergist prior to getting the vaccine due to my prior history allergy history. I was advised by the allergist to take Allegra an hour before receiving the vaccine. About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I started to throat my started to feel dry and tickling, it felt like it swelling starting from the left side to the center, I started having difficulties swallowing my salvia and any fluid. My blood pressure was checked and it was elevated.  I started to have difficulty breathing. They transferred me over to the ER. They gave me IV medicines Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid (I think). After 6 hours I was able to go home. Everything went back to normal besides the pain in the left arm at injection site.   I had a telemedicine visit today with my primary care physician to follow up.

                                                heart rate of 160; severe nausea; arm soreness; muscle soreness in left arm; general fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 62-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 62 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EK5730) administered on 30Dec2020 at 01:00PM and the patient said she did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. The patient received no concomitant medications. She stated that she had no other recent vaccinations or new medications. One thing that may be important is that she did do a 7 day detox that ended the Sunday before her second vaccine dose, so her body was pretty much having no impurities in it, and she has been eating clean since then, maybe having something foreign put into her body set it off after detox. The patient experienced arm soreness and general fatigue on 21Jan2021, and on 22Jan2021 at 01:00 she experienced severe nausea and heart rate of 160 (which was reported serious as medically significant). Patient reported that after her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine she had a significant side effect that didn&#39;t happen until 10-12 hours after getting the vaccine. She did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. After the second injection her arm was sore, and she had general fatigue. She had the second dose injected Thursday at around 01:00PM, then at one in the morning her heart rate was 160, and she had severe nausea. She was that way until 08:00AM. Her heart rate was 120 probably by 09:00AM, then came down to 100, she has never had anything like that before. Her arm soreness was a deep muscle soreness to her left arm. The fatigue was a couple hours later after she got the second dose of the vaccine. The nausea started at 01:00AM, and lasted until six to eight, she did no treatment, and it improved and is still gone now. For her heart rate of 160, she had no treatment, though she probably should have gone to the hospital, but it came down. She usually runs a heart rate of 60-70, it went back to normal Friday, probably in the afternoon on the 22nd, about 12 hours after that started. The patient stated that she feels this is medically significant for her heart rate to be that high. She had contacted her primary care physician (PCP), but they didn&#39;t call her back for 4-5 hours, by then she was fine. She doesn&#39;t think that this was treated well by her PCP, and that they should have done an electrocardiogram (EKG) and follow up labs, she is changing her PCP as a result of this. She is concerned about the people who will be getting their second dose, she has been helping with these, they have patients that are over 100, they wouldn&#39;t survive that rapid heartbeat. The outcome of arm soreness/muscle soreness and fatigue was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event of heart rate increased was likely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                I have chronic left lower quadrant pain/inflammation due to prior abdominal surgeries. My doctors have told me it is scar tissue/adhesions.  I have flare ups periodically.  This has been going on for more than 15 years.  I have not had a major flare up in more than 2 years.   I received the second dose on 2.10.  I had mild flu like symptoms in the next 24 hrs.  On 2/16 I began to feel like I was going to have a flare up.  The pain progressed to constant.  It was the worst flare up of this left lower quadrant pain I have had in YEARS!   I had to call my MD and ask for pain medications.  I was nauseous as well.   The pain slowly began to subside and by 2/23 I was back to normal.   The ONLY thing different in my life has been the vaccine.

A little breathing problem - it was almost like my reaction to bees that I had before - where my throat was closing up but that was just for about an hour.

A 62-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982, expiration date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shingles which she contracted in 2019, about one and a half years ago, it was a shingles on her back and lower back which she stated were the worst place for shingles has attacked, it left her with severe pain in both legs; diabetes; and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included losartan, atenolol (a beta-blocker), and metformin for diabetes. The patient took the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and after about 2-4 days (Jan2021), she had a little chill and got very tired. She had to take care of herself. She was very tired not realizing it was the shot she took. She also felt like she has no energy. The patient was working from home but a lot of times, she was lying on the couch. Over the weekend (Jan2021), she had a slight pain on left arm. About a week or 8-10 days later (2021), she got very tired and couldn&#39;t even sit up. Her body was not itself. She started to feel like a bus rolling over her, like somebody took a baseball bat and beat her really bad. The patient uses her arm a lot and her hand started to feel a lot of pain. She couldn&#39;t even touch herself; it was so sensitive. She took paracetamol (TYLENOL) but it didn&#39;t work. She had celecoxib (CELEBREX) an anti-inflammatory, she thought she was maybe inflamed, but it didn&#39;t work. She had some diclofenac cream, she rubbed it, but it didn&#39;t work. The patient had shingles about a year and a half ago which was very bad. She just felt weak and didn&#39;t feel like herself anymore. She had a little bit of nausea and her whole body was really terrible. When she had the shingles, it left her with severe pain in both legs. She saw a neurologist and told her that she would have to take pregabalin (LYRICA) and it would go away. So, when she had severe pain last week, she took pregabalin but it didn&#39;t help. The patient took half of acetaminophen, oxycodone (PERCOCET) as she was not the person who takes pills, but it didn&#39;t work. Her body was so severe on Friday, it was not going away, the pain was there 24 hours. The patient has been experiencing this for 8-10 days now. She took one PERCOCET on Friday and had a slight relief and didn&#39;t took anything again. She kept rubbing the diclofenac cream, but it was not much of a relief. This morning, she has to work, she was sitting so she took PERCOCET. She is getting her second shot on Friday, 12Feb2021. She asked how she will feel after the second dose if she felt that way after the first dose, if the first shot was adequate, and if she should take the second dose. She stated that she didn&#39;t want to take the second dose. Her body felt so weak including her fingers and hand. It triggered the shingles pain in her back and felt like she was beaten up by someone. She has to lie down for the pain in her back. She also mentioned that she couldn&#39;t sit for so long as her waist and back were so painful. She was lying on a heating pad and ice and nothing was working. She even has a hard time getting up. She thought what happened was it triggered the shingles pain in her back and also left her with a problem under her feet. The shingles left her with some kind of damage when she took the shot. It was really bad. Her son was a physician and was concerned because last week, it got so bad, she didn&#39;t come out, she was in bed and bedridden from Friday to Sunday. She had no appetite, she didn&#39;t eat. The only thing that the patient had was diabetes and high blood pressure, but it was under control. She just checked her pressure and its was 130/80, and now, because of the pain, it went up a little bit, but before my pressure was like 120 something, over 68 or 72 it was always around the 60s and 70s. Since she was having this, it was a little high. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She made it home, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), and got in bed. Saturday her headache was on steroids, she had fever, and just didn&#39;t feel good. Later that day, she was so sick she went to the bathroom and she guessed she passed out. Basically, her husband said he found her on the floor after he heard a thump. He asked me what was his name. He said she responded correctly, but then her eyes rolled back, she became rigid, and he called 911. she knew 2 sets of paramedics arrived w/ambulances. They monitored her vitals and stayed until she was normal. They were willing to take her to the hospital, but offered other options for her husband and she to consider. They suggested she see her Primary care doctor (she did on 29Mar2021). Her doctor believed she should not take the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Adverse event start date was 26Mar2021 at 12:30 pm. AE resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was reported no treatment received for the adverse event. The outcome of event was resolving. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

On 10Apr2021, patient felt like she was going to die, and went to urgent care and asked if they could give her fluids. They gave her fluids and Zofran and that helped a lot.

I?m typically a very health person and have never experienced any of these experiences before.

                                                2.5 hours after receiving vaccine, I started getting dizzy and vomiting. I vomited 6 or 7 times. I was so dizzy I couldn&#39;t open my eyes without getting sick. We called ER and explained that we thought I was having a reaction to the vaccine, and their response was they had never heard of that type of reaction. I was sick all night, called my primary Dr in the am and they told me to go to ER. We had to call ambulance to take me there because I was so sick and couldn&#39;t open my eyes without having to vomit. Room spun in circles. My arrival at ER, they did MRI, EKG, blood work. My blood pressure was very high, so they connected me to a heart monitor. I had low Magnesium due to vomiting so much.  I was treated with Valium and anti-vert medication and fluids. I stayed overnight in hospital- had PT Jan 13th  for DX of Vertigo. Then referred to Outpatient PT for Vertigo.  Dr&#39;s felt it was a &#34;coincident&#34; that I got Vertigo shortly after vaccine, and strongly felt it was not related.  . Today is Jan 17th, and I am still dizzy, but feeling better. I have an appointment with my primary Jan 18th and not sure if I should take the 2nd dose. That is the question.

A 63-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK4176/expiration date) dose number 2 intramuscularly on 08Jan2021 11:45 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine in a hospital. Medical history included severe allergic reaction to pecans and tinnitus. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (dose number 1, intramuscularly on the left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced tinnitus, sinus infection, and stuffy head after the first dose. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks and no other medications were taken within 2 weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post-vaccination. On 08Jan2021, after the 2nd dose, the patient experienced itching across shoulders/back of neck and sl nausea. She took Benadryl which relieved the itching. She went to bed and had onset of body aches, chills, and sense the she couldn&#39;t get a good breath. She felt like there was a tight band around chest. Her O2 Sat was 95% - 98%, with pulse of 101-129, T max was 101.8. The symptoms were lasting about 6 hours. In the morning, the patient took Aleve and Benadryl. Most symptoms were alleviated. She took those meds scheduled for 48 hrs. She noticed that if she tried to push past scheduled time, the itching started to return, so she just kept the meds scheduled for 48 hours. No other symptoms after that. She added that she had tinnitus, and she noticed that both injections made that worse. It was not yet subsiding since last injection. The patient also received Tylenol for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021.

I felt like I was going to faint and then I got nauseated and I knew I was going to throw up. With my husband&#39;s help, I did manage to get to the bathroom (about 6 steps away).  I threw up and immediately sat down in the nearest chair.  I threw up a second time into a vessel after that.  I then got a massive headache and chills.  I could barely walk with assistance up the stairs to go to bed.  I have never been more fatigued.  After going to bed, I slept all night and woke the next day still fatigued, but nothing like the night before.  I was able to work, even though I felt really tired.  I did not have much of an appetite all day and two days later, I still feel fatigued.

Second dose nausea the first night, extreme fatigue the second day which was gone by day 3. Headache from day after vaccine until today (5 days later)  with more severe headache and dizziness today, but not bad enough to make me not be able to function.

Twelve hours post vaccination: slight chills without fever, severe headache, nausea and fatigue Twenty four hours post vaccination: severe headache, moderate nausea and fatigue Forty eight hours post vaccination: moderate headache, mild nausea and fatigue Seventy two hours post vaccination: symptoms resolved (*Correction: I believe I may have recorded the date for vaccine #1 incorrectly on the form I previously submitted regarding a reaction to my second vaccination. When asked if I had received any previous vaccinations within the past 4 weeks, the correct date for my first Covid-19 vaccination should read 12/28/2020, 10:00 am)

I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got her first shot for the vaccine last Friday afternoon (15Jan2021). Yesterday early evening (19Jan2021), she was feeling nauseous and was vomiting. She wanted to know if it was an adverse effect from the COVID-19 vaccine even though it was the 4th day after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. She also mentioned that she ate a bunch of pistachios and wasn&#39;t sure if that was a contributing factor to what she was experiencing. The patient experienced indigestion, belching, and vomiting on 19Jan2021. She is feeling okay now and asked if that was normal. She confirmed contact details. She was asking if it was normal to have the side effects 4 days after getting the vaccine. She is so much better and has not vomited since 07:30 this morning. She has improved within the last hour. She still has tightness in her upper intestines, but it could be because she is hungry since she has not had anything since yesterday. She is glad she is feeling better. Stated the indigestion could be from all the pistachios that she ate at work. She took tums. She still had indigestion and ate a small dinner. She kept vomiting after, and it was more of a liquid. She put her glasses on. She has a hard time seeing the lot number on the card she was provided, stating it is so small Dose reported as 30mcg or 0.3ml. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Starting a couple hours after vaccination, I began to feel unwell, overall poorly, nothing specific.  Went to be early at 9:30 and awoke at one a.m.on February 26 with splitting headache.  Could not get back to sleep well and felt terrible all that  day with headache, nausea, and foggy thinking, not funcional after about 2:30 p.m.  Took Ibuprofen at 3 p.m., called doctor and went to ER at Medical Center.  Was seen at ER a few hours later.  Slept some in waiting room. Had sore throat, the worst splitting migraine type headache ever, and was extremely foggy headed, couldn&#39;t process thoughts, eyes had difficulty focusing, nausea.  My temperature was a little high for me, I am normally low and it was 99.  My blood pressure is usually low and it was 105/59, pulse was 82 and respiration was 16 with 96 % Oxygen Saturation. They did tests and had an ophthalmoligist give me an exam also.  They said I could go home with the same meds they were giving me in the hospital since they were working to alleviate my painful headache, 600 mg of ibuprofen, reglan and benadryl.  Before I left they gave me the potassium chloride. I am continuing my medications today, two days after my vaccine.

He stated his mom (patient) in the hospital due to pulmonary embolism from 24Feb2021, 2.5 weeks after her second shot. He stated his anxiety levels were higher than normal. He had strong response to flu vaccine this year and experienced chill, shakes, fever, received antibiotic, and loss sense of taste from the flu vaccine. Reporter read online that some people commented that they have DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) and blood clots from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient experienced blood clots in the lung in Feb2021 and hospitalized on 24Feb2021. Patient got her second shot about 2 weeks before and she ended up in the hospital with pulmonary embolism. They looked at her lungs and found all the blood clots. Patient had really bad shortness of breath, headache, her jaw hurt, and her shin hurt. She was helping out at vaccine clinic and she was out of breath, she said the old people in strollers were passing her. Patient began to make complaints about how she was feeling in mid of Feb2021. Patient said in rare cases 2 weeks after the second dose reactions could happen. Patient got done working in ICU, and helped with PPE, then at 11 she left work at the hospital, she was experiencing heart burn for 3 days and so she thought had a heart attack drove to an ER (emergency room) on the way home, and then was admitted to the hospital on that same day 24Feb2021, she was supposed to be discharged today (26Feb2021). Patient had been feeling out of breath for past 2 month, it was possible it might seem like it was related to the vaccine but it could also not be related. Reporter stated that on the internet he saw how a 1000 deaths happened after the vaccine, it was all old people, but in the autopsies there was no link to the vaccine, they were going to die regardless. Lab data included: She did get a test before for Factor 5 Leiden but it was negative. They did test for COVID, it was negative, while in the hospital. In the hospital they were also testing her again for the Factor 5 Leiden, the results hadn&#39;t come back yet.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Mar2021 16:32 (Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies to Sulfa drugs, Penicillin, and believes she has allergies to Ploymers (She cannot wear polyester and she has to wear 100% cotton). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient (at the age of 62-year-old) previously received the second dose of Shingles Vaccine in Jan2021 for immunization. The patient experienced really bad headache, excruciating headache on 09Mar2021 21:00, nauseous, nausea/queasy on 09Mar2021, she had soreness in the arm on 05Mar2021, blurred vision on 09Mar2021, holes in her vision on 09Mar2021, not right on 09Mar2021, like an allergic reaction on 09Mar2021. She developed a &#34;really bad headache&#34; around 9pm on Tuesday 09Mar2021, that caused holes in her vision and pain &#34;straight across my forehead&#34;. She did treat with Tylenol and was able to finally sleep around 5am. She states that the headache has persisted, and she&#39;s felt &#34;nauseous, queasy, and not right&#34; since the headache started.  She is hesitant to get the second dose. She was experiencing headache following. She mentioned she is allergic to sulfa drugs, penicillin, and polymers, and thought maybe the headache was a result of an allergy to the vaccine? Ingredients don&#39;t appear to have any of her reported allergens. She had soreness in the arm the first 48 hours, which was to be expected and no big deal for her. However, starting on Tuesday, she had an excruciating headache. She normally does not typically get headaches. She believes in vaccinations and as a teacher the minute she could sign up to get one she did. Now she is terrified to get the second one. When this excruciating headache began she woke her husband up to tell what happened. She thought she was going to die, that is how bad it was and she wanted him to be aware and prepared if anything should happen. The excruciating headache started at 9PM. It was excruciating all night. The headache made her queasy because she hurt so bad. It continued into Wednesday. Today and today the pain is duller in her head, much duller than it was. However, she still feels queasy/nauseous. The headache also started with blurred vision. The blurred vision has gone away. It was like there were holes in the TV. She was thinking  it was interesting and did not think much of it at first. She thought one of her contacts had a hole in it, but she did not even have any on. The blurred vision lasted 24 hours. The soreness in arm lasted until Sunday or Monday. She confirmed the pain in arm is gone and was gone by Monday. She initially could not wait to get her shot. Now she is terrified to get the second one. She took Tylenol in the middle of the night on Tuesday and Wednesday for the headache. Has allergies to Sulfa drugs, Penicillin, and believes she has allergies to Ploymers. She cannot wear polyester. She has to wear 100% cotton. She is questioning if the vaccine has polymers in it. From what she heard it does and is wondering if this caused her to have like an allergic reaction. The outcome of the event vaccination site pain was recovered in Mar2021, the events Nauseous and headache was not recovered, other events was unknown.

When she got to the ER- they had to use the old blood pressure cuff to get her blood pressure because it wasn&#39;t coming up on the machine- the kind where you pump it up and watch the needle, they said it was 58/38. patient states that they asked her about the rash that was all over her body in 2021; caller reports that she did not have a rash when she called at 4 PM. patient describes the rash as an extremely red sunburn rash- like you got really bad sunburn, most of it was on her torso, she also had it on legs on 13Mar2021. patient mentioned she remembers them taking off sock and her toes were purple on 13Mar2021. She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021. Discharge paper reads as anaphylaxis due to vaccination on 13Mar2021. patient states that she came home from hospital on Monday, 15Mar2021. patient reports she started a diet. 2nd day (12Mar2021)- From the time she got up, she was too cold to do anything; she couldn&#39;t walk and she was feeling like she was getting the flu. Saturday (13Mar2021)- She woke up and had the worst Charlie horse between ankle and calf- took forever to walk Charlie horse off. Really sharp Charlie horse. Even had less energy today. Really nauseated. patient reports that yesterday and today, she is just tired. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her body catching up on sleep or she&#39;s just tired; she will find out today when she goes to doctor. Caller mentions that she is normally more active than she feels right now. patient reports her eyes have been itchy and she has a rash on her eyelids. patient doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the shot; patient mentions that she decided on 01Mar2021 she would start a diet, get healthy, and see a nutritionist. patient reports that initially she didn&#39;t think her symptoms were from the vaccine and thought it was that she wasn&#39;t eating enough food on Friday. She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

                                                I got the vaccine at 9am. At 4pm that same day I experienced terrible pain to left arm. No redness or swelling at the site. I couldnt lie on my left arm at all that night.  By 11pm I also experienced headache, sinus drainage, sore throat, body aches, taste and smell were off, upset stomach, queezy stomach but no nausea or vomiting, very weak , dry mouth, fever at 99.2 then 98.6, chills, lots of chills. The covid hotline at my work told me I had a moderate reaction to the vaccine. Treatment was rest and tylenol which didn&#39;t alleviate any symptoms whatsoever. I had all these symptoms til Jan 6th at 4am.   At 4am all the symptoms left and have not returned.

This 64-year-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscular on 18Dec2020 at single dose on left upper arm (lot: EKS730), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 14:30 at single dose (lot: EL1284 or EKI284) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient did not have anything with the first shot except a sore left arm on 18Dec2020. She stated that if she lays on left side it is sore. The patient had the sore left arm both times that she got the vaccine. She got second dose of vaccine on 05Jan2021 at 2:30pm and had a blasting headache and just had chills that went away about hour ago on 05Jan2021. She did not have a fever but her skin felt hot on 05Jan2021. She stated that she had dry heaves on 05Jan2021. The patient started that she had a blasting headache within a few hours of the vaccine and it gradually got worst by the time she went to bed. Stated that the chills and dry heaves started then and throughout the night. The chills stopped an hour before she got up. Stated that she went to check her temperature and did not have a fever despite having chills and her skin feeling hot. Stated that nausea started about 10 at night on 05Jan2021. Seriousness for blasting headache, chills and dry heaves was disabling, for nausea was medically significant, for other events was non-serious. The patient took Ibuprofen for the headache. Stated that she was going to try to drink something. The outcome of sore left arm was not recovered; of chills was recovered on 06Jan2021. The outcome of other events was recovering. The causality for blasting headache, chills, dry heaves, nausea and skin felt hot was related (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Agency Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the headache, chills, dry heaves and other reported events due to temporal relationship.

                                                Has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands; She still has a cough and no taste; She still has a cough and no taste; The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot; Body aches; Chills; Nausea; Tired; Diarrhea; Had a fever reached 100.0; Joint hurt, all of them; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020 (8 weeks ago). Concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the vaccine, she got sick as a dog and couldn&#39;t work. She had a fever that reached 100.0, she had body aches. It was explained that she has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands. The caller continues that her joint hurt, all of them, but it was throbbing the most where she has visual arthritis. To sum it up, she had chills, nausea, and body aches the first day. The caller took Tylenol regardless of what the paper said; this was on Friday, 08Jan2021. She kept taking the Tylenol. The next day, she was still tired but when she quit taking the Tylenol on the 2nd day the symptoms returned. It was clarified that she took it in the beginning of the second day twice but at the end of the day wanted to see if she was over it all so she stopped the Tylenol. The symptoms all returned so she took again at bed time, the Tylenol, this was Saturday. On Sunday, she had diarrhea but only a couple times and though it was weird, after that is was over. That day she took Tylenol once. She was calling because she was scared about the second dose, this one produced a big immune response and she says that usually happens with the second dose. The caller wants to know if she should take the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to have this happen again or it be worse. She thought since she had already had COVID it wouldn&#39;t be as bad, her immune response. The first dose was given on 07Jan2021. It was explained the only thing unresolved was from when she had COVID, she still has a cough and no taste. There are just few thing she can taste and smell now. The patient said that all the symptoms had resolved as of Monday, the 11Jan2021. Actually, she felt pretty good on the 10Jan2021 so let&#39;s say Sunday. She explained that most people get this on the second dose and so if she going have a third response she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She was calling to get an answer to her question, the doctor told her to call to see what could be recommended. She has really good doctors, three of them. The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot. The patient said she really needs to go. No need to continue when there is no one to tell her if she should take the second shot or not. The patient asked to be contacted via email to relay information about people&#39;s immune response to the first dose verses the second dose, is it greater or less. Clinical outcome of the events recovered on 11Jan2021.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 07Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital, not a Military Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient got the Flu Vaccine last part of Sep2020 or Beginning of Oct2020. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EK57530), via an unspecified route of administration at left Upper arm on 17Dec2020 9:10AM for covid-19 immunization. She only had a sore arm. It started the same day, a couple of hours after getting the vaccine. It went away a day to a day and a half after it started. After that she was fine. She got the second dose on 07Jan2021. After the second dose, immediately, like within five minutes her arm became very sore, this event was assessed as non-serious by HCP. Also, that Thursday (07Jan2021) night after getting the second dose of the Vaccine around 9PM-10PM she started to get chills, myalgia, severe headache, and nausea. She also mentioned she was so sick during the night she was not able to get up and around. She felt like she had a temperature and by the time it was checked her temperature was 101.9. She was febrile all through 08Jan2021. She started to become afebrile 09Jan2021 with improvement and by 10Jan2021 all her symptoms had gone away and completely resolved. Seriousness Criteria: Stated she felt these are serious. She was unable to go to work on Friday. She could not return back to work until Monday. The HCP assessed all events were related to the vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021. She stated, even though she got so sick with getting the vaccine she was just continuously telling her self this is better than having COVID. She stated she even told people even if she knew after getting the shot she would have this reaction she would still take it. She has seen death occur from COVID and does not want that to happen.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, clinical course and known safety profile of the product, the reported events chills, myalgia, severe headache, nausea and fever were likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

Could not report symptoms but if had been asked directly could have. REalised half way driving home that I should not be driving. Eurphoria lasted for 24 hours. Was on phone constantly the next day for 7 hours straight without eating.  Could not remember what some items were like a drone. Had to ask = that thing that flies with a camera. Short term memory loss that continues. Facial numbness began 48 hours after injection. Facial numbness continues changing in areas of right side of my face. Felt extremely vulnerable. Wore my same clothing for 4 days as I did not remember that I had clean clothing. Did not remember that I should notify medical personal until late 2/20.

A 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3284, NDC number and expiration date were unknown), intramuscularly in the left arm on 25Jan2021 at 12:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination facility type was reported as the nursing home. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL0140, expiry date was unknown), on 04Jan2021 intramuscularly in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included problems in blood pressure and sleep and restless leg syndrome; pain in legs; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, gabapentin for restless leg syndrome; pain in legs, venlafaxine for antidepressant therapy, bupropion (also reported as the generic for Wellbutrin) for antidepressant therapy, and chlordiazepoxide to help sleep; all medications were ongoing. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient worked at a nursing facility, but she was not a healthcare professional. After receiving the first vaccine, she felt great. The vaccine built her immunity up, which was good. With the second vaccine, she got very ill over it on an unspecified date. The patient was asking if there had been other people reporting side effects of the vaccine. The patient further reported that after she was given the second vaccine, they had a waiting time where she had to sit and wait about 15 minutes and it was fine. After work on an unspecified date, she had gone to pick up some groceries and it hit her like a ton of bricks. It was really, really bad. When she was given the vaccine, she asked the pharmacist from the time she was given the vaccine, if there would be any special time she would have symptoms or experience what would be going on. The pharmacist told her everyone was different, but that she would definitely know. The patient stated she had very bad stomach issues; it felt like someone was stabbing her on an unspecified date. She had no vomiting or diarrhea, but when she ate, it was horrible. She couldn&#39;t eat; every time food reached her stomach, it was a horrible pain. She also experienced some fatigue on an unspecified date. She got tired a lot. She had to call her employer and tell them that she wouldn&#39;t be coming in. This went on for a week. She still had some side effects, but its working its way out of her and she could tell. The patient stated she didn&#39;t believe her employer believed her. She had called and left messages and it went no where. She was afraid and she didn&#39;t want to lose her job. The patient stated that she really hadn&#39;t eaten for a couple of days at the time of the report. She asked one of the nurses where she worked if she should be drinking water and continue to try and eat and the nurse told her to drink as much water as she could and rest her body. The patient didn&#39;t believe her employer believed that this was actually happening to her. The patient was very upset that she could lose her job and she didn&#39;t know what to do or who else to call. The patient explained that mentally, she was feeling better, but her body hadn&#39;t caught up with her mind. The patient stated she needed any information to show that she spoke with Pfizer that she could give her employer. The adverse events (AEs) did not require any visit to an emergency room or the physician office. The patient had no investigation assessment and relevant tests. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm (at the age of 64 years) on 24Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes (borderline about 15 years ago/started taking a medication a year ago for her high sugar numbers/had some blood tests, her A1C was normal, her diabetes was the same way it always has been); hypertension from 2012 (diagnosed about 9 years ago); sleep apnea from 2020 (uses a C-PAP machine/diagnosed approximately a year ago); Epstein Barr from 1995 (diagnosed when she was 39); high cholesterol (sometimes she didn&#39;t take her medication for that); cataract and cataract surgery in Jan2021 (had this last month/they used anesthesia/didn&#39;t know which type/had some eye drops for this). Concomitant medication included an unspecified high blood pressure medication (she thinks she tried a few times). The patient called about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and she had questions and side effects. She did get one shot, and was not due for her second for a couple weeks. The patient felt sick since she got it, some side effects have been less, some stayed the same or got worse. Her skin was burning up, her arms, her face, her stomach, her back, and her chest were burning up. She has done no treatment, because she didn&#39;t know what to do to treat it and it was difficult to be able to get in to see a doctor. The burning skin has probably gotten worse. She also had nausea and no appetite, though she has gotten a little better, it has been at least a full week or so. She had a headache and a bad sore throat also. She got home from getting the shot, probably maybe 5 or 6 hours after getting the shot. The patient&#39;s weight was 145-150lbs. The outcome of the event skin burning sensation was not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

                                                I had severe COVID and was hospitalized on Dec 7,  I was in hospital (non ICU setting) for 5 days and had O2, remdisiver and dethemethzone IV.  I recovered fully, and have felt very good since mid January.  My reaction after my 1st dose of vaccine on Feb 25  started 20 hours after shot.  Worsened through the day and I got sicker at 24-36 hours, and then stayed in bed another day.  Symptoms were identical to my bout with COVID:  chills (no fever),  nausea, aches in joints and muscles, fatigue.  They were quite significant==I could not be out of bed.  As it went along I also developed the feeling in my chest like COVID--tough to take deep breath, chest hurt---but my O2 readings were fine.   Recovered after 48 hours, People who have had COVID should be aware that they will have a significant response to the vaccine on the 1st does.  I am questioning having a second dose I have not reported this to my doctor

She says she took one dose of the cough medicine yesterday morning, and she has taken 3 doses of Imodium today. She wondered if she should take the second shot or if she would get the same symptoms again. She says she is hesitant to take second one because she doesn&#39;t want respiratory distress again (Mar2021), it was horrible, and she has never had massive diarrhea before to where she couldn&#39;t get to the bathroom, it was the worst thing she has went through. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The contributory role of the suspect productbnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6198; expiration date: unknown), to reported events is possible.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6206), via intramuscular route of administration, in the right arm on 05Mar2021 09:30 (at the age of 64-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing rheumatoid arthritis, anaemia, cardiac disorder, rash (She has had a reaction to IVP dye. She has to pre-medicate with benadryl and a steroid 10 hours before, then 8 hours before, then 1 hour before procedure prior to receiving IVP dye. When querying NDC/Lot/Expiry for IVP dye, caller states she does not have that information, it happened years ago. She always pre-medicates when she has to have have x-rays with the dye). The patient did not have history of all previous immunization with the BNT162B2 vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). Concomitant medications included tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ XR) via oral route of administration from an unspecified date (been on for 2 years) and ongoing at a dose of 11 mg daily for rheumatoid arthritis; ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) for an unspecified indication; tramadol (TRAMADOL) via unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at a dose of 50 mg daily (in morning) for rheumatoid arthritis; gabapentin (NEURONTIN) via unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at a dose of 300 mg twice daily for rheumatoid arthritis and Multivitamin for an unspecified indication. The patient previously took buprenex and experienced drug hypersensitivity, buprenex and experienced nausea and vomiting, avelox and experienced angioedema. The patient did not underwent any Lab tests.The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than BNT162B2 Vaccine prior to the event being reported.The patient did not received any other vaccines around the time of BNT162B2 vaccination. She was calling about the Covid vaccine. She had her first dose this past Friday, clarified 05Mar2021. It&#39;s been a week. On the evening about 8 hours after the Covid 19 injection she got a rash on her shoulder that she had the shot in. The rash went across her chest to the other shoulder. On her neck she had hives up to her face and down her chest a little bit. She has been taking Benadryl for the past 6 days. She is very concerned what is going to happen with the next dose. She contacted her primary health care provider and it was recommended that the caller pre-medicate. The caller states it says not to pre-medicate. She has her next Covid 19 vaccine in 2 weeks and she was nervous. She did file a report with the government. It was in the information she received from the hospital where she got her Covid 19 injection. Every day at 2:00PM she gets a text message. They monitor her for up to a year. Every day she checks in and says how she feels, is she having trouble completing daily activities, did you have to call your doctor. They gave her a paper at the hospital where she had it done. When querying if this government program had given her a report number she states she doesn&#39;t have a report number, she deletes the text messages every day. She is due for the second Covid vaccine on 26Mar2021. It was reported that several hours after the injection in the evening, maybe 8 hours after she had the injection is when her symptoms began. She does feel like she is improving. Today was the first morning that she didn&#39;t take the Benadryl. She had no respiratory problems. But she was very concerned because the hives were pretty prevalent. It was very uncomfortable. She was taking 50mg of Benadryl for 5 days. When she went to the pharmacy to pick up a cream too, the pharmacist thought that a steroid would be good. She was concerned. She emailed her primary care doctor with pictures. When querying seriousness of events, caller states it was bad enough that she went to the pharmacy and called her primary care doctor and sent her pictures. If she had developed any respiratory issues she would have gone to the emergency room. If she was non medical she would have gone to the emergency room but because she&#39;s a nurse she thought she would ride it out. When querying information for the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine data capture aid, the caller reports the hives were 48 hours later. She also reports urticaria, her head and ears were itchy. She is using steroid cream on it. It is driving her crazy today. Still going to be using the cream. A little bit of erythema, worst part was her neck. When querying red and itchy eyes, she reports only the eyelid. When querying gastrointestinal issues, she reports she has diarrhea, but she has gastrointestinal issues. The diarrhea is nothing worse than what she normally has. She doesn&#39;t think this has anything to do with the vaccine. The patient did not visited to emergency room and physician office. The patient was not hospitalized or admitted to an intensive care unit. Therapeutic measure were taken with Benadryl 25-50mg (Lot Number:P134952, Expiration date: Sep2021) and Hydrocortisone cream 1% maximum strength for the events. It was reported that Benadryl makes her hyper and her heart racey.The outcome of the event diarrhea, gastrointestinal issues were repoorted as unknown, event head and ears were itchy was not recovered and recovering for other events. The events rash on shoulder that she had injection in, hives on neck, rash on neck up to her face were assessed as serious (medically Significant) by the reporter. The causality of the events rash on shoulder that she had injection, hives on neck, rash on neck up to her face were reported as related to vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6208), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 10:30 (at the age of 64 years old), single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing thyroid (disorder) (Unspecified thyroid condition). It is the vaccines with aluminum and bovine extract that she knows that she can&#39;t handle. Caller reported that she got a flu vaccine at work and that she definitely got the flu within a few minutes of receiving the flu vaccine.  Caller reported that another time after receiving the flu vaccine, she definitely got the flu but she was unsure of the time frame.  Caller reported that she did have the flu vaccine several times but that two times, the flu vaccine definitely gave her the flu.  She has 3 brothers and that one of her brothers that she is a  caregiver for has Type 1 Diabetes. Her brother just felt like he had to have 2 vaccines several years ago and that he received the pneumonia and flu vaccines. Her brother was hospitalized within days of receiving the flu and pneumonia vaccines.  Her brother was placed in the ICU for heart patients and the medical staff at the hospital was not sure if her brother was going to live. She couldn&#39;t remember how long her brother was hospitalized for, caller stated she thinks maybe around 10 days.She knows what she knows, her 2 other brothers were also hospitalized as children. She didn&#39;t know if her brothers had vaccines  before they were hospitalized but that she would bet money that vaccines they had received are what resulted in hospitalization.When hospitalized, her second brother was not expected to live. At the time of the event, her brother was only 1 or 2 years old. Her brother&#39;s infection was so bad that the hospital sent blood to the CDC and that the CDC couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong with her brother.The hospital kept giving IV antibiotics to her brother and he lived. Her third brother hospitalized around 5 years old with pneumonia during the summer. She didn&#39;t know if her brother had received any vaccinations at that time. She just thinks the vaccines did that to them but she doesn&#39;t know that.  Someone gave her first brother the information on the pneumonia and flu vaccines he received prior to his hospitalization. She didn&#39;t have information regarding the details of the vaccines that her brother received.The facility where her first brother was vaccinated with flu and pneumonia vaccines would not give her the information on the vaccines that her brother received.  Caller reported that it was a really hard time to fight the facility for that information and she was shocked the facility wouldn&#39;t give her the requested information.  Caller reported that they wouldn&#39;t give her any medication records or anything.  Caller reported that it was a bad time for her to fight it, and that she will eventually go back and tell them they have to give her the information.Her brother that she is a caregiver for and that was hospitalized after receiving the flu and pneumonia vaccines also had the Covid-19 vaccine on 16Mar2021.  Caller reported that she had been more concerned about her brother having a reaction as he has serious health issues, including Type 1 Diabetes and a heart condition.

Yesterday, 30Mar2021, her lymph nodes were hurting a lot, at least she thinks it was her lymph nodes. All of her organs that have been affected by  the Covid-19 vaccine and that it seems like it moves day to day. She is mostly sensitive to UV light  but is also sensitive to artificial light. She thinks that the hypersensitivity to light has improved a little  bit but it&#39;s still a problem. The hypersensitivity to light was the absolute worst on 20Mar2021. She doesn&#39;t know how much she is still dizzy when asked if it was still ongoing. She added she has been taking Benadryl and ginger for the dizziness and nausea and it helps a lot.She has been taking ginger for the nausea, and if she still has a little, it&#39;s not as much.Today is an overcast day and that it&#39;s an easy day for her.  Caller reported that  bright, sunny days are the worst.She was unsure of when the vision loss occurred but stated that she knew by 20Mar2021 that she had lost vision. She didn&#39;t know if she was continuing to lose vision but she can tell she lost vision. She did have a headache in the evening on 16Mar2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. She thinks the headache occurred in the evening on 16Mar2021.She may have had some headaches between 16Mar2021 and 20Mar2021, but that the headache she had on 20Mar2021 was a horrible headache.She is still getting headaches.  She would say the headaches are a little better but she is still having them.She is having headaches that she doesn&#39;t think she would normally have.  She wasn&#39;t having headaches before receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.She thinks she did have headaches between 16Mar2021 and 20Mar2021, but 20Mar2021 is when the headaches really hit her.The chest pain is intermittent and that the chest pain coincides with when the light is affecting her.  When it&#39;s UV light, more so in the afternoon on sunny days, but technically the artificial light in the evening some days bothers her too.She doesn&#39;t think her lymph nodes were bothering her before 29Mar2021. Her lymph nodes are ok this morning, 31Mar2021.Different organs have hurt at different times. The effect on organs started within minutes of  getting the Covid-19 vaccine.She could feel her eyes and that her eyes felt different within minutes of getting the Covid-19 vaccine.

                                                my auntie, who was trying to be supportive and to get vaccinated just passed away like this is not worse it.   My auntie, passed away the next two days after she got her Pfizer Covid vaccine.   My auntie, who is 65 years old, got her Pfizer vaccine the the morning of April 22 2021. She told us he was completely find on the day of the vaccine. But the next morning around 9 am, she told us she has  severe abdominal pain, has the need to have a bowel movement, but she was defecated. She also told us that she vomit couple times already,  then she has no more energy to talk. She got into the hospital and she was announced right after midnight at 12:04 April 25th.  The reported death reason is due to Bowel Ischemia with Perforation and it has nothing to do with Pfizer vaccine that she got. But I believe it is her post Pfizer covid vaccine reaction that result in Bowel Ischemia with Perforation.  My auntie lived with a very healthy life style. She walked every morning, and has a shorter walk in the evening. She has no blood pressure, no blood sugar, everything is fine with her medical check.  My auntie had a kidney transplant 20&#43; years ago and she is on the track for monthly doctor visit. When she asked her general doctor if she could get the vaccine, her general doctor asked her to consult her kidney doctor. She then went to ask her kidney doctor and her kidney doctor call her general doctor to discuss her health conditions. Both of her doctor decided that she could take the vaccine and one of the doctor registered her for the vaccine on April 15 2021. The she nurse told her to came in for vaccine on Apr 22, and she is now death after the Pfizer vaccine.    I only read about people with recent organ transplant is not recommended to take the Covid vaccine. But there is no information about people that ever had kidney transplant shouldn?t take the vaccine.   My auntie, who was trying to be supportive and to get vaccinated just passed away like this is not worse it without a clear explanation.   I would like you to contact health department to follow up on this case and find out the real root cause. If the vaccine is not recommended for people that ever got kidney transplant, CDC should publish the information so that there won?t be more victims.   Please take necessary action ASAP.     Thank you!

Awoke at 3:40 am and rolled off of arm where injection given and a wave of pain and nausea and malaise overwhelmed me. I passed completely out still lying in bed (so out that I wet myself in bed) and gradually came to, still feeling horrible. Got up, changed clothes, and major chills when I returned to bed. Around 6am I felt nauseous, got up to vomit, but instead passed completely out on the bathroom floor for about 15 minutes.  Remainder of day I felt very stiff, low energy and slightly woozy. By afternoon, energy was returning (I vacuumed the house). Minimal pain in arm this time compared to previous.

Immediately there after, I started vomiting.  These symptoms lasted 4 days extremely fast and hard. Tylenol was take for the headache and helped very little. I slept a lot and I couldn?t eat or drink anything witching vomiting it back up. Even my regular meds with a little water came back up.  The evening of the 4th day, I was able to keep clear broth down and crackers helped with the nausea some.  The following week, I still didn?t feel quite right and kept fighting off sleep. Today is the 10th of February and toe nausea has returned. Getting out of bed, I dry heaved for an hour.  I feel if I eat anything it?s going to come back up.  My theory is that the side effects didn?t go away the week I felt somewhat better and had resurfaced, starting out slowly like before. I called my primary at the VA and we discussed what I was already doing i.e. a bland diet until I feel better.

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

I am not sure it was related to the injection. It resolved on sat Feb 20th 2021.  I still have mild nausea but am on Ozempic which gives me nausea some of the time. I did not feel well but finally fell asleep and slept until AM.

                                                Monday, February 22,  in the evening,  I started feeling lightheaded, then more debilitating dizzy, worsening, nauseas . Went home from work that evening around 9:30 p.m. I Vomited as soon as I got home.  Felt better but still lightheaded, dizzy, not as bad.  No fever. Couldn&#39;t sleep. Tuesday, February 23 felt pretty weak, tired some lingering lightheadedness. Stayed home from work.  Next day, Wednesday, my right arm around the injection site was pretty sore. Hard to sleep  last night. Took Tylenol for arm. Still somewhat sore today,  Thursday.

                                                On February 23 (1 week after 2nd vaccine), I experienced sudden onset of swollen lymph node in left side of neck and sore throat, headache, difficulty swallowing, fatigue, some sinus symptoms and stuffy ears. Today is February 26 and I am still experiencing the same symptoms, somewhat less intense than initially.  I called my primary care doctor&#39;s office and was told by the receptionist that this was a reaction to the vaccine and should subside in a few days and if not to call back.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Six days after receiving my second vaccine at a mass drive-thru site (on 2/25), I experienced plugged ears -- a feeling of congestion, pressure and mild pain. Then three days after that, on 2/28, I became dizzy and nauseous, causing vomiting and a feeling that I may faint. My husband took me to Urgent Care where I was diagnoses with BPPV and prescribed meclizine and ondansetron. I have been doing the Epley maneuver and my condition has improved somewhat, but I still feel fatigued and the pressure in my ears has not subsided. I cannot hear correctly out of my left ear. I am concerned that I now have Meniere&#39;s disease, which can be caused by &#34;abnormal immune response&#34; -- the vaccine? I have an appointment with an ENT specialist on 3/25 and hopefully can get some answers at that time.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I have had so many different symptoms and some have gone away like my fever is gone but I have such a painful headache that I can&#39;t eat, nausea and constant diarrhea, you get the idea. I&#39;m not against the vaccine but I think it would be good if people like me, people that have had my experience know, I hope it&#39;s within the normal range, I still don&#39;t know I would love to talk to somebody and find out if what I am experiencing is in the normal range, but it&#39;s not, people saying they experience so far the kind of the level of being in bed, low energy, unable to eat, fever, headache, stomach upset, I didn&#39;t have a cold, I had respiratory, I had a cough that has cleared up. I was hospitalized yesterday with fluids to become hydrated. It&#39;s important for us, you know, I mean, I leave the work that not good, people need to be prepared, it should be sick time I think it&#39;s important there is a follow up, absolutely. I was very happy I got the vaccine but I am so sick and it&#39;s been a week today so, that&#39;s why I decided to call and I was in the hospital yesterday, getting fluids dehydrated and I was admitted (reason for hospitalization was not clarified). I wasn&#39;t admitted, I was in the hospital for the day on IV fluids, anti-nausea medication, pain medication also, 3 things they gave me in an IV. They sent me home but the diarrhea I have so bad, I&#39;m exhausted, but I have to spent all my time in the toilet, I thought today might be, I might wake up it would be healing today but I&#39;m still pretty sick.&#34; Outcome of fever and cough was recovered, and of remaining events was not recovered. The patient underwent COVID-19 virus test via nasal swab on 03Mar2021 with negative result.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

At ER, a computerized tomogram (CT) of head was done and resulted negative and blood work was normal except for high neutrophils and high sugar due to her drinking ginger ale for the nausea. The ER treated her with a shot of ANTIVERT and ZOFRAN and then lorazepam (ATIVAN). ATIVAN helped her so they sent her home with a prescription for ATIVAN. On 15Mar2021 (on Monday), she was no better. She was still dizzy and nauseous although the nausea was getting better as she could keep food down; she couldn&#39;t get off the couch without getting dizzy; under her eyes are so puffy and she was seeing double this morning when she woke up. The ER told them she had an allergic reaction. She was not sick at all when she got the shots; she was perfect. She used a C-Pap machine for sleep apnea and had oxygen that she used as needed. The patient had recovered from dry heaves on 14Mar2021, from seeing double on 15Mar2021; the patient had not recovered from dizziness and eye are puffy.

April 23 morning, she told us she has  severe abdominal pain, has the need to have a bowel movement, but she was defecated. She also told us that she vomit couple times already,  then she has no more energy to talk. She got into the hospital and she was announced death right after midnight at 12:04 April 25th.  Reason of death given is &#34;septic shock secondary to ischemic bowel &amp; intra-abdominal sepsis&#34;.   But it is the blood clots issue that is causing it.   I was told that after my auntie got into hospital the very next day after Pfizer vaccine, hospital later found out that my auntie has blood blockage issue that is causing blood couldn&#39;t flow to her intestines. The acid in her blood was very high, 6&#43;.  After more than 6 hours without blood to her intestines, her intestines tissues start dying and turned black color. Doctor found out about this at the night of April 23, 2021 nighttime. April 22, 2021 morning is the day my auntie got her Pfizer covid vaccine.  There is a very high chances of the Pfizer vaccine is causing the blood clots that lead to blood blockages.

                                                About 45 minutes after the injection there was a swelling of the back of my tongue and throat.  It was difficult to swallow, but not difficult to breathe.  I took 25 mg of Benadryl and 4 hours later took 50 mg of Benadryl.  The swelling did not diminish, but did not get worse.  When I woke up the next morning, everything was back to normal.

                                                She received her 2nd shot on 2/20/2021.  Within minutes she noticed that she could not see, due to localized swelling around her eyes.  She began to feel itchy and her tongue felt swollen.  She was taken to ED and was given Benadryl and Solu-Medrol, her symptoms continued and she was administered epinephrine about an hour later which immediately cleared up her symptoms.  She has some residual generalized itching and has been taking Benadryl 50 mg every 6 hours until 9:00 p.m. yesterday.  She also takes Zyrtec 10 mg daily starting yesterday.  She denies having any dizziness or lightheadedness, hives urticaria, nasal congestion, weepy eyes, diarrhea or abdominal cramping.  She does endorse nausea and was administered Phenergan in the emergency department.  She also endorses that her eyes felt itchy.  She also endorses that she was able to swallow.   Takes celebrex but paused this prior to the vaccine to prevent possible anti-inflammatory interrupting vaccine efficacy.   Her ED record is available for review.  Exam findings endorse she is tolerating secretions, speaking in full sentences and her tongue was not enlarge. No labs were drawn during her visit.   She denies historical reactions to vaccines. She does get itching with some medications. Historical angioedema/urticaria post pistachio and bran muffin were singular events and have not recurred. She had a normal tryptase in 2014

Day 1: felt slight fever; Day 2: Extreme headache (which I never get) low grade fever; Day 3:Hives and itche sin addition to dry cough; Day 4 - Hives deep red, full torso and back, top of legs and pubic areas. Deep and extreme.Chills Steady, Night Hard vomiting, Hives, Soaking Night sweats (never had before), Temp 101.5.    Day 5 Morning - rapid test negative, fever 99.9.  Started Ibuprofen Day 6 - Hives same - extremely dark and red. itchy. # day swab test was POSITIVE. Put on Prednisone. Day 7 - Fever normal, Hives going down but still ugly.  Not sure whether this was really an adverse event as it was a positive test result AFTER the vaccine.  I am an allergig person whose eosinophils report for duty quickly and obviously too much!   I will assume that they were the result of the virus and NOT the drug as the drug does not have an active virus included.  Your call.

I have had some diarrhea with this.  I started taking  Probiotics  on February 19th which has helped with the diarrhea  but the stomach pain is still very real.  Ibuprofen will help for  about 2 hours but then it comes back.

                                                Before I left the hospital parking lot I could taste the   drug in my moth.  By the time I got home I had the dry heaves.  I was also alternating hot and cold.   This went from about 7 pm to 8 AM the next day.  That  day I had a head ache which I normally do not have.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number EL9264), via an unspecified route of administration (arm left) on 30Jan2021 14:00 at SINGLE DOSE for to have some protection against COVID, at 66 years old. Medical history included connective tissue disorder and anti-cardiac lipid antibody problem; she is prone to blood clots from 2001. At that time, she was sent to the hospital and no one could figure out what it was. She was seeing the Rheumatologist and another person, and they knew something was going on and was given Prednisone (from 2001) because her tissues in the joints were swelling and she had trouble with speech. Patient also reported this as some weird connective tissue disorders already and some anti-cardiac lipid antibody problem. It was really weird and had not changed a bit since so she was kind of checking to see if anyone has reported anything like this. She reported that with this weird antibody problem, she is more prone to blood clots and has to be careful with medications with her blood she knows that some breast cancer medicines can do that. She stated this immune thing was never diagnosed. She also had migraine with globes of flashes of light, left eye (does not typically get migraines and has only had 1 in her life and she saw globes of lights in both eyes and had to go to the emergency room and was told it was an ocular migraine and this was also only in the left eye. This was long ago) from an unspecified date.  Concomitant medication included low dose steroid (unspecified). The patient previously received flu vaccine on Sep2020 (AE none). No other vaccines were administered on the same day. On 30Jan2021, the patient experienced vessels in hands were really dilated and dark blue 5 hours after vaccination. On 30Jan2021, the patient also experienced IBS stuff and has had diarrhea the last couple of days after getting the COVID vaccine. She took Pepto Bismol to help and had a mild version of the diarrhea that seemed to get worse after the vaccine and still ongoing. On 01Feb2021, the patient experienced migraine with flashes of light in left eye. It was further described as having a weird migraine with flashes of light in the left eye and she got the shot in her left arm and not sure if that makes any difference. She does not typically get migraines and has only had 1 in her life. The migraines started in the morning and lasted about an hour (as reported) and now they are gone and hopes they stay gone (reported as recovering). She wanted to know if she can take TYLENOL or ibuprofen for vaccine. She heard about people getting symptoms after the second dose not the first dose. Events did not require visits to the emergency room or physician office, but stated that if her vision become worse, she would go to the eye infirmary close by. The outcome of the events diarrhea and vessels in hands really dilated and dark blue, gets IBS stuff was not recovered. Outcome of the events migraine with flashes of light in left eye was reported as recovering.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318 (not clarified further)), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and loratadine (CLARITIN), via an unspecified route of administration from 03Feb2021 at an unspecified dose for unspecified indication. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol and Sleep disorder, both from unknown date. Concomitant medication included alprazolam (XANAX), calcium (CALCIUM), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12), Multivitamin, taking a statin to prevent high cholesterol and L-methylfolate, stated it is like a folic acid drug. Because the patient really can&#39;t take anti-depressant she reacted to them all (Unspecified Medications), so that worked for her and helped her to keep up her spirit. The patient reported her side effects. She didn&#39;t want to interfere with anything but she was having lots of Gastrointestinal issues which were inconvenient. She was up in the middle of the night, happened not within 48 hour after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine but around 60 hours after the vaccine, early this morning (06Feb2021) like around 2 am. The patient was having a reaction after the vaccine but they seemed to be like delayed reactions. Not anything with breathing, she had gastrointestinal stuff going on. The patient had chills, no fever, body aches and she was really going to the bathroom nonstop in the night. It seemed to have been like 2 days after she got the shot like they were worst yesterday (05Feb2021). And she experienced achy, chills, nausea, diarrhea and sore arm in Feb2021. She would like to take TYLENOL and IMODIUM and she didn&#39;t know what she could take because she didn&#39;t want anything to interfere with that as she had been reading a lot. The patient wanted information on IMODIUM to prevent diarrhea, TYLENOL for body aches, chills (no fever), and FLONASE for sinus. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The patient actually didn&#39;t even take, that morning that day when she was getting the shot, she called the pharmacist to see if she could spray her nose with the FLONASE for sinus and he told her that he didn&#39;t think it was a good idea and that maybe she should just take CLARITIN, so she did. But she took CLARITIN that morning (03Feb2021) and she was hoping that didn&#39;t interfere. She was just nervous about it as she didn&#39;t want that to interfere with the work that it was. The patient was still suffering, less, like she didn&#39;t have the diarrhea anymore. She still had a little achy. She did get the sore arm but only for one day, so it wasn&#39;t so bad. The action taken in response to the events for loratadine was unknown. The outcome of event diarrhea and got the sore arm was recovered on an unspecified date in Feb2021, of event achy was recovering, of other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The urticaria improved the following day, as did the fevers. Then 3/5, the fevers started again, several times per day, as high as 102 at home.  In association with the fever she has had some mild nausea, x1 non-bloody emesis last night, as well as rigors/night sweats.  She went to urgent care and eventually was admitted to the hospital for the following 9 days. During this admission, she continued to have fevers intermittently as high as ~103. She also developed more generalized urticarial rash (worst on trunk), and lab abnormalities including low platelets and elevated liver function tests. She had extensive testing, ultimately determined likely vaccine reaction, started on prednisone 40 daily and improved for discharge to home on 3/17 without fevers x48 hours and with improving labs.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the second of two reports.   A 66-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s wife) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL8982), intramuscular on 26Jan2021 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and there were no concomitant medications. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the COVID vaccine. The reporter called for himself and his wife. He reported that they looked at the at the symptoms on the vaccine fact sheet and they did not have any of those symptoms. They received the first dose of the vaccine on 26Jan2021. The first couple of days they had a little bit of a headache starting on 27Jan2021. The third day, 29Jan2021, they started having constipation and bloating which is not normal for them. They are having a lot of gas and are very bloated. The reporter and patient was asking if anyone else has reported this since it is unusual for them. The patient then stated that she had just a very mild headache. She has been able to go to the bathroom a little bit. Usually she is going to the bathroom a lot. The patient stated that the gas and bloating is unreal. All she had last night was chicken broth and a piece of toast for dinner. She took Tylenol for the headache. She is not taking anything for constipation. She is drinking caffeinated coffee which she never drinks or she would be going to the bathroom all day. She just wishes she could fart. The outcome of headache was recovered on 29Jan2021.

                                                I woke up the following morning (March 5) having chills, vomiting, and very very weak-----but no fever.   On Saturday I was better but still weak and that is when cellulitis started in my left leg.  On March 7, 2021, I was seen in the ER.  I was given a shot and antibiotics and told to return if not better.  So on Monday, March 8, I returned to ER and then was admitted to the hospital.  I was allowed to go home on Saturday, March 13.  Since then I had two sores to develop on my left leg.  I had to have wound surgery on them on March 25.  I am a lot better but still not completely well.

A 66-years-old (non-pregnant) female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3302, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy from 2006 and ongoing, since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer in 2006 and burning mouth syndrome. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had other medications in two weeks which included unspecified dietary supplements. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took doxycycline from 2010 to an unknown date for Lyme&#39;s diseaseand experienced burning mouth syndrome. On 11Mar2021 at 02:00 PM, patient had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. These symptoms still continue. Patient stated that people were talking about the second dose being worse. Patient stated that some of the reactions in Mar2021 look like an allergic reaction. They (HCP) only have cautioned the patient about difficulty breathing in Mar2021. They were saying there wasn&#39;t anything they can do for it. Patient asked how long the side effects will last and how to go about changing the appointment. If they are going to continue, patient was very concerned about following up with the second shot and asked if they can have that second shot be postponed until patient was not experiencing these side effects to the effect that she was. She completed the self-reporting on Monday (15Mar2021), but because her side effects were not going away she wanted to reach out to someone. She has reached out to her practitioner and had an appointment yesterday. Doctors didn&#39;t really know because it was all very new. She had the first vaccination shot on 11Mar2021, almost a week ago. In the 15 minutes that she waited afterwards she definitely experienced palpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. She has an underlying condition of burning and pain called neuropathy. She has had neuropathy since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer. This exacerbated that. She had been very concerned about that prior. Everyone said and the CDC recommends even with neuropathy to go ahead with the vaccine. It also triggered another underlying condition. She had a reaction to a course of Doxycycline in 2010 for Lyme&#39;s disease that caused burning mouth syndrome. Both of these things were really acute now, the neuropathy and burning mouth syndrome. Monday (15Mar2021) was a particularly bad day because the symptoms of an allergy which were swelling of the face and throat, fast heart beat, and dizziness were with the burning mouth syndrome. She didn&#39;t have difficulty breathing. It was the nerve endings of the tongue that go all the way to the back of her throat and gave the sensation of the whole mouth being involved. Monday was difficult. It was 8 hours of an acute episode then it eased off a little that evening. She had no appetite on Monday and barely ate anything. Yesterday was ok and much better although she was being triggered by environmental thing such as food and toothpaste. Things she normally uses were setting it off. She had an acute reaction this morning to a protein shake she has had every day for 14 years. The reaction this morning, 17Mar2021, was a drop in blood pressure and palpitations. It passed. She has been documenting this and made her provider aware of what she was experiencing. She was participating in the V-Safe through the CDC that checks up on her everyday and asks about symptoms. She didn&#39;t know if she was supposed to report this to the vaccine adverse event system or not. Obviously, she didn&#39;t want to get COVID. She was struggling with the recommendation to get second shot because she was extremely concerned. She wanted to know how long will the side effects will last and if she can postpone getting the second shot until she gets reasonably well. No practitioner can recommend whether to do it or not to do it. She reported this information online to Pfizer on 15Mar2021. She provided the lot number when she reported it online. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. No treatments received from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The patient recovered with lasting effects from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The outcome of the other reported events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 17Mar2021 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 66 years old) (Lot Number: EN6205, unknown expiration) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing anxiety (40 years or more), ongoing depression (46 years ago, at the age of 20), ongoing acid reflux (maybe 25 years), ongoing GERD (maybe 25 years), ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus (for 12 years), mild to moderate COPD since 2011, gastric bypass (a year and a half ago), and lost 120 pounds. Concomitant medications included bupropion for anxiety depression and omeprazole for acid reflux, both ongoing.  The patient previously received flu and tetanus on unspecified dates for immunization and both experienced hard red welt on arm (welt was hard and lasted for 5-7 days). The patient reported no side effects for 12 hours, but a little soreness at injection site on 17Mar2021 at 20:00 (8:00 PM). Her arm wasn&#39;t heavy, but she had an awareness of the soreness.  She has had life-long anxiety and depression. Several weeks ago (on 26Mar2021), her anxiety reared up, and it could have been due to a family situation. On the 9th day after the first shot, she was having a therapy appointment on the phone and talking about her anxiety, and she got a stiff neck, like an iron claw (26Mar2021 at 10:00 am). It lasted for a couple of 5 minutes and she laid down on the couch then on the floor.  Her therapist said to call 911. Emergency medical technicians came to her house and they said all of her numbers looked good.  She went to the hospital, and was in the emergency room for several hours, but she only remembers one hour of it.  She also had diarrhea and nausea on 26Mar2021 at 11:30, and it felt like Dumping Syndrome, that one can have from a gastric bypass. She was only aware for one hour at that point and blacked out (on 26Mar2021). With regards to nausea, she mostly saw bile in the bag, all she had that day was a protein drink. She was back home and the next day, she did not remember how she got home. She hasn&#39;t had blackouts anymore but feels it may be from heightened anxiety.  On 27Mar2021 at 09:00, she had no appetite, lost 6 pounds in a week, and was tired. She had headache lasted for days and days on 29Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. She is slowly improving but she still doesn&#39;t sleep through the night on 29Mar2021 at 16:00. It was like a feeling like she was resetting her surgery, like she didn&#39;t care about eating.  The also experienced back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica on 31Mar2021 at 16:00 and was constipated. She is using a stool softener and is back in her routine. She called her primary doctor and could not tell her what happened, and she went in a loop trying to get information and authorizations for her to make a determination of what had happened.  Her doctor felt like she should have an MRI. Her heart and all of her numbers looked good, as the emergency medical technicians said. Her primary doctor recommended her to get the second shot.  She had cancelled the second shot for this week, and she has rescheduled it for another date.  She was afraid that she will black out again, after the next vaccine, and is not sure if that is how her anxiety manifested. The main reasons she is calling is that she had no concerns of side effects prior to the vaccine, and a couple of her neighbors said they had read about side effects of the vaccine, but she was not worried.  When the patient started to read about side effects of the vaccine, she understood that on the 10th day, the vaccine starts to be in a person&#39;s system and that maybe is why she didn&#39;t have initial side effects, but then she had side effects several days later because the vaccine was in her body.  By day 10, the vaccine is in effect in the body and she is nervous. Her second vaccine is scheduled on 26Apr2021. The patient would like to know if there is any information on people that have had a gastric bypass. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The events resulted in emergency room visit (except nervous). The patient recovered from soreness at injection site on 18Mar2021; recovered from diarrhea, nausea,  felt like Dumping Syndrome on 26Mar2021; recovered from stiff neck on 26Mar2021 at 10:05am; recovered from constipation on 02Apr2021; and recovered from no appetite and lost 6 pounds on unspecified dates. The patient also recovered from headache with sequelae on unspecified date; and recovered from blacked out on 27Mar2021 with sequelae. The patient had not yet recovered from anxiety reared up; tired; doesn&#39;t sleep through the night; back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Noticed some circumoral cyanosis around my lips after  arriving home. Had a fine afternoon (sleeping following vaccine and 16 hr. shift).  Had dinner and usual evening. Upon going to bed about 11pm,  I experienced chills for several hours, and shortness of breath. Very weak. Called 911 about 3 am - went to hospital ER - O2 sat. 90% enroute. Vital signs stable in hospital ER. Had neg. CXR, EKG, and labs. Also had slight cough and slight bronchial congestion. Received some IV fluids in ER. Left ER at 7am. Went home and slept all day, slight nausea in am. Awoke at 7pm - had good breakfast for dinner. Fine evening and night. Off the next day from work - usual day. It was like having Covid all over again (positive X2 in April - out of work for 5 weeks).  Although the symptoms began about 12 hrs. following the injection and subsided about 24 hrs. later).   My colleagues (work as a nurse in long term care - rehab) who had Covid in the past have experienced similar symptoms following the vaccine, even though we had Covid back in the spring. Dreading vaccine number 2 on Jan. 19th - hopefully I will be ok.

A 67-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: 3247), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 18Jan2021 10:10, the patient&#39;s arm began to hurt then throb and go numb a bit. On 18Jan2021 10:15, the patient started sweating. She stood up to try and feel better. The patient&#39;s husband called the nurse over and they called the paramedics because they said the patient was cold, clammy, and still sweating. The patient sat down again and they put leads on me to check her heart rate, blood pressure (BP), and oxygen on 18Jan2021. Her heart rate and oxygen were fine but the first BP was 90 over something. A few minutes later, she closed her eyes and could have fallen asleep right there. Her second BP was 70 over 40 something. She opened up her eyes and tried to stand up again. After a few more minutes, her BP came up and was OK. They refused an ambulance and went home. She had diarrhea at home on 18Jan2021. She ate, walked and felt better. She just experienced the normal tired and hurt arm in the afternoon on 18Jan2021. She rested the balance of the day. On Wednesday (20Jan2021), she got a bumpy itchy rash on both legs which is still present but with cream, it was OK. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Outcome of the &#34;the first blood pressure was 90 over something/second blood pressure was 70 over 40 something&#34; was recovered on 18Jan2021 and of the remaining events was recovered on Jan2021.

This 67-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot#: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 09:55 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient got her first injection of the COVID-19 vaccine on 26Jan2021 at 09:55AM in her left arm. Patient said that the diarrhea just started on 26Jan2021, she had tried calling earlier and had to hang up because of it, maybe because she was nervous. Patient said that she tasted the vaccine constantly, she has been experiencing a bad taste in her mouth, she couldn&#39;t stand the taste. Patient couldn&#39;t get rid of the taste. She said beforehand she was scared of anaphylactic shock, but she was having the taste in her mouth and diarrhea. She said she had the taste of the vaccine in her mouth and throat on 26Jan2021. She said that everything that she eats she is trying to get taste out of her throat. Patient has done no treatment yet for the diarrhea or the taste in her mouth. She said that her arm didn&#39;t hurt afterwards and she didn&#39;t feel the shot, and now she can&#39;t touch her arm without it hurting though she has been moving her arm a lot. She said she knew that from the flu shot, but that never hurt her, this thing was sore (sore arm) on 26Jan2021. She said she wasn&#39;t worried about that though, she just wanted to know if the taste would go away, and if it was normal. She said that there was nothing that said anything about diarrhea either, and she was not sick, she didn&#39;t feel sick, there was just the taste. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Did not report on check in yesterday because I didn&#39;t think there was a correlation.   I developed severe persistent heartburn 2.5 weeks after second dose.  I considered this as more coincidence (although I have never had severe heartburn except once related to NSAID use) given the timing (2.5 weeks after vaccine) and that I had not seen this listed as a potential side effect.  It then dawned on me that if no one reported for the same reasons you would never know that there is in fact a correlation so I am deciding to report.   It may be worthless data but it may also be relevant.

I waited 20 minutes and went to the restroom and had diarrhea (very rare for me).  I went to my car and looked in the mirror and my face was bright red and  the whites of my eyes were red and my eyes were glassy.  I went back in to the observation area and was given oral Benadryl. and monitored for 45 minutes.  Right after I took the Benadryl my throat felt itchy (not sore - itchy).  My blood pressure was 157/62 when I first sat down but came down to 130/ 60 by the time I was sent home.  My bp is normally about 106/60.   I was really tired at home for the rest of the day so went to be early.  The next day I felt fine and my arm was only slightly sore.  The doctor at the immunization clinic told me not to get the 2nd shot.  I called my GP,  and he too told me not to get the 2nd COVID shot and wait until more information has come out about adverse reactions to the vaccine.  I did not have any difficulty breathing.  I don &#39;t know if the redness on my face went down my neck to my chest.  I didn&#39;t look.  I did not have a fever.

A 67-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot no: EL1284) at vaccination age of 67-year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose to prevent COVID19 (covid-19 immunisation). Medical history included interstitial lung disease and overactive thyroid (She was treated for overactive thyroid, but it has been stable for five years). Concomitant medication included nitrofurantoin for interstitial lung disease and fluticasone. The patient previously took prednisone [prednisone acetate] (She did ten weeks of Prednisone and has been off Prednisone since the middle of Nov2020. She started at 30mg and tapered down to 20mg then to 10mg and then to 5mg until she was done). The patient experienced feeling lightheaded, mild headache, fatigue, erratic bp 01Feb2021 11:30, feeling nauseous on an unspecified date in 2021. Took Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine last week. Began feeling lightheaded, mild headache, fatigue, erratic BP on Monday, 4 days after receiving the vaccine. Went to Emergency department on Monday evening. Has been continuing off and on since Monday. Can these symptoms occur after 4 days patient questioned. Has already reported to DSU. She got Pfizer&#39;s COVID19 Vaccine a week ago today. She was doing fine and then Monday she started with mild headache, erratic blood pressure readings. She ended up in the ER because it was so high. It stabled out and she went home. She was feeling ok on Tuesday, but not quite normal. She was fine yesterday until last night then it started again with erratic blood pressure, fatigue, mild headache and lightheadedness. The headache is never pounding. The lightheadedness won&#39;t go away. Is that normal to have that many days after receiving the vaccine? It was four days before she started experiencing it. Now she feels kind of normal as long as she is laying down except for headache. As of 15Feb2021, the patient reported that she called a couple weeks ago and reported adverse side effects and she needed a couple questions answered. She mentioned that she was due to have the second vaccine this weeks (18Feb2021). She was extremely worried about doing it because even some of the effects she had after 4 days in the first vaccination have not subsided. She added that it landed her in emergency room a couple of times (also reported as ended up in the ER twice). She inquired if should she take the second one at this point or can she wait and if she can wait for how long. She mentioned that she had a spike in her blood pressure (BP), she had accelerated HR on an unspecified date in 2021, she was very lightheaded to the point she thought she was going to pass out on an unspecified date in 2021. The second time around, her body was trembling on an unspecified date in 2021, she had body shakes. It was not fun. All of these effects have returned to somewhat normalcy, but she is still experiencing lightheadedness. She has seen her own physicians, but she is not sure if she should proceed with the second vaccine. The outcome of the event lightheadedness was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was recovering.  Follow up (15Feb2021): New information received from a contactable consumer (patient) included: lab data, new event (accelerated HR, to the point she thought she was going to pass out, body shakes/trembling) and clinical course of the events.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pretty severe headache; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between generalized aching, severe headache, feel dizzy, going to faint, vision blurred, no energy  been very tired, very cold, her skin was very cold, wheezing and bnt162b2 vaccine cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association. The Company considers the reported event fibromyalgia flare up is unrelated to bnt162b2 vaccine but more likely due to underlying medical history of ongoing fibromyalgia.

So I have been taking Tylenol, Advil (Treatment) finally this morning, yesterday was tiny, tiny bit better, this morning its little bit better but I am still little real nauseous and I feel like I mean like acid coming up constantly making me more nauseous and almost like unable to eat. Ever since Saturday all I will have been doing is three bites of chicken soup three times a day. What in the world is going on with this vaccine that it would cause those severe symptoms and my chest is still tight I still feel low congestion having hard time taking a deep breath in Mar2021&#34;. The outcome of the event &#34;my symptoms were so severe I felt like I was going to die I mean literally die&#34; was recovered on unspecified date. The outcome of the event unable to eat was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.  Information on lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                also had a headache; her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes; her platelet levels dropped; having muscle pain or some kind of pain, maybe joint pain that is in her hips; has had nausea and she has generally felt unwell; muscle pain; she slept for almost two days; felt unwell; diarrhea; abdominal pain; her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes; her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes; tiredness; eyes were yellow when she woke up that morning; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6200), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Mar2021 11:45, single dose as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included lung transplant from May2011, immunodeficiency from May2011 and ongoing, strokes. The patient had dtap vaccine before Jan2021. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); prednisone acetate (PREDNISONE); tacrolimus monohydrate (TACROLIMUS). Patient reported that it has been about a week and a half of maybe more since her first COVID vaccine and she gets new symptoms almost everyday. Most of the symptoms aren&#39;t like put-you-down sick, horrible symptoms, they can be dealt with, but she has had a lot of them. She never got injection site pain and her arm never got sore. She had tiredness on the second day after her COVID vaccine, she slept for almost two days. She has a headache almost constantly. She is having muscle pain or some kind of pain, maybe joint pain that is in her hips. She doesn&#39;t have chills, a fever, injection site swelling or redness. She has had nausea and she has generally felt unwell all the time for a week and a half now. She is immunocompromised because she has had a lung transplant, that is the one thing that probably sets her apart is that she is immunosuppressed. She had the lung transplant almost 10 years ago now and she has been doing well. She is not on blood thinner medicine but she does take a baby aspirin everyday. Those are the only two things that she can think about. She doesn&#39;t know if all of that would make the symptoms from the COVID vaccine different for her. Most people she knows who have received the COVID vaccine have only had a couple days of tiredness and a sore arm. But she has a headache, been achy, and she just doesn&#39;t feel good. She also had a headache then and slept a lot, she was really tired. Later in the report caller clarified the first dose was actually 09Mar2021. She is not tired right now but she does still have a headache today, it is a pretty good headache. Her tiredness was Sunday and Monday of this week, confirmed to be 14Mar2021 and 15Mar2021. She says that she has recovered completely from the tiredness even though she feels like she could nap right now but she can&#39;t since she has a blood draw later. It is like she wakes up and every day she gets new symptoms. She had two symptoms that are not on the sheet of symptoms. The two she experienced are weird. On Saturday, a week and a day after her vaccine, her eyes were yellow when she woke up that morning. Confirmed date to be 13Mar2021. It was only that one day. She thinks that she has recovered completely. Also, her eyes have been really sore, red and she has several broken blood vessels in her eyes. Some of this is normal in the winter for her, but the yellow isn&#39;t normal for her. Normally, when she does get the blood vessels in her eyes they will heal in a day or so but the ones now have lasted much longer. They have been much slower to go away. It is not like there is a red spot, but it looks kind of red and kind of weird. The other symptom that is strange is that her platelet levels dropped. She was at 49 before her COVID vaccine and now her platelet level is down to 29. She does have normally very low levels for platelets but they are usually around 50. They have dropped substantially since her COVID vaccine. They dropped from 50 to 33 and then 5 days later her level went to 29. She is getting another platelet level drawn today, confirmed to be 16Mar2021. Her eyes being sore, red, and having broken blood vessels occurred probably a couple of days after she received the COVID vaccine. Specifically, her left eye felt like it had something in but she doesn&#39;t believe that it did. She used eye drops. Her eye just felt gritty. This is not like she had pink eye and she didn&#39;t wake up with this eye shut. It wasn&#39;t pink eye she knows what that is like. Her eyes had broken blood vessels and then they turned yellow then they turned red and have remained red. They are not sore today and she doesn&#39;t feel like she has gravel in her eye but the whites of her eyes don&#39;t really look clear. She says so far it has improved some but she will see since she wakes up every day and something new has happened, or something different or something has come back again. The good news is that she doesn&#39;t have all of these symptoms at the same time. She can&#39;t the remember the day pain in hips began but it is ongoing. She noticed this morning that the pain in her hip was not as bad when she had gotten out of bed. That pain has lessened there but the pain went to her head. Nausea and generally not feeling well: Probed for when this began and caller says that it has occurred for several days after she eats dinner, her stomach will be growling loud and that comes along with abdominal pain which doesn&#39;t really fit in with muscle or joint pain, she has no muscle there unfortunately she jokingly says. Sometimes this is all accompanied with diarrhea. It is not ongoing as of now, no date provided. She noticed that it comes and goes and sometimes she can eat and she is fine and sometimes she gets really sick feeling. It seems like if she doesn&#39;t eat then she doesn&#39;t get the symptoms but she knows that she needs to eat. Investigations: Her doctor has been having her do platelet blood tests about every 5 days since she took the COVID vaccine. She does not remember the dates of these tests off of the top of her head. She had a blood draw at the clinic the day before her COVID vaccine and her platelet count was 49 on 08Mar2021. For the result of 29 that was either last Thursday or last Friday, 11Mar2021 or 12Mar2021. Te outcome of the event scleral discoloration was recovered on 13Mar2021, tiredness was recovered on 15Mar2021, headache was not recovered, pain in hip was recovering, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021299104 similar report from same reporter

She states that is what makes them wonder if it is from the Covid vaccine. Adds that she is not saying that is what caused all of this, but that it is just a coincidence that it was exactly 2 weeks after the vaccine, exactly 2 weeks out when this happened. She states that she has been thinking if she should be wasting Pfizers time reporting this but it could be a coincidence or maybe a reaction.  Caller adds maybe it is because she had 34 radiations, 8 chemo treatments, 1 year of Herceptine, and breast cancer.

The one in the groin was there for about two weeks. On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 1.5 and was not something that people need to take an Advil or something for.

She states it was like the flu shot. She clarifies that it was not his arm, it was the injection side. She states that these people who are going on and on about their arm hurting, it is the injection site.  She states it is the injection site and will not be the arm.  States that it is like the flu shot.  States she does not want to file a report regarding her husband because it was injection site soreness and went away.  Provides no additional information.

A 67 years old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199) on 10Mar2021 17:30 at age of 67 years old at single dose in right upper arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included: last year February, she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, she has had acid reflux in the past. digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable). There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events (AE) following prior vaccinations. Patient had first Pfizer covid vaccine on 10MAR2021, approximately 10 days to 14 days after the vaccine her face swelled up, numbness and red on left side, went to see my  doctor, he treated her with steroid and antibiotic for sinus infection, at the same time she had some shortness of breath and pounding in my chest, and had and still have ringing in ears since then, it kind of flared up some digestive issues she had last year. If she back up to last year February, she had a bad sinus infection, went to see allergist, family doctor and ENT, all treated her for sinus&#39; before covid testing was even a thing, they didn&#39;t think of covid testing at the time. It ended up in her stomach and esophagus, horrible attacks where she couldn&#39;t breath, they did and endoscopy and put her on amitriptyline 10mg daily, continuing to take this medication for hypersensitivity.  In March2020 her husband came home with covid, after that, talking to his doctor, she brought him meals outside of the door, it occurred to her that queried if this could have been covid. She tested in April last year, it was negative (not detectable), they were still not sure if it could have been covid. She was supposed to get the second vaccine, she postponed it, the numbness and swelling of face is gone, next shot was tomorrow. Since this was a delayed reaction, typically one to three days would be a reaction to the vaccine. she didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine, asked if it could have been from the vaccine. She wanted to make sure that she was safe to get the second one. Response: Spoke from EUA factsheet for Recipients and Caregivers: LAB-1451-4.0 Revised: 06 April 2021: Sections: who should not get the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and what the risks of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE were. Spoke from attached VR Consumer- Pfizer cannot assess causality (i.e., cannot assess if what you described/are experiencing is associated with the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine). Your doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise you as your doctor/healthcare provider is most familiar with your medical condition, clinical history, how your treatment has been conducted and any relevant information to your specific case. Patient calling about the COVID vaccine. She states that she had the first vaccine 10MAR2021, and 10 days afterwards her face swelled up. She had numbness in it and redness. She went to the doctor and the doctor thought that maybe it was a sinus infection. So she was treated for that. She states that she did have a few other symptoms. To make a long story short, she was suppose to have the last vaccine last Friday. She postponed it for a week (postponed getting the second shot for a week). She wants to know what Pfizer thinks about her getting her second vaccine and her side effects. She says that somewhere between the 10th and 14th day, after receiving the vaccine the symptoms started and that was why she did not think she had a reaction to the vaccine. She has not had anything like that before, it was sort of a delayed reaction. She states she is better now. She had a few symptoms after the face things started and the only thing that she still has now is ringing in her ears. She states it all started around the same time as her face issues, or might have started a little after that. She confirms everything but ringing in her ears have completely resolved. She states that she did have some digestive disturbances, shortness of breath, and throbbing in her chest after receiving the vaccine. She asks if she can go back a little bit to explain. She states that last FEB2020 she was really sick with bad sinus infection not knowing about COVID at the time. She went to her allergist, then her family doctor, and then an ENT. She states that it was nothing like she has ever had, it was really bad. Sometime later she got these horrible digestive attacks, she has had acid reflux in the past but it was nothing like this. In March her husband had COVID and tested positive for COVID. She decided to get tested and she tested negative. She wonders if she had COVID earlier but at that time they were not testing for COVID. Her digestive problems stayed with her a really long time, and she was still on the medications her gastrointestinal doctor put her on. They are hypersensitive esophageal medication. She states that she has been exhausted all the time. The rest of the story she has told already. She states that after the face thing happened she started getting those digestive issues again. Her friend suggested that she call Pfizer, so she is doing that. She confirms that the vaccine card does not have an expiration date, NDC, or dosing information. She states it says 0.3 ml, but she cant see a point, so she doesn&#39;t know if its just 03. She states she got the vaccine to lessen her chances of getting a severe disease, in case she ends up in the hospital. Also, to keep herself safe from other people. She states she wants the second one because husbands works with the public and she wants to be protected when he comes home. She states that she has those gastrointestinal disturbances and is on amitriptyline 10 mgs for that. She states she also takes something for her thyroid but she has no major health issues. She states that she had a endoscopy and a colonoscopy as well as blood work done but she doesn&#39;t have any of the results because they are in her Beaumont chart where she actually got the vaccine. All of this was pre-vaccine so she doesn&#39;t know how relevant it is. The patient did not require a visit to Emergency Room, but visit to Physician Office. The only thing similar had a sister who reacted to a shingles vaccine, She has no information about her sisters reaction to the vaccine. Outcome of event ringing in ears was not recovered, for others was recovered.      No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 67-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN6208) intramuscular, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 67-year-old, on 19Mar2021 11:00, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma and Allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number EN6203) single dose, at the age of 67-year-old, on 26Feb2021, for covid-19 immunisation and experienced slight ache in her left arm, headaches, and mitral valve disease.  On 20Mar2021, the patient had headaches off and on and the patient mostly woke up with them. The patient doesn&#39;t know if the headaches were from pollen in the air since it is Spring time or mold. On 24Mar2021 at 4am, the patient got out of bed because she had to use the restroom. As soon as the patient took the first step into the tile floor of the bathroom, the patient collapsed. The patient didn&#39;t fall, the patient collapsed on the file floor. Her head hit the floor. Her head was killing her when she was laying there. The patient used the restroom and went back to bed. The patient got out of bed because her head was killing her. The patient guesses she threw her right arm out to brace herself, because she noticed her right arm was bruised the morning of 24Mar2021 when she went to shower. The patient took Equate 500MG for the events head hit the tile floor of bathroom, headache, and right arm was bruised and used a wash cloth with cold water as a cold compress and applied it by her eyebrow, the corner of her eye was purple/bruised. It looked like she had eyeshadow on. On 24Mar2021, she was feeling nauseated. Thankfully, she had the next 2 days off  (Thursday and Friday) because she didn&#39;t feel so hot. On 26Mar2021, the patient called her PCP and was asked if she wanted to come in/ make an appointment. Since, the caller was planning to meet with the surgeon about her upcoming surgery on 29Mar2021, it didn&#39;t really fit into her schedule. She was undergoing all these tests, etc. It was determined her surgery was going to happen after receiving the second vaccine. The surgery is hopefully a mitral valve repair. The patient mentioned that her provider is aware of her experience with the COVID vaccine. The patient saw the surgeon on 29Mar2021, and she told him all about her experience. He advised the patient to call her PCP and schedule an appointment with them. She saw her PCP on 01Apr2021. She told her PCP what happened and her PCP asked why she didn&#39;t go to urgent care. The patient doesn&#39;t really know why she didn&#39;t, she just thought she was going to feel better. The patient thought she would work through the pain since Mar2021. Plus, she had everything going on with her surgery- like finding out she had to have the surgery and going under other tests. Her PCP wanted her to go to radiology to have a MRI of the head/brain done. She had the MRI done at 3:00PM on 06Apr2021 and the results were negative. Up until last weekend, she still felt &#34;headachy&#34;. The patient has headaches too because of stress knowing her surgery was scheduled in a matter of 2 weeks, so she didn&#39;t know if the headaches she was experiencing was because of the COVID vaccine, stress, allergies, etc. The patient was certain the headache she experienced the day after she collapsed, was due to the collapse. The patient clarified that she knew it was more of a &#34;collapse&#34; instead of a fall because all the furniture leading to the bathroom, like the loveseat, lamp, cedar chest, etc, were all intact with no marks. It was like all of a sudden she collapsed. Her bruising is all gone, but there might be a slight mark that is like yellow and green (because the bruising changes colors) on her arm. Her eye was okay. The patient will have her planned surgery on 15Apr2021. The events required physician office visit. The patient underwent unspecified lab test and procedures relevant to her upcoming surgery but no other testing in regards to her symptoms after the COVID vaccine. Outcome of headache was not recovered, the events corner of her eye was purple/bruised and right arm was bruised recovered in 2021, while it was unknown for the other events.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

Seemed to subside in about 30 minutes.  Took a benedryl at bedtime.  In morning, seemed ok, though took another benedryl.  Seemed OK on this next day, but before bed, face was puffy, then woke up at 3:50 a.m. Saturday, and throat glands swollen and was having difficulty swallowing.

                                                I immediately sat down for 1 hour, felt I had something , like i felt possible slight chest tightness. I say I was fine until 3-4 hours later, I had extreme headaches. At 430pm, I still had the headaches and I took Tylenol 500mg. At night my headache got worse and it felt like I had the flu. I then went to bed and when I woke up my left arm felt intense like hornets and it was swollen. I then took another Tylenol and Ibuprofen 600mg. At 4am, I felt awful and horrible. I had joint pain with aches, felt nauseated. I called my PCP and he told me to take Prednisone 10mg. My fever was 101.4F. By the night my fever was gradually coming down and it was 102F. By the next day I felt much better.  I also had Covid-19 on March 2020 and also got tested for antibody test in July 2020.  I spoke with my PCP and he is recommending I do not take the 2nd dose injection.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 11Jan2021 5:15 PM at a single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing shellfish allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing iodine allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing Mitral valve prolapse (for 20 years), blood pressure high, and cholesterol. The patient had mitral valve prolapse for about 20 years now. They are just watching it now. She just saw the cardiologist, and had an echo done. If the symptoms worsen, they will proceed. Concomitant medications included diltiazem for blood pressure high and atorvastatin for cholesterol, both from an unspecified date and ongoing; she has been on these medications for 30 years now. On 11Jan2021, the patient experienced facial tingling, immediate pain in arm from injection, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all, left eye twitching, chills, nausea, no appetite, whole body ache, tired, whole body trembled, nervous. On 12Jan2021, the patient experienced back pain. The patient explained that on 11Jan2021, evening at 5:15pm, she received her first COVID 19 vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine was being given out at that time. She has shellfish and iodine allergies. So, they made her sit and wait 30 minutes after being injected. One of her daughters took her. On the drive home, a few minutes after leaving she developed facial tingling. At first, she thought nothing of it. She did have immediate pain in her arm from the injection. By the time she got home, she couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all. It was that painful. The next morning, she couldn&#39;t lift arm, and if she tried, she would be in pain. Also, her left eye started twitching right away also. That night she really noticed it. It was not a constant twitching. She thought at first it was because she was tired or from the pain in her body. But then she noticed the next day it was still doing that. It was still twitching. It is not constant, but it was here and there. She still had it on 13Jan2021, but so far nothing at the day of report (14Jan2021). She also had chills. She had on double clothes, and coverings on her feet and hands. The chills wouldn&#39;t go away. Her whole body trembled. On 13Jan2021, Wednesday morning, they went away. She experienced nausea and no appetite. Her whole body ached. It was so brutal. The problem was with her left eye. It didn&#39;t twitch constantly, but it got her nervous. She is pretty sure she is going to refuse the second dose. She has heard that the 2nd part is when most people have the worst side effects. So, she is not comfortable getting it. She also got back pain. It wasn&#39;t severe, but it was there. She is against getting the second shot. She stated that she is a medical assistant at a pediatric office. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got it (vaccine) because of her age. She was advised to get it as she was around patients. Work gave them the option. The inability to move her arm ended in the middle of night at 4 am 14Jan 2021. She noticed she could move her arm. Her second dose is scheduled for 01Feb2021 at 8:45 am. She does work in a pediatric office. If the second part of side effects are worse, then she doesn&#39;t want to take the chance. The eye has her concerned. Outcome of the events were as follows: facial tingling recovered on 11Jan2021, immediate pain in arm from injection recovered on 13Jan2021, chills recovered on 13Jan2021, nausea recovered on 13Jan2021, no appetite recovered on 13Jan2021, whole body ache recovered on 13Jan2021, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all recovered on 14Jan2021, back pain was recovering, while outcome for events left eye twitching, tired, whole body trembled, and nervous, was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient presented to the ED on 1/21/21 for evaluation of SOB stating her husband tested positive for COVID earlier that week and she has been around him. The patient states her symptoms started 3-4 days prior to presentation. She admits to cough, nausea, and an episode of vomiting the day of presentation. She had been intermittently using her husband&#39;s oxygen prior to presentation which she says has helped with her symptoms, but does not use oxygen at baseline. Upon presentation the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation rate on room air is 89%. Patient was placed on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula and then was saturating in the mid 90s. CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates in the ED which the ED physician felt to be consistent with COVID infection. The patient&#39;s rapid COVID test resulted as positive. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management of hypoxia related to COVID infection. The patient remains hospitalized on the day of report submission (1/28/21)

I felt incredibly tired and slept, restlessly, on and off for 24 hours. I was unable to even drink anything for about the first 15 hours. Finally I was able to eat two crackers and tea and take tylenol which took the edge off the headache. All of these sympoms persisted for 36 hours.  It was miserable and I honestly have never felt so sick. That is coming from someone who has been through labor, childbirth, c- sections, and several major surgeries. I don&#39;t think I could do another vaccine without being supervised in a health care facility to help manage the side effects for the first few days. Also, I had a mild case of Covid beginning November 9, 2020 that lasted about 2 weeks.  I was only exposed to one person who had covid that I am aware of. When I was with that person for about 15 minutes, we were masked and 6 feet apart. I do not go anywhere but work and am always masked,  as is everone else I work with and we are always at least 6 feet apart.

Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated, &#34;I got the vaccine yesterday about 3 pm and I came home and I had dinner and sat down to watch TV at 9 O&#39; clock, I turn the program on and I was out like a &#39;light&#39; and this stuff knock me out (onset date: 29Jan2021). My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Pt received her first Pfizer COVID vaccine today at approximately 1305.  She stated approximately 10 minutes into observation she developed abdominal pain and felt like she needed to have a BM.  She sat on the toilet and had an episode of diarrhea and started to feel flushed, diaphoretic and stood up to go to the sink.  She then felt nausea, dizziness and lightheaded and placed her head down leaning over the sink.  EMT arrived to bathroom and sat patient down in a wheelchair.  I arrived on scene shortly thereafter and the patient was pale and diaphoretic stating she did not feel well.  EMS was activated. She was placed on the cardiac monitor and her HR was NSR in the 80&#39;s.  BP 114/61, 96% on RA.   Denied CP, SOB, rash, mouth, lip or tongue swelling. She was brought back to the observation area and was assisted to the gurney.  Cool compresses were placed on her forehead and behind her neck.  Medics arrived to scene to assess the patient.  She stated she was feeling improved and did not want to go to the ED.  She signed the AMA form. She was given water and crackers. She was monitored for 1 hour and stated she felt improved.  She denied dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea or abdominal pain.  I assisted her to the bathroom and she had one more episode of diarrhea.  She stated she felt improved after that. She was monitored for 15 more minutes and stated she would like to go home.  She was able to get up off the gurney without assistance, stated she felt well.  She was ambulatory with a  Steady gait and assisted outside.  Prior to discharge I recommended she follow up with her PCP.  Advised that she rest for the remainder of the day and to activate 911 should she develop any new or worsening symptoms.  Advised that if she does get the second dose of vaccine she should be laying down at the time of administration and for 30 minutes after the injection for observation.

Received the shot around noon on Tuesday , February 23, 2021. Later in the afternoon experienced muscle aches and chills. My head felt kind of weird. Hard to describe except I once had a morphine shot that made me feel close. I spent the next ~60 hours in bed. Fever, severe joint and muscle pain, migraine like headache, and brain fog is about all I remember. It could have been 2 hours or 60  hours, I don&#39;t remember. On Wednesday and Thursday my sedentary heart rate was 101 and 95 according to my Apple watch up from 77 on Tuesday. Couldn?t eat. Food tasted and smelled differently but not in a good way. Woke up this morning,Friday, with a mild headache and very fatigued but mostly back to normal.

Next day same until about 3:30 and I started to get chills, body aches and pains then nausea and headache.  Shivering for 4-5 hours under the covers in bed with extra blankets and clothes.  Can?t say I?m overly concerned as searching online I?ve seen reports of similar reactions but best to report. Today feeling a bit better, not shivering but still achy but not as bad and still a little nauseous.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular injection on 20Jan2021 (at the age of 68-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing breast cancer stage IV, patient was in treatment for breast cancer stage IV, she had cancer 13 years prior the report in 2008, and then was found again and diagnosed 3 years prior the report, in Jun2018; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a long time, a lot of her adult life. The patient was on oxygen; she had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer; patient tested positive for COVID in 2020 (Feb2020 or Mar2020, as reported). She and her roommate tested positive and had a cough. They had no fever or other symptoms. Both in the nursing home got over the cough and 21 days later tested negative. Patient tested negative for COVID ever since. The nursing home tested the residents and staff every week. They had tested the patient so much to the point her nose was bloody which the reporter got upset about; hallucinations and paranoid thoughts. Concomitant medications included ongoing perphenazine (TRILAFON) taken for hallucinations and paranoid thoughts; treatment for breast cancer stage IV and oxygen. The patient lived in nursing facility and had received both Pfizer vaccine doses. The patient received the first vaccine for COVID-19 immunisation in Dec2020. She was fine. She got the second one on 20Jan2021. Since patient received the 2nd vaccine dose, in Jan2021, she was having confusion and dementia, which was not an issue before the vaccine doses. The patient was having trouble putting words together. Patient initially had vomiting, nausea and brain fog where she could not concentrate on her TV, in Jan2021. She was hospitalized from 17Feb2021 to 20Feb2021 to have all kinds of tests run and see if her cancer had spread to her brain. Patient had 3 years with stage 4 breast cancer and had fought so hard and was aware of her confusion and it was very upsetting to her. She had days of vomiting and nausea. She complained of brain fog and could not focus on the tv or her programs. Within days, she went into this kind of like dementia-like state where she talked incessantly and could not get a thought completed. Patient would go from one thought to the next. It was very bizarre. She had never had this kind of issues. This went on for so long, they finally put her in the hospital. Patient had stage 4 breast cancer, and the doctors thought maybe her cancer had gone to her brain. The doctor did not think it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was checked for a urinary tract infection (UTI), for brain cancer, for a stoke, for everything. She saw so many doctors. She still had not come out of this a month later. She was currently on psych meds because she had mood swings, since Jan2021. It had been one thing after another. The patient could not tell the time. On some level, patient knew something was wrong. She was in a very confused state. She did not know how to tell anyone what she wanted to tell. It was very distressing to say the least. She had made a little bit of progress. She could tell time with some struggling but she got upset and cried. Patient could only tell that the time was 3, but not 3:15. But, then she cried and got upset. She had been able to tell time a couple of times, but if you asked her what day was it, she had no clue. She had no clue what day it was and would ask &#34;what day is it?&#34; Her moods all over the place. The patient was still very confused. The reporter explained the patient could be 5&#39;3&#39;&#39;, she was unsure. The reporter really did not know the patient weight, she was guessing around 270lbs. She had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer, and reporter had not seen her since COVID started. Patient told that her weight was up around 300lbs. The reporter declined to include a healthcare professional for the report, stating she had not spoken to her sister&#39;s primary care doctor. She was waiting for her to call back. The patient was sent to the ER and admitted into the hospital on 17Feb2021. She came back from the hospital on 20Feb2021 at 6:30pm. She had a CAT scan, MRI, bloodwork done, in Feb2021. She saw a psychiatrist, neurologist, her oncologist. There was so many doctors seeing her and talking to the reporter. The last doctor the patient saw in the hospital said that she thought the patient was dehydrated from her vomiting episodes, but did not know for sure. In Feb2021, the nursing home did blood tests and a urinalysis to see if she had a UTI. The blood work would have shown if patient was dehydrated and she was not. The head nurse thought it was the vaccine, but she was not sure. Everybody was not sure. No one could tell her anything concrete about patient. She was not normally like this. Patient had recovered completely from the nausea and vomiting. They tried for a while to give her an anti-nausea medicine, but she could not keep anything down. It was given to her orally, she did not know why an injection was not given. This lasted for a few days, clarified as maybe 3 days. The reporter had no name, NDC, lot number or expiry date for the anti-nausea medicine the patient took. She knew it was given to her once and when they tried to give it to her again, patient refused. Reporter had no product information to provide for the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, did not have the patient vaccine record card. This would be with the nursing facility. She mentioned patient went into the nursing home on Jan2018 and then was diagnosed with breast cancer Jun2018. She did not know if there were any interactions there with the patient having the breast cancer and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The reporter had no product information for the first dose. When probed for the date in which the first dose was given, she explained she was sent constant emails which could have provided a date, but she did not know this information offhand. It was approximately a month before the second dose, or it could have been on 27Dec2020, which was a little closer than a month apart. No additional vaccines were administered on the same date of the Pfizer vaccine. The events required a visit to emergency room. Patient had constant testing while in the hospital. In the hospital, in Feb2021, they did MRI and CAT scan to see if the breast cancer had gone to the brain and both were negative. They tested for UTI. They did the first UTI test at nursing home in 2021 and they said she had a UTI and patient was put on an antibiotic. They tested her again for a UTI when she was admitted into the hospital in Feb2021 and they said she did not have a UTI. She did have a buildup of urine in her bladder because her kidney functions were not good enough for the MRI at first, in Feb2021. Her bladder was relieved of the urine build up and her kidney functions improved and she was able to get the MRI. The MRI did not show any cancer in the brain. None of it relieved her symptoms. This was just bizarre. It happened within a week of receiving the vaccine. She could not talk with patient and patient had never been like that. The patient had always been lucid and open and you could talk about anything: the past, the present, she had no problems. She could remember everything crystal clear from the past but she could not remember or know everything from the present. The reporter would ask her what day was it and the patient did not know. The patient would absorb the information she was told but there was like this strange disconnect, almost like a dementia of some form. About concomitant medications, the reporter explained the patient had not started anything new. She had been on the same stuff for many years. She had psych meds that she had been on, but she had been on those for many years. She clarified further that patient had been stable on her psych meds for many years, and the nursing facility had the patient stable for 3 years at the nursing home. At the time of the report, her mood swings were all over the place, she had never had that before. She had hallucinations and paranoid thoughts in the past, but she had never had mood swings like this and never had dementia. She had been on the same medications for a long time, but they were currently trying to play with them and trying to adjust her psych meds. It was apparent it was not working and this was something more organic, something going on in her body. The psych med was perphenazine all of her life. The psych nurse was a new nurse and was not familiar with the patient. The psych nurse informed the reporter she raised the perphenazine to the highest dose she could possible go on and told she could have to try the patient on a mood stabilizer and could have to put her in a psych unit. The reporter would not have any NDC, lot numbers or expiration dates, or anything like that. The reporter had been told an UTI could have caused the patient symptoms. It could have been brain cancer, or this or that. She did not know what was going on. Reporter asked if there had been any reports or had other people called in with these types of reactions or adverse events. The patient had recovered from vomiting and nausea on an unknown date in 2021, had recovered from kidney functions were not good enough and UTI in Feb2021, the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Three days after dose 1 I experienced dizziness and violent vomiting (for 8 hours). Taken to emergency room. Admitted to hospital for hospital for 1 day.  Was given anti-vomiting/dizziness drugs, CT scan, IV for dehydration, pain and anxiety medicine. Diagnosis was vertigo. Upon release from hospital, consult with internist further diagnosed condition as labarynthitis. Headache and slight dizziness continued for a couple of weeks . After second dose dizziness, light-headedness and headache are significant enough to  take Tylenol regularly. These effects are still in place 12 days after 2nd dose. Will see internist if symptoms continue after 2 weeks.

                                                She had the vaccine at the facility where she lives.  She fainted less than 24 hours after the vaccine, got up from that and had dry heaves, lost her speech and had loose stools.  The aide caught her as she was fainting as she would have fallen on the floor.  She said it was weird, she looked at people and it looked like they were 2 dimensional and knew something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t figure out what as they attended to her.  They asked her questions, but she was not able to speak to them.   They apparently spent 2 hours with her, but she doesn&#39;t believe it was that long, and then they knew she wanted to go to one Hospital and not the other.  She had been loosing words before this happened, but not as bad as this one.  This was about the same reaction that she had when she got the COVID virus in January.  She was then taken to the hospital where she was given fluids and hydrated her and checked her heart, saw a cardiologist and a neurologist to see if those things caused the fainting and had blood work done.  They also did a CAT Scan of her head and neck.  They told her that she was fine and was discharged back home after 5 days, which was 3/11/21.  Since then she has been very tired, she does have GERD and her stomach has been hurting a lot as well.

This  68-year old female patient receive her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), lot number EL 9262, via unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 05Feb2021 at 3:30 PM (at the age of 68-year old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included allergy to NSAIDs, cephalosporin and bee stings, Epstein-Barr virus infection (EBV), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), drug induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with NSAIDs and Rebetrol/Interferon), &#34;T&amp;A&#34;, tubal ligation, cholecystectomy and osteoporosis. Concomitant medications included zinc, Vit D3, probiotics and calcium. After first shot, on an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient experienced platelets down to 140k, (Hx of drug induced ITP), splenic discomfort/pain. No treatment was given to the patient for the events. The outcome was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Platelets decreased cannot be excluded. However, the medical history of drug induced immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) with NSAIDs may provide a plausible alternative explanation for the event.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

During the night nightmares and migraine woke me up. Tried to go to the bathroom but collapsed and knocked my head on the wall. Could not get up crawled to the bathroom and tried to pull myself up but fell headfirst and hit my nose and cheek on the toilet. Cut nose and hurt cheek bone. Felt terrible head spinning and unable to get up/ Crawled to bed; Live alone. Could not even find the telephone; Woke up and tried to get up.  Freezing cold. Finally called Ambulance Their doctor refused to send an ambulance and said &#34; go to your GP its not an emergency&#34;. I was disgusted barely could walk but somehow drove to the GP. he was closed so went to emergency. the Dr in charge of the vaccination center was there but did not accept it was the vaccine; Finally on the verge of collapse another lady took me to the entrance of emergency. I was finally seen:; Same thing. Dr there told me its not an emergency and to go and see my GP. I was so sick and told him th eGP was not there; His reply &#34; There are plenty of others to see&#34;  It was the nurse who persisted and even  thought may be I had covid and did the PCR test. I started uncontrollably shivering and was freezing. I had a fever. they did blood tests lung x ray and finally a urine test, Full of blood leucocytes and protein. The same wonderful nurse said its bad. I was by then vomitting again and thought I would die; Uncontrollable shivering ;  taken to the lab or a pelvic cat scan;Couldnt even get to sip water. SEVEN hours later the  same DR who told me I was not an emergency came in and said &#34; You will have to be hospitalised as you have a serious kidney infection. Acute pyelonephritis.

For two days, unable to eat anything but broth and oatmeal.  After the second dose on 3/9/21, similarly, after 6-7 days same symptoms, however, to date, they have not subsided.  Food and liquids (even water and fizzy water) tastes funny, flat.  The smell of most food is nauseating, and in the last few days I have had some explosive diarrhea, now just loose stools.  For the last 3 days have felt dizzy; not constantly, but if I move my head quickly or bend over.  I did not have covid at the time of vaccination; I have had 8 covid tests in 2021 due to medical procedures and flying.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Mar2021 at 15:00 (Lot Number: EN6198) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included mild stroke from 18Jan2020 and not ongoing, suspected she had atrial fibrillation and she had a heart monitor placed 21Feb2020. Her heart monitor never showed Atrial Fibrillation after one year of being monitored. Ongoing low thyroid/hypothyroidism and blood cholesterol increased from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for low thyroid/hypothyroidism from an unspecified start date (started probably been 10 years) and ongoing; atorvastatin taken for reduce cholesterol from 2020 (started right after she had stroke, either Jan2020 or Feb2020) and ongoing. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 01Mar2021 (at age of 68 years old, Lot Number: EN6200) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. She was fine right after the first dose. She only had a sore arm for 3 days. Just last week, she had a severe adverse reaction right after her vaccine. With the second dose, she had everything possible. Twelve hours after, on 23Mar2021 at 03:00, she awoke to throw up.  She thinks she fainted.  She had to throw up 2 more times that night. She had been wearing a heart monitor. On 24Mar2021 her cardiologist called her and told her she had a 19 second pause of no heartbeat and was in a 3rd degree heart block. The very next morning, they put in a pacemaker. She was overall healthy and athletic. She was a runner and golfs all the time. She had an outpatient procedure for the pacemaker placement at the hospital on 25Mar2021. She was still recovering but improving. Caller added it was scary when your heart stops. Caller added she did not see this as a possible related side effect, but that evening when she was not feeling well, 22Mar2021, she checked her oxygen level with her oximeter. It was 93 and usually runs around 99. It is back to normal now. She checked it the night she was vomiting. Stated this was before the third degree heart block by a few hours. She did not think it was related. All her symptoms are gone other than the placement of her pacemaker. The outcome of the events &#34; 19 second pause of no heartbeat and in third degree heart block&#34; was recovering. The outcome of the event &#34; Oxygen saturation decreased&#34; was recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EW0158), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid left on 06Apr2021 at 12:00 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 (had coronavirus last year) on an unspecified date in 2020, blood pressure and blood cholesterol abnormal, sleep disorder, prophylaxis for heart disease, hypertension and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included amlodipine; olmesartan medoxomil taken for hypertension; acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for prophylaxis; atorvastatin calcium taken for blood cholesterol; metoprolol taken for hypertension; melatonin taken for sleep disorder, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing. She has taken medication for blood pressure and cholesterol for years and never had this type of pain. She takes amlodipine, olmesartan medoxomil and was taking Bystolic before and it was working ok but she would have PVC&#39;s and that was discontinued, and she was placed on metoprolol. The PVC&#39;s are better, better control over the PVC&#39;s. Clarified she had the PVC&#39;s before the medications. The patient previously received a flu vaccination for influenza immunization and got soreness at the injection site. Reporter stated that on her right side when she presses down in the area, she feels it a lot, has pain in the right side of her stomach when sneezing and coughing, and a very deep pain upon movement. These started mildly several hours after the vaccine on the same day and then progressively got worse over the last 2 days, 07Apr2021 was very bad and 08Apr2021 also and she still has it this morning. It let up a bit this morning. The slight dizziness started the same day as the vaccine a few hours later and has stayed about the same, it may be improving a little she thinks as she didn&#39;t really evaluate it this morning, but she thinks it might be a little better. The dizziness she knows you can have light dizziness as a side effect from the vaccine and it is not serious, it can be a normal side effect for people, that most people she has spoken to didn&#39;t have dizziness. The pain is a little less today, she is moving around now, and it has lessened to some degree, it is not as severe as yesterday or the day before. She didn&#39;t know if her liver was being affected or what, it is in that area. She feels her symptoms are 100% related to the vaccine. Consumer stated, &#34;I took Pfizer COVID vaccine on 06Apr (06Apr2021) and after that I started feeling dizziness and pain in my stomach area or abdomen area and now the third day it is really bad. All I had was the Pfizer COVID Vaccine.&#34; When paraphrased the concern, consumer stated, &#34;Yes, It is in my stomach area.&#34; The events coughing, sneezing and stomach pain were considered medically significant by the reporter. The outcome of the event slight dizziness was recovering, while of the rest was not recovered.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: CER230) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The medical history included flu and suspected COVID-19 both in Jan2020 to an unspecified date (she had a bad flu back in Jan2020, which could have been COVID because it was such a bad flu, over a year ago), ongoing asthma from an unspecified date (mild asthma) and chest nausea in Jan2020 to an unspecified date. The patient had no history of any adverse events following prior vaccinations. Medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was also reported as none. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event included an uncle that had asthma, but no one else had breathing issues. Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulfate (DUONEB), both ongoing and taken for asthma on unspecified dates. Other products were also reported as &#34;no&#34;. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine and did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: 3N6202) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. On 24Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and headache; on 25Mar2021 the patient experienced flu-like symptoms, fever, achy, fatigue; on 02Apr2021 the patient experienced asthma flare up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest, nausea feeling in her chest; on unspecified dates in Apr2021 the patient experienced she gets this laryngitis, has trouble talking and she wants to make sure its not going into like a viral pneumonia. The reporter classified the events headache and flu-like symptoms as non-serious. The patient called to report that she had an asthma flare up 10 days (as reported) after her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 24Mar2021. The patient stated that she did not get a flare up often, she had mild asthma. She usually got mild flare-ups since she did not have severe asthma. She stated it could be something else, but she had not had a flare-up like this since she had a bad flu back in Jan2020, which could have been COVID-19 because it was such a bad flu. That was over a year ago. She received her second vaccine on 24Mar2021, and the asthma flare up and hacking cough started on 02Apr2021. On the night of 24Mar2021, she started with a headache. She had the shot at 11 something and by that evening before she went to bed, she had a headache and a sore arm, but that was no big deal. Then on 25Mar2021, she started with flu like symptoms/fever. The headache persisted through that as well. At that point, she did not have tightness or the dry, hacky cough. By the middle of the day on 27Mar2021, her flu-like symptoms were gone. She would consider these to be &#34;non-serious&#34;, it was what she expected, as it was seen from the paperwork of the vaccine. By 28Mar2021, all of her symptoms were gone prior to the flare-up. She had typical flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, achy, fatigue on the 2nd, 3rd, and into the 4th day but then they cleared up. By the evening of the 4th day, she started feeling fairly normal. She stated that they were mild flu symptoms. Her temperature was only 100 for about a day. She stated that that was expected. Then, she went into this flare-up about the 10th day after the vaccine. The first 3 or 4 days after the flare up began, the flare up was worsening. Then, she got it under a little bit of control, so she was not coughing all night and having to sit up as she was sleeping. Now, she was concerned about the pain and tightness in her chest and the hacky cough. She wanted to make sure it was not going into like a viral pneumonia or another thing. She did not know. She kept increasing her Advair use and was at the top of that. She was doing the duoneb which she did not usually have to do. She had not had to do that since Jan2020 when she had the 5-week flu, or it could have been COVID (they were calling it a hoax back then). She was using her duoneb 4 times a day and now she was using it to 2-3 times, but she was still getting chest tightness, hacky cough. It was kind of like nausea- it was hard to explain, it was kind of like a chest nausea, which she had also had back in Jan2020 when she had the bad flu. She also would get this laryngitis and had trouble talking. With her flare-up, her chest tightness/nausea feeling in the chest continued. Now, she was getting into laryngitis type of thing, but she could loosen that up with her duoneb but if she got to the point where she could not do that, she would definitely have to see someone right away. She clarified that when her chest got tight, the dry, hacky cough continued/increased. When she did the breathing treatment, it loosened it up for about 3-4 hours and some of the pain would go away in her chest. If she talked too much, she would begin to cough. She had had this flare up 3 times in her life, it was not very common. She was diagnosed with asthma in her 40s, and this was her 3rd time ever having anything like this. This was the first time she had experienced a flare up like this. She had had 3 episodes since she had had asthma in her 40&#39;s and all 3 bad episodes were about the same. All the episodes were related to illness, it did not just happen out of the blue. It happened with a viral respiratory thing or the flu. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. The patient stated that she would call her physician or the clinic &#34;today or tomorrow&#34;. She had not been to a doctor since her asthma flared up. Her respiratory doctor/pulmonologist moved away, there was no respiratory doctor nearby right now. So, her general practitioner was following her because it was a mild case and she had mild asthma. If it was severe, her doctor would make her go to a specialist. Relevant tests were reported as no. The patient used to be followed with pulmonary function tests until her respiratory doctor moved away. The patient stated that she took care of her 94 year old mother several days a week and because of all of the variances coming out, she thought it was her civic duty to prevent it from spreading through the population and creating more variances which was why she received the vaccine. She stated her doses were scheduled a month apart because they expecting to get a shipment of Moderna and they did not. They had to run to Buffalo to get the Pfizer vaccine, but they left her doses scheduled a month apart because the appointments were so hard to get. Normally, it would be 3 weeks. Her card clearly said Pfizer and they told her Pfizer, and they told her the reason for it being scheduled at 4 weeks. The patient called to inquire whether asthma flare-ups had been seen in clinical trials. It was not a reported side effect from the paperwork she received. When she looked online, she could not really find anything. She was thinking of going to a clinic but was wondering if there were any reports of flare-ups with asthma with the vaccine. With regards to causality, the patient stated it was a concern because she usually did not get a flare-up unless she was sick. She stated that there were many variables, and that it was spring, and bugs were out, but she did not usually get a flare-up like this. She stated that maybe it was a challenge to her immune system, the antibodies, but she did not know. She suspected the flare-up was related to the vaccine, but she did not have any idea. She would say yes, but she had no way of knowing. The flare-up usually only appeared if she got ill or something weird happened to her.  The clinical outcomes of the events flu-like symptoms, fever, achy and fatigue were recovered/resolved on 27Mar2021; sore arm and headache were recovered/resolved on 28Mar2021; asthma flare up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest and nausea feeling in her chest were not recovered/not resolved; she gets this laryngitis, has trouble talking and she wants to make sure its not going into like a viral pneumonia were unknown. The reporter believed there was a reasonable possibility that the events sore arm, flu-like symptoms, asthma flare-up, dry, hacky cough, pain and tightness in her chest and nausea feeling in her chest were related to BNT162B2.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information the events asthma flare-ups and viral pneumonia are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions, unlikely related to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Lot  EJ1686, intramuscular in right deltoid on 03Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient did not receive other vaccine within four weeks.  On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced sore arm and tiredness.  On 07Jan2021 the patient experienced anterior cervical fusion and was hospitalized from 07Jan2021 to 09Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced nausea. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced muscle aches, loss of taste and loss of smell. On unknown date the patient experienced headache. The patient was tested positive to COVID-19 on 11Jan2021. The patient did not visit Physician Office or Emergency Room. Laboratory data included COVID-19 Rapid Test positive on 11Jan2021. The outcome of the events tested positive for COVID-19, and anterior cervical fusion was unknown. The outcome of the events sore arm, tiredness, nausea, muscle aches, headache was resolving. The outcome of the events loss of taste, loss of smell was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 03Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 11Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  This 69-year-old female had medical history of ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The reported anterior cervical fusion was most likely due to concurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the vaccine of BNT162B2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                While half way through eating a Lean Cuisine Butternut Squash Ravioli dinner I suddenly couldn&#39;t swallow. I coughed and threw up what I had eaten. My throat was extremely itchy and my head became very congested. I have never had a food allergy before but after searching that I found the symptoms to be similar. My face was not particularly swollen but I was unable to eat anymore and my throat continued to be very itchy on the right side.  I eat mostly on that side due to a dental problem on the left side.  I took an antihistamine, gargled with mouth wash, used a Netti Pot and sucked a cough drop. The itchiness was reduced by the next morning and gone by that afternoon.

Saw rings of colored lights and squigly lines. Took Tylenol and Benadryl per PCP by phone.  Dizziness and chills went away in about 12 hours.  Still saw squigly lines at night.  Much better the next day but queasy for another 24 hours.

I knew there was potential for side effects before taking the vaccine...I was totally unprepared for so many symptoms and how intense they were and what little I could do to relieve any of them. Never had fever that I am aware of. Today I?m weak and sweating is unreal.  ?? Should I prepare/expect my second dose around Feb. 14 to have the same effect on me.? Not looking forward to that. I was almost ready to go to the ER I was getting so dehydrated and weak.

                                                I give the girl in front of me the Covid vaccine way high on her arm. I told MA do not give my shot that high up. She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times. I still have ongoing pain 24 seven and I want to report a complaint against the girl who gave my shot I thought she was an LPN but she is a MA.  We both work at healthcare clinic. I am a 26 year RN and she did not listen to me and she stuck me anyway against my will.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis, ongoing high cholesterol,  ongoing high blood pressure, celiac disease from 2005 (this has been tested too many times to count and it has been negative since after initial diagnosis 2005), arthritis (all her life) ongoing, hip replacement surgeries first done in 2005; repair of same hip in 2015; other hip in 2017. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Historical vaccines include Pneumonia Vaccine, Shingles Vaccine and Flu vaccines; all on an unspecified date for immunization. She never had adverse events with those. Ongoing concomitant medications included rosuvastatin (5 mg tablet) for high cholesterol, mesalamine (400 mg capsule) for ulcerative colitis and lisinopril from 2018 for high blood pressure. According to the patient, she knows that mesalamine is an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory to keep inflammation in the colon down. This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021 14:30 with immunosuppressant mesalamine. The night of 14Jan2021 patient had headache, chills, body aches, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and dizziness like Covid 19 symptoms. She went to the ER during the past 11 days for IV fluids due to deyhydration from the diarrhea. Today, 25Jan2021 is the first day she has been out of the house, except to go to the ER, since she received her 1st vaccine dose. On Jan2021 muscle pain, neck ache, backache, problems with balance and problems with walking. Events probably started with intense diarrhea starting 14Jan2021; then Fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit and chills 14Jan2021; Specific onset dates and onset times unknown otherwise other than between 14Jan2021 and 16Jan2021 onset dates. It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired. She will fall asleep through the day for 3-4 hours at a time and she does not even nap usually (Jan2021). She has not driven yet but assumes probably once she is a little stronger she will be able to drive again. She did not have upper respiratory, chest or cough issues. The outcome of the events fever, headache, body ache, muscle pain, neck ache was recovered on Jan2021; fatigue was not recovered. The outcome for the other events was unknown.

                                                chills; fever; body aches; headache; vomiting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via a Pfizer sponsored program. A 69-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a sngle dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She mentioned that she received the vaccine on Sunday (unknown date) and reported that for the last 4 days she had been pretty sick with fever, chills, headache and body aches. She had been alternating acetaminophen (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen (ADVIL). She did have COVID in Nov2020. The patient inquired if the symptoms after dose 2 would be worse if she&#39;s had COVID in the past. She also inquired if she will have the same symptoms for the second dose and if how long side effects will last. She add that she did have some vomiting on Sunday later after she got the vaccine. She was wondering because she is to get the second dose on the 21st, the pharmacist did say that sometimes people who have had the Covid virus already can sometimes experience strong side effects from the vaccine. She does not want to feel or get sick. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A non-pregnant 69-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 26Jan2021 at 13:15 (01:15 PM), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. The vaccine was administered in a doctor&#39;s office or urgent care facility. On 26Jan2021 (reported as 12:15 AM; pending clarification), the patient woke up lightheaded or dizzy, with dry heaves, very warm, and with Charley (reported as Charlie) horses in both legs, then she got the chills. This morning (27Jan2021), the patient felt fine. No treatment was administered for the adverse events. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on 27Jan2021.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

                                                Within 10 seconds I began to feel that something was wrong.   A full body response of a swirling congestion, extreme weakness. very blurry vision and couldn&#39;t think straight.  I had trouble walking to recovery room, felt nauseous and weak and had a very fast heartrate.  I had to stay in private recovery room for 45 min.  I was still very ill and nervous at this point.   I left with a family member and asked to be driven to the nearby hospital emergency room.  For a precaution .  We parked across from ER entrance for another 1 hour till I slowly regained strength to 50% normalcy.  I went home afterwards and had to go to bed. I was unable to drive my own vehicle home.  Day 2, still feel weak, shaky and not normal.  I consider this a serious adverse reaction that did not receive medical intervention but will prevent me from getting the second Pfizer shot.  After 5 hours post injection I felt 60% normal .  Day 2, 70 per cent normal.   The vaccination facility was not able to do blood pressure monitoring ( which is a problem for anyone experiencing reactions.)  They said their protocol was to call 911/ambulance.   My blood pressure was checked by a certified PA with professional equipment at the 3 hour post injection time and the diastolic pressure was still below 50.  And heart rate above normal.  Still weak and nauseous.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 26Jan2021 at 15:46 PM, (at the age of 69-year) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, pacemaker insertion. Concomitant medication was not reported, however, the patient reported that she takes medicines for hypertension, and is on blood thinners. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reported that on 26Jan2021, after receiving the vaccination she did wait a half hour and the only symptoms she thought at the vaccination visit was a little blurred vision, which was temporary and went away. At 16:30, about 45 minutes to 1 hour after she left the vaccination center, as she was driving home, she informed that she was feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/face was really tingling and numb, and she had difficulty swallowing;  her throat started to feel like it was closing up and her tongue was really thick.  She stated she tried to stay calm and forced herself to drink a bottle of water. She had no idea where there was any emergency area since she was not familiar with the area and tried to calm herself down and took sips of water and made sure she was breathing okay and it all went away. The reaction lasted 10-15 minutes and seem to resolve when she was able to calm herself down. She stated it was scary, and once she calmed down it all went away.  She was concerned about receiving the second dose. She did not go to a physician or emergency room, but says she probably should have. The clinical outcome of little blurred vision, feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/her face was really tingling and numb, difficulty swallowing, throat started to feel like it was closing up, and tongue got thick was recovered.     The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                shaking; chills; headache; diarrhea; overall body aches; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 69-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination.

Patient probably tested positive and was treated probably the same day she had the positive test (in Oct2020), reporter was sure all of this happened at the hospital, but he doesn&#39;t have that information, and the COVID test type was unknown. Reporter&#39;s question was related to information about this specific type of patient, having received the monoclonal antibody treatment on 12Oct2020, to an unknown date, which was Remdesivir and also having had COVID then, then having reactions to the dose, would the second dose be necessary, effective, or safe to give to this patient. The patient had her first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine 3 weeks ago (estimated as 27Jan2021 by standing order and not prescribed). The patient had general same symptoms listed for side effects of the vaccine that were more severe than others. The patient experienced effects after the first dose of the vaccine as shaking and chills for two days, and headache, diarrhea, and overall body aches (Jan2021). Reporter wanted to know of any studies or research on patients who have been positive for Covid 19 prior to getting the vaccine and treated with monoclonal antibodies and if they do have similar titers to those who have been vaccinated. The reporting pharmacist that the events were serious, and he thought these were medically significant. The patient&#39;s symptoms resolved after 72 hours, and reporter did not believe that they did any treatment other than to sleep. The events recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.

Patient stated that she would wake up in the night and need three or four treatments. Patient stated that before being sick, she had horses and it would take 15-20 minutes to do her routine with the horses, but while she was sick, it took two hours. Patient stated that she would walk out and back, and it was an ordeal, she was tired and short of breath. Patient stated that the doctors called it severe respiratory inflammation, and that was in Nov and Dec2020. Patient stated that she was put on steroids at that time, and she really didn&#39;t want to go back to the doctor, so she took some of her husband&#39;s steroids, he had some dexamethasone, and she took that and started to feel better.

Patient took her first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 09Feb2021. Patient stated that two days later, she had side effects and had had them for the last 6 days. Patient stated that if someone picked it, she had it. Patient stated that she had a fever, chills and pain.

Patient stated that her side effects started on 11Feb2021 between 4 and 5PM, so more than 48 hours later and they all of a sudden just hit her. Patient stated that the vomiting had stopped, but she did still get some abdominal pain once in a while, but the vomiting stopped about two days ago, but for a while she could not keep food down, and she was just trying to take paracetamol (TYLENOL).

Patient stated that these side effects were a little better yesterday, the caller got up and took a dexamethasone 5 mg and felt better. Patient stated that when she woke up this morning, she was feeling god awful, so she took another dexamethasone, and she was better this afternoon. Patient planned to go to an urgent care today, but she had not been to a doctor yet.

Patient stated they were serious, but nothing life threatening, caller confirmed all side effects were medically significant.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 26Feb2021 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) and vitamin. The patient previously took BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunisation (first dose on the left arm at 01:30 PM, lot number: EL 1283); and SHINGRIX vaccine in 2019, codeine and cipro and experienced allergies. On 27Feb2021 03:30 PM, the patient experienced chills, fatigue &amp; then sudden nausea &amp; lightheadedness that resulted in passing out. Unfortunately, the patient fell on a tile floor &amp; hit her head resulting in a 1.5 inch gash in the back of her head. When she went to the ER, it was determined that she now had vertigo (which she never had before) but obviously hard to tell if it was a side effect of the vaccine or from the fall. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the events which included CT scan, ekg, chest X-ray, bloodwk (unknown results) and Epley maneuver. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient is not pregnant. Outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                On 3/24, I woke up nauseous, extremely fatigued, with sore joints, headache, and abdominal pain.  A few days later I noticed I had extreme shortness of breath.  I went to see my PCP on or about 3/31.  He listened to my heart and discovered a rapid heartbeat.  He then took an EKG.  He wanted to put me on lifetime meds immediately.  I was in shock because I truly believe this is a reaction to the COVID vaccine.  I have never had arrhythmia.  In fact, I had a wellness visit with the Dr. about 3 months previously and all was good.  I have been seeing him for four years since I moved.  He does not think my new diagnosis is related to a vaccine reaction, but I find it highly suspect that 4 other women in my large circle of friends also have AFIB after 2nd shot. I spent Easter in the ER and they pumped Metoprolol in my bloodstream.  I did not stay in the hospital that night.  I went to see the Dr. on Monday morning on 4/4.  He prescribed Metroprolol 25 mg and Xarelto 20 mg IMMEDIATELY.  I picked up the meds and started this regimen.  In speaking with other women, I believe this terrible diagnosis is a direct result as a reaction from the vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history included knee replacement surgery years ago, dyslipidemia, depression,  insomnia, constipation problems; she was taking clopidogrel (PLAVIX) because she had a hole in her heart last year (2020).

Concomitant medications included: clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) taken for hole in heart from Aug2020 and ongoing, venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFEXOR), simvastatin (ZOCOR), and temazepam.

Every time she sat down to use the bathroom, the sweating would get more intense and every time she would get up and use the restroom, she had to use a walker. Then, she used the walker to back up in the bed (19Feb2021), and she seemed to be okay. It seemed like the sweats would go away and she would get the cold chills. The patient just put a heating pad on her stomach, and this occurred all day long until Saturday morning. She mentions she does have constipation problems, but this was explosive. She couldn&#39;t get to the restroom a few times. She had several explosive bowel movements on 19Feb2021 10:00. Her husband brought the garbage pail in the bedroom and she did use plastic on the bedding. By 11:30-12pm on Saturday (20Feb2021), it completely stopped, but she was still sweating. She was so dizzy. It would hit her so bad and her head as wringing wet. However, when she would get back in the bed and lay down flat, the sweating would go away, and she would start to get the cold chills. The patient explained the sweating/hot and cold chills went away by yesterday afternoon (unspecified date). She was able to walk back and forth to the restroom with no problems. She verified all of her symptoms have improved. On 02Apr2021, the patient reported she received the second dose of the vaccine on 09Mar2021. The patient reported that sore arm and chills were important medical events, for which no treatment was received. Treatment received for diarrhea included &#34;limgen&#34;.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL8982, unknown expiration), via injection in right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 prevention.  Medical history included ongoing vertigo (in car accident a little over 5 years ago, that affected a big nerve in left temple, and so every once in a while she will get vertigo so bad that she falls over), ongoing GERD (from a hiatal hernia; diagnosed many years ago), ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed about 15 years ago, ongoing bad cholesterol diagnosed 10 to 15 years ago, ongoing heart burn, ongoing hiatus hernia, and car accident a little over 5 years ago. Concomitant medications included ongoing omeprazole sodium (OMEPRAZOLE) for GERD, heart burn, and hiatal hernia (started this product at least 10 years ago; takes the product as needed if she is having heart burn or is going to eat spicy food); ongoing vitamin D3 for vitamin supplementation (started product about 8 months ago, because her doctor told her too, she guesses her vitamin was low); ongoing metoprolol for high blood pressure and to prevent stroke (started product at least 15 years ago; her BP could be regular but it could shoot up when she is upset, so she takes this to prevent stroke); ongoing hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure (started product at least 5 years ago); pravastatin for bad cholesterol  (started the product at least 4 or 5 or more years ago); and ongoing acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) to prevent stroke (has been taking this product forever, at least for 10 years).  The patient reported that she received the first COVID shot on 13Jan2021. She was okay on the 13th, 14th, and 15th. However, on the 16th (16Jan2021), she woke up and threw up once and was very dizzy for three days. She mentioned that she had like vertigo, she couldn&#39;t even walk, she had to crawl and her husband had to walk her around, she couldn&#39;t do anything. She had vertigo (16Jan2021). She was that way on Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, the patient&#39;s son took her to acupuncturist for her dizziness and was able to get up fine and walked away. After the acupuncture, she felt fine, like she was all better. On 19Jan2021 (reported as yesterday), she was fine. She woke up at midnight and had terrible acid reflux for 3 hours even though she had hardly eaten. She does take omeprazole for heart burn, and she had taken omeprazole earlier in the day, but it was just coming up, that acid and burning. She drank milk to coat the stomach and it went away at 03:00 AM. She had very bad chills/terrible chills (20Jan2021) and her teeth were chattering, she couldn&#39;t even talk, and couldn&#39;t control the chills. She is fine now. She clarified that she got vertigo from a car crash years ago and haven&#39;t had it in almost a year. Chills are not ongoing at this time, she has not had any for about 4 hours now, and she is hoping she is recovered completely, but it may be too soon to tell. She did not receive other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient is wondering if all this could be from the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if it is safe to take the second shot. She was scheduled to receive the second dose on 03Feb2021. The patient recovered from the events threw up on 16Jan2021; unable to walk and vertigo on 18Jan2021; dizziness on 19Jan2021; and terrible acid reflux on 20Jan2021. While unknown outcome for chills.

                                                My reaction began typically enough, with a sore arm and chills.  The chills subsided by the evening, but symptoms continued and migrated from there.  The arm remained sore for 3 days and then began to itch.  This itchiness continued on and off for the next 2 days.  My neck and shoulder were also sore.  The shoulder continued to be sore for about 4 days.  I had an intermittent headache, also  for 4 days.  The worst part though, is the nausea, which also comes and goes.  But it can last for many hours and now, even after 8 days, I am still experiencing this.  I can find nothing in the writings about this vaccine to corroborate this side effect and I am therefore worried about the second shot.

A 70-year-old female patient (who was not pregnant at the time of vaccine) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number; el3249) via an unspecified route of administration, at right arm on 14Jan2021 14:00, at hospital for COVID-19 Immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), GERD (Gastrooesophageal reflux disease), oral cancer 2020 with surgery only, arthritis, hypothryroid and allergies to nickel. Concomitant medications included, irbesartan (AVAPRO), levothyroxine, liothyronine (NP THYROID), lansoprazole (PREVACID), ibuprofen (MOTRIN) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took metoclopramide (REGLAN) and prochlorperazine edisylate (COMPAZINE); patient had allergies to both drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. List of medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination, included: avapro, np thyroid, prevacid, motrin, Tylenol. On 14Jan2021 at 14:15 (after 15 minutes of dose), the patient experienced feeling very hot, lips numb and tingly, headache, dizzy, heart beating hard in chest, anxiety, waited another 15 minutes, taken to ER (Emergency Room) on site; elevated blood pressure, nausea with dry heaves. Patient was taken into Emergency room/department for urgent care and received treatment IV solumedrol, ativan and zofran, oral Benadryl. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date in 2021; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events headache and nausea were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other reported serious events with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Lasted approx. 30-35 minutes. crawled with head hanging to floor to keep from passing out, to locate a phone for help. after several of agonizing attempts to try and climb up to couch to elevate legs high above head and laying there for  approx. 20 or more min. blood pressure came up some. (Did not call emergency services) afraid of hospitalization due to  all chronic health problems, (forgot to report earlier that I am Hypothyroid as well)  previously hospitalized for a Thyroid Storm. This is day 10 from injection and still have nausea, dizziness &amp; fatigue, (also have couple episodes of abdominal pain). (I want to add that I felt completely fine prior to receiving 2nd Pfizer Covid dose).  I am contacting my  doctor today to receive some IV fluids.

Took acetaminophen  and some anti -nausea drugs I had on hand.  Fever left, but returned next night.  Weakness, no appetite stayed for two days.  Thought it was the flu, but no upper respiratory symptoms.  Thought it might be Covid-19 but tested negative.  Finally decided it was a reaction to the vaccine.

There was a sense of nausea initially but it went away. There was pronounced feeling of heat located subcutaneously on my right outer thigh. It came and went about every minute or so. (I counted the seconds in between each incident). I am still experiencing flu like symptoms (bodily aches, slight headache, mild chest pain, and general ill-feeling.) I will contact my primary care physician today about my concerns but felt it necessary to document these mild but disturbing side effects.

It felt almost like a seizure because my lack of control was evident in my movements.  With my heaviest PJs on, it took 8 blankets to finally warm me up.  I am on a CPAP machine but I was having a hard time getting my breath.  I was also nauseous but never threw up.  I finally got back asleep a little after 3 am but  woke several times after that.  This morning, I had a terrible headache and can&#39;t get rid of it. Although I feel better than last night, I feel lousy.  It is now 2 pm and I just want this to be over.  On the first shot, I didn&#39;t have any reaction at all.

My husband was up every half hour urinating from 6pm  until about 3am.  We both felt fine this morning but about 11am I got super dizzy and had to sit down, the dizziness caused vomiting and a sever headache.  I laid down for about an hour and feel a bit better but the headache has remained!!   Hopefully this too will pass in a few more hours!  Just thought you might want to know.  If it gets worse I will contact my doctor.   My husband has not had any other adverse reactions.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL3247, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 26Jan2021 at 08:30 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a clinic.  Medical history included ongoing underactive thyroid, cataract surgery on 14Oct2020 and on 28Oct2020, and cholesterol (abnormal).

The patient experienced nervousness, slight swelling/tingling in lips, dizziness, like she has a cough in her throat, swelling and soreness of her arm, tightness in her jaw, numbness in hand on 26Jan2021. The patient also had difficulty swallowing, had taste in her mouth, and dry mouth in Jan2021. The patient on the line calling about the COVID-19 vaccine.

She initially stated she had slight swelling/tingling in lips, difficulty swallowing, numbness in hands, jaws became tight, and nervousness which she is still experiencing. She mentioned she took benadryl. She was wondering if she should go and get the second shot. The patient first experienced dizziness which lasted for a second and this occurred while waiting in the lobby for observation after getting the vaccine. Slight swelling and tingling in lips were noticed two minutes after the dizziness. It felt like a tingle sensation. She clarified she does not necessarily have difficulty swallowing. It was not so much she could not swallow, but it was like she has a cough in her throat. It feels like she could cough but would need to keep swallowing and drinking water.

The numbness in hand started at the same time as the tightness of her jaw. Her left hand is what went numb, and she had the vaccine administered in her left arm. The nervousness is getting better, but she felt very nervous. She also mentioned she has thyroid problems and is not sure if this has anything to do with it. She had this nervousness feeling 2 hours after getting the shot. Patient is scheduled to get the second vaccine on 18Feb2021. Benadryl has helped a lot. The patient has no additional vaccines administered on the same date and has no prior vaccination within four weeks.  The events did not require emergency room and physician office visit.

I am right now still somewhat nauseated at 9:13AM same day but at least I&#39;m not retching unable to even  keep a sip of water from causing violent retching.  I only weigh 118lbs and wonder if the doses are just too strong for that body mass. My doctor told me beforehand to stay hydrated before the shot so I drank lots of water/liquids the days prior to the shot and thought I would be generally OK.  I have had no problems with my yearly influenza vaccine or any other vaccine but I would think twice about doing this vaccine again.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number EN6205) via unspecified route of administration on unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was not provided. Upon 15 minutes after injection, she noted nausea with belching and had some SOB. Symptoms worsened as she ambulated over to the medical bay along with her chest pressure. She denied rash, hives, welts, hoarseness, stridor, itching, lightheadedness, dizziness, facial swelling, lip swelling and tongue swelling. Patient reported recently admitted for unstable angina and CAD with tachycardia. Patient had elevated d-dimer and blood clot was ruled out. Patient discontinued on new medication, beta blocker. Since discharge this Sunday 21Feb2021, she reported chest heaviness as if she has &#34;cardboard on chest.&#34; Can slightly increase with going up and down stairs or increased activity. She states she had reached out to her cardiologist via an online site but has not heard back. Patient stated her pain is about the same today. Patient complains of chest tightness and shortness of breath. The outcome of events was unknown.   No Follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of events unstable angina and tachycardia cannot be excluded. The patient&#39;s age and suspected cardiac condition are risk factors. The event CAD, given its progressive nature, is most likely an underlying condition, thus unrelated to the suspect drug.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The possibility that suspect drug may have contributed to the reported event cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/Lot Number: EL9264; Expiration Date: May2021), intramuscular, administered in Arm Left (left upper arm) on 25Feb2021 11:00 (at 70-year-old) at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications.  Vaccination Facility Type was clinic. The patient previously took flu shot (she took the flu shot every fall and she has never had a reaction like this). It was reported that the patient started feeling queasy within 1 hour of the dose the same day. She confirmed by 1 AM 26Feb2021 she had diarrhea and vomiting which was about 14 hours after shot. She says the diarrhea actually started before 1 AM, so could have been 25Feb2021, but was mild and escalated and by 1 AM it was extremely bad. She confirmed the diarrhea was mild the same day as the vaccine and then got worse. She has also had a few heart quivers since this happened nothing constant but occasionally she feels like her heart is trembling. She thinks it was Saturday which would have 27Feb2021 because Friday, the day after the vaccine she was exhausted all day from being sick and maybe from the vaccine also but she thinks it was the next day, Saturday when she started occasionally feeling her heart  jumping around a bit. She says occasionally her heart is still quivering for no rhyme or reason, just every once in a while she notices it. She says hopefully if she does take the second shot she will do better. The outcome of the event &#34; few heart quivers/heart is trembling/occasionally feeling her heart jumping around a bit/occasionally her heart is still quivering for no rhyme or reason&#34; was not recovered, &#34;exhausted all day from being sick&#34; was unknown, while for other events was recovered.

After the second dose I was not aware that I would get sick to the extreme that I did. I found out afterwards that other people have said this, I did not know at the time. I thought I was going to die. I am a 70-year-old woman, I am not young, and I have had viruses, flus my whole life and I got so sick. First, I had over a 103 temperature, it came on suddenly, 12 hours to the minute after I got the vaccine. On top of that I had such bad chills I never saw anything like that in my life, 5 blankets on top of me, sweaters, sweatshirts and the fever was so high. I could not keep the Tylenol down because I had nausea and I would throw it up. So, I could not even get rid of it. Then on top of that my arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all, plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain, it was excruciating. I have had 5 surgeries, my arm hurt worse than all 5 surgeries put together. And I had my gall bladder removed and everything, nothing hurt to this extent. Now also I have asthma, nothing severe but I do have asthma, so I have one of those little oximeters and you put it on your finger and it checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91, all night it was 91, my chest was shortness of breath. I was ready to go to the hospital. And I did not know it was going to be that bad.&#34; When clarified about the treatment the patient stated that &#34;yes, the Tylenol helped once I could hold it down. The doctor gave me something to stop the vomiting and the nausea. And then I could take the Tylenol and then the Tylenol worked great. But at first, I was so sick I could not hold the Tylenol down in my stomach I would throw it up, that was the problem.&#34; When asked about lab work the patient stated that she had not had lab work done since the first vaccine. She stated that she had stayed in the house because she had other health issues and was afraid to come out for 11 months. So she had not gone out to get anything done. The patient stated that she called because if a third dose was needed, she suggested that a smaller dose be given to small people. She stated that she took childrens medicine most of the time because she was tiny. She wanted to know if Pfizer in the future would be making doses for small people and doses for bigger people. Her suggestion was to have a separate booster to go by weight or by gender, men usually did not experience the same. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34; were all recovered/resolved on unspecified dates.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal.

The next day I felt tired, foggy brain, and dizzy.  Assumed it was from the shot.  Side effects continued/worsened.  4/6/21 I saw my Dr.  She checked me over, labs. found nothing wrong with me.  Likely side effects from Pfizer.  Unlikely that they would last two weeks.  Rx Meclizine for dizziness, which didn&#39;t really help.  Now it&#39;s Day 15.  Tired and brain fog are gone.  I don&#39;t feel as dizzy.  BUT, when I try to drive, I feel QUITE dizzy with blurred vision.  This side effect persists and clearly effects my quality of life.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Very tired after vaccination.  Went to sleep about 8 PM Sat 1/16 and slept most of the next 4 days.  Stomach  was queasy.  Unable to drink coffee.  Tried to push fluids and tried to just eat bland foods.  Would wake up sporadically but was unable to awaken enough to watch an entire TV show. Pretty lethargic and brain fog.  Was able to wake up a little more on Wed 1/20 but still had the queasy stomach.  Started getting Headache and Eye pain and severe upper leg  and lower back burning &amp; cramping, I tried taking tylenol which helped a little.  By Thursday  the pain was worse.  I was still tired  only walking helped the pain. It got worse if I sat down and extremely bad if I laid down to try to sleep. It&#39;s Friday morning &amp; I am planning to go to med check this AM.  Symptoms still ongoing

This time, about 12 hours after receiving the shot, I began to feel aches and pains (like a cold was coming on). During the night I had some chills and the next day I was very achy and very tired. I napped about 4 hours during the day and was asleep by 8p.m. and slept for 12 hours. The next day (second day after the shot), the aches receded but I was still very lethargic for about another 8 hours.  I began to feel &#39;normal&#39; by evening and am felling OK today (third day after the shot). I did drink a lot of water during the whole time as I felt very thirsty (and I am normally a big water drinker!) I also had no appetite until this morning.

The patient stated that the dizziness she had, caused her to be nauseous and she threw up all day yesterday. She tried to eat something today and she was just having bad problems with feeling sick all the time. She asked if there are recommendations for getting the second shot after having symptoms like this. Today is the third day that she had been feeling the dizziness and it had improved a little, like she was not dizzy today like she was yesterday, but today she was just more like lightheaded. The patient reported that the nausea was ongoing, she felt like she was going to get like today like she did yesterday. She did not think she still has a low grade fever, she probably had the low grade fever on 15 and 16Jan2021. She just can&#39;t seem to shake not feeling good. At first that it was her sinuses because that was where her head was hurting, but then the sinus pain went away but she still had a headache. The patient stated that her heart also went racing a few times in the night. Yesterday was a bad day, but today she was a little bit lightheaded. She tried to eat some toast today, so she will see if she can keep that down. The outcome of the events headache, dizziness, heart rate increased and sinus pain was recovering and the low grade fever was recovered on 17Jan2021 and other events was not recovered.

Probably after 8AM I took my temp and I had a fever (102F) for about 10 hours. Started aching all over, joint and muscle aches, I also had headache (took Motrin and headache went away),  no pain at the injection site. Almost like I had flu symptoms. I felt miserable all day but next day when I woke up I was fine. Went to work as normal the next day. I forgot to state I had COVID in March 2020 and the symptoms I had felt very much like it.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 19Jan2021 08:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. She was sick (COVID symptoms) all Dec2020 when she was with her sister who had COVID-19. She does not know for sure that she had COVID 19 because she was never tested. She recovered from that illness about two weeks before getting the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine first dose. The cough was all gone before she had the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the vaccine on 19Jan2021, two days ago and had not had a problem. She left there and went to the gym for 1 hour afterwards. Then yesterday morning she woke up and has been sick ever since with a cough and chills. She never tested positive for COVID but she was with her sister who had it during Dec2020. She had a cough similar to the one she had in Dec2020 when she was quarantined for COVID symptoms. She was not expecting anything, but it says you can have side effects if you have had COVID-19 so she was calling in about that. On 20Jan2021 she woke up at 02:00 in the morning with a cough; injection site pain which was not sore before; headache; muscle pains, chills; joint pain; fever, but not a high fever; feeling freezing cold; and nausea. She reported &#39;cold, chills, fever, ache&#39;. She felt a little bit better today on 21Jan2021. She was scheduled to receive the second dose on 15Feb2021 at 08:15. The patient would like to know whether her history of COVID symptoms from Dec2020 may have aggravated her post-vaccination symptoms. The patient would like to know whether there have been other reports of similar post-vaccination as hers. The outcome of the events cough, injection site pain, headache, fever and feeling freezing cold was recovering; event muscle pain, joint pain and nausea was not recovered; event chills was recovered on 21Jan2021; and unknown for the other events.

The skin redness started locally to the injection site and then spread to covering the entire upper arm.

                                                This patient started to feel lightheaded and had a dry mouth approximately 5 minutes after receiving her Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Over the next 20 to 25 minutes she progressed to having a sensation of tongue swelling, then difficulty swallowing, then chest tightness.  Her vital signs were stable throughout the observation period (blood pressure 144/74 and 150/70, pulse in the high 80s to low 90s, and oxygen saturation 96-98% on room air) and she was able to speak in full sentences without any respiratory distress.  Her lungs were clear and she had no stridor.  She never had any pruritic symptoms or rash/hives.  Because of the progressive nature of her symptoms, however, I felt she needed emergency room evaluation for observation.  We never administered any medication while at the vaccine clinic including epinephrine or Benadryl.  After approximately 25 minutes, 911 was called and she was transported by ambulance to the emergency room in stable condition.

Then vomiting.  Same symptoms I had with Covid in June. extremely tired for about a week. Called my son who works for Pfizer the next day (the 4th of February).  I want to reschedule my second vaccine for later in March because my Endocrinologist has put in a referral to have my antibodies tested.  Unfortunately I just had a tooth extracted and am on antibiotics, not sure if that will affect the antibody test or the second vaccine.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

                                                I received the first Pfizer vaccine t 2:45 PM on Thursday, 2/25/21. That night when I went to bed I felt chilled and woke up several times feeling chilled.  In the morning I felt sick with similar symptoms as when I had COVID-19 in March2020. I had head pains, inner ear pains, naseau, sore muscles, and extreme fatigue. I slept the whole day, waking up and going back to sleep. I dranka little, but just didn&#39;t feel like it. I ate a piece of toast with butter that evening and then felt naseauated.  I slept through the night and woke up feeling a little better the next day, but still feel tired and have some pains in my head.

                                                Severe abdominal pain. Started as diffuse cramps, surged to the most severe pain I have ever experienced. The pain extended below my left rib through the area above my hip to my navel and then to my entire abdominal area. As noted, it ranged from severe cramps (maybe only a 4 on a NPRS) to searing pain that I would mark as a 10 on a NPRS. This subsided and then surged about 5 times in the space of 30 minutes. At one point, I got very hot, but I didn&#39;t have a fever. The pain was so bad and I felt so horribly sick that I was about to ask my husband to take me to the ER. I had a Cesarean section in 1978 followed by two natural, unmedicated VBAC births in 1981 and 1985, and, although I know we &#34;can&#39;t remember pain,&#34; the pain I experienced last night was far, far worse than the pain of childbirth. After it went away, everything immediately went back to normal, as if it hadn&#39;t happened.

Taken by ambulance to medical center.  On route,  ambulance stopped and another team came in. I was given epinephrine, zofran, Benadryl, and maybe a steroid? Not sure.  When I arrived at hospital, t think I was given dexamethasone and famotidine.  I was barely awake but could speak. Could not hold anything. After several hours, they woke me up, I felt myself again, and I was discharged.  Following days I felt exhausted and dizzy, and had a headache. Took prednisone for five days.

                                                The patient initially presented (3/3/21) with headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, malaise. Patient related she was in her normal state of health and only started to feel poorly after she received her second COVID-19 vaccination three days earlier.  She interestingly related that after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination she had significant burning in her stomach that she noted but no other major symptoms and notably did not experience this severe burning in her stomach after the second dose. She denied any chest pain, current dyspnea, productive cough, sore throat, urinary symptoms, sick contacts.  She has no history of C. difficile, no recent antibiotics, no recent spoiled foods, no recent travel, no history of radiation.  She does have a history of GERD and has had gastritis with mild gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and undergone EGD negative for H. pylori infection.  She also has undergone colonoscopies with polyps that have been removed and reported as tubular adenomas.  As her hospitalization progressed, she was diagnosed with Severe Sepsis due to E. Coli bacteremia in setting of liver abscess, Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Transaminitis (which resolved). Patient was appropriately treated for these conditions. Also, her known uncontrolled diabetes was treated. Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake. Difficult to state definitively any relation to COVID-19 vaccination, though may have resulted from associated dehydration.

Medical history included diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago, obesity, asthma with bronchitis as a child, allergy to other medications, anaphylactic reaction to sulfas twenty years ago (also reported as 50 years ago), muscle hurt/sore arm usually when she got a flu vaccine (unspecified) once a year, allergies to makeup and clothes (diagnosed at least 50 years ago), heart beats fast, low thyroid and borderline high cholesterol.

The patient did not receive any other vaccinations on the same day or within 4 weeks of the vaccine. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) as pre-medication since she had allergic reactions to some things and would get this before the flu shot; as well as salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA) for runny nose and coughing. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 28Feb2021, and &#34;they&#34; wanted to give her diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) after the vaccine but could not since she was driving. After the vaccination, the patient was not feeling well for 2 days (as of an unspecified date) and thought she was getting better. On 28Feb2021, the patient experienced anxiety. She was more anxious when &#34;that stuff&#34; appeared on the news on day 4 and 5 after the vaccine. She took a small dose of clonazepam 0.5 mg, dividing the pill in 4 pieces as she never took the whole thing. She took it when she got extremely anxious and tried not to take it because it can be habit forming. She may take it 3 times a week or in the middle of the night. It helped a little bit, but she still felt panicky and upset. She woke up feeling anxious. She did not normally take these medications. The patient reported that she experienced headache (constantly several times a week) and left arm sore at injection site, itchiness/ itching all over body (not constant but still happening) from 28Feb2021. On Mar2021 (day 4), the patient experienced dizziness (comes and goes and was not constant like it was), was very exhausted, nausea (tapered off after 2 weeks), diarrhea, some cramping in stomach, brain fog (still struggling and forgets to take her insulin, not as bad as when she first noticed), body aches. At first, the body aches were a pain in the left knee and left elbow and then moved to various joints and muscles. The left knee and elbow pain persisted without ever going away, but also moved to different areas. The calf muscle in left leg pain is also constant. The patient experienced pain in the joints and stinging pain in left leg (below knee down to ankle) from 04Mar2021, runny nose (tapered off) from 07Mar2021, and on an unspecified date muscle pain, back pain, fever, neck pain, pain in left arm. On Mar2021 (two weeks after vaccination), the patient had a red circle around injection site not all the way filled in, but rim around where she got shot. On Mar2021 (3 weeks after vaccination), the patient experienced a weak feeling in arms and legs and other times when she stood up her body felt heavy (persistent but not every day).

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at left arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included low sodium, Covid-19 in Nov2020 (She had felt sick for a week and on 13Nov2020 she went to the ER and they did blood tests and she could not eat or drink for 3 days. She stated that she had 4 different IV fluids going and one of them was sodium and the other was for nausea), blood did not clot properly, broke her back. There were no concomitant medications.The patient had a unique reaction after receiving the Covid-19mRNA Vaccine. She clarified that she never had a reaction to a shot before. She received the vaccine on 31Dec2020 and was fine for the first 20 hours. She said that the next morning on 01Jan2021 at 0600 she woke up cold  and could not get warm. She said that she spent the next 24 hours to where she kept adding clothes and blankets to keep warm. She stated that she was freezing and the she felt like the interior of her body was freezing even down to her toes felt cold. She also had injection site pain and the arm felt heavy and stated that the pain extended from her shoulder down to her elbow. She stated that the injection site pain was kind of delayed. She had aches and pains. She said that some of the pain went from the injection shoulder and spread to the middle of her spine. She had nausea and total loss of appetite and could not even eat. Her aches and pains after the vaccine were similar aches like she had with the Covid. She said that she had a terrible headache when she had Covid though. She stated that after the 24 hours of receiving the vaccine she had a little headache, but she took a migraine pill for it. She said that she was able to shed clothes, but she could not take a shower, but within 24-36 hours she was back to normal like it all never happened. She said that was when she figured out it was like her hemorrhaging with one of her childbirths. She explained that she had 3 children and hemorrhaged with each of her child births and was going into shock with one of them and felt this freezing sensation due to blood loss. She thought that her reaction to the vaccine was so bad that she was either not making blood or there was an interference. There was some kind of weird interruption. She said that her blood clots break down from minutes to hours after her child birth or with dental procedures. She had a PAI-1 deficiency or Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 deficiency. She said that there was also something deeper that her doctors had not figured out yet too. She said that her blood did not clot properly. She said that she did not bruise or anything, but she was not allowed to have internal surgery without a transfusion. She said that her doctor&#39;s started to figure this all out after she broke her back before. She went to a hematologist and had her counts checked regularly. She said that she was being studied by 127 different clinics. She gained 10lbs, but she was very physically active. This was her first dose of teh vaccine. She said that her doctors told her that she needs to be under 48 hours of observation if she gets the second vaccine. Her primary care physician recommended that she did not take another mRNA vaccine. She said that she was taking their advice and canceled her second dose appointment. She said that when she had Covid-19 they did a Chest x-ray on 13Nov2020 and she had low sodium. She said that they gave her tramadol at the hospital for her headache, but she had already taken 3 migraine pills that day. She had already had her flu shot and read somewhere on a website, that mRNA vaccines might cause unstable anticoagulation. She wondered if it could be possible that Covid-19 antibodies interfered with her injection? The outcome of events was unknown.

Right after the steroid shot, I started reactions---Severe headache, chills, nausea, cough, upper chest pain, severe weakness, blood pressure up and down.  Went to family doctor 1/22 and covid shot in office showed negative.  Worse on 1/24/21 and went to ED.  They did a chest x-ray, CTA chest, lots of bloodwork and covid test that took 2 hours to receive results.  All was negative except the D-dimer test.  Thye thought it might be a result of the 2 injections within days of each other.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 at a single dose in the hospital for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety, seizures, and high cholesterol. She passed out last summer and they put her in the hospital from 31Aug2020 and ran all kinds of tests. In the end, they said she only had a few PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) and she doesn&#39;t need to see the doctor for a year. Mentioned she also has chronic bronchitis and this is related to having low platelet count and low immunity. All of these events predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin for high cholesterol, clonazepam for seizures, escitalopram for anxiety, levothyroxine sodium for thyroid, and mirtazapine for sleep; all were ongoing. Stated that she had something weird happen after her injection about four hours after the shot. She received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 in the right arm. About three or four hours later on 13Jan2021, she was getting ready for bed and when she sat down and leaned over she had a god awful burning in her chest and nausea. She was going to take baking soda but when she sat up she had horrible pressure and pain in her chest and felt woozy so she sat on the floor and then the pain started to radiate through her arm and into her neck. The horrible pain and pressure in her chest felt like something was sitting on her chest and the bad pain in her chest was going into her arm and a little into her neck. She laid real still on the floor, and did a lot of praying, and then 20 minutes later it totally stopped. She got up slowly and finished getting ready for bed and was fine. She was just hoping they will still let her get the second shot. The whole event only lasted 20 minutes and when it was over it was completely gone. She did tell her husband when he came home. She was alone when this happened. The patient wanted to know if she can receive second dose of vaccine. She stated it almost felt like a heart attack. She was planning to get the second dose on 03Feb2021. Wanted to know if her effect will preclude her from getting the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.

                                                angina; angina; Fever; Chills; Cough; Sore throat; runny nose; Nausea; Diarrhea; Headache; arm heavy; muscle aches and heaviness; muscle aches and heaviness; she just woke up feeling sick; fevers may come like a hot flash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (HCP) (patient). A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose, in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia diagnosed years ago, angina (some stents). There were no concomitant medications. On Jan2021, the patient experienced angina, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, nausea, diarrhea, headache, arm heavy, muscle aches and heaviness, and she just woke up feeling sick. The patient experienced multiple AEs after 1st dose of vaccine (received on 23Jan2021). The patient experienced angina later last week. Clinical course: The patient has misplaced card, states her second appointment for the second dose is this Saturday. Caller stated she started having these experiences the day after she was vaccinated with her first dose, received first dose of 23Jan2021. She had fevers, chills, cough- not an aggressive cough, a funny kind of sore throat- like something wrapped around her throat like the muscles of her throat, no congestion but does have a runny nose, states she has some nausea, no vomiting but feeling like she needed to vomit and diarrhea, and headache. The symptoms started about the third day after the vaccine, started with the fevers, stated the fevers may come like a hot flash, lasts seconds even, states you know it is a fever because your bones get hot. These symptom&#39;s did not attack her body at one time. Her whole arm stayed heavy, the whole arm not just the injection site, for almost 10 whole days. She previously had fibromyalgia and thought maybe that made the symptoms worse. She had muscle aches and feeling heavy. Her symptoms were spread out over time, no two were at the same time, sore throat was one of the last things. Diarrhea was ongoing, not a runny diarrhea but it was enough to empty stomach and was soft. She was a medic in the military, worked as a Nurse, clarifies she was an LPN and took all the underlying courses to be a PA. One of the issues she found, she thought it may be deadly, as a prior healthcare person and in tune to her body, the people who are in the nursing homes may not be mobile, states so one of the things she felt was just feeling really really sick, that she couldn&#39;t put a pin point on it, states she just woke up feeling sick, states she had the urge to get out of bed and got up and after she got up the feeling left her, states a person in the nursing home may just feel really bad and cannot get up, thinks a protocol should be that the people that are immobile should be required to move or if they can&#39;t get up they need to move their muscles, people with these symptoms need to get up and get moving. She also has history of angina and a stent, has not had angina in a while and had 3 days where she thought she may need to go talk to her doctor. It was on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week. States one of her friends, 92 years old, said she got high after the vaccine and didn&#39;t want to talk to anybody, states it was her first dose, she was kind of leery about the 2nd shot, feels like this was kind of aggressive. She had both doses and had no symptoms, but 92-year-old female had no symptoms right away, other than normal body aches and pains, but the next day was high as a kite. Her son has heart disease and she advised him not to take it right now. They were losing a lot of people to the vaccine in nursing homes, no further information provided. This could be affecting good hearts more than damaged hearts, read that this virus likes to work in parts of the body that are already damaged. The outcome of event diarrhea was not recovered, outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a causal association between the reported angina and BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. Note however, that the patient has underlying angina with some stents that may also have contributed to the event. Case will be re-assess once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39; medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced vomiting and diarrhea. Mostly diarrhea. The vomiting started 05Mar2021 in the middle of the night. She was vomiting so much she went to the Emergency room by ambulance. They kept her in the hospital for a couple of days, but she did not have diarrhea at this time. It was like three days later that she suddenly became violently ill. At the time she did not tie it to the vaccine administration, she thought she had food poisoning or something. She then had severe diarrhea. She cannot recall the exact onset date of when the diarrhea began. She can&#39;t get the dates together because she knows she became very sick. Patient recalls that when she got out of the hospital, she was having stomach pains. The stomach pains were feeling more severe on 18Mar2021. On 19Mar2021, she went to a check up with her gynecologist for an annual check up and did tell her gynecologist about the stomach pain and having a lot of stomach issues, but the doctor had no idea about it, she&#39;s a gynecologist. The patient&#39;s gastroenterologist thought maybe she had diverticulitis not related to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and on 27Mar2021, they started her on Cipro and Flagyl, but the diarrhea just kept getting worse even with the meds and its just been getting worse and worse and worse. Cipro and Flagyl were stopped after 5 days because her gastroenterologist told her that maybe all of her flora was cleared out, and the flora was causing the diarrhea. No one knows what was causing her diarrhea.  Oddly enough, she was feeling a little better today. She feels like she doesn&#39;t have diarrhea today, but she doesn&#39;t know because sometimes she has diarrhea for a couple of hours and then she feels just fine for a couple of hours. She also has brain fog. She was feeling like she could not think straight. She confirmed she does not have this feeling today. It got really bad after the second shot. The brain fog started between the time of first and second shot, when she had the diarrhea. It was like a week to ten days after the first shot, but she does not know exactly when brain fog started. It comes and goes, doesn&#39;t have it right now, and didn&#39;t have it yesterday. She stated that the brain fog seems to have gone away about 5 days ago. She had all these blood tests and cat scan and they all came back negative that she is in perfect health. She has no other issue except this constant diarrhea. Caller states she doesn&#39;t have any issues with any of her abdominal organs, her gall bladder and intestines are all fine. She has lost 5 pounds explaining that a month ago she weighed 136 pounds and now she weighs 130 pounds. The diarrhea is without any known medical known ideology and is very debilitating because she has lost a lot of weight. The outcome of events was reported as &#34;unknown&#34;.  Follow-up attempts are completed. The following information on the batch number has been requested.

                                                Approximately 39 hours after receiving the shot, I experienced severe diarrhea.  It continued for four hours.  Upon waking in the morning the symptoms had ceased and I felt well.  While I have Ulcerative Colitis, I do not believe this event was related to it.  It was not food related.  Also, as I have had a C.diff problem in the past and am taking Vancomycin daily, it did not appear to be related to that.

A 73-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 10Jan2021 and didn&#39;t have a reaction, but had a slight pain in her arm on 10Jan2021. Her sore arm started on 11Jan2021. There was a sore spot and when she would pick up her arm it was sore and achy. No pain, but sore and achy. It lasted for a day or two. She didn&#39;t have any symptoms until Saturday the 16Jan2021, this past Saturday she thought she was dying. She had chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and had a headache. She thought she was losing her mind. The headache just stopped today. She had the chills that would not stop and she thinks she broke the sweat on Sunday (17Jan2021). She had a little nausea and couldn&#39;t eat anything on 16Jan2021. She had a terrible headache, which just stopped about 2 hours ago. She stated she must have to take 10 Tylenol over the course of time, every 4 hours. On Saturday 16Jan2021 she was just laying on the floor in pain. She was not even eating, just drinking water. All of her symptoms stopped this morning around 5 AM (18Jan2021). She had a big sweat. She is unsure if she had a fever because she does not have a thermometer. She is unsure if she has recovered completely from these symptoms. She feels weak, and is still weak (on Jan2021). She cannot go out or get dressed or shower. She is not strong enough. She is just sitting up now, no longer laying in bed. She couldn&#39;t walk (on Jan2021) and was afraid she was going to faint on 16Jan2021. She can walk a little bit now and feels a little bit better. She has been out of it for three days, She hasn&#39;t felt good. She asked if side effects can appear 6 days later? Is this normal to have a reaction 1 week after getting it? She asked are the side effects worse after the second dose? She asked is this Covid or side effects, what are the COVID symptoms? She asked should she take the second one if she had these side effects? Caller clarifies this is the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Whoever vaccinated her did not give her the paper about it afterwards. Her neighbor brought it to her cause they went together. She did not realize she could experience these things. She did not expect them a week after getting the vaccine. She thought she had COVID. She asks, &#34;do you think I have COVID?&#34; She is just now getting better and it has been 3 days of experiencing these symptoms. Should she get the second vaccine? She is trying to do the right thing. Event outcome of chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and headache was recovered on 18Jan2021, for was going to faint and couldn&#39;t walk was recovering, for weak was not recovered, while for others was unknown.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fever, being ill (deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks) and bug bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient is the type of person that takes a lot for her to take medications. She is allergic to a lot of things; she always has crazy reactions. She can&#39;t take morphine. It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn&#39;t think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn&#39;t breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can&#39;t describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn&#39;t drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn&#39;t take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn&#39;t like it. It wasn&#39;t like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, &#34;what is this Parkinson&#39;s?&#34;. She doesn&#39;t even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn&#39;t debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it&#39;s like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can&#39;t even think of what that area is, but it&#39;s the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don&#39;t atrophy or won&#39;t pull. She hasn&#39;t told anybody about it. She doesn&#39;t like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn&#39;t figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her &#34;brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep.&#34; On Monday she experienced, &#34;horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band.&#34; Stated that it wasn&#39;t a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of gas (flatulence), muscles became tight/contort, minor nausea, horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band and shingles. The outcome of the event &#39;the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot&#39; was not recovered while of the rest of the events was unknown.

The injection site is sore but no rash; right arm seems to have &#34;phantom pain&#34; as well ( I experienced this with Shingles shot in December 2020 too).

                                                On Feb. 12th at 2PM symptoms started with lower back pain, pain in abdomen and stomach, cramping, chills, ear ache, pain level 8.  Felt sick all over, like having the flu and then whole body ached, not just GI track.  Left arm injection site was red, sore to touch, swollen (slightly).  Doctor couldn&#39;t get vaccination needle into arm muscle the first time and so had to try a second time.   Intense cramping of GI track started up again 8:45AM on Feb. 13th.   By 4PM Feb. 15th fever 102F, chills, felt freezing cold and had to wrap myself in a heating blanket.  Pain level 10, especially in pancreas. Fever broke around 2:30AM Feb. 16th and later when I was up at 8AM I felt very weak, faint, pancreas ached.  Pancreatic pain lasted another 3 days.  Pancreatic pain stayed around level 5.  On Feb. 17th took ibuprophen.  Pain level reduced to 1.   This was the only time that I took pain medication between Feb. 10th and 17th, because I am conservative about using Ibuprophen, Tylenol, and have a high threshold for pain.

                                                Tingling of fingers and numbness of left cheek.  Did not get any worse after 30 minutes. Extremely tired and sore arm that day.  Day 2 - tired easily, no stamina.  Dizzy and nauseous after showering at3:30 pm.  By 10:30, both hands were red and itched.  Sometime in the night woke with a very sharp, painful headache.  Did not last.  No real problem again until Saturday.  Nausea at 11:20 am.  Sunday I sat all day doing taxes - no symptoms noted.  Monday after walking - rapid heart rate and very tired after what is normal activity.  By 4:30 I was tingling all over my body.  Tuesday night my ankles are swollen for the first time in years.  Only happened that nigh.  Wednesday morning, the tingling is very strong in my calves. and I had a sharp pain in the area of my Achilles tendon.  I believe that the vaccine has exacerbated the neuropathy (undiagnosed) of the bottom of my feet.  Today I am reporting because I fell for no reason getting out of a chair, and the tingling is in my legs, arms, shoulders.  I had not heard until today that the vaccine could affect the nervous system.  The effects are the worst they have been and it has been one week since I had the vaccine.  Should I get the second shot?  Due March 11,2021.

A 73-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP7533), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 07Apr2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included breast cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2 on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 73-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced Sore arm and feeling blah. Clinical course was as follows: She spent 50 years in neurology and neuroscience, she was a crazy RN that did neurology right out of school, she was recommended for that specialty. She is not sure if she had a reaction to the vaccine or if it is just her. Her 2nd dose was last Wednesday, 07Apr2021. She had a sore arm and felt blah. Just like after the 1st shot. On Saturday night (10Apr2021) at 0200, she was awakened with chills, cold sweat, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. She was sick as a dog for 2 days and didn&#39;t eat or drink much of anything. She went to the doctor who sent her to an infusion center. She is down to 5&#39; 2&#34; and weighed too much. She has not been able to lose weight for a couple years. She gained 40 pounds when she turned 50 years old. After the shot, she had a sore arm and felt blah like she did after the first dose, but she thought everyone felt that way. She missed a day of gym class because of her really sore arm. This got better like after a flu shot, it was nothing. This time she had a really sore arm and felt blah after the shot but then on Saturday morning this whole thing started happening. She woke up very restless, was all sweaty, cold, dizzy and was too miserable to try and take her blood pressure. Her blood pressure tends to run low. Her symptoms of the sore arm resolved at 06:00 Saturday (08Apr2021). She had nausea and vomiting and couldn&#39;t eat or drink. That lasted through Monday morning. She had some back pain with this, but she has back pain normally as she is a little old lady. She had a scheduled Oncology appointment Monday, as did her husband. She experienced orthostatic dizziness. She woke up plain dizzy. Her doctor gave her a liter of fluids and it helped her. This was something that needed to be addressed. It was serious. It was all serious. She had nothing left to vomit. She is an old lady with Breast Cancer. Her creatinine level of 1.10 which dropped her GFR of 52, she calculated the GFR using a computer program. This is what lead to the doctor giving her a liter of fluid. She had an appointment scheduled and her doctor sent her to the infusion centers for a liter of D5NS. She was sent home afterwards and encouraged to drink fluids. She also had a CBC and chemistry panel with her blood work. She was worried because her skin was tenting badly, and she couldn&#39;t keep anything down. She was probably dehydrated. Her blood pressure at the doctor&#39;s office was 82/50. She didn&#39;t care that her skin was tenting. She has been drinking a lot of fluids as advised after her liter of fluids at the infusion center. She is interested in researching the MRNA process because it is used it in other things. The way the vaccine was developed, it should have dissipated after 48 hours. She likes to research everything. She and her husband experienced a year from Hell starting in August of last year. All events are considered serious. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatinine: 1.10 and blood pressure measurement: 82/50 on 12Apr2021, blood test, full blood count and investigation with unknown results and glomerular filtration rate: 52 on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events chills and cold sweat was recovered on 12Apr2021, skin tenting and orthostatic dizziness was recovered on 13Apr2021, vomiting and nausea was recovered on 14Apr2021, pain in arm was recovered on 10Apr2021, feeling abnormal was recovered on an unspecified date, while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a temporal association and the known drug safety profile, the reported events are considered possibly related to BNT162B2.

                                                Pain (level 4 of 10) starting in right rear of neck, becoming more intense on 01/19/21. By evening head movement was very difficult, I could not sleep in bed that night. I slept on the couch sitting up trying to immobilize head. During the night pain spread into the base of my skull. I applied heat to help relieve the pain and tightness. On 01/20/21 the pain (6 of 10) spread into the left side of neck and skull, it became difficult to eat, swallow and to get up from couch. I tried to sit motionless most of the day. On 01/21/21 the pain (6 of !0) moved down into my left rear shoulder, I continued to apply heat and immobilize sitting on couch, eating and swallowing still difficult. On 01/22/21 pain in neck and base of Additional information for Item 18:  skull subside to level 5, movement of head still difficult, able to to get up and move slowly. Could not lift head to drink, still needed to use straw. Slept on couch again this night. On 01/23/21 pain still subsiding to level 4, head movement still difficult, still needed straw to drink, slept on couch again. On 01/24/21 pain continuing to subside to level 3, head movement still difficult, still needed straw to drink, slept on couch again. On 01/25/21 conditions unchanged. On 1/26/21 pain subsided to level 2, head movement stiff but not difficult, swallowing less difficult but still need straw to drink. Slept in bed for first time since 01/19/21. On 01/27/21 pain continued to subside to level 1, head movement improved but still limited, still need straw to drink, able to move around more freely but still not normal. Improvement is slow but I hope to be back to normal in a few days. I am concerned that my second vaccination may cause a more severe reaction, please have someone call or contact me so I can discuss this issue.

                                                Severe urgent diarrhea; Feels like she might be getting a little fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 74-year-old female patient  received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration to right deltoid (shoulder) on 15Jan2021 at around 10:30-10:40 AM at a single dose  for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, problems with her colon, back surgery, and flashes.  Concomitant medications included ibuprofen given on unspecified date for back surgery, and unspecified hormones, vitamins, and laxatives.  The patient previously received the flu vaccine on unspecified date and experienced like she got the flu and relapse of her chronic fatigue syndrome. She also received hepatitis C vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, pneumonia vaccine, and shingles vaccine; all on unspecified dates. The patient had not received prior vaccinations within four weeks. On 15Jan2021, the patient experienced severe urgent diarrhea and felt like she might be getting a little fever. It was further described as: Patient had an odd reaction within maybe 30 minutes to 1 hour after that dose was administered of severe urgent diarrhea. Patient mentioned she felt like she might be getting a little fever; but she was not sure and did not have a thermometer to check that. Severe urgent diarrhea: She mentioned she had not seen that side effect posted anywhere for the vaccine so she felt it was an odd reaction; although she did see that it was a side effect of the virus, so maybe it was not that odd of a reaction for the vaccine now that she thought about it. She described this event as completely crazy, the urgency to go to the bathroom, she almost did not make it home to the bathroom. It just hit her like she has never experienced before. It cleaned out her colon really well. She also felt like she might be getting a little fever but mentioned that at her age she gets hormone flashes so it could be that; and was humid at the time of report and thought so it could just be from that. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information regarding Batch/ Lot number has been requested.

At 8:30 PM I went to bed because I didn&#39;t feel good, I laid in bed for a few minutes and then jumped up because I began to violently vomit. After I vomited I felt weak, I was sitting with my back against the wall my husband came to check on me.  He walked away and when he came back I was unresponsive, laying on the floor and he said my eyes rolled in the back in of head. He called 911. I was unresponsive for about a 1-2 minutes. EMS arrived, by the time they had arrived I had crawled into bed, and they took my vitals and they were fine, they asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital but I declined as I was afraid to go. I went to sleep. The next day I felt weak and tired, I had a burning feeling in my stomach, I took some TUMS, I didn&#39;t much that day. I rested most of the next day. Yesterday I felt a little better and today I am fine. I have a doctor&#39;s appointment 2/26/2021 at 2PM to see the ARNP at my doctor&#39;s office.

                                                I became dizzy and then nauseous, increasingly dizzy.  When I told  my husband that I was getting up to go to the restroom, perhaps to throw up, I found that I couldn&#39;t walk or make my arms and legs move in a controlled way.  He helped me to a  resting place on the floor. I asked him to call 911.  I thought that I was having a stroke.  Emergency personnel treated it as  a pot overdose, because I told them that I had a bite of a pot brownie a couple of hours earlier.  It was really a little piece and I doubt that it would be enough to have these results.  I developed spasms throughout my body. My hands were unable to do tasks.  I did throw up once at the hospital.  I think that the pot issue was parallel but not necessarily the cause.  I received IVs.  One med was for nausea, Not sure what all.  I went home about 1 AM after dizziness had lessened and spasms had stopped. Today I am  a  wobbly and  weak, but no spasms.  And I can walk and control my arms.

A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 15:30 in left arm at single dose as Covid vaccine, etanercept (ENBREL, 50 mL/mg, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen, lot number: 1119808, expiry date: Apr2023) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 DF weekly to the stomach area for rheumatoid arthritis, methylprednisolone (MEDROL, tablet) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 3 mg, daily (1.5 tablets daily for total of 3 mg) for rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate (tablets) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, weekly (2.5 mg tablets, 20 mg total) for rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity) and took levothyroxine, rheumatoid arthritis. She had had regular blood work for rheumatoid arthritis and that was normal for her, they were relatively normal and her ESR was down. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included levothyroxine daily for endocrine abnormalities. It was a daily thing for the body and the body couldn&#39;t live without it if it did not have it. The patient previously took the Shingrix vaccine and it was terrible for her and put her into a rheumatoid arthritis flare and was taking prednisone and was getting better and the wap she was in a rheumatoid flare. No prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient was taking 3 medicines for rheumatoid arthritis that might or might not affect the RNA in the vaccine. She wondered if etanercept would have an effect on the vaccine since it was shipped on ice overnight. She did not think they would affect anything. Nobody has said anything about the medications and she just wanted to get the vaccine. Her doctor knows nothing about the interactions and none of them seem to know if it is normal to have these symptoms 4 days after getting the vaccine. She felt great the first 2 days after getting the vaccine and then began to feel a little bad. She was having some symptoms maybe 4 days on 01Feb2021 after receiving the Covid vaccine and wanted to know if that was sort of normal. It was unusual for her, but she had nauseous, not dizziness, but unsteadiness, tired, also headaches and generally didn&#39;t feel well. She felt like she might have the stomach flu, but had not had that in so many years. She also felt weak. No temperature. Gentle muscle ache. On 01Feb2021 Monday night she had the nausea. On 02Feb2021 Tuesday, she had it again, and had it again today and almost threw up last night. Just the malaise or tiredness had gotten worse. She could not tell the difference between the rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain and muscle pain and this with the vaccine. She was having a few little odd pains, but nothing that she hadn&#39;t had before. It was more of a soft pain, they made her feel weak and then they went away. It was more muscle than joint. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was supposed to get a second dose but felt she shouldn&#39;t, it might put her back into a rheumatoid flare. She was just getting over it and afraid to go through that with the Covid vaccine also. The action taken in response to the events for etanercept, methylprednisolone and methotrexate was dose not changed. The outcome of events nausea, unsteadiness, tired (tired was reported as worsened), generally does not feel well, feels like the stomach flu, weak, few little odd pains; soft pain, joint pain was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

                                                Chills; Irritation in throat; Swelling of tongue; Unable to swallow solids; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 74-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6202), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 25Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported; She takes other unspecified medications, though declined to provide details. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (Lot EM9809) on 04Feb2021 as first single dose for covid-19 immunization and hydrochlorothiazide and experienced anaphylactic reaction on an unspecified date (reported as years ago).   The patient experienced the following medically significant events:  irritation in throat on 27Feb2021 with outcome of recovered; swelling of tongue on 27Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered; unable to swallow solids on 27Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered; chills on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the reporting nurse received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. She received the first dose on 04Feb2021. She received the second dose on 25Feb2021. 48 hours after the second dose she developed a really sore throat way down in the back of her throat. Her tongue also started swelling. She took diphenhydramine (ASSURED) 50mg. Her tongue was swollen the next day and she was unable to swallow solids.  She went to a Covid clinic and was prescribed a diphenhydramine mouthwash. She was still unable to swallow. She has been taking diphenhydramine and Ibuprofen. It waxes and wanes.  She had to take diphenhydramine to go to sleep. She thinks it is a reaction to the vaccine. She read about the ingredients and is not allergic to anything in the vaccine. She clarified that she did not have a sore throat. Her throat was irritated. It felt like pop rocks in the back of her throat. She saw a provider on 01Mar2021. She thinks her histamine level is too high. She also had chills last night, date unspecified. She had them once since 27Feb2021 and again last night. She was unable to confirm if they are ongoing or resolved. She had to turn up her electric blanket to 8. She was not shaking but just had chills.  Years ago she had an anaphylactic reaction to hydrochlorothiazide. This felt similar to that. She was walking around fine and then started having swelling. She did not have difficulty breathing. She hoped it was not anaphylaxis. The diphenhydramine mouthwash was a compound of lidocaine, diphenhydramine and Maalox. The ratio was 1:1:1. The diphenhydramine 50 mg was a liquid children&#39;s allergy relief medication. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as aforementioned. Relatedness of drug to reaction for irritation in throat, swelling of tongue, unable to swallow solids and chills per primary source reporter  of assessment was reported as related. The outcome of irritation in throat was recovered on 28Feb2021; the outcome of swelling of tongue  and unable to swallow solids was not recovered; the outcome of chills was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of  irritation in throat, swelling of tongue, unable to swallow solids  due to temporal relationship and the known product safety profile.  The clinical presentation is suggestive of a severe allergic reaction, involving the tongue and throat.  There is limited information provided in this report.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

A 74-years-old female patient received BNT162B2, dose 2, via intramuscular, administered in right arm on 16Mar2021 10:00 AM (Lot Number: EN6204; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility type was hospital. Medical history included eczema from 2017, she had eczema all over her back and arms and had mild allergies to mold and juniper. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 74-year-old on 23Feb2021 at 10:00AM (lot number: EN6198, Expiry: Jun2021) intramuscular injection in left arm and experienced pain at injection site and couldn&#39;t sleep. The patient also took Prolia shots for arthritis. The patient experienced headache, nausea, pain at injection site and hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold on 16Mar2021, passed out, weakness and disorientation when walking on 17Mar2021, a little tired on 18Mar2021. The clinical course included: The patient was calling about the second vaccine that she got on 16Mar2021 (Tuesday). She was calling about the after effects. They were quite huge. She had a headache, nausea, weakness, and disorientation when walking. Stated she obviously had pain at the site of injection. Stated some of it was her own fault, and at first she felt fine. On the same day that she got her second dose of the covid vaccine, she had a glass of wine and was not too hungry. She ate a little that evening. The next morning she passed out. Clarified that she had two glasses of wine, not one. Caller&#39;s daughter was a doctor. Caller referd to her daughter as doctor daughter. Stated that she told her daughter about what happened. Her daughter told her it was because she was dehydrated. Her daughter told her that it was called vagus something or another. Her daughter was not there with the caller. Her daughter called it vagus something, she does not remember. Her daughter told her that it had to do with inflammation and her immune system. Caller stated she also has arthritis. Her daughter told her that she was stupid for drinking wine after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine and not eating a full meal. Whenever she passed out and fell, she did not hurt herself but it was a wake up call. She realized she was vulnerable. She was calling because she did not know why no one told her to drink a lot of water after receiving the vaccine. She got a Prolia shot in July and the nurses told her to drink a lot of water. She was asking why the nurses who gave her the covid vaccine are not saying that to people. Her daughter told her to call the doctors office about this, and she told her daughter that it was over with now, she&#39;s 95%, she was a little tired on 18Mar2021. She was unconscious for 15 seconds per her husband. Her husband was shouting her name, and she did not hear anything. She wanted to call and report that the nurses should tell people to drink water. One more thing, her daughter told her that the covid vaccine was slowly released. About 10 hours after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold. She got the vaccine about 10AM, and about 10PM at night is whenever her hand got cold. She had pain at the injection site where she had the first dose of the vaccine too. She had more pain at injection site after the second dose of the vaccine. It was not awful, but only if she pressed on it. Clarified that she gets Prolia shots twice a year for her arthritis. Luckily whenever she started to get dizzy, she braced her self, whenever she fell, she did not fall from an upright position. She was crouched over, and fell against trays that fell with her. Her doctor daughter told her that inflammation was because of her immune system. One other thing was that she has been stung in the past and had extreme reactions from yellow jackets in the 90&#39;s. She thought her immune system was sensitive. One other things related to her autoimmune from 3 years ago. She moved to a city in 2012. Everyone told her after 5 years she would develop allergies. In 2017, she had eczema all over her back and arms. It was not just like a topical thing where she scratched and itched, it was under her skin. She went to a dermatologist and he took a biopsy, but the results just said eczema. She went to an allergist, he finally found a space on her underarms where he could do a test. The test showed that she had mild allergies to mold and juniper. Juniper is a tree that they have there, she has one in her back yard. Her allergy was very mild. She tried everything, and in 4 months it went away. Now she just latherers her skin with coconut oil. Her diagnosis that this autoimmune issue was related her immune response from the yellow jacket reaction is a self diagnosis. A doctor had never told her this, this was coming from her own self. Clarified that she is calling about the second dose of the pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Headache: It was not a bad headache, it was more like pressure all across the top. Whenever she went to sleep, the headache started. She got the second dose of the covid vaccine on 16Mar2021. She had a little bit of a headache this morning. A cup of coffee with milk made it better. Nausea: It started whenever she did not want to eat dinner. She could tell her stomach was not right. The nausea and headache started together about 12 hours after her vaccine at 10:00 PM.

Second dose: pain at injection site: The pain only lasted for about 2-3 hours. It was now absolutely minimal. She would have to press on it to feel anything. Her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold: She got the second dose of the covid vaccine around 10:00 AM, and noticed her hand was cold about 5:00 PM., about 7-8 hours later. Whenever she went to bed, she was cold. She thought that it resolved by the next morning.

A 75-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1686), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 15:45 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Leighten Plantar Alopecia (hair follicle is an enemy), skin infection (infection in body most of the time, at least on skin), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, obesity, autoimmune disorder (diagnosed 8 months ago). She has lost some height, prior to taking the vaccine and she said it was related to age. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced feeling unwell on 10Jan2021; blood in urine on 10Jan2021 at 17:00; nausea at 10:00, chills at 11:00, almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office at 10:00, felt cold - all on 11Jan2021; getting really tired/fatigue on 14Jan2021 at 09:30; gets really sweaty on 13Jan2021 at 10:00; and dizziness on unknown date. The patient had the first shot on Friday (08Jan2021). On Sunday (10Jan2021), she started feeling bad. She was feeling good about getting it and had no reaction. She has an autoimmune disorder that made her a little afraid to take, but with all the indications, they said it would be much better for her to take it than to get the COVID virus. Sunday (10Jan2021), she does not feel good. So, she started having blood in urine. She thought she had a UTI and had not had one in 20 years. It felt like that is what she had and with the blood in urine. She just took Tylenol and waited until Monday morning because she does not like sitting in doctor&#39;s office. They gave her a cup to give sample and said she didn&#39;t need to see provider. They will have it checked and in the meantime call in a prescription. It kept getting worse and worse. She was about to passed out in the doctor&#39;s office on 11Jan2021, she got nauseous and almost threw up. She got in the car with her husband and he was trying to get her home. She got chills and got so cold and could not warm her body up. Her husband gave her Phenergan and it kind of knocked her out for a while to ease her nausea. She was thinking of going later today (14Jan2021), when she gets enough energy, to get a COVID test. She does not know if it will give false positive or not. She had chills and now she gets sweaty since 13Jan2021. She took her temperature and she did not have one. She just now got up. It is 10:00. She got up this morning (14Jan2021) and was really tired. She was not sweating this morning. Tiredness is kind of new, and when she talked to the nurse, she sort of felt like maybe it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine, but then she talked to her daughter and she said the symptoms she was having are usually symptoms that occur with second dose of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for people to have symptoms she was having. She wanted to know if she should have a COVID test. If she has had just one shot, would the test give a false positive coming from the COVID. They were asking if patient should take the second dose, and should she continue her UTI medication. Doctor&#39;s visit to give urine sample on 11Jan2021 (results: negative for UTI). She did not see a doctor though. They sent sample and prescribed a sulfa based medication for a UTI. She did start feeling a little better and stopped having blood in her urine. She plans to continue it because she does not like to stop taking an antibiotic. She did not have any clue that it was not a UTI until the nurse from her provider&#39;s office called to tell her results of urine sample was negative. Outcome of event getting really tired/fatigue was not recovered; events almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office, blood in urine, chills, and gets really sweaty was recovering; and unknown for other events.

Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I woke up feeling sick with headache and pain in abdomen, went to bathroom and sat down, I was burning up and perspiration was dripping down my body, i felt like i might throw up and that was the last though until I came to on the floor of our walk in shower.  It took me a while to orient myself and get up and sat down again on toilet still with pain in head and disoriented. next thing i know i am coming to wedged between the toilet tank and the vanity.  I managed to get back on the toilet and sat there wondering what was happening to me.  I could tell i was getting better so i just sat there a while longer until i though my legs would hold me so i could get back to the bed.  I laid in bed the rest of the night unable to sleep with headache and shivering with being cold even under my blankets. I stayed in bed Saturday then called the doctor first thing Monday morning. I got in to see her at 10:30 Monday morning.  She ordered a full blood panel and urinalysis and heart monitor for 48 hours.  The blood panel and urinalysis reports are all ok.  Have not received report yet from the heart monitor.  Doc said I cannot take the second shot.

                                                At 9:30 A.M. on 2/23, I noticed that I had a slight headache.  My left arm was, as I had expected, painful and red near the injection site.  As the day progressed, I became aware of more reactions: chills, body aches, increasing headache, arm pain, and changes in my temperature (I usually have a temperature of 97.6, but measured 96.6 and in the evening, 100.4).   I felt listless and nauseous by dinnertime.   By the morning of 2/24, nothing was improved, so I took 2 Tylenol, which I repeated 7 hours later and 7 hours after that.  By the morning of 2/25, I began feeling better and stopped the Tylenol.  My symptoms gradually continued to improve through 2/28.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.
