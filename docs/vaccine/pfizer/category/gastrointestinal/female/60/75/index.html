This 60-year-old female nurse (Patient) reported that received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation, Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune. Concomitant medications included Metoprolol at 12.5 mg for Atrial fibrillation and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN). No diabetes, no hypertension. None of the usual common diseases. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was &#39;weird&#39; sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday. What happened it looked like an encephalopathy but my head swelled, my face was all swollen, complete brain fog, fatigue and I couldn&#39;t talk. I was in so much pain in my head resulting in (incomplete sentence).&#34; Lab work included the only thing is the PCR swabbing. No blood test. Registered Nurse further stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know if that is important. But I will tell you and if it is you can send me the questions. I do have a history of Autoimmune. So my Physician thought that this was just like an enhancement of like my bodies reaction I have Chronic Lyme and I have lupus like my ANA has always been stressful. But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body&#39;s reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.&#34; Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I just wanted to let you know what happened and the intensity of what it was because normally I would expect a headache. But this was a &#39;go dated&#39;. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I guess the only question that I have is so do my work has this question and I was going to call my doctor tomorrow may be might know it better. I know that I have to take the second dose. But I understand the second round can be worse than the first. Is there anything that they are recommending that I can do may be prior to ease the reaction?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported clinical manifestations including swelling face and head swelled, which was suspected as encephalopathy by the reporting nurse, was probably related to the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), due to temporal relationship.  The subject&#39;s underlying Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune were likely the risk factors to the onset of the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Weakness, fatigue and increased fever continued thru the night and not able to sleep, very restless.  The next morning after I had more weakness and major flair up with my MS, where I fell several times and was not able to get myself off the floor.  Each time I fell it too approximately 20 minutes for me to get either in bed or a chair.  Still had fever of a 100-101 through out  the day, took ibuprofen to help, which it did for a short time but then fever was back.  About 7pm I took some Benadryl  and was finally able to fall asleep.  The next morning, no fever but very weak.  Went to health club to help with my legs.  This day was ok, weak but improved.  No falls

All the events (except for event bruise at injection site) were reported as seriousness as life threatening. Clinical course: the patient worked nightshift. Laid down that afternoon to take a nap and got up around 10:00. Around 05Jan2021 19:00 PM had sever leg cramps in both legs where her toes were curled out. Leg cramps after vaccine wouldn&#39;t go away and it was in both legs. Just wouldn&#39;t go away. Around 05Jan2021 21:00 PM it went away. The patient was dizzy, nauseous, and threw up twice on the night of 05Jan2021, and going into 06Jan2021. The patient went to the couch in the hotel room and started going deaf. She couldn&#39;t hear anything on 06Jan2021 around 09: 00 AM. Things started looking funny on 06Jan2021 around 09: 00 AM. Woke up at 09:35. Hour after that there was pain through her whole body and everything was hurting at 10:00 AM on 06Jan2021. The patient was tremoring at 10:00 AM on 06Jan2021. Couldn&#39;t reach the phone to dial 9-11. Thought she was going to die. Last until about noon and then started to go away. Doesn&#39;t know if it is safe to take the second vaccine. Doesn&#39;t know if these are thing that should have happened to her. She started to get real concerned. Went into hotel room and started feeling dizzy again. Stopped haring things. Funny feeling in her ears. Was seeing things, got dizzy, and everything got dark. Everything lasted until 12:00 PM on 06Jan2021. Everything was good now.

She felt fine. Her whole body was sore from the muscle spasming. The outcome of the event bruise at injection site was unknown, of the event leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out was recovered around 05Jan2021 21:00, the outcome of other remain events was recovered on 06Jan2021 12:00.  The reporter considered (method of assessment: Global Introspection) that all the events were related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: All the reported events were possibly related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship. However, it is worth noting that the 60-year-old female patient had car accidents history and had surgeries. All the events started when she worked nightshift, including leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out, nauseous, threw up twice, pain through whole body, tremoring and transient deafness. Patient did not get rest after vaccination may a risk factor to the onset of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021.

She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130.

She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then.

The patient&#39;s medical history was covid at the end of Apr/May2020 with shortness of breath, seasonal allergies and allergies to &#34;some anitbiotics.&#34; The concomitant medications was reported as none, received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced soreness at site, redness and swelling, fever, nausea, general feeling of unwell 3 days. Patient stated, &#34;I had covid at the end of April/May with shortness of breath. I thought I would have less reaction from the vaccine. I know someone who was out of work for a while week after the vaccine.&#34; States that she read that the 2nd dose is supposed to have worse side effects than the first. If she had bad side effects from the 1st dose, will the 2nd be worse? Also asking if the side effects are the immune system reacting or just an allergic reaction. Patient was anxious about getting her second COVID shot on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that she had all the side effects listed, for three days. Patient stated that she didn&#39;t mind the side effects at the time, she had fever, soreness at the injection site, nausea, and a general feeling of unwell, but Patient stated that she could not work like that. Patient stated that her question was, statistically she has read that the side effects from the second shot are supposed to be worse than the first shot, but she was wondering, if she had bad side effects from the first shot, will her side effects be worse after the second, or will they maybe be lessened because she already had bad side effects. Patient reported that she did fill out the VSafe significant because she had to work on the third day after her shot, which was Christmas Eve, and work, was so busy and she did not feel well. Patient stated that she does have two days scheduled off work after her next injection, but it is the third day that she was worried about because she does not want to work feeling like that. Patient stated that the arm soreness started that same day (21Dec2020). At first, Patient reported that the arm soreness resolved, but then she states that it is still a little sore to the touch. So Patient confirmed that it is ongoing but improved. Patient reportsed that the fever started the day after the injection, 22Dec2020 and it has resolved. Patient reported that the last day she recorded a fever was on 24Dec2020. Patient  stated that she woke up on 24Dec2020 and her temperature was normal, so she went to work and she did not feel so well at work, but they were so busy that she barely noticed, and then when the Patient  went home that night, she took her temperature and it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient reported that the nausea started on 22Dec2020, which was mild at times, but then she got to where she did not want to eat. Patient reported that the nausea has resolved but she was not entirely sure when it resolved because she had been so busy at work on 24Dec2020, and it was hard to tell what she was feeling because she was non-stop busy that day. Patient stated that she was nauseous for a full three days, and she remembered that she did not eat much on the 24th either. So Patient stated that her nausea may have resolved on the third day after her injection, but it is unknown to her what day exactly that it resolved. Patient was also experiencing the general feeling of unwell from 22Dec2020 for a few days, but stated that by 25Dec2020 she felt okay. Patient also included that her left arm was also swollen, like her whole upper arm was swollen after the injection in Dec2020. Patient stated that she also experienced redness, there was a like a red mark that was further down her arm than the injection site in Dec2020. The outcome of soreness at site was recovering.  Patient confirmed that both the swelling and redness had resolved in Dec2020.The outcome of fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The outcome of general feeling of unwell and nausea was recovered on 25Dec2020.

This 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686), via intramuscular, on 06Jan2021 (at 14:30) at single dose at left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Age at vaccination is 61-year-old.  Historical vaccine included Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine (intramuscular, at single dose) on 15Dec2020 for immunization; and Shingles vaccine (intramuscular, at single dose) on 15Dec2020 for varicella immunization. Relevant medical history included usual tenderness. No relevant concomitant medications were provided.  On 07Jan2021, she woke up at 2:00 in the morning, she had a high temperature, she was chilled, she had a severe headache, nausea, fatigue, and body aches. She got up and took ibuprofen (ADVIL). She was basically in bed, she had to cancel all her appointments in the morning, she just laid in bed and the following afternoon her fever broke at about 4:30 in the afternoon then she just had a low grade temperature and a dull headache, nausea through the next day, Friday the 08Jan2021. She still has a very dull headache and just not right, kind of like a flu bug. She had no fever; she had not had any fever after Friday afternoon or Saturday. Fever started at 2 in the morning 07Jan2021 and she experienced the chills until after fever broke. Fever went above 102 degrees. She still had a little of the nausea, she just didn&#39;t feel like eating. She still had the dull headache. The nausea and headache have improved when compared to how it was on the 07Jan2021. She was back to work now she just has a dull frontal headache. The reporting nurse assessed all the events, except of &#39;Doesn&#39;t feel like eating&#39;, serious for disability. She stated she may have had usual tenderness but nothing like this. The patient had recovered from the event fever on 08Jan2021 and from the event &#39;chills/chilled&#39; on 07Jan2021; the patient was recovering from &#39;nausea&#39; and &#39;severe Headache/Dull headache/Frontal headache&#39;, while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  It is worth noting that patient had other vaccines not far ago, including Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine and Shingles vaccine on 15Dec2020 for immunization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                After waiting 15 mins  I developed a dry throat and walked to my car (8-10 mins later). Began to develop difficulty swallowing by the time I reached my car.  Waited a few minutes and it did not abate and continued worsen,. Went to hospital&#39;s ER and was seen by Dr. At that time, my voice had become coarse and gravely. Was given oral steroid and a Benadryl.  Symptoms lessened a bit and were gone after about 2 hours. While at first I thought my breathing wasn&#39;t affected, after symptoms cleared, I realized that my breathing was easier. Symptoms did not reoccur.

Had I been driving, this would likely have caused an accident.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this feeling.  There were 2 or 3 other episodes of feeling like I was falling.  2 of this happened while lying down.  They were sudden sensations that made me gasp.  Spent most of 1 week in bed with fatigue, vertigo, and 2 times vomiting.  Vomiting occurred day 2 post vaccine.  Fatigue was continuous for about a week.  At day 16 now, certain movements still illicit vertigo.  All vertigo symptoms have lasted under 1 minute. However, some have been back to back, such as after repositioning multiple times in bed.  Ears have felt very full for almost 2 weeks.  Certain head positions or movements, still illicit sensations of the room moving.  There was no specific headache, but my head did not feel good for about 2 weeks.  There was no fever, but there was chilling one night, a couple of days after the vaccine.  I don&#39;t know if getting 2nd vaccine is wise.

                                                61 yo F with history of bilateral lung transplant 6/23/17 presented to ED on 2/4/21 with chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath, nausea and diarrhea for past week since receiving since receiving COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 1/28/21. Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3302, NDC number/expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm (also reported as upper left arm) on 13Jan2021 at 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; the patient was a healthcare worker and was trying to protect herself. The vaccination facility type was reported as a drive thru site. Relevant medical history included previous neurological problems, which included history of underlying migraine with paresthesia/chronic paresthesia (ongoing) and tinnitus. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no other vaccine received on the same day of the Pfizer suspect or 4 weeks prior. She never had any problems with vaccines in the past. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was reported as none. Initially, the patient was asking if there were any reports of paresthesia, serious neurologic adverse events, tinnitus, hearing loss, or abdominal tightness in the studies for the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccine. After the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021, she experienced an exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus. She also reported experiencing some abdominal tightness on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient reported she was scheduled for her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, but had concerns because she was still experiencing tinnitus and it was &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss&#34; on an unspecified date. The patient further reported that she was due for the next dose the following day at the time of the report (03Feb2021). She had previous neurological problems and did not know if this did exacerbate things or not. She had migraines, tinnitus, and paresthesia and was wondering how many other patients with neurological problems reported this and was this a common side effect or adverse event reported. One doctor told her not to get the second dose and another one told her to get it and she wanted to know what she should do. The patient had headaches/migraines on the evening of vaccination on 13Jan2021 that were fairly mild and 3 days after that on 16Jan2021, they got bad and was accompanied with nausea with increased tinnitus. The migraines and nausea had gone, and the chronic paresthesia was the same as she always had, but the tinnitus was a lot louder and worse. The patient also mentioned that her migraines usually go away, but this one had lingered. The AEs did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. There were no investigation assessment. The patient recovered from the event &#34;nausea&#34; on an unspecified date, she was recovering from the event &#34;exacerbation of migraine/ headaches/migraines,&#34; she was not recovered from the events &#34;exacerbation of paresthesia and tinnitus/increased tinnitus, while the outcome of the events &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss and some abdominal tightness&#34; was unknown. The reporter assessed the events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; as serious, other medically important conditions. The relatedness of drug to the reactions/events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; was unknown as per the reporting pharmacist (Method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 61-year-old female had relevant medical history included previous neurological problems. The reported neurological events and partial hearing loss were more likely due to pre-existing conditions, and less likely related to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  Event nausea was likely due to the first dose of bnt162b2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had the 1st Pfiser Covid Vaccine on 12/21/20 and on 12/24/20 I had abdominal pains resulting in diarrhea turning into bright red bleeding by the late morning on 12/25/20. I continued to bleed for hours (only when  cramping) and ended up going to an ED for severe abdominal pain, bleeding, nausea and general weakness. The ED doctor said it was from internal hemorrhoids and the diarrhea and was not sure it was related to the Covid Vaccine and possible being an intestinal flu but I felt like I needed to report.  I also had nausea and vomiting the evening of 12/26/20 lasting about 12 hours. It took me a few days of Zofran and Imodium to get it in control and the bleeding did stop by 12/27/20.

                                                10:23pm felt a slight headache and nausea.  Left work at 10:43pm since didn&#39;t feel good.  While on road, my tongue started to tingle and then my lips started to tingle and both sides of face felt numb. This started around 10:50pm?  Went to bed and woke up Sat with same tongue, lip tingleling and face numbness.  Lips felt very swollen. Felt that way throughout the weekend.  On Monday, went back to work place injection area and requested someone talk to me.  Nurse practioner came out and spoke to me, asked about balance of facial features, no problem breathing or swallowing and gave me 25mg benadryl to take 3 times a day.  Did nothing but make me sleepy.  She calls me Tue am and told me to make an appt with PCP.  Made phone appt  for Wed.  Dr calls me Wed am and gives me presciption for 60mg Prednisone to take for a week (at this time symptoms are the same).  the first 3 days taking Prednisone the intensity of tingleling seems to lessen day by day.  But on 4th day, the symptoms stopped lessening.  Finished the meds anyway. Last 3 days, i&#39;ve also had that mild headache back in addition to the numbness from face traveling up to my ears. Past few days the tingling in tongue isn&#39;t confined to just the edges of the tongue.  It started with the first 1/4 of whole  tongue and is today tingleling in the front half of whole tongue.  One good thing so far is the past few days, my lips feel way less swollen and tingleling is lessening. So, riding this out, hoping it will  end sometime this year.  Will not be getting the second shot.  Just so you know.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1284), intramuscularly in the left arm on 29Dec2020 at 06:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); both taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date.  The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, influenza vaccine (FLU VACCINE) for an immunization on an unspecified date (received within two weeks of vaccination).  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: muscles felt really tightened up and stiff when getting out of bed and throughout the day (worst complaint) (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight nausea/nausea (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight fatigue (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight headache (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slightly stiff neck (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, right arm pain (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, back pain (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, the muscles knot up under her rib cage/muscle tightness (non-serious) in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown.  The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020 at work, and she had been experiencing adverse events since. The worst side effect she was experiencing was muscle tightness. At the time of the report, the patient got up at 09:00, and her &#34;back was killing her.&#34; The patient was achy. The patient would tighten up really tight under both rib cages, and it made her nauseous. The patient had been taking ibuprofen (ADVIL) and ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN since she received the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in her left arm, but her right arm hurt the next day. The next day after that (30Dec2020) she woke up and the right side of her back around the kidney area hurt. It was the right side lumbar. The next morning after that, &#34;her entire back was killing her down the middle of her spine. From her head all the way down.&#34; Since then, it came and went. The patient could not say if it was persisting, improving or worsening for any of the symptoms. &#34;It just grabs her.&#34; The day before the report, the patient thought she was doing better. The patient cleaned the house, and then sat down to eat. The past two nights, it had &#34;hit her really hard during supper time.&#34; Both of her sides of her back would tighten up; &#34;tense up like waiting for an impact before a wreck.&#34; The patient&#39;s back would seize up. The patient could not get comfortable; and would start pacing. Then, she would try to lay down. Last night, it took a half an hour to loosen back up. &#34;It knots up like crazy. It was bad enough, she thought she was going to pass out.&#34; The patient did not know if it was the combination of eating supper or what. The patient thought if she got up that maybe she would feel better. The patient started pacing around. The patient went outside because she thought maybe fresh air would help. When it would tighten up under her rib cage, it made her nauseous. The patient did not know if it was a &#34;vagus nerve thing or what.&#34; The patient was close to throwing up. The muscles knot up under her rib cage. The patient&#39;s back felt like she fell off a horse. It was weird to her that her left arm never bothered her. &#34;Nothing stays the same.&#34; Sometimes it was her entire arm or part of the arm that hurt. Like on top of her forearm. The patient thought she was doing good and then it would come back. When she moved her arm upward, she felt it. The patient said she could deal with the arm pain. It was the knotting up pains that were the worst. The patient tried calling an institute (name withheld) because it happened while eating dinner the other night. The institute (name withheld) &#34;nurse was useless.&#34; The pain was across her sacroiliac area. The patient had been &#34;living on Advil and ibuprofen for her back pain.&#34; The patient had been taking them together. The patient worked nights, and she was planning on going to work the night before the report, but she had to text her boss and tell her she could not come in. The patient was in good health; had perfect blood pressure and her sugar was normal. The patient was not diabetic. The patient&#39;s labs were always normal. The patient was really dreading that second shot. &#34;The flu shot kicked her butt for a couple of days, but this was way worse.&#34; The patient started reading up on the COVID vaccine, and it said usually younger people had severe side effects. That old people have less of a response. The patient did not know why she was experiencing such side effects. At the time of the report, it was day 7 or 8, and she was still feeling bad.  The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

A 62-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 62 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EK5730) administered on 30Dec2020 at 01:00PM and the patient said she did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. The patient received no concomitant medications. She stated that she had no other recent vaccinations or new medications. One thing that may be important is that she did do a 7 day detox that ended the Sunday before her second vaccine dose, so her body was pretty much having no impurities in it, and she has been eating clean since then, maybe having something foreign put into her body set it off after detox. The patient experienced arm soreness and general fatigue on 21Jan2021, and on 22Jan2021 at 01:00 she experienced severe nausea and heart rate of 160 (which was reported serious as medically significant). Patient reported that after her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine she had a significant side effect that didn&#39;t happen until 10-12 hours after getting the vaccine. She did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. After the second injection her arm was sore, and she had general fatigue. She had the second dose injected Thursday at around 01:00PM, then at one in the morning her heart rate was 160, and she had severe nausea. She was that way until 08:00AM. Her heart rate was 120 probably by 09:00AM, then came down to 100, she has never had anything like that before. Her arm soreness was a deep muscle soreness to her left arm. The fatigue was a couple hours later after she got the second dose of the vaccine. The nausea started at 01:00AM, and lasted until six to eight, she did no treatment, and it improved and is still gone now. For her heart rate of 160, she had no treatment, though she probably should have gone to the hospital, but it came down. She usually runs a heart rate of 60-70, it went back to normal Friday, probably in the afternoon on the 22nd, about 12 hours after that started. The patient stated that she feels this is medically significant for her heart rate to be that high. She had contacted her primary care physician (PCP), but they didn&#39;t call her back for 4-5 hours, by then she was fine. She doesn&#39;t think that this was treated well by her PCP, and that they should have done an electrocardiogram (EKG) and follow up labs, she is changing her PCP as a result of this. She is concerned about the people who will be getting their second dose, she has been helping with these, they have patients that are over 100, they wouldn&#39;t survive that rapid heartbeat. The outcome of arm soreness/muscle soreness and fatigue was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event of heart rate increased was likely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 62-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), intramuscular in right deltoid on 24Jan2021 at a single dose for prevention (COVID-19 immunization). Medical history included Low immunoglobulin/compromised immune status/Low immunoglobulin diagnosed 8 years ago, hereditary angioedema from 2010, asthma diagnosed in her 20&#39;s, Allergic to Thermarisol, diagnosed allergies, respiratory illness, and endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (LOT number: EJ1686) in right deltoid on 03Jan2021 for covid-19 immunization, and flu shot on Sep2020 without adverse event. She got second injection on 24Jan2021. On 25Jan2021, she woke up with 100.5 degrees temperature and could not stop vomiting.  She had to go to the ER.  They gave her Zofran, IV and also Toradol because she had a number 10 headache.  She continued with low grade temperature throughout week from 99.5-100.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and by Tuesday morning, she developed a red area below injection site. By Thursday, there was a red area growth to 13 cm x 15.5 cm on the injection site. She could not remember her email address and said her brain was not thinking. This started after the vaccine that she began having difficulty remember things. She never had a headache that bad.  It improved but she has a lingering headache still.

                                                2.5 hours after receiving vaccine, I started getting dizzy and vomiting. I vomited 6 or 7 times. I was so dizzy I couldn&#39;t open my eyes without getting sick. We called ER and explained that we thought I was having a reaction to the vaccine, and their response was they had never heard of that type of reaction. I was sick all night, called my primary Dr in the am and they told me to go to ER. We had to call ambulance to take me there because I was so sick and couldn&#39;t open my eyes without having to vomit. Room spun in circles. My arrival at ER, they did MRI, EKG, blood work. My blood pressure was very high, so they connected me to a heart monitor. I had low Magnesium due to vomiting so much.  I was treated with Valium and anti-vert medication and fluids. I stayed overnight in hospital- had PT Jan 13th  for DX of Vertigo. Then referred to Outpatient PT for Vertigo.  Dr&#39;s felt it was a &#34;coincident&#34; that I got Vertigo shortly after vaccine, and strongly felt it was not related.  . Today is Jan 17th, and I am still dizzy, but feeling better. I have an appointment with my primary Jan 18th and not sure if I should take the 2nd dose. That is the question.

I felt like I was going to faint and then I got nauseated and I knew I was going to throw up. With my husband&#39;s help, I did manage to get to the bathroom (about 6 steps away).  I threw up and immediately sat down in the nearest chair.  I threw up a second time into a vessel after that.  I then got a massive headache and chills.  I could barely walk with assistance up the stairs to go to bed.  I have never been more fatigued.  After going to bed, I slept all night and woke the next day still fatigued, but nothing like the night before.  I was able to work, even though I felt really tired.  I did not have much of an appetite all day and two days later, I still feel fatigued.

                                                About 5:30 or so and I was going to go to lunch at work - I felt like a heartburn and I was looking for a tums. I didn&#39;t have any. I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

This 64-year-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscular on 18Dec2020 at single dose on left upper arm (lot: EKS730), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 14:30 at single dose (lot: EL1284 or EKI284) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient did not have anything with the first shot except a sore left arm on 18Dec2020. She stated that if she lays on left side it is sore. The patient had the sore left arm both times that she got the vaccine. She got second dose of vaccine on 05Jan2021 at 2:30pm and had a blasting headache and just had chills that went away about hour ago on 05Jan2021. She did not have a fever but her skin felt hot on 05Jan2021. She stated that she had dry heaves on 05Jan2021. The patient started that she had a blasting headache within a few hours of the vaccine and it gradually got worst by the time she went to bed. Stated that the chills and dry heaves started then and throughout the night. The chills stopped an hour before she got up. Stated that she went to check her temperature and did not have a fever despite having chills and her skin feeling hot. Stated that nausea started about 10 at night on 05Jan2021.

                                                Has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands; She still has a cough and no taste; She still has a cough and no taste; The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot; Body aches; Chills; Nausea; Tired; Diarrhea; Had a fever reached 100.0; Joint hurt, all of them; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020 (8 weeks ago). Concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the vaccine, she got sick as a dog and couldn&#39;t work. She had a fever that reached 100.0, she had body aches. It was explained that she has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands. The caller continues that her joint hurt, all of them, but it was throbbing the most where she has visual arthritis. To sum it up, she had chills, nausea, and body aches the first day. The caller took Tylenol regardless of what the paper said; this was on Friday, 08Jan2021. She kept taking the Tylenol. The next day, she was still tired but when she quit taking the Tylenol on the 2nd day the symptoms returned. It was clarified that she took it in the beginning of the second day twice but at the end of the day wanted to see if she was over it all so she stopped the Tylenol. The symptoms all returned so she took again at bed time, the Tylenol, this was Saturday. On Sunday, she had diarrhea but only a couple times and though it was weird, after that is was over. That day she took Tylenol once. She was calling because she was scared about the second dose, this one produced a big immune response and she says that usually happens with the second dose. The caller wants to know if she should take the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to have this happen again or it be worse. She thought since she had already had COVID it wouldn&#39;t be as bad, her immune response. The first dose was given on 07Jan2021. It was explained the only thing unresolved was from when she had COVID, she still has a cough and no taste. There are just few thing she can taste and smell now. The patient said that all the symptoms had resolved as of Monday, the 11Jan2021. Actually, she felt pretty good on the 10Jan2021 so let&#39;s say Sunday. She explained that most people get this on the second dose and so if she going have a third response she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She was calling to get an answer to her question, the doctor told her to call to see what could be recommended. She has really good doctors, three of them. The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot. The patient said she really needs to go. No need to continue when there is no one to tell her if she should take the second shot or not. The patient asked to be contacted via email to relay information about people&#39;s immune response to the first dose verses the second dose, is it greater or less. Clinical outcome of the events recovered on 11Jan2021.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 07Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital, not a Military Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient got the Flu Vaccine last part of Sep2020 or Beginning of Oct2020. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EK57530), via an unspecified route of administration at left Upper arm on 17Dec2020 9:10AM for covid-19 immunization. She only had a sore arm. It started the same day, a couple of hours after getting the vaccine. It went away a day to a day and a half after it started. After that she was fine. She got the second dose on 07Jan2021. After the second dose, immediately, like within five minutes her arm became very sore, this event was assessed as non-serious by HCP. Also, that Thursday (07Jan2021) night after getting the second dose of the Vaccine around 9PM-10PM she started to get chills, myalgia, severe headache, and nausea. She also mentioned she was so sick during the night she was not able to get up and around. She felt like she had a temperature and by the time it was checked her temperature was 101.9. She was febrile all through 08Jan2021. She started to become afebrile 09Jan2021 with improvement and by 10Jan2021 all her symptoms had gone away and completely resolved. Seriousness Criteria: Stated she felt these are serious. She was unable to go to work on Friday. She could not return back to work until Monday. The HCP assessed all events were related to the vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021. She stated, even though she got so sick with getting the vaccine she was just continuously telling her self this is better than having COVID. She stated she even told people even if she knew after getting the shot she would have this reaction she would still take it. She has seen death occur from COVID and does not want that to happen.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, clinical course and known safety profile of the product, the reported events chills, myalgia, severe headache, nausea and fever were likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

Was on phone constantly the next day for 7 hours straight without eating.  Could not remember what some items were like a drone. Had to ask = that thing that flies with a camera. Short term memory loss that continues. Facial numbness began 48 hours after injection. Facial numbness continues changing in areas of right side of my face. Felt extremely vulnerable. Wore my same clothing for 4 days as I did not remember that I had clean clothing. Did not remember that I should notify medical personal until late 2/20.

There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient worked at a nursing facility, but she was not a healthcare professional. After receiving the first vaccine, she felt great. The vaccine built her immunity up, which was good. With the second vaccine, she got very ill over it on an unspecified date. The patient was asking if there had been other people reporting side effects of the vaccine. The patient further reported that after she was given the second vaccine, they had a waiting time where she had to sit and wait about 15 minutes and it was fine. After work on an unspecified date, she had gone to pick up some groceries and it hit her like a ton of bricks. It was really, really bad. When she was given the vaccine, she asked the pharmacist from the time she was given the vaccine, if there would be any special time she would have symptoms or experience what would be going on. The pharmacist told her everyone was different, but that she would definitely know. The patient stated she had very bad stomach issues; it felt like someone was stabbing her on an unspecified date. She had no vomiting or diarrhea, but when she ate, it was horrible. She couldn&#39;t eat; every time food reached her stomach, it was a horrible pain. She also experienced some fatigue on an unspecified date. She got tired a lot. She had to call her employer and tell them that she wouldn&#39;t be coming in. This went on for a week. She still had some side effects, but its working its way out of her and she could tell. The patient stated she didn&#39;t believe her employer believed her. She had called and left messages and it went no where. She was afraid and she didn&#39;t want to lose her job. The patient stated that she really hadn&#39;t eaten for a couple of days at the time of the report. She asked one of the nurses where she worked if she should be drinking water and continue to try and eat and the nurse told her to drink as much water as she could and rest her body. The patient didn&#39;t believe her employer believed that this was actually happening to her. The patient was very upset that she could lose her job and she didn&#39;t know what to do or who else to call. The patient explained that mentally, she was feeling better, but her body hadn&#39;t caught up with her mind. The patient stated she needed any information to show that she spoke with Pfizer that she could give her employer. The adverse events (AEs) did not require any visit to an emergency room or the physician office. The patient had no investigation assessment and relevant tests. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Seizures; throat swelled up; Troponin level increased; Mild heart attack; arm was hurting; breathing issues; Dry heaves; Mucus to come out; Nauseous; Dizzy; Headache; Ears became hypersensitive; Senses heightened; Throwed up; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient). A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Pfizer shot  on Sunday am - my father noticed my mother c/o not feeling well and unable to explain why she didn&#39;t feel well. She woke up feeling well and then quickly became disoriented and vomited. She was then unable to walk or communicate appropriately. Emergency services was called and she was transported to Emergency room. She was diagnosed with a posterior brain CVA and was treated with tpa and now remains hospitalized in the ICU with expressive aphasia and vision loss.

                                                having lots of Gastrointestinal issues/have gastrointestinal stuff going on; up in the middle of the night; body aches/achy; chills (no fever); nausea; got the sore arm; diarrhea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318 (not clarified further)), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and loratadine (CLARITIN), via an unspecified route of administration from 03Feb2021 at an unspecified dose for unspecified indication. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol and Sleep disorder, both from unknown date. Concomitant medication included alprazolam (XANAX), calcium (CALCIUM), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12), Multivitamin, taking a statin to prevent high cholesterol and L-methylfolate, stated it is like a folic acid drug. Because the patient really can&#39;t take anti-depressant she reacted to them all (Unspecified Medications), so that worked for her and helped her to keep up her spirit. The patient reported her side effects. She didn&#39;t want to interfere with anything but she was having lots of Gastrointestinal issues which were inconvenient. She was up in the middle of the night, happened not within 48 hour after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine but around 60 hours after the vaccine, early this morning (06Feb2021) like around 2 am. The patient was having a reaction after the vaccine but they seemed to be like delayed reactions. Not anything with breathing, she had gastrointestinal stuff going on. The patient had chills, no fever, body aches and she was really going to the bathroom nonstop in the night. It seemed to have been like 2 days after she got the shot like they were worst yesterday (05Feb2021). And she experienced achy, chills, nausea, diarrhea and sore arm in Feb2021. She would like to take TYLENOL and IMODIUM and she didn&#39;t know what she could take because she didn&#39;t want anything to interfere with that as she had been reading a lot. The patient wanted information on IMODIUM to prevent diarrhea, TYLENOL for body aches, chills (no fever), and FLONASE for sinus. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The patient actually didn&#39;t even take, that morning that day when she was getting the shot, she called the pharmacist to see if she could spray her nose with the FLONASE for sinus and he told her that he didn&#39;t think it was a good idea and that maybe she should just take CLARITIN, so she did. But she took CLARITIN that morning (03Feb2021) and she was hoping that didn&#39;t interfere. She was just nervous about it as she didn&#39;t want that to interfere with the work that it was. The patient was still suffering, less, like she didn&#39;t have the diarrhea anymore. She still had a little achy. She did get the sore arm but only for one day, so it wasn&#39;t so bad. The action taken in response to the events for loratadine was unknown. The outcome of event diarrhea and got the sore arm was recovered on an unspecified date in Feb2021, of event achy was recovering, of other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                The evening after patient received vaccine, she started to develop low grade fever and urticarial rash at the vaccine site. The urticaria improved the following day, as did the fevers. Then 3/5, the fevers started again, several times per day, as high as 102 at home.  In association with the fever she has had some mild nausea, x1 non-bloody emesis last night, as well as rigors/night sweats.  She went to urgent care and eventually was admitted to the hospital for the following 9 days. During this admission, she continued to have fevers intermittently as high as ~103. She also developed more generalized urticarial rash (worst on trunk), and lab abnormalities including low platelets and elevated liver function tests. She had extensive testing, ultimately determined likely vaccine reaction, started on prednisone 40 daily and improved for discharge to home on 3/17 without fevers x48 hours and with improving labs.

Noticed some circumoral cyanosis around my lips after  arriving home. Had a fine afternoon (sleeping following vaccine and 16 hr. shift).  Had dinner and usual evening. Upon going to bed about 11pm,  I experienced chills for several hours, and shortness of breath. Very weak. Called 911 about 3 am - went to hospital ER - O2 sat. 90% enroute. Vital signs stable in hospital ER. Had neg. CXR, EKG, and labs. Also had slight cough and slight bronchial congestion. Received some IV fluids in ER. Left ER at 7am. Went home and slept all day, slight nausea in am. Awoke at 7pm - had good breakfast for dinner. Fine evening and night. Off the next day from work - usual day. It was like having Covid all over again (positive X2 in April - out of work for 5 weeks).  Although the symptoms began about 12 hrs. following the injection and subsided about 24 hrs. later).   My colleagues (work as a nurse in long term care - rehab) who had Covid in the past have experienced similar symptoms following the vaccine, even though we had Covid back in the spring. Dreading vaccine number 2 on Jan. 19th - hopefully I will be ok.

Patient also reported that she received the Pfizer shot yesterday at around 3:30, then at around 7:30 she experienced really bad cramps in her abdomen, along with a bit of a headache. She asked if that is one of the side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. She was a little concerned because she heard that if you had a reaction or side effects to the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine that they would be worse with the second dose. She had abdominal cramps all night long off and on. She reported outcome as ongoing but a little bit better. She did better if she just stays still. When she gets up and starts doing things the abdominal cramps occur more.

Usually with something like this kind of abdominal cramps she would have diarrhea but she was not having any diarrhea. The abdominal cramps are weird feeling.

A 68-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. A couple of hours after she received the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine last 21Dec2020, she started to experience moderate, and intermittent nausea, lack of appetite, fatigue, malaise, and sometimes chills; all on 21Dec2020. She said that the worse of all side effects she&#39;s experiencing was nausea. HCP also said that she was still experiencing the side effects until now. She also mentioned that she got tested for Covid, and results came back negative. However, she said that she will get tested again just to make sure she did not have the virus. The events were reported as non-serious. The outcome of events was not resolved.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

                                                After 15 minutes felt light headed and throat started to constrict slightly.  Had an Allegra with me, so took it.  Seemed to subside in about 30 minutes.  Took a benedryl at bedtime.  In morning, seemed ok, though took another benedryl.  Seemed OK on this next day, but before bed, face was puffy, then woke up at 3:50 a.m. Saturday, and throat glands swollen and was having difficulty swallowing.

                                                Patient presented to the ED on 1/21/21 for evaluation of SOB stating her husband tested positive for COVID earlier that week and she has been around him. The patient states her symptoms started 3-4 days prior to presentation. She admits to cough, nausea, and an episode of vomiting the day of presentation. She had been intermittently using her husband&#39;s oxygen prior to presentation which she says has helped with her symptoms, but does not use oxygen at baseline. Upon presentation the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation rate on room air is 89%. Patient was placed on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula and then was saturating in the mid 90s. CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates in the ED which the ED physician felt to be consistent with COVID infection. The patient&#39;s rapid COVID test resulted as positive. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management of hypoxia related to COVID infection. The patient remains hospitalized on the day of report submission (1/28/21)

This 68-year-old female patient (pregnant no) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number En6200), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 10:30 AM on left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included high blood pressure.  Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin and hydrochlorothiazide/losartan.  The patient experienced injection site reaction and severe stomach flu like symptoms, nausea, protracted vomiting, abdominal cramping and muscle aches on 20Feb2021 19:00. The patient had not received other vaccine in four weeks. There was no treatment received, no COVID prior vaccination and no COVID tested post vaccination, no known allergies.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular injection on 20Jan2021 (at the age of 68-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing breast cancer stage IV, patient was in treatment for breast cancer stage IV, she had cancer 13 years prior the report in 2008, and then was found again and diagnosed 3 years prior the report, in Jun2018; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a long time, a lot of her adult life. The patient was on oxygen; she had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer; patient tested positive for COVID in 2020 (Feb2020 or Mar2020, as reported). She and her roommate tested positive and had a cough. They had no fever or other symptoms. Both in the nursing home got over the cough and 21 days later tested negative. Patient tested negative for COVID ever since. The nursing home tested the residents and staff every week. They had tested the patient so much to the point her nose was bloody which the reporter got upset about; hallucinations and paranoid thoughts. Concomitant medications included ongoing perphenazine (TRILAFON) taken for hallucinations and paranoid thoughts; treatment for breast cancer stage IV and oxygen. The patient lived in nursing facility and had received both Pfizer vaccine doses. The patient received the first vaccine for COVID-19 immunisation in Dec2020. She was fine. She got the second one on 20Jan2021. Since patient received the 2nd vaccine dose, in Jan2021, she was having confusion and dementia, which was not an issue before the vaccine doses. The patient was having trouble putting words together. Patient initially had vomiting, nausea and brain fog where she could not concentrate on her TV, in Jan2021. She was hospitalized from 17Feb2021 to 20Feb2021 to have all kinds of tests run and see if her cancer had spread to her brain. Patient had 3 years with stage 4 breast cancer and had fought so hard and was aware of her confusion and it was very upsetting to her. She had days of vomiting and nausea. She complained of brain fog and could not focus on the tv or her programs. Within days, she went into this kind of like dementia-like state where she talked incessantly and could not get a thought completed. Patient would go from one thought to the next. It was very bizarre. She had never had this kind of issues. This went on for so long, they finally put her in the hospital. Patient had stage 4 breast cancer, and the doctors thought maybe her cancer had gone to her brain. The doctor did not think it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was checked for a urinary tract infection (UTI), for brain cancer, for a stoke, for everything. She saw so many doctors. She still had not come out of this a month later. She was currently on psych meds because she had mood swings, since Jan2021. It had been one thing after another. The patient could not tell the time. On some level, patient knew something was wrong. She was in a very confused state. She did not know how to tell anyone what she wanted to tell. It was very distressing to say the least. She had made a little bit of progress. She could tell time with some struggling but she got upset and cried. Patient could only tell that the time was 3, but not 3:15. But, then she cried and got upset. She had been able to tell time a couple of times, but if you asked her what day was it, she had no clue. She had no clue what day it was and would ask &#34;what day is it?&#34; Her moods all over the place. The patient was still very confused. The reporter explained the patient could be 5&#39;3&#39;&#39;, she was unsure. The reporter really did not know the patient weight, she was guessing around 270lbs. She had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer, and reporter had not seen her since COVID started. Patient told that her weight was up around 300lbs. The reporter declined to include a healthcare professional for the report, stating she had not spoken to her sister&#39;s primary care doctor. She was waiting for her to call back. The patient was sent to the ER and admitted into the hospital on 17Feb2021. She came back from the hospital on 20Feb2021 at 6:30pm. She had a CAT scan, MRI, bloodwork done, in Feb2021. She saw a psychiatrist, neurologist, her oncologist. There was so many doctors seeing her and talking to the reporter. The last doctor the patient saw in the hospital said that she thought the patient was dehydrated from her vomiting episodes, but did not know for sure. In Feb2021, the nursing home did blood tests and a urinalysis to see if she had a UTI. The blood work would have shown if patient was dehydrated and she was not. The head nurse thought it was the vaccine, but she was not sure. Everybody was not sure. No one could tell her anything concrete about patient. She was not normally like this. Patient had recovered completely from the nausea and vomiting. They tried for a while to give her an anti-nausea medicine, but she could not keep anything down. It was given to her orally, she did not know why an injection was not given. This lasted for a few days, clarified as maybe 3 days. The reporter had no name, NDC, lot number or expiry date for the anti-nausea medicine the patient took. She knew it was given to her once and when they tried to give it to her again, patient refused. Reporter had no product information to provide for the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, did not have the patient vaccine record card. This would be with the nursing facility. She mentioned patient went into the nursing home on Jan2018 and then was diagnosed with breast cancer Jun2018. She did not know if there were any interactions there with the patient having the breast cancer and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The reporter had no product information for the first dose. When probed for the date in which the first dose was given, she explained she was sent constant emails which could have provided a date, but she did not know this information offhand. It was approximately a month before the second dose, or it could have been on 27Dec2020, which was a little closer than a month apart. No additional vaccines were administered on the same date of the Pfizer vaccine. The events required a visit to emergency room. Patient had constant testing while in the hospital. In the hospital, in Feb2021, they did MRI and CAT scan to see if the breast cancer had gone to the brain and both were negative. They tested for UTI. They did the first UTI test at nursing home in 2021 and they said she had a UTI and patient was put on an antibiotic. They tested her again for a UTI when she was admitted into the hospital in Feb2021 and they said she did not have a UTI. She did have a buildup of urine in her bladder because her kidney functions were not good enough for the MRI at first, in Feb2021. Her bladder was relieved of the urine build up and her kidney functions improved and she was able to get the MRI. The MRI did not show any cancer in the brain. None of it relieved her symptoms. This was just bizarre. It happened within a week of receiving the vaccine. She could not talk with patient and patient had never been like that. The patient had always been lucid and open and you could talk about anything: the past, the present, she had no problems. She could remember everything crystal clear from the past but she could not remember or know everything from the present. The reporter would ask her what day was it and the patient did not know. The patient would absorb the information she was told but there was like this strange disconnect, almost like a dementia of some form. About concomitant medications, the reporter explained the patient had not started anything new. She had been on the same stuff for many years. She had psych meds that she had been on, but she had been on those for many years. She clarified further that patient had been stable on her psych meds for many years, and the nursing facility had the patient stable for 3 years at the nursing home. At the time of the report, her mood swings were all over the place, she had never had that before. She had hallucinations and paranoid thoughts in the past, but she had never had mood swings like this and never had dementia. She had been on the same medications for a long time, but they were currently trying to play with them and trying to adjust her psych meds. It was apparent it was not working and this was something more organic, something going on in her body. The psych med was perphenazine all of her life. The psych nurse was a new nurse and was not familiar with the patient. The psych nurse informed the reporter she raised the perphenazine to the highest dose she could possible go on and told she could have to try the patient on a mood stabilizer and could have to put her in a psych unit. The reporter would not have any NDC, lot numbers or expiration dates, or anything like that. The reporter had been told an UTI could have caused the patient symptoms. It could have been brain cancer, or this or that. She did not know what was going on. Reporter asked if there had been any reports or had other people called in with these types of reactions or adverse events. The patient had recovered from vomiting and nausea on an unknown date in 2021, had recovered from kidney functions were not good enough and UTI in Feb2021, the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Admitted to hospital for hospital for 1 day.  Was given anti-vomiting/dizziness drugs, CT scan, IV for dehydration, pain and anxiety medicine. Diagnosis was vertigo. Upon release from hospital, consult with internist further diagnosed condition as labarynthitis. Headache and slight dizziness continued for a couple of weeks . After second dose dizziness, light-headedness and headache are significant enough to  take Tylenol regularly. These effects are still in place 12 days after 2nd dose. Will see internist if symptoms continue after 2 weeks.

                                                She had the vaccine at the facility where she lives.  She fainted less than 24 hours after the vaccine, got up from that and had dry heaves, lost her speech and had loose stools.  The aide caught her as she was fainting as she would have fallen on the floor.  She said it was weird, she looked at people and it looked like they were 2 dimensional and knew something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t figure out what as they attended to her.  They asked her questions, but she was not able to speak to them.   They apparently spent 2 hours with her, but she doesn&#39;t believe it was that long, and then they knew she wanted to go to one Hospital and not the other.  She had been loosing words before this happened, but not as bad as this one.  This was about the same reaction that she had when she got the COVID virus in January.  She was then taken to the hospital where she was given fluids and hydrated her and checked her heart, saw a cardiologist and a neurologist to see if those things caused the fainting and had blood work done.  They also did a CAT Scan of her head and neck.  They told her that she was fine and was discharged back home after 5 days, which was 3/11/21.  Since then she has been very tired, she does have GERD and her stomach has been hurting a lot as well.

Went to ER  and was diagnoised with appendicitus.  Had surgery next morning.

My whole body ached and I was extremely fatigued.  All I wanted to do was sleep and I also started a slight cough. Later on in the afternoon I started to sweat profusely.  I had chills/sweats all through the afternoon and into the evening.  I did not even get out out bed until the next afternoon (1-1-21).  For 2 days afterwards I had chills/sweats and on 1-2-21 I had terrible stomach cramps and diarrhea.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Lot  EJ1686, intramuscular in right deltoid on 03Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient did not receive other vaccine within four weeks.  On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced sore arm and tiredness.  On 07Jan2021 the patient experienced anterior cervical fusion and was hospitalized from 07Jan2021 to 09Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced nausea. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced muscle aches, loss of taste and loss of smell. On unknown date the patient experienced headache. The patient was tested positive to COVID-19 on 11Jan2021. The patient did not visit Physician Office or Emergency Room. Laboratory data included COVID-19 Rapid Test positive on 11Jan2021. The outcome of the events tested positive for COVID-19, and anterior cervical fusion was unknown. The outcome of the events sore arm, tiredness, nausea, muscle aches, headache was resolving. The outcome of the events loss of taste, loss of smell was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 03Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 11Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  This 69-year-old female had medical history of ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The reported anterior cervical fusion was most likely due to concurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the vaccine of BNT162B2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

I knew there was potential for side effects before taking the vaccine...I was totally unprepared for so many symptoms and how intense they were and what little I could do to relieve any of them. Never had fever that I am aware of. Today I?m weak and sweating is unreal.  ?? Should I prepare/expect my second dose around Feb. 14 to have the same effect on me.? Not looking forward to that. I was almost ready to go to the ER I was getting so dehydrated and weak.

                                                I give the girl in front of me the Covid vaccine way high on her arm. I told MA do not give my shot that high up. She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times. I still have ongoing pain 24 seven and I want to report a complaint against the girl who gave my shot I thought she was an LPN but she is a MA.  We both work at healthcare clinic. I am a 26 year RN and she did not listen to me and she stuck me anyway against my will.

She went to the ER during the past 11 days for IV fluids due to deyhydration from the diarrhea. Today, 25Jan2021 is the first day she has been out of the house, except to go to the ER, since she received her 1st vaccine dose. On Jan2021 muscle pain, neck ache, backache, problems with balance and problems with walking. Events probably started with intense diarrhea starting 14Jan2021; then Fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit and chills 14Jan2021; Specific onset dates and onset times unknown otherwise other than between 14Jan2021 and 16Jan2021 onset dates. It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired. She will fall asleep through the day for 3-4 hours at a time and she does not even nap usually (Jan2021). She has not driven yet but assumes probably once she is a little stronger she will be able to drive again. She did not have upper respiratory, chest or cough issues. The outcome of the events fever, headache, body ache, muscle pain, neck ache was recovered on Jan2021; fatigue was not recovered. The outcome for the other events was unknown.

                                                chills; fever; body aches; headache; vomiting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via a Pfizer sponsored program. A 69-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a sngle dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She mentioned that she received the vaccine on Sunday (unknown date) and reported that for the last 4 days she had been pretty sick with fever, chills, headache and body aches. She had been alternating acetaminophen (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen (ADVIL). She did have COVID in Nov2020. The patient inquired if the symptoms after dose 2 would be worse if she&#39;s had COVID in the past. She also inquired if she will have the same symptoms for the second dose and if how long side effects will last. She add that she did have some vomiting on Sunday later after she got the vaccine. She was wondering because she is to get the second dose on the 21st, the pharmacist did say that sometimes people who have had the Covid virus already can sometimes experience strong side effects from the vaccine. She does not want to feel or get sick. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Very lethargic which I understand is normal. I was concerned about the one sided headache. Was on the left side of my head. The shot was in left arm. Have not idea if that would make a difference.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

Medical history included hypertension, pacemaker insertion. Concomitant medication was not reported, however, the patient reported that she takes medicines for hypertension, and is on blood thinners. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reported that on 26Jan2021, after receiving the vaccination she did wait a half hour and the only symptoms she thought at the vaccination visit was a little blurred vision, which was temporary and went away. At 16:30, about 45 minutes to 1 hour after she left the vaccination center, as she was driving home, she informed that she was feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/face was really tingling and numb, and she had difficulty swallowing;  her throat started to feel like it was closing up and her tongue was really thick.  She stated she tried to stay calm and forced herself to drink a bottle of water. She had no idea where there was any emergency area since she was not familiar with the area and tried to calm herself down and took sips of water and made sure she was breathing okay and it all went away. The reaction lasted 10-15 minutes and seem to resolve when she was able to calm herself down. She stated it was scary, and once she calmed down it all went away.  She was concerned about receiving the second dose. She did not go to a physician or emergency room, but says she probably should have. The clinical outcome of little blurred vision, feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/her face was really tingling and numb, difficulty swallowing, throat started to feel like it was closing up, and tongue got thick was recovered.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 26Feb2021 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) and vitamin. The patient previously took BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunisation (first dose on the left arm at 01:30 PM, lot number: EL 1283); and SHINGRIX vaccine in 2019, codeine and cipro and experienced allergies. On 27Feb2021 03:30 PM, the patient experienced chills, fatigue &amp; then sudden nausea &amp; lightheadedness that resulted in passing out. Unfortunately, the patient fell on a tile floor &amp; hit her head resulting in a 1.5 inch gash in the back of her head. When she went to the ER, it was determined that she now had vertigo (which she never had before) but obviously hard to tell if it was a side effect of the vaccine or from the fall. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the events which included CT scan, ekg, chest X-ray, bloodwk (unknown results) and Epley maneuver. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient is not pregnant. Outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL8982, unknown expiration), via injection in right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 prevention.  Medical history included ongoing vertigo (in car accident a little over 5 years ago, that affected a big nerve in left temple, and so every once in a while she will get vertigo so bad that she falls over), ongoing GERD (from a hiatal hernia; diagnosed many years ago), ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed about 15 years ago, ongoing bad cholesterol diagnosed 10 to 15 years ago, ongoing heart burn, ongoing hiatus hernia, and car accident a little over 5 years ago. Concomitant medications included ongoing omeprazole sodium (OMEPRAZOLE) for GERD, heart burn, and hiatal hernia (started this product at least 10 years ago; takes the product as needed if she is having heart burn or is going to eat spicy food); ongoing vitamin D3 for vitamin supplementation (started product about 8 months ago, because her doctor told her too, she guesses her vitamin was low); ongoing metoprolol for high blood pressure and to prevent stroke (started product at least 15 years ago; her BP could be regular but it could shoot up when she is upset, so she takes this to prevent stroke); ongoing hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure (started product at least 5 years ago); pravastatin for bad cholesterol  (started the product at least 4 or 5 or more years ago); and ongoing acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) to prevent stroke (has been taking this product forever, at least for 10 years).  The patient reported that she received the first COVID shot on 13Jan2021. She was okay on the 13th, 14th, and 15th. However, on the 16th (16Jan2021), she woke up and threw up once and was very dizzy for three days. She mentioned that she had like vertigo, she couldn&#39;t even walk, she had to crawl and her husband had to walk her around, she couldn&#39;t do anything. She had vertigo (16Jan2021). She was that way on Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, the patient&#39;s son took her to acupuncturist for her dizziness and was able to get up fine and walked away. After the acupuncture, she felt fine, like she was all better. On 19Jan2021 (reported as yesterday), she was fine. She woke up at midnight and had terrible acid reflux for 3 hours even though she had hardly eaten. She does take omeprazole for heart burn, and she had taken omeprazole earlier in the day, but it was just coming up, that acid and burning. She drank milk to coat the stomach and it went away at 03:00 AM. She had very bad chills/terrible chills (20Jan2021) and her teeth were chattering, she couldn&#39;t even talk, and couldn&#39;t control the chills. She is fine now. She clarified that she got vertigo from a car crash years ago and haven&#39;t had it in almost a year. Chills are not ongoing at this time, she has not had any for about 4 hours now, and she is hoping she is recovered completely, but it may be too soon to tell. She did not receive other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient is wondering if all this could be from the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if it is safe to take the second shot. She was scheduled to receive the second dose on 03Feb2021. The patient recovered from the events threw up on 16Jan2021; unable to walk and vertigo on 18Jan2021; dizziness on 19Jan2021; and terrible acid reflux on 20Jan2021. While unknown outcome for chills.

Lasted approx. 30-35 minutes. crawled with head hanging to floor to keep from passing out, to locate a phone for help. after several of agonizing attempts to try and climb up to couch to elevate legs high above head and laying there for  approx. 20 or more min. blood pressure came up some. (Did not call emergency services) afraid of hospitalization due to  all chronic health problems, (forgot to report earlier that I am Hypothyroid as well)  previously hospitalized for a Thyroid Storm. This is day 10 from injection and still have nausea, dizziness &amp; fatigue, (also have couple episodes of abdominal pain). (I want to add that I felt completely fine prior to receiving 2nd Pfizer Covid dose).  I am contacting my  doctor today to receive some IV fluids.

Took acetaminophen  and some anti -nausea drugs I had on hand.  Fever left, but returned next night.  Weakness, no appetite stayed for two days.  Thought it was the flu, but no upper respiratory symptoms.  Thought it might be Covid-19 but tested negative.  Finally decided it was a reaction to the vaccine.

There was a sense of nausea initially but it went away. There was pronounced feeling of heat located subcutaneously on my right outer thigh. It came and went about every minute or so. (I counted the seconds in between each incident). I am still experiencing flu like symptoms (bodily aches, slight headache, mild chest pain, and general ill-feeling.) I will contact my primary care physician today about my concerns but felt it necessary to document these mild but disturbing side effects.

IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The possibility that suspect drug may have contributed to the reported event cannot be excluded.

A 70-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (at the age of 70-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included viruses, flus (I have had viruses, flus my whole life), five surgeries, gallbladder removed, and asthma, all from unspecified dates and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) on an unspecified date, at the age of 70-years-old and experienced a very sore arm. On an unspecified date in Feb2021 the patient experienced, &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34;. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;I wanted to call today because I got the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 3 weeks ago, 03Feb2021 it was. After the first dose I had a very sore arm and that was it. It was more sore than normal vaccine, but it was that was all I had. After the second dose I was not aware that I would get sick to the extreme that I did. I found out afterwards that other people have said this, I did not know at the time. I thought I was going to die. I am a 70-year-old woman, I am not young, and I have had viruses, flus my whole life and I got so sick. First, I had over a 103 temperature, it came on suddenly, 12 hours to the minute after I got the vaccine. On top of that I had such bad chills I never saw anything like that in my life, 5 blankets on top of me, sweaters, sweatshirts and the fever was so high. I could not keep the Tylenol down because I had nausea and I would throw it up. So, I could not even get rid of it. Then on top of that my arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all, plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain, it was excruciating. I have had 5 surgeries, my arm hurt worse than all 5 surgeries put together. And I had my gall bladder removed and everything, nothing hurt to this extent. Now also I have asthma, nothing severe but I do have asthma, so I have one of those little oximeters and you put it on your finger and it checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91, all night it was 91, my chest was shortness of breath. I was ready to go to the hospital. And I did not know it was going to be that bad.&#34; When clarified about the treatment the patient stated that &#34;yes, the Tylenol helped once I could hold it down. The doctor gave me something to stop the vomiting and the nausea. And then I could take the Tylenol and then the Tylenol worked great. But at first, I was so sick I could not hold the Tylenol down in my stomach I would throw it up, that was the problem.&#34; When asked about lab work the patient stated that she had not had lab work done since the first vaccine. She stated that she had stayed in the house because she had other health issues and was afraid to come out for 11 months. So she had not gone out to get anything done. The patient stated that she called because if a third dose was needed, she suggested that a smaller dose be given to small people. She stated that she took childrens medicine most of the time because she was tiny. She wanted to know if Pfizer in the future would be making doses for small people and doses for bigger people. Her suggestion was to have a separate booster to go by weight or by gender, men usually did not experience the same. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34; were all recovered/resolved on unspecified dates.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal.

                                                Very tired after vaccination.  Went to sleep about 8 PM Sat 1/16 and slept most of the next 4 days.  Stomach  was queasy.  Unable to drink coffee.  Tried to push fluids and tried to just eat bland foods.  Would wake up sporadically but was unable to awaken enough to watch an entire TV show. Pretty lethargic and brain fog.  Was able to wake up a little more on Wed 1/20 but still had the queasy stomach.  Started getting Headache and Eye pain and severe upper leg  and lower back burning &amp; cramping, I tried taking tylenol which helped a little.  By Thursday  the pain was worse.  I was still tired  only walking helped the pain. It got worse if I sat down and extremely bad if I laid down to try to sleep. It&#39;s Friday morning &amp; I am planning to go to med check this AM.  Symptoms still ongoing

                                                This patient started to feel lightheaded and had a dry mouth approximately 5 minutes after receiving her Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Over the next 20 to 25 minutes she progressed to having a sensation of tongue swelling, then difficulty swallowing, then chest tightness.  Her vital signs were stable throughout the observation period (blood pressure 144/74 and 150/70, pulse in the high 80s to low 90s, and oxygen saturation 96-98% on room air) and she was able to speak in full sentences without any respiratory distress.  Her lungs were clear and she had no stridor.  She never had any pruritic symptoms or rash/hives.  Because of the progressive nature of her symptoms, however, I felt she needed emergency room evaluation for observation.  We never administered any medication while at the vaccine clinic including epinephrine or Benadryl.  After approximately 25 minutes, 911 was called and she was transported by ambulance to the emergency room in stable condition.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

Then abdominal pain, nausea, then feeling of something really wrong, I didn?t feel well, then got weaker and weaker, couldn?t lift arms, and felt extremely fatigued, trouble staying awake.  Taken by ambulance to medical center.  On route,  ambulance stopped and another team came in. I was given epinephrine, zofran, Benadryl, and maybe a steroid? Not sure.  When I arrived at hospital, t think I was given dexamethasone and famotidine.  I was barely awake but could speak. Could not hold anything. After several hours, they woke me up, I felt myself again, and I was discharged.  Following days I felt exhausted and dizzy, and had a headache. Took prednisone for five days.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1685, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at left arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included low sodium, Covid-19 in Nov2020 (She had felt sick for a week and on 13Nov2020 she went to the ER and they did blood tests and she could not eat or drink for 3 days. She stated that she had 4 different IV fluids going and one of them was sodium and the other was for nausea), blood did not clot properly, broke her back. There were no concomitant medications.The patient had a unique reaction after receiving the Covid-19mRNA Vaccine. She clarified that she never had a reaction to a shot before. She received the vaccine on 31Dec2020 and was fine for the first 20 hours. She said that the next morning on 01Jan2021 at 0600 she woke up cold  and could not get warm. She said that she spent the next 24 hours to where she kept adding clothes and blankets to keep warm. She stated that she was freezing and the she felt like the interior of her body was freezing even down to her toes felt cold. She also had injection site pain and the arm felt heavy and stated that the pain extended from her shoulder down to her elbow. She stated that the injection site pain was kind of delayed. She had aches and pains. She said that some of the pain went from the injection shoulder and spread to the middle of her spine. She had nausea and total loss of appetite and could not even eat. Her aches and pains after the vaccine were similar aches like she had with the Covid. She said that she had a terrible headache when she had Covid though. She stated that after the 24 hours of receiving the vaccine she had a little headache, but she took a migraine pill for it. She said that she was able to shed clothes, but she could not take a shower, but within 24-36 hours she was back to normal like it all never happened. She said that was when she figured out it was like her hemorrhaging with one of her childbirths. She explained that she had 3 children and hemorrhaged with each of her child births and was going into shock with one of them and felt this freezing sensation due to blood loss. She thought that her reaction to the vaccine was so bad that she was either not making blood or there was an interference. There was some kind of weird interruption. She said that her blood clots break down from minutes to hours after her child birth or with dental procedures. She had a PAI-1 deficiency or Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 deficiency. She said that there was also something deeper that her doctors had not figured out yet too. She said that her blood did not clot properly. She said that she did not bruise or anything, but she was not allowed to have internal surgery without a transfusion. She said that her doctor&#39;s started to figure this all out after she broke her back before. She went to a hematologist and had her counts checked regularly. She said that she was being studied by 127 different clinics. She gained 10lbs, but she was very physically active. This was her first dose of teh vaccine. She said that her doctors told her that she needs to be under 48 hours of observation if she gets the second vaccine. Her primary care physician recommended that she did not take another mRNA vaccine. She said that she was taking their advice and canceled her second dose appointment. She said that when she had Covid-19 they did a Chest x-ray on 13Nov2020 and she had low sodium. She said that they gave her tramadol at the hospital for her headache, but she had already taken 3 migraine pills that day. She had already had her flu shot and read somewhere on a website, that mRNA vaccines might cause unstable anticoagulation. She wondered if it could be possible that Covid-19 antibodies interfered with her injection? The outcome of events was unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 at a single dose in the hospital for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety, seizures, and high cholesterol. She passed out last summer and they put her in the hospital from 31Aug2020 and ran all kinds of tests. In the end, they said she only had a few PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) and she doesn&#39;t need to see the doctor for a year. Mentioned she also has chronic bronchitis and this is related to having low platelet count and low immunity. All of these events predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin for high cholesterol, clonazepam for seizures, escitalopram for anxiety, levothyroxine sodium for thyroid, and mirtazapine for sleep; all were ongoing. Stated that she had something weird happen after her injection about four hours after the shot. She received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 in the right arm. About three or four hours later on 13Jan2021, she was getting ready for bed and when she sat down and leaned over she had a god awful burning in her chest and nausea. She was going to take baking soda but when she sat up she had horrible pressure and pain in her chest and felt woozy so she sat on the floor and then the pain started to radiate through her arm and into her neck. The horrible pain and pressure in her chest felt like something was sitting on her chest and the bad pain in her chest was going into her arm and a little into her neck. She laid real still on the floor, and did a lot of praying, and then 20 minutes later it totally stopped. She got up slowly and finished getting ready for bed and was fine. She was just hoping they will still let her get the second shot. The whole event only lasted 20 minutes and when it was over it was completely gone. She did tell her husband when he came home. She was alone when this happened. The patient wanted to know if she can receive second dose of vaccine. She stated it almost felt like a heart attack. She was planning to get the second dose on 03Feb2021. Wanted to know if her effect will preclude her from getting the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose, in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia diagnosed years ago, angina (some stents). There were no concomitant medications. On Jan2021, the patient experienced angina, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, nausea, diarrhea, headache, arm heavy, muscle aches and heaviness, and she just woke up feeling sick. The patient experienced multiple AEs after 1st dose of vaccine (received on 23Jan2021). The patient experienced angina later last week. Clinical course: The patient has misplaced card, states her second appointment for the second dose is this Saturday. Caller stated she started having these experiences the day after she was vaccinated with her first dose, received first dose of 23Jan2021. She had fevers, chills, cough- not an aggressive cough, a funny kind of sore throat- like something wrapped around her throat like the muscles of her throat, no congestion but does have a runny nose, states she has some nausea, no vomiting but feeling like she needed to vomit and diarrhea, and headache. The symptoms started about the third day after the vaccine, started with the fevers, stated the fevers may come like a hot flash, lasts seconds even, states you know it is a fever because your bones get hot. These symptom&#39;s did not attack her body at one time. Her whole arm stayed heavy, the whole arm not just the injection site, for almost 10 whole days. She previously had fibromyalgia and thought maybe that made the symptoms worse. She had muscle aches and feeling heavy. Her symptoms were spread out over time, no two were at the same time, sore throat was one of the last things. Diarrhea was ongoing, not a runny diarrhea but it was enough to empty stomach and was soft. She was a medic in the military, worked as a Nurse, clarifies she was an LPN and took all the underlying courses to be a PA. One of the issues she found, she thought it may be deadly, as a prior healthcare person and in tune to her body, the people who are in the nursing homes may not be mobile, states so one of the things she felt was just feeling really really sick, that she couldn&#39;t put a pin point on it, states she just woke up feeling sick, states she had the urge to get out of bed and got up and after she got up the feeling left her, states a person in the nursing home may just feel really bad and cannot get up, thinks a protocol should be that the people that are immobile should be required to move or if they can&#39;t get up they need to move their muscles, people with these symptoms need to get up and get moving. She also has history of angina and a stent, has not had angina in a while and had 3 days where she thought she may need to go talk to her doctor. It was on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week. States one of her friends, 92 years old, said she got high after the vaccine and didn&#39;t want to talk to anybody, states it was her first dose, she was kind of leery about the 2nd shot, feels like this was kind of aggressive. She had both doses and had no symptoms, but 92-year-old female had no symptoms right away, other than normal body aches and pains, but the next day was high as a kite. Her son has heart disease and she advised him not to take it right now. They were losing a lot of people to the vaccine in nursing homes, no further information provided. This could be affecting good hearts more than damaged hearts, read that this virus likes to work in parts of the body that are already damaged. The outcome of event diarrhea was not recovered, outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a causal association between the reported angina and BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. Note however, that the patient has underlying angina with some stents that may also have contributed to the event. Case will be re-assess once additional information becomes available.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 10Jan2021 and didn&#39;t have a reaction, but had a slight pain in her arm on 10Jan2021. Her sore arm started on 11Jan2021. There was a sore spot and when she would pick up her arm it was sore and achy. No pain, but sore and achy. It lasted for a day or two. She didn&#39;t have any symptoms until Saturday the 16Jan2021, this past Saturday she thought she was dying. She had chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and had a headache. She thought she was losing her mind. The headache just stopped today. She had the chills that would not stop and she thinks she broke the sweat on Sunday (17Jan2021). She had a little nausea and couldn&#39;t eat anything on 16Jan2021. She had a terrible headache, which just stopped about 2 hours ago. She stated she must have to take 10 Tylenol over the course of time, every 4 hours. On Saturday 16Jan2021 she was just laying on the floor in pain. She was not even eating, just drinking water. All of her symptoms stopped this morning around 5 AM (18Jan2021). She had a big sweat. She is unsure if she had a fever because she does not have a thermometer. She is unsure if she has recovered completely from these symptoms. She feels weak, and is still weak (on Jan2021). She cannot go out or get dressed or shower. She is not strong enough. She is just sitting up now, no longer laying in bed. She couldn&#39;t walk (on Jan2021) and was afraid she was going to faint on 16Jan2021. She can walk a little bit now and feels a little bit better. She has been out of it for three days, She hasn&#39;t felt good. She asked if side effects can appear 6 days later? Is this normal to have a reaction 1 week after getting it? She asked are the side effects worse after the second dose? She asked is this Covid or side effects, what are the COVID symptoms? She asked should she take the second one if she had these side effects? Caller clarifies this is the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Whoever vaccinated her did not give her the paper about it afterwards. Her neighbor brought it to her cause they went together. She did not realize she could experience these things. She did not expect them a week after getting the vaccine. She thought she had COVID. She asks, &#34;do you think I have COVID?&#34; She is just now getting better and it has been 3 days of experiencing these symptoms. Should she get the second vaccine? She is trying to do the right thing. Event outcome of chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and headache was recovered on 18Jan2021, for was going to faint and couldn&#39;t walk was recovering, for weak was not recovered, while for others was unknown.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fever, being ill (deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks) and bug bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient is the type of person that takes a lot for her to take medications. She is allergic to a lot of things; she always has crazy reactions. She can&#39;t take morphine. It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn&#39;t think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn&#39;t breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can&#39;t describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn&#39;t drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn&#39;t take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn&#39;t like it. It wasn&#39;t like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, &#34;what is this Parkinson&#39;s?&#34;. She doesn&#39;t even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn&#39;t debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it&#39;s like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can&#39;t even think of what that area is, but it&#39;s the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don&#39;t atrophy or won&#39;t pull. She hasn&#39;t told anybody about it. She doesn&#39;t like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn&#39;t figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her &#34;brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep.&#34; On Monday she experienced, &#34;horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band.&#34; Stated that it wasn&#39;t a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of gas (flatulence), muscles became tight/contort, minor nausea, horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band and shingles. The outcome of the event &#39;the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot&#39; was not recovered while of the rest of the events was unknown.

Took a 500 mg Tylenol and slept for about 4 hours. Woke up in a sweat but chills gone and am now able to eat a little bit. Back of head and neck still very sore.   The injection site is sore but no rash; right arm seems to have &#34;phantom pain&#34; as well ( I experienced this with Shingles shot in December 2020 too).

By evening head movement was very difficult, I could not sleep in bed that night. I slept on the couch sitting up trying to immobilize head. During the night pain spread into the base of my skull. I applied heat to help relieve the pain and tightness. On 01/20/21 the pain (6 of 10) spread into the left side of neck and skull, it became difficult to eat, swallow and to get up from couch. I tried to sit motionless most of the day. On 01/21/21 the pain (6 of !0) moved down into my left rear shoulder, I continued to apply heat and immobilize sitting on couch, eating and swallowing still difficult. On 01/22/21 pain in neck and base of Additional information for Item 18:  skull subside to level 5, movement of head still difficult, able to to get up and move slowly. Could not lift head to drink, still needed to use straw. Slept on couch again this night.

                                                Severe urgent diarrhea; Feels like she might be getting a little fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 74-year-old female patient  received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration to right deltoid (shoulder) on 15Jan2021 at around 10:30-10:40 AM at a single dose  for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, problems with her colon, back surgery, and flashes.  Concomitant medications included ibuprofen given on unspecified date for back surgery, and unspecified hormones, vitamins, and laxatives.  The patient previously received the flu vaccine on unspecified date and experienced like she got the flu and relapse of her chronic fatigue syndrome. She also received hepatitis C vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, pneumonia vaccine, and shingles vaccine; all on unspecified dates. The patient had not received prior vaccinations within four weeks. On 15Jan2021, the patient experienced severe urgent diarrhea and felt like she might be getting a little fever. It was further described as: Patient had an odd reaction within maybe 30 minutes to 1 hour after that dose was administered of severe urgent diarrhea. Patient mentioned she felt like she might be getting a little fever; but she was not sure and did not have a thermometer to check that. Severe urgent diarrhea: She mentioned she had not seen that side effect posted anywhere for the vaccine so she felt it was an odd reaction; although she did see that it was a side effect of the virus, so maybe it was not that odd of a reaction for the vaccine now that she thought about it. She described this event as completely crazy, the urgency to go to the bathroom, she almost did not make it home to the bathroom. It just hit her like she has never experienced before. It cleaned out her colon really well. She also felt like she might be getting a little fever but mentioned that at her age she gets hormone flashes so it could be that; and was humid at the time of report and thought so it could just be from that. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information regarding Batch/ Lot number has been requested.

A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 15:30 in left arm at single dose as Covid vaccine, etanercept (ENBREL, 50 mL/mg, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen, lot number: 1119808, expiry date: Apr2023) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 DF weekly to the stomach area for rheumatoid arthritis, methylprednisolone (MEDROL, tablet) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 3 mg, daily (1.5 tablets daily for total of 3 mg) for rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate (tablets) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, weekly (2.5 mg tablets, 20 mg total) for rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity) and took levothyroxine, rheumatoid arthritis. She had had regular blood work for rheumatoid arthritis and that was normal for her, they were relatively normal and her ESR was down. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included levothyroxine daily for endocrine abnormalities. It was a daily thing for the body and the body couldn&#39;t live without it if it did not have it. The patient previously took the Shingrix vaccine and it was terrible for her and put her into a rheumatoid arthritis flare and was taking prednisone and was getting better and the wap she was in a rheumatoid flare. No prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient was taking 3 medicines for rheumatoid arthritis that might or might not affect the RNA in the vaccine. She wondered if etanercept would have an effect on the vaccine since it was shipped on ice overnight. She did not think they would affect anything. Nobody has said anything about the medications and she just wanted to get the vaccine. Her doctor knows nothing about the interactions and none of them seem to know if it is normal to have these symptoms 4 days after getting the vaccine. She felt great the first 2 days after getting the vaccine and then began to feel a little bad. She was having some symptoms maybe 4 days on 01Feb2021 after receiving the Covid vaccine and wanted to know if that was sort of normal. It was unusual for her, but she had nauseous, not dizziness, but unsteadiness, tired, also headaches and generally didn&#39;t feel well. She felt like she might have the stomach flu, but had not had that in so many years. She also felt weak. No temperature. Gentle muscle ache. On 01Feb2021 Monday night she had the nausea. On 02Feb2021 Tuesday, she had it again, and had it again today and almost threw up last night. Just the malaise or tiredness had gotten worse. She could not tell the difference between the rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain and muscle pain and this with the vaccine. She was having a few little odd pains, but nothing that she hadn&#39;t had before. It was more of a soft pain, they made her feel weak and then they went away. It was more muscle than joint. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was supposed to get a second dose but felt she shouldn&#39;t, it might put her back into a rheumatoid flare. She was just getting over it and afraid to go through that with the Covid vaccine also. The action taken in response to the events for etanercept, methylprednisolone and methotrexate was dose not changed. The outcome of events nausea, unsteadiness, tired (tired was reported as worsened), generally does not feel well, feels like the stomach flu, weak, few little odd pains; soft pain, joint pain was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

She woke up and said she feels fine. She said at one point her body felt frozen and she couldn&#39;t move at all.

A 75-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1686), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 15:45 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Leighten Plantar Alopecia (hair follicle is an enemy), skin infection (infection in body most of the time, at least on skin), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, obesity, autoimmune disorder (diagnosed 8 months ago). She has lost some height, prior to taking the vaccine and she said it was related to age. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced feeling unwell on 10Jan2021; blood in urine on 10Jan2021 at 17:00; nausea at 10:00, chills at 11:00, almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office at 10:00, felt cold - all on 11Jan2021; getting really tired/fatigue on 14Jan2021 at 09:30; gets really sweaty on 13Jan2021 at 10:00; and dizziness on unknown date. The patient had the first shot on Friday (08Jan2021). On Sunday (10Jan2021), she started feeling bad. She was feeling good about getting it and had no reaction. She has an autoimmune disorder that made her a little afraid to take, but with all the indications, they said it would be much better for her to take it than to get the COVID virus. Sunday (10Jan2021), she does not feel good. So, she started having blood in urine. She thought she had a UTI and had not had one in 20 years. It felt like that is what she had and with the blood in urine. She just took Tylenol and waited until Monday morning because she does not like sitting in doctor&#39;s office. They gave her a cup to give sample and said she didn&#39;t need to see provider. They will have it checked and in the meantime call in a prescription. It kept getting worse and worse. She was about to passed out in the doctor&#39;s office on 11Jan2021, she got nauseous and almost threw up. She got in the car with her husband and he was trying to get her home. She got chills and got so cold and could not warm her body up. Her husband gave her Phenergan and it kind of knocked her out for a while to ease her nausea. She was thinking of going later today (14Jan2021), when she gets enough energy, to get a COVID test. She does not know if it will give false positive or not. She had chills and now she gets sweaty since 13Jan2021. She took her temperature and she did not have one. She just now got up. It is 10:00. She got up this morning (14Jan2021) and was really tired. She was not sweating this morning. Tiredness is kind of new, and when she talked to the nurse, she sort of felt like maybe it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine, but then she talked to her daughter and she said the symptoms she was having are usually symptoms that occur with second dose of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for people to have symptoms she was having. She wanted to know if she should have a COVID test. If she has had just one shot, would the test give a false positive coming from the COVID. They were asking if patient should take the second dose, and should she continue her UTI medication. Doctor&#39;s visit to give urine sample on 11Jan2021 (results: negative for UTI). She did not see a doctor though. They sent sample and prescribed a sulfa based medication for a UTI. She did start feeling a little better and stopped having blood in her urine. She plans to continue it because she does not like to stop taking an antibiotic. She did not have any clue that it was not a UTI until the nurse from her provider&#39;s office called to tell her results of urine sample was negative. Outcome of event getting really tired/fatigue was not recovered; events almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office, blood in urine, chills, and gets really sweaty was recovering; and unknown for other events.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia.

An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.
