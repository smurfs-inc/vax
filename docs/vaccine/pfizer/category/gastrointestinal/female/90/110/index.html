Took 2 tablets of advil 200mg at the beginning of shaking.  After shaking slowed down could not talk, stand or hold up hands; she was drooling barely could swallow.  She just wanted to lay down and sleep.  This lasted about 30-45 minutes.  Hands turned BLUE to her wrists lasting 15 minutes.  Resolved without intervention.  Very tired that evening. Slept for 12 hours. Back to normal the next day.

A 90-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left arm, on 18Feb2021 at 10:50 AM, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including type 2 diabetes diagnosed years ago), and obesity. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Jan2021 at 90 years of age for COVID-19 immunization. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. About a week ago (Mar2021), the patient started experiencing delusions and hallucinations. The patient was currently hospitalized. These came on quickly, no definitive diagnosis. Over the last 2 months (2021), the patient slowly started slurring speech to the point where it was very slurred. In 2021, they took her to the emergency room (ER) and they did a battery of test including computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood test, urine, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain. They were thinking maybe she might have had a small stroke but did not find anything. On Sunday (14Mar2021; within the last 2 weeks), the patient also had brain fog, and a little confusion, but was still there. The patient had no cognitive issues of any sort. On Tuesday (16Mar2021), the patient called and said there were some men at her house. The patient had the police go over and they said there was no one there and she started to say other things that did not make sense. On Wednesday (17Mar2021) at 03:00, the patient&#39;s granddaughter got a call from EMS that the patient reported someone broke into her home, stole her TV, and raped her. This was not true. By Wednesday (17Mar2021), the patient was in full blown psychosis with hallucinations, and delusions. The patient was hospitalized on Wednesday (17Mar2021) and the delusions, psychosis and hallucinations began between Sunday to Wednesday (Mar2021). The patient&#39;s granddaughter believes it all occurred after the vaccine. It was around the same time frame. The patient&#39;s granddaughter would notice a word here and there where the patient was slurring. The patient&#39;s granddaughter did not know if the patient was being lazy or tired and it gradually progressed. The patient&#39;s current state is in a very bad spot - cognitively, she is very bad (started on an unspecified date). The patient now has aphasia and extreme lethargy from 18Mar2021, and dysphagia from 22Mar2021.  This has all progressed since she has been in the hospital. The psychosis came out of nowhere. The patient was on a whole laundry list of medications and does not know if they were relevant to this. The patient had just recently started experiencing some extreme changes to herself to the point where she is hospitalized. The medical team is not finding anything wrong with the patient medically. The patient has developed some psychosis and there is nothing else that has happened that would have caused it. The patient had both doses of her COVID-19 vaccine. The patient&#39;s granddaughter was trying to research it to see if has been reported by anyone else. The patient&#39;s granddaughter considered the events as non-serious. The patient had not recovered from the events.

This 91-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included high blood pressure, kidney cancer, cancer in her bladder 20 years ago and coughing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), ascorbic acid (VIT C), losartan potassium for blood pressure, metoprolol succinate for blood pressure, amlodipine for blood pressure, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81). Patient had cancer in her bladder 20 years ago. That was taken care of. Had kidney cancer because her husband used to smoke and blow it in her face. Had rare type of kidney cancer. It was removed. Treated for bladder cancer. Patient has had no problem ever since and that was more than 18 years ago. Patient had a fever, headache, and was very tired. Burning up on side of the body and she got all wet. This was not normal and she felt like she was dying. Patient stated she had shingles and developed post herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had pain at the bottom of her foot but it was getting worse after she received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Patient noticed the liquid going thru arm to chest and in straight line to her leg, like a science fiction movie with an injection of some kind. The doctor thought the vaccine might have an impact on the nervous system and spike the symptoms of post herpetic neuralgia. Patient spoke to her doctor but nobody knows anything. Nobody was willing to help her. Patient felt like she was dying. She didn&#39;t want to die. Patient feel the symptoms are getting worst. She was burning up inside. Her pain was around the bottom of the foot now it&#39;s on top of the foot and goes up to knee. Patient was not blaming anybody but she thought it was the vaccine. Patient was sweating, wet, perspiring all night. The symptoms usually occur at night. Patient wanted to know if these symptoms were associated with the vaccine. Patient also mentioned she developed a bladder infection for which she was taking antibiotics. Patient had Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021, about 5 days ago. Patient followed instructions before vaccine. Doctor said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) before the vaccine for a headache. Patient did that. Patient had injection and told to wait for 15 minutes before she went home. About 5 minutes, she was relaxed and sitting down. Vaccination given in left arm. All of a sudden she had a very strange feeling in her body on 02Feb2021. Something was going across the top and right side like a fluid was flowing or something strange. Then it felt like a straight line down her right foot and it stopped. Was a feeling like maybe the liquid of the vaccine went that way. Didn&#39;t have a vein going that way. Patient was afraid. She went home and didn&#39;t remember the next thing that happened. Every night she has gotten more sick. Patient had a feeling in her foot where she had shingles a few years ago. After shingles had post-herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had burning on bottom of her foot and would put it in ice water. Patient could handle that because it was just uncomfortable. After injection, she got so bad, the post-herpetic neuralgia was on her whole foot and it started to burn. It went up a little towards the knee or higher. Yesterday, at times, it quickly went over to the left leg. Patient had a fever every day and every night. Patient took paracetamol to cut the fever. Patient was coughing on call but stated that was nothing and the coughing was something she had. Every night she felt like her body was burning up in side. Felt like she was burning alive. Got all wet with perspiration. She changed clothes and every night it got worse. Patient called emergency, they listened to her, stating they have never heard of anything like this. Asked patient if she wanted to go to emergency. She stated ok. The doctor listened to her story and told her it was weird. Doctor told her to give it a few more days to up to eight days. Doctor wanted her to get a urine test, but she couldn&#39;t urine, patient tried for a long time in the bathroom and only got a few drops of urine out and it was brown. Not normal urine. Next day patient called 911. She wanted to be assured she was not dying at home. Did have room available at the hospital. Patient had to sit in a wheelchair and there was no bed for her to lie down in. Last time she was admitted from the emergency. Next day she came home and had to call emergency again. Really thought she was burning up. Patient didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital and suffered at home. Next night and third night was so bad. Patient couldn&#39;t urinate anymore. She had a fever, but not a high fever, because the paracetamol cut the fever. Temperature was 100 degrees. On the inside she thought she was being burned up a live. Never got better, always got worse. Yesterday, she was in the hospital all day. Now she has an infection in her bladder. Was put on a machine and everything. Had a long procedure, and got the urine going. Patient didn&#39;t miss not urinating. Has accidents like when she sneezes or cough. Usually gets up 2-3 times at night to urinate. When she finally realized she couldn&#39;t urinate, the doctor kept her there for a long time, eight hours. Was put on the machine, thought she may need a catheter. Her bladder was massaged in order to get her to urinate. Patient only had the left kidney. Correct problem about the urine. Doctor told her to make sure she goes back for second dose on 23Feb2021, but she was afraid. In the morning she was a little better, couldn&#39;t handle this. Patient was very weak and tired. One night she was in the emergency and didn&#39;t sleep because of the procedures. Patient didn&#39;t think the needle went in all of the way when the nurse administered her vaccine. Sensation started on the left, went across her chest, straight down like an arrow. Like something was trickling down to the end of her foot and stopped. Patient had symptoms every night since. So severe patient thought she was burning up. Patient got worse every night and didn&#39;t get any better. Patient said feeling at COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was not a natural thing. Last time she was in the hospital her blood pressure went up to 184. After COVID-19 Vaccine patient lost a little weight. Same time had this problem, was seeing a doctor with a colon specialty. Had so much constipation for a long time and tried to correct it with mediation. Medication was too strong and gave her diarrhea. Doctor thought maybe she had colon cancer. Stopped the medication. Wasn&#39;t 100% healthy, but that was just cramps. Patient eats very little now, not very hungry. Patient feels good in her bowels after something good from a restaurant. Patient attempted to clarify the medication that was too strong. She stated it was over the counter. She stated it was something that had to be mixed. She was supposed to take a cap full and mix it with 8 ounces of liquid. Needed something to make her have a bowel movement. Only took it for two days. Was way before the vaccine. It was too strong and she stopped it. Patient took a probiotic. After that patient was given gas relief medication called: Gas Relief Extra Strength Simethicone, 125mg. Provided: V11496, MSRS 53041 REV 0417, and 883928. Patient no longer has constipation. Now it is the opposite. Now bowel movements are soft and pasty. Patient tried a stool softener that didn&#39;t work, was worthless. Was over the counter. Patient didn&#39;t take stool softeners after the COVID-19 Vaccine. All the events started from Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                3/16/2021 Reaction from Pfizer second shot:  I received the second Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, February 23rd, 2021 around 1PM.  Early Wednesday morning I developed Gastric reflux which I never had before. As the day progressed I had severe abdominal pain that lasted throughout the day, also something I never had before. Nausea set in late that evening. Although Thursday was fairly stable, on Friday I developed black diarrhea that continued all day.  By Sunday I was so weak that a nurse came and sent me to hospital via  ambulance. After 4 days of blood tests, transfusions, a chest x-ray, heart monitor, endoscopy and colonoscopy  etc. , the only diagnosis for the significant blood loss was a bleeding ulcer.  This must have been developing on Wednesday when the severe pain began. After release from the 4 day hospital stay, I was sent to our health clinic for 6 days to regain some strength. Since I never had ulcers, I firmly believe that everything was activated on Tuesday when I received the second Pfizer vaccine shot.  Please advise on your perspective of my situation. Is what I have described similar to others who have reported vaccine side-effects?  Thanks and be well.

                                                felling dizziness; nausea; not feeling strong; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 93-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), at left arm on unspecified date in Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization and lubiprostone (AMITIZA) , via an unspecified route of administration from Dec2020 to an unspecified date at 1 DF, 2x/day as laxative..Medical history included:TIA started in Dec2020, bowel problem, fell (she fell about 3 weeks before she got the Pfizer COVID-19 shot) and some memory loss ( not serious).She wanted to know if she should receive her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine if she was presenting the following side effects: felling dizziness, nausea and not feeling strong. She was currently taking Amitiza as a laxative. She believed these side effects were not related to the administration of the first dose of the vaccine and were rather common conditions for her age , she also stated that she did not have any &#34;negative feelings&#34; with the first shot of the vaccine.   Consumer said she had an appointment today for her second shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and got a letter yesterday that said she could get it at 03:00PM today at the center where she got the first vaccination. She said that they gave the shot in her left arm for her first vaccination. She said it was very common at this age that she very often didn&#39;t feel well, and she was on a new laxative that might be causing some upset. She said she had no fever, she was not nauseated, she had no headache, there was nothing wrong. However the outcome of the events was unknown. Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events dizziness, nausea and asthenia cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. Further details about the patient&#39;s medical history, concomitant conditions and the events would be helpful. The contributory role of the concomitant laxative also cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Injection site became pink, 3X5 inches, the day following the shot.  On 2.11.2021, about 55 hours after vaccination #2, pt developed generalized weakness, nausea, and then vomited.  She was taken to bed, where she rested poorly and only dozed off for 1-2 minutes at a time and was mumbling words.  She  continued with generalized weakness, nausea with dry heaves, a sensation of marked shortness of breath, and inability to stand without support.  Complained of feeling hot and then cold.  Appeared pale and lethargic, skin clammy and complained of difficulty breathing and was irritable. Lung sounds -clear, no wheezing despite being unable to speak more than a few words at time. Vitals at 10:00pm:  HR 62, pulse weak, O2 sat 92% (normal for her), temp 101.7F (her normal temp is 95-96).  Given a Tylenol extra strength 500mg, 2.5 mg Prednisone, increased O2 nasal canula to 3-4 L/min, and cold compresses to reduce fever and discomfort.   Vitals at 10:15p:  HR 93, O2 sat 92%, BP 131/59. Discussed going to the ER, but decided to wait until the morning if not better. Symptoms continued until ~ 2am, when she was able to fall deep asleep for 4 hours.  Awoke and felt better, able to walk, but still a bit weak and short of breath.  By noon Feb 12 she felt mostly back to normal.

                                                My mother died on February 19, 2021. She had her 2nd dose vaccine on 2/11, on 2/12 it was noted that she was not able to walk, on 2/13 she was walking at 30%, on 2/14 she was walking with difficulty, on Monday 2/15 she was throwing up violently and her blood pressure dropped, so she was sent to Clinic. My sister was told she was just constipated and she had A Fib (never reported before to us). My sister was then told on 2/16 early a.m. that she had a blood clot that destroyed her colon. Due to age surgery would likely not be successful. She then died on the Friday. We are reporting in the event that the Pfizer vaccine was somehow a contributing factor to the A fib or to the Clot. She has no history of A fib or clotting prior to this incident. She was 93, and did have dementia, but was able to eat normal foods prior to this. What was unusual was the challenge in walking the day after the shot. Other than that no difference was observed until the day she was admitted to the hospital emergency room. She was a resident at Assisted Living, Memory Care, and that is where she received the vaccine. The mailing address I provided is her mailing address prior to death.

                                                Vertigo last week that stayed for five days; pain at the injection site; 2 stroke like symptoms/ like she was having a TIA (Reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack); Blood Pressure 170/130; Fatigue; Joint ache; Nausea; Vomiting; Fever 100.1; Stress; 2 stroke like symptoms/numbness in her lip; Pervasive aching; Momentary confusion; , like she was having a TIA;  Not able to answer questions; she still has not recovered her strength; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter).  A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

A 95-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 10:15 at SINGLE DOSE in left arm for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) with lot number: EL3249 on 20Jan2021 in right arm. After receiving the 2nd dose on 10Feb2021, the patient became ill on 11Feb2021, while sitting on the toilet, she became nauseous and vomiting repeatedly even dry heaves also then became dizzy and felt a tingling in my face and right hand didn&#39;t feel like the patient could get up on her own so the patient&#39;s son and daughter assisted her to her bed. She didn&#39;t know what was wrong and her daughter thought it was a side effect of the vaccine and called the nurse on call. After arriving at the emergency and was examined the patient was told she was being kept for observation since she had just had the vaccine. The patient was later told she also had a mild heart attack and to her knowledge I never had any heart issues. She could then no longer use her walker to walk because she couldn&#39;t bear weight on her right hand. She was hospitalized for 8 days and transferred to rehab and I&#39;m still in rehab. The events were assessed as serious (hospitalized and disability). The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient received treatment for the events.

                                                Gastrointestinal issues; threwup/vomiting; Diarrhea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter).  A 96-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL9264, expiry date unknown) in the hospital via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 on the left arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was concomitantly taking hydrochlorothiazide (manufacturer unknown) for blood pressure.  It was reported that the patient seemed to be okay after receiving the first vaccination when they came home that day but today, Saturday, 30Jan2021, 2 days later, she has had some gastrointestinal issues, she threw up this morning in her bed and now she has a case of diarrhea. The patient doesn&#39;t seem to have any fever, she is cool. She doesn&#39;t seem to have any respiratory problems but mostly this is gastrointestinal problems. The patient is alert but she had a bout of vomiting and diarrhea on 30Jan2021. The reporter was wondering if the agent had any thoughts about whether or not this was the reaction to the vaccine or something else. The patient did not receive treatment for the events.  The outcome of the events was unknown.

Recreational Therapist was in room with patient who was at baseline mentation at that time, and was getting patient a cup of tea.  Rec Therapist observed patient to &#34;all of a sudden slouch down toward left side&#34; and became unresponsive.  Therapist called for help, and Registered Nurse (RN) and Certified Nurse Aide (CNA) came into room.  Patient was initially non-responsive and profusely sweating and hot to touch.  Vitals  were taken (see below).  The patient then slowly became responsive after approximately 4 minutes and was visibly nauseous  and appeared like she was going to vomit, but ultimately did not.  Patient was assisted into bed, APRN was called, order for vital signs to be taken every 4 hours for 72 hours, and Electrocardiogram (EKG) to be performed.   EKG results were abnormal, indicative of infarct; APRN ordered transport to Emergency Department.   Patient returned from Hospital ED at approximately 10:45 PM same day (1/28/21), with transfer paperwork documenting  a  Hospital diagnosis of &#34;Syncope&#34; without any additional lab results or any new medication or treatment orders in the documentation.  Follow up the next day (1/29/21) by RN at the Nursing Facility--RN logged into the Hospital medical Charting system, only to find that there was no record whatsoever of the patient being in the Emergency Department on 1/28/21--no notes, no labs, no summary from a practitioner.  Patient recovered and has resumed close-to-baseline activity and functioning.

                                                The above info is available but it is as my mothers....She had a bad reaction ( very flu like for several days). I proceeded with second shot in February....she did not feel well, but just sorta didn&#39;t want to get up anymore. She slept more and more and more. Her appetite declined. I got her up and she was ravenous. She slept more and seemed in a lethargic way to take less and less interest. She was living independently and had been most of her life. We scheduled an internist report. She passed labs with flying colors....... when you are 96 they look at everything as remarkable ( will live for 10 more years). I also was not equating any of this with the vaccine. However, we could not ignore it any longer Saturday the 4-10-21. I took her to ER. She was lucid and walking with difficulty. I took her in by ambulance as she was just saying, &#34;I&#39;m so week!&#34; I&#39;m so whoozie! On Sunday they are talking immediate intensive rehab. Neurologist leave for 5 days and in next 48 hours she becomes 200% less. First delusional, then sleeps all day. He showed me an MRI that to a layperson looked like little hives all over the brain ( I had also gotten hives from somewhere on my skin that I originally equated with Covid but no one thought so. I have also had the two shots.) One week out I was looking at Hospic eand long term care placement. Yesterday they couldn&#39;t get a diagnosis for Hospice ( the person sent to sign her up). I thought what? After all these tests and  maybe it is cardio, maybe it is exchemic  strokes, they don&#39;t have a diagnosis because she hasn&#39;t changed much since 2017? We have to take this totally fine independent  woman and in one week say, &#34;She has Dementia?&#34; It&#39;s possible but what caused it? It&#39;s not age......we live until we are 110. Yes, that MRI showed me little formations of clotting all over ( no major bleed if any in a lobe). Over the last week I have been looking at her health and how we just slowly went downhill. It&#39;s easy to blame a vaccine, but still..........I am saying that there were NO OTHER reasons other than she didn&#39;t seem to tolerate the shots well........first was acute, and the second was long term and slow...........

Daughter states that over the last several weeks her behaviors have been worsening and been more difficult to deal with.  These include her getting up at night and sundowning as well as yelling and screaming during the day.  Daughter states that she gets in the shouting matches with the patient during the day.  Daughter breaks down and starts to cry when discussing that she thinks her mother will need long-term placement as she is having a difficult time dealing with her behaviors.

The patient&#39;s medical history included arthritis, she is in a wheelchair (can&#39;t walk), gallbladder out a year ago (2020) and she her right hip replaced. No family medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient usually sleeps well. Clarified she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine 12Jan2021 15:45PM in the left arm. She was fine after the injection then 13Jan2021 in the afternoon she had a headache for two hours; that night she was restless and couldn&#39;t sleep; she was so hot she couldn&#39;t keep cool. Then this morning 14Jan2021 her headache is gone but she has a little stomach ache. Mentioned they haven&#39;t brought breakfast by yet and that might help. She was planning to get the next dose of the vaccine 02Feb2021. She has been living in an assisted living facility now for three years; and she can&#39;t get outside; and has not seen her family due to the virus.

Outcome of the events headache, feeling hot, restless was recovered on 14Jan2021; stomach ache was recovering and unknown for the other event.

                                                I am the discharging physician and did not admit her but based off the information at admit: the patient received her Pfizer vaccine and developed nausea during her observation time but it was not significant enough to cause concern for the family. They took her home in good spirits and she appeared to be doing well until the evening when she became unresponsive. She developed high fevers and came to the ER with low normal O2 saturations and evidence of sepsis. Blood work showed a markedly elevated white count and an elevated lactic acid of 8 along with an elevated renal function and cardiac enzymes without EKG changes (multiorgan failure). Her COVID test was negative.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated no acute findings but likely chronic fecal impaction.  CT Head was negative for bleed or stroke. At this time is is unclear as to what was the cause of her symptoms but we believe it was presumed bacterial sepsis but this diagnosis is in question as all her cultures were unremarkable. The family opted on comfort measures rather than aggressive intervention and she was sent home with hospice.  Since it occurred so closely after receiving the vaccine I think it was worthwhile to bring it to your attention.

At 12:00 pm, she complained of worsening fatigue and blurry vision.  At 3:40 pm, she complained of loss of appetite but denied fever and chills.  The niece was unable to reach her by phone after 4 pm, so she came over to the decedent?s residence at 6:15 pm to check on her.  The niece found her lying face up in bed ?gasping for air.?  She then became unresponsive and EMS was called.  The decedent was pronounced at 8:11 pm after unsuccessful resuscitative efforts.  Autopsy showed hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with marked partially calcific coronary atherosclerosis; marked pulmonary edema; and pleural effusions.  The brain was saved for neuropathology given the history of blurry vision.
