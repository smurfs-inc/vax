This 91-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included high blood pressure, kidney cancer, cancer in her bladder 20 years ago and coughing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), ascorbic acid (VIT C), losartan potassium for blood pressure, metoprolol succinate for blood pressure, amlodipine for blood pressure, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81). Patient had cancer in her bladder 20 years ago. That was taken care of. Had kidney cancer because her husband used to smoke and blow it in her face. Had rare type of kidney cancer. It was removed. Treated for bladder cancer. Patient has had no problem ever since and that was more than 18 years ago. Patient had a fever, headache, and was very tired. Burning up on side of the body and she got all wet. This was not normal and she felt like she was dying. Patient stated she had shingles and developed post herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had pain at the bottom of her foot but it was getting worse after she received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Patient noticed the liquid going thru arm to chest and in straight line to her leg, like a science fiction movie with an injection of some kind. The doctor thought the vaccine might have an impact on the nervous system and spike the symptoms of post herpetic neuralgia. Patient spoke to her doctor but nobody knows anything. Nobody was willing to help her. Patient felt like she was dying. She didn&#39;t want to die. Patient feel the symptoms are getting worst. She was burning up inside. Her pain was around the bottom of the foot now it&#39;s on top of the foot and goes up to knee. Patient was not blaming anybody but she thought it was the vaccine. Patient was sweating, wet, perspiring all night. The symptoms usually occur at night. Patient wanted to know if these symptoms were associated with the vaccine. Patient also mentioned she developed a bladder infection for which she was taking antibiotics. Patient had Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021, about 5 days ago. Patient followed instructions before vaccine. Doctor said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) before the vaccine for a headache. Patient did that. Patient had injection and told to wait for 15 minutes before she went home. About 5 minutes, she was relaxed and sitting down. Vaccination given in left arm. All of a sudden she had a very strange feeling in her body on 02Feb2021. Something was going across the top and right side like a fluid was flowing or something strange. Then it felt like a straight line down her right foot and it stopped. Was a feeling like maybe the liquid of the vaccine went that way. Didn&#39;t have a vein going that way. Patient was afraid. She went home and didn&#39;t remember the next thing that happened. Every night she has gotten more sick. Patient had a feeling in her foot where she had shingles a few years ago. After shingles had post-herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had burning on bottom of her foot and would put it in ice water. Patient could handle that because it was just uncomfortable. After injection, she got so bad, the post-herpetic neuralgia was on her whole foot and it started to burn. It went up a little towards the knee or higher. Yesterday, at times, it quickly went over to the left leg. Patient had a fever every day and every night. Patient took paracetamol to cut the fever. Patient was coughing on call but stated that was nothing and the coughing was something she had. Every night she felt like her body was burning up in side. Felt like she was burning alive. Got all wet with perspiration. She changed clothes and every night it got worse. Patient called emergency, they listened to her, stating they have never heard of anything like this. Asked patient if she wanted to go to emergency. She stated ok. The doctor listened to her story and told her it was weird. Doctor told her to give it a few more days to up to eight days. Doctor wanted her to get a urine test, but she couldn&#39;t urine, patient tried for a long time in the bathroom and only got a few drops of urine out and it was brown. Not normal urine. Next day patient called 911. She wanted to be assured she was not dying at home. Did have room available at the hospital. Patient had to sit in a wheelchair and there was no bed for her to lie down in. Last time she was admitted from the emergency. Next day she came home and had to call emergency again. Really thought she was burning up. Patient didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital and suffered at home. Next night and third night was so bad. Patient couldn&#39;t urinate anymore. She had a fever, but not a high fever, because the paracetamol cut the fever. Temperature was 100 degrees. On the inside she thought she was being burned up a live. Never got better, always got worse. Yesterday, she was in the hospital all day. Now she has an infection in her bladder. Was put on a machine and everything. Had a long procedure, and got the urine going. Patient didn&#39;t miss not urinating. Has accidents like when she sneezes or cough. Usually gets up 2-3 times at night to urinate. When she finally realized she couldn&#39;t urinate, the doctor kept her there for a long time, eight hours. Was put on the machine, thought she may need a catheter. Her bladder was massaged in order to get her to urinate. Patient only had the left kidney. Correct problem about the urine. Doctor told her to make sure she goes back for second dose on 23Feb2021, but she was afraid. In the morning she was a little better, couldn&#39;t handle this. Patient was very weak and tired. One night she was in the emergency and didn&#39;t sleep because of the procedures. Patient didn&#39;t think the needle went in all of the way when the nurse administered her vaccine. Sensation started on the left, went across her chest, straight down like an arrow. Like something was trickling down to the end of her foot and stopped. Patient had symptoms every night since. So severe patient thought she was burning up. Patient got worse every night and didn&#39;t get any better. Patient said feeling at COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was not a natural thing. Last time she was in the hospital her blood pressure went up to 184. After COVID-19 Vaccine patient lost a little weight. Same time had this problem, was seeing a doctor with a colon specialty. Had so much constipation for a long time and tried to correct it with mediation. Medication was too strong and gave her diarrhea. Doctor thought maybe she had colon cancer. Stopped the medication. Wasn&#39;t 100% healthy, but that was just cramps. Patient eats very little now, not very hungry. Patient feels good in her bowels after something good from a restaurant. Patient attempted to clarify the medication that was too strong. She stated it was over the counter. She stated it was something that had to be mixed. She was supposed to take a cap full and mix it with 8 ounces of liquid. Needed something to make her have a bowel movement. Only took it for two days. Was way before the vaccine. It was too strong and she stopped it. Patient took a probiotic. After that patient was given gas relief medication called: Gas Relief Extra Strength Simethicone, 125mg. Provided: V11496, MSRS 53041 REV 0417, and 883928. Patient no longer has constipation. Now it is the opposite. Now bowel movements are soft and pasty. Patient tried a stool softener that didn&#39;t work, was worthless. Was over the counter. Patient didn&#39;t take stool softeners after the COVID-19 Vaccine. All the events started from Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                My mother died on February 19, 2021. She had her 2nd dose vaccine on 2/11, on 2/12 it was noted that she was not able to walk, on 2/13 she was walking at 30%, on 2/14 she was walking with difficulty, on Monday 2/15 she was throwing up violently and her blood pressure dropped, so she was sent to Clinic. My sister was told she was just constipated and she had A Fib (never reported before to us). My sister was then told on 2/16 early a.m. that she had a blood clot that destroyed her colon. Due to age surgery would likely not be successful. She then died on the Friday. We are reporting in the event that the Pfizer vaccine was somehow a contributing factor to the A fib or to the Clot. She has no history of A fib or clotting prior to this incident. She was 93, and did have dementia, but was able to eat normal foods prior to this. What was unusual was the challenge in walking the day after the shot. Other than that no difference was observed until the day she was admitted to the hospital emergency room. She was a resident at Assisted Living, Memory Care, and that is where she received the vaccine. The mailing address I provided is her mailing address prior to death.

                                                Vertigo last week that stayed for five days; pain at the injection site; 2 stroke like symptoms/ like she was having a TIA (Reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack); Blood Pressure 170/130; Fatigue; Joint ache; Nausea; Vomiting; Fever 100.1; Stress; 2 stroke like symptoms/numbness in her lip; Pervasive aching; Momentary confusion; , like she was having a TIA;  Not able to answer questions; she still has not recovered her strength; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter).  A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

A 95-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 10:15 at SINGLE DOSE in left arm for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) with lot number: EL3249 on 20Jan2021 in right arm. After receiving the 2nd dose on 10Feb2021, the patient became ill on 11Feb2021, while sitting on the toilet, she became nauseous and vomiting repeatedly even dry heaves also then became dizzy and felt a tingling in my face and right hand didn&#39;t feel like the patient could get up on her own so the patient&#39;s son and daughter assisted her to her bed. She didn&#39;t know what was wrong and her daughter thought it was a side effect of the vaccine and called the nurse on call. After arriving at the emergency and was examined the patient was told she was being kept for observation since she had just had the vaccine. The patient was later told she also had a mild heart attack and to her knowledge I never had any heart issues. She could then no longer use her walker to walk because she couldn&#39;t bear weight on her right hand. She was hospitalized for 8 days and transferred to rehab and I&#39;m still in rehab. The events were assessed as serious (hospitalized and disability). The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient received treatment for the events.

                                                In ED on 2/25/21 Chief complaint: Patient&#39;s daughter present at bedside stating patient was not vocalizing this morning when she woke up.  Patient&#39;s daughter was talking to her and she would orient to her but not answer any of her questions.  EMS called and by the time they arrived patient was acting her normal self.  Daughter states she has had a very difficult time managing patient&#39;s behaviors over the last several weeks and it has been getting more difficult.    Daughter states that over the last several weeks her behaviors have been worsening and been more difficult to deal with.  These include her getting up at night and sundowning as well as yelling and screaming during the day.  Daughter states that she gets in the shouting matches with the patient during the day.  Daughter breaks down and starts to cry when discussing that she thinks her mother will need long-term placement as she is having a difficult time dealing with her behaviors.  Of note patient did receive second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday. -Patient has not been complaining of any symptoms over the last several days and daughter has not noticed cough or congestion or other signs of URI/illness -No focal neurologic deficits on exam  -Received 1L IV NS in ED  2/26/21 Covid positive, incidental finding ? tested so she could go to nursing facility -Patient asymptomatic -Vital signs stable, afebrile -She does not need treatment at this time -She will need a repeat Covid test 14 days after the original Covid test prior to going to SNF -Plan- discharge to skilled nursing facility  Discharge summary Principal Problem:   Comfort measures only status Active Problems:   Chronic atrial fibrillation   Essential hypertension   Dementia with behavioral disturbance   Recurrent falls   Dysphagia   COVID-19 Resolved Problems:   Cough with hemoptysis   Leukocytosis   Dehydration   Inadequate oral intake  Patient is a 97-year-old female with a past medical history of dementia, likely combined vascular/Alzheimer&#39;s, hypertension, chronic A. Fib, who presented to the ED on 2/25/2021 due to behavioral disturbance as well as need for long-term care placement due to progressive dementia.   She did have an incidental positive Covid test on 2/26/2021 and was planned for discharge to COVID recovery ward of SNF. She did not require medication or oxygen treatment for COIVD-19.  She developed tachycardia/tachypnea and cough later productive for blood after suctioning attempts overnight on 2/28-3/1, which did not recur.   Unfortunately, patient&#39;s overall function declined after, and she was refusing/unable to eat or drink. She was transitioned to comfort care status on 03/03/2021.   She eventually slipped into persistent sleep with lack of responsiveness on 3/4/2021. Comfort care was provided.   She had decreased urinary utput and respiratory function indicating expected progression. She was noted to not have a heart rate on 03/08/2021. Auscultation did not reveal any breath sounds or heart sounds; unable to palpate pulse; no pupillary response to light was seen; and patient did not respond to painful stimuli. Death was pronounced on 03/08/2021, 02:58am.   Deceased 3/8/21

                                                I am the discharging physician and did not admit her but based off the information at admit: the patient received her Pfizer vaccine and developed nausea during her observation time but it was not significant enough to cause concern for the family. They took her home in good spirits and she appeared to be doing well until the evening when she became unresponsive. She developed high fevers and came to the ER with low normal O2 saturations and evidence of sepsis. Blood work showed a markedly elevated white count and an elevated lactic acid of 8 along with an elevated renal function and cardiac enzymes without EKG changes (multiorgan failure). Her COVID test was negative.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated no acute findings but likely chronic fecal impaction.  CT Head was negative for bleed or stroke. At this time is is unclear as to what was the cause of her symptoms but we believe it was presumed bacterial sepsis but this diagnosis is in question as all her cultures were unremarkable. The family opted on comfort measures rather than aggressive intervention and she was sent home with hospice.  Since it occurred so closely after receiving the vaccine I think it was worthwhile to bring it to your attention.

                                                Patient, age 101, was having a period of declining health prior to vaccine administration.  This continued after the vaccine to include increased pain, inability to swallow and ultimately Patient passed away on 1/9/2021.  The physician does not believe this is due to vaccine administration, however family asked that this information be reported for record keeping.
