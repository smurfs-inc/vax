                                                About 30 minutes after the vaccine, I was driving and suddenly felt congestion, flushing and a sense of fullness/swelling in my throat. I pulled over and called my husband. I could breathe fine, but the sensation of swelling in my throat was frightening and I felt like I couldnt swallow my saliva. I also had the feeling like I might faint (hot and flushed). This all passed pretty quickly (5 minutes), and I took a benadryl when I got home and rested.

                                                Around at 7AM when I arrived at work I started feeling chills, took temperature 99.5F that is already elevated for me.  About 9:30 my temp was 101.8F and they sent me home.  I just had the chills and fever.  I got home and developed a headache and around 1PM I started feeling really dizzy. The temperature did not subside and the next day I woke up and I couldn&#39;t function, I felt really dizzy I kept laying down and drinking water, I could not keep anything down my stomach did not feel well. I felt like I had to vomit. When I sat down in the toilet then my ears started ringing pretty bad all of a sudden I could not hear anything and I passed out in the toilet. My husband found me and tried to wake me up. After that I still feel dizzy. I did not have any appetite either. I could barely hold water. The next day I was not as dizzy but my stomach was still upset but I could hold some soup down but then started with diarrhea. Employee health kept calling me everyday and I did the the telehealth appt and I also had a little bit of a rash in my chest that appeared all of a sudden red like a streak. The dizziness I had for the first 4 days, diarrhea did not come until the 3rd day and I had it for 2 days and my temperature was back to normal on the 4th day. Everything started to get better (my stomach stopped feeling queezy) around the 4th day but still felt fatigued until about 12/29/2020.

My swallowing felt slightly off however, I was not aspirated secretions. My throat felt slightly thick and I had the sensation of wanting to clear my throat. I took a deep breath and I could breath.  It started to feel like my throat was getting sore or irritated. I felt slightly warmer. I decided to wait the full 30 minutes. When I went to stand had a moment of dizziness that passed but then I felt lightheadedness for about 2 hours after the injection. My ear felt like it was warm and there was slight pressure there. My throat continued to feel irritated and still feels lightly irritated after 4 days.  After about 3 hours it felt like something lifted and I felt better. That night I was really fatigued and tired. Maybe slightly cold. The next day felt fine except for the throat irritation that still persists today.  The side where I received the injection my arm, shoulder, and chest area felt affected for two days after receiving injection.

This back pain continues today (1/26/2021).  On 1/21/2021, in the early hours of the morning, I woke to hives over my entire trunk, left arm (injection site), and left thigh.    *This subsided in maybe 10 or so hours with antihistamines.   On 1/23/2021, at approximately 1100, I felt heat in my left arm. This coincided with a heavy feeling in my left arm. When examined, I noted that my upper arm was slightly swollen, blotchy, and had a reddened rash approximately 4x4 inches. Minor itching.    *The swelling subsided by 1/25/2021, but the heat and reddened rash continues today (1/26/2021).

                                                a female patient at the hospital with appendicitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 40-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE , batch/lot and expiry unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Feb2021 at a single dose for covid prevention. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first dose of Covid vaccine on 03Feb2021 (40 years) for Covid-19 immunisation. 4 days after getting her second dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine, patient was in the hospital with appendicitis on 26Feb2021. Patient was hospitalized, and he believes the patient was heading into the operating room (OR) now.  It was confirmed that the patient had no other vaccines on the same day as both her COVID vaccine doses. The causality was reported as &#34;unrelated&#34;.  Information on the Lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: In agreement with the reporting physician, the company considers that the event appendicitis is unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162B2. Appendicitis is most likely an intercurrent condition. There is no plausible mechanism implicating BNT162B2 to the reported event based on the drug known safety profile.

I went over to find the employee sitting in the person&#39;s office in a chair. She was able to tell me she received her first COVID vaccine approx 30 mins ago. She stated she stayed there for the 15 mins after the vaccine with no reaction. She is now having ringing in her ears, feeling lightheaded, hot, nauseaus, and &#34;I feel like I am in a cloud.&#34; She denies allergies or past hx of vaccine reactions. Denies hx of anaphylaxis. She denied any sob or chest pain. Employee was holding her head. She stated she had only had some coffee and juice today and was feeling hot. BP was taken and was 112/90 and she is not tachy and no resp distress observed. Patient was able to speak to me in full complete sentences initially. Another person came over and the employee was asked if she could stand and walk. Employee stated she felt she could stand and walk and when she did this she had to hold onto something to avoid falling and she was sat back down. Emergency services was called and employees speech was slow and almost slurred at times. Emergency services arrived and transported employee.

                                                Dizzy at work around 4pm. Tightness in chest worked its way down to stomach - felling queasy and sick to the stomach. When driving  home from work, she instantly felt really hot and had a lot of flushing that felt like a hot flash. Hot all over. Had to pull over and take off layers of clothes. Sat with the air on in the car. Burning sensation when she got home felt like brillo pad  was used on face. Burning sensation on cheek all the way down to chin. Face was really on fire. Today, the burning sensation have gotten better, but her cheeks still have prickly, tight sensation. Headache at 8pm yesterday when she was trying to go to bed at the back of the head. Felt like a lot of pressure.

Took 50 hours to get out of bed and feel half normal.  Thought I was on the road to recovery when the arm pain started to increase.  No rash or swelling occurred at the sight.  It presents with pain more nerve like pain in my shoulder, elbow and radiated to fingers.  On Feb 5th the pain was so bad I went to see a shoulder specialist and are trying to figure out what is going on.  My right arm remains painful to move with nerve issues.  The specialist advise I report. In the meantime, I will follow up Monday with another specialist and also undergo some nerve testing.

                                                Anaphylactic shock? Shortly after receiving the vaccine my arm was sore and I had a severe headache. Approximately 24-48 hours after I received the vaccine I started developing a red, hot, itchy raised rash on my ears and buttocks which became more prevalent and peaked around 80-90 hours later. Approximately 82 hours after I received the vaccine, I began to feeI nauseous, dizzy, and fatigued so I stood up to get ready for bed early. While brushing my teeth, I went pale white and felt like I was going to vomit. I put the toothbrush down and got on floor. My pulse felt like it had stopped. I tried to check my pulse and I could only detect one beat every other second. I called for my spouse and by the time he got to bathroom I was passed out. I came back to after about 30 seconds and was convulsing from chills. He put a blanket on me and grabbed my Apple Watch to try to get my pulse which read in the 50s (so I assume it was much lower when I passed out). My hands and feet were tingly and I stayed on the floor until my pulse got back up. I then had diarrhea. At this point in time the rash was most prevalent and was present mostly on my buttocks but also on my ears, scalp, pointer finger on right hand, thighs, and hips. I went to doctor the following morning an my vitals, blood sugar, EKG, urine screen were stable and indicated no issues. 106 hours later I still have the rash on all areas mentioned and am dizzy, nauseous, and fatigued.

A 41-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at 01:15 (at the age of 41-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included spontaneous coronary artery dissection with stenting (reported as &#34;five years ago&#34;) and complex migraines from an unspecified date. The patient is allergic to Tramadol, Codeine and Novocaine. The patient&#39;s historical vaccinations included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EH9899) on 23Dec2020 at 01:15 AM as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The vaccination was administered in a hospital. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included diltiazem (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN),  acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN).The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reported the development of double vision on 25Jan2021 at 06:00. She was hospitalized and remained hospitalized for three days. She reports having had an MRI (date not specified) which showed an inflammatory lesion of the Pons. She further described the events as follows: Initially mild chills and headache &#34;the day after&#34; developing into significant diarrhea for four days and on and off diarrhea for several weeks. One week after vaccine vision noted to be off but no official work up developing into double vision with right gaze and head turning three weeks after vaccine. She also stated that there was a single lesion appearing inflammatory in nature found in the Pons at origin of Cranial Nerve 6. Treatment received included Solumedrol and Pepcid infusion.  Lab data included an MRI on an unspecified date which showed inflammatory lesion of the Pons and  COVD-19 testing as follows: SARS-CoV-2 Nasal Swab PCR test on 20Jan2021 and on 11Feb2021 both of which were negative. The clinical outcomes of brain inflammation, double vision, chills, headache, diarrhea, vision decreased and cranial nerve disorder were reported as recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on vaccine-event chronological association, a causal relationship between reported events and  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                After receiving the vaccination, when I stood up I felt a rush to my head. I went to sit in the waiting area to be monitored and my tongue and lip started itching. I then started w/ a red rash to the R side of my neck. My body started to itch all over.  I was brought into a treatment room and my vital signs were being taken when I started to have an increase in coughing, shortness of breath and vomiting. I was given an epipen and brought to the emergency room when I received Benadryl 50mg IV, Solumedrol 125mg IV, and Pepcid 20mg IV. Approximately 1 hour after receiving the medication my face again began to itch and I was given an additional dose of 25mg of Benadryl. My reaction resolved and I was discharged home with a prescription for prednisone.

A 42-years-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK5730, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the right arm on 31Dec2020 at 10:15 AM, at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthma, allergy, hypothyroidism, and some fish allergy. There were no concomitant medications (no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks). Patient previously took ibuprofen and experienced allergy. The patient is not pregnant. On 31Dec2020, after ten-15 minutes (10:30 AM) of receiving the vaccine, she was light headed and dizzy with some nausea. Monitored in the emergency room (ER) with high BP 140&#39;s and heart rate (HR) 110s to 120s. After an hour of saline bolus, she was better but she got nasal congestion and swelling of the face with sore throat. On 01Jan2021, after 24 hours, she got some soreness at the injection site with generalized body aches. Also she got some shortness of breath which lead to her asthma attack and difficulty sleeping. On 02Jan2021, after 48hours, she was feeling still light headed with some sore throat, chills, body aches and severe headache which lead her to go to the ER and got herself tested for flu, covid and strep, which came back all negative but her signs and symptoms (s/sx )still after discharge was getting worst especially the headache and generalized body aches. As well as congestion and sore throat. The patient had given &#34;Ivf&#34; for the events. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The headache lasted only 2 days.

They run bloodwork all normal. They told me to take OTC meclizine.  It took the edge off helped a tiny bit. I woke up 01/01 symptom free.

The day after: moderate to severe pain on the left arm that radiates to the neck and back. Took Ibuprofen in the morning. Pain was getting better as the day pass. At night, around 6 pm started to feel that something is not OK. I am not the same as before. My legs are not very strong (feeling it, not a problem that I can?t walk - it feels like). Feeling dizzy at times. Went to bed and pain on the left arm is much better. Two days after the vaccine: woke up with body aches, feeling dizzy at times, weak, nauseous. Not feeling OK. It is now around11:30 am  two day after the vaccine and I am starting to get worried. Please contact me for advise. Thanks

Remained in the observation room symptom-free for additional 30 minutes.   At home, symptoms of shortness of breath and chest tightness returned and worsened.  Throat felt tight, able to move air, however had trouble swallowing.  Voice was raspy and increased coughing.  From past experience with allergy shots, this was my cue to use epi pen.  Within 5 minutes after using epi pen, all symptoms were resolved.

Took 50mg of Benadryl PO and went to the ED, about a 15 minute car ride. Had tingling and numbness of the tongue and back of throat by arrival but still able to breath with focus. Exertion of just walking into the ED greatly increased the SOB. Was triaged, Benadryl starting to help, was able to speak a little better, 3-4 words without too much SOB caused. Was walked to a room, SOB milder with that exertion. Seen by Dr. Given IV Sol-u-Medrol and 50mg Benadryl. Was observed on cardiac monitor/Q15VS for a few hours and discharged home around 5:30. Given Rx of Prednisone 20mg -3tabs x2 days, 2tabs x5 days all once a days and told to take 50mg of Benadryl Q4H for the next 24 hours at least and to return prn.   I did need to stay on Benadryl, as the Sol-u-Medrol wore off some of the swelling in thr throat did return but not severe, Benadryl did help, along with taking my Asthmnex I already had. I also continued my normal HS antihistamines.  I had SOB on exertion, progressively better from the 6th-10th with it mostly resolved to yesterday. Body aches have continued but also progressively better.  Yeasterday1/12/21 the Rx of prednisone was completed and I did have some mild swelling /tingling in the throat/face/mouth return in the evening, took Benadryl 50mg again and inhaler used. I have an appointment today to seek further care at my primary doctor&#39;s office.  Asthmnax used again this morning as well, only mild tightness in the throat currently with mild body aches this whole time.

Overnight, I started to experience chills followed by extreme perspiration and weakness to the point that I struggled to open a bottle of water I had by my bed.  Tuesday, 1/12/2021:                       Headache, weak and tired but attempted to work.  I had to leave shortly after arriving because my symptoms were becoming progressively worse to the point I almost passed out from standing.  Upon arriving home, I started to experience nausea and vomiting x 3. Intense chills followed by the extreme perspiration still existed.  Most of these symptoms subsided by 9:30p that evening.  Wednesday, 1/13/2021:                Intense headache, weakness and dizziness.  Of note, my left underarm/armpit (the arm where the vaccine was administered) is sensitive to touch.

                                                Severe pain/swelling on R upper arm, R lateral breast/axilla and R side of the neck starting the morning of 1/14/21.  Pain got steadily worse to the point of full body myalgias, severe fatigue/weakness and severe nausea.  Almost passed out at work and ended up being bedridden for the rest of the day on 1/14 and all day 1/15 and 1/16.  Also had hematuria that developed on 1/15.  Went to urgent care clinic on 1/16 and received one bag of IV fluids and zofran for the nausea.  CBC, CK, CMP all normal but 1&#43; hematuria on U/A.  Symptoms finally improved on 1/17

                                                Sunday evening developed lower pelvic pressure which continued to Tuesday. Called my OB MFM office and was instructed to come in for a check up. I am currently 18wks 4 days (was exactly 18 weeks on date I received  dose 2).  At the OB MFM  clinic I was discovered to have a shortened cervix of 2cm. I did not have this occur in my prior term pregnancy.  Although there may be no causal link I felt it important to report as there may be an association with the vaccine and  cervical length/risk of preterm delivery.

Ibuprofen and caffeine. Day 7 I went to get a haircut thinking the migraines may be caused by heavy long hair. Day 8 extremely painful migraine, can?t open eyes as light made it worse, nausea, vomiting. Called my PCP, they recommended going to urgent care after I vomited. I couldn?t get a ride so I took ibuprofen, Tylenol, and hydroxyzine to help me sleep until it?s gone.

                                                I am going to describe all my symptoms so far in detail.  Shortly after the shot in the medical observation area I experienced mild nausea that went away for the rest of the day.  About an hour after the injection, I experienced nasal drainage in the back of my throat that lasted about 30 minutes.  3 hours after my shot, the arm pain at injection site began, followed by 6 hours later moderate to extreme fatigue that did not cause me to be sleepy or drowsy--simply fatigued.  I had enhanced sense of taste and smell.  On Wednesday, 1/27 I woke up seeming okay and tried to work at my computer from home.  I experienced light-headed and dizziness, and a headache that feels like pressure, and sinus pressure at the bridge of my nose.  I had to disengage from work.  After lunch around 2 PM I had extreme fatigue and had to lie down in bed the rest of the afternoon and evening.  I have moderate nausea that comes in goes in waves.  This morning, Wednesday, 1/28 I woke up with nausea and ate breakfast with a heightened sense of smell and taste.  I logged into work and the lightheadedness and dizziness began again (also sort of in waves, though the headache is more pervasive and less wave-like than the nausea), along with waves of moderate nausea and headache.  The arm pain at the sight of injection has significantly abated from a punch to mild pain.  The &#34;sinus&#34; or sinus pressure on the bridge of my nose seems only a fraction improved.  The headache or pressure has moved from the back of my head to the right side of my head.  I had no body aches, but this morning has mild to moderate body aches this morning in my legs and hip bones.   1/29 I woke up with 20%-30% reduced symptoms of nausea and headache, but the dizziness and sinus pressure on the bridge of my nose remain the same.  I still have enhanced taste and smell (a sensory plus it&#39;s not a distorted or odd enhancement, simply the same flavors and tastes enhanced).  The ache that began yesterday in my lower body, my legs still ache, though it feels more like numbness than an ache.  I tried doing some stretches which felt good, but my legs still feel the same after stretching.  Pain at the site of injection is reduced 90%. There are some strawberries sitting next to me, and I can smell them acutely. Yesterday, 1/30, I woke up with mild nausea and fatigue.  This nausea dissipated in the morning, but I felt too fatigued to do Pilates.  The waves of dizziness and waves of nausea returned mid-day and I had a low-grade fever of 99.4 (my temp. Tends to run slightly lower than 98.6, as I take it regularly).  The pain/pressure in the bridge of my nose has reduced 30%, but still remains.  The ache or numbness in my thighs remains the same. This morning, 1/31, my temp is normal at 98.6, but I have mild waves of nausea and moderate waves of dizziness.  The pain/pressure on my nose remains the same as yesterday.  I have some mild ear pressure.  My thigh weakness remains the same.  I am too fatigued to attempt Pilates.  Acute sense of smell and taste remains the same.  The headaches or pressure also seem improved since Saturday 1/30. Monday, 02/01 - ah back to work I woke up with moderate nausea and pretty intense body fatigue and muscle aches in my lower body.  I had to work, and I just wanted to crawl back into bed.  I worked anyway, also the fatigue tends to worsen mid-day.  The dizziness is moderate in waves, and the headache is still mild, along with that mild sinus pressure on my nose.  I was in bed after dinner but could have rested all day.  02/02 I awoke with a very mild nausea! The intense fatigue (which worsened several days past my vaccine) was mild. I was ready to attempt my regular Pilates routine, and I did it!  My muscle aches are mild to moderate (also, why are my muscle aches mostly confined to my thighs and hips I do have vague pain at the injection site, but its vague, and I use my whole body in Pilates) dizziness waves are back as I sit here typing and get ready to login online to my job staring at the computer screen is jarring to the dizziness waves and reminds me of the mild headache.  This is the best I&#39;ve felt since 1/27 through mid-day I tend to worsen and dizziness that is moderate is disturbing.  The heightened sense of taste and smell also seems to have waned a bit in the past two days, back to what I was per usual? I tend to have an acute sense of smell and taste.  *I would like it noted in light of new evidence that many people that have had COVID are experiencing intense reactions to the first dose that it is quite likely that I had COVID back in March when my learning center (I work with students age 4-adult, some of which are learning disabled and have autism) emergency closed because a client called to say she was positive for COVID.  I had taken her sons temperature the day before.  Me, and my two co-workers on my management team were also feeling sick.  I had a sore throat and chest pains for approx. a month, but at the time COVID testing was not widely available.  Since then, My co-worker has tested positive twice for the antibodies, and her husband, who was also sick at the same time, has tested negative twice.  I tested negative once for the antibodies, though given my job, my commute on the subway during rush hour my co-workers positivity, and my intense reaction to the first dose I most likely had COVID.  My boyfriend&#39;s roommate recently also revealed that he is positive to the antibodies, and he was literally sneezing and coughing in the same room with us this past summer and spring.    I think a 2nd dose of the same vaccine will cause fainting and vomiting, and the need for two weeks off of my work. This dizziness is alarming.  I&#39;m also thinking not having antibodies means nothing in terms of my body and immune system recognizing the vaccine and the virus, making me more ill than when and if I actually had COVID in March or last year.

A 42-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 22Jan2021 14:58 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination and ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 16:30 at an unknown dose, single for pain. The patient medical history includes low iron anemia from Oct2020 and allergy to eggs, pecans, walnuts and latex. Also on 15Jan2021, she fell down the stairs and thought she broke her arm and was in severe pain. The has been taking iron supplements as concomitant medications. The patient reported having hallucinations, body aches, fatigue and dizziness on Jan2021. On 22Jan2021 09:00PM, she started smelling smoke, like cigarette smoke, like her home was filling with cigarette smoke, and no one in her house even smokes. On 22Jan2021, she also had severe stomach cramps like she was going to have diarrhea, but she never did. She says she was bowed over with the worst cramps like menstrual cramps, and her left arm was in pain, more pain that it had been. She says she could feel blood surging in her legs, it was almost surreal, she could feel the blood going through her body, which she never had felt something like that before. She says that the pain was in her scapula, her left arm, all of her joints. She says she could not get comfortable, and she was crying she was in that much pain. She says she does not typically cry and has a pretty good pain tolerance. She says she was getting freaked about that, and the next morning she was exhausted (Jan2021), she would assume since she was up all night in pain (Jan2021). The following day she laid around and felt extremely fatigued and dizzy, then by Sunday she was feeling better. For pain treatment she took Ibuprofen though her doctor also prescribed her another pain pill for her arm, she was scared to take it, so she took Ibuprofen 600mg which was also prescribed to her. The patient said that she did not think it was an allergic reaction but her doctor thought it might have been. The action taken in response to the events for ketorolac tromethamine was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.

This 43-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), (Lot number: EL1285) via intramuscular route on 29Dec2020 14:30 at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety. No known allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient was not pregnant. Facility type vaccine was Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. No other vaccine received in four weeks. Patient hospitalized for stroke on 31Dec2020 two days after vaccine (Days of hospitalization: 4). Day of vaccine-6 hours after patient had dizzy and lightheaded for about 45 min then went away. On 31Dec2020 at 19:15 had sudden loss of hearing to right ear and severe dizziness, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and felt like fainting. Paramedics were called-sent to ER, had CTA which showed partial blockage and received TPA. Treatment included TPA, fluids, medications, hospital stay, outpatient follow ups, physical therapy. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. Patient has been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: Negative and Pixel: Negative on 08Jan2021. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events including stroke, dizzy/lightheaded/felt like fainting, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and sudden loss of hearing to right, and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2. More information regarding the patient&#39;s underlying medical conditions, relevant lab tests would be helpful for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.

                                                I started with under arm- armpit pain last night and this morning noticed that my glands and or lymph nodes under the left arm are very swollen- knots. It alarmed me. I have also had diarrhea since the day of vaccine and just feel over all flushed and very sleepy/tired.

                                                Around 11:30pm 1/25, I muttered &#34;I don&#39;t feel good,&#34; which reminded me of being a child getting sick. within 30 minutes of then end escalating over the next hour, I had a severe headache, bilateral, occipital, pressure in entire head and neck. The headache as also in my eyes and in my ears.  Back was also painful - not as bad as neck, but i can&#39;t explain how horribly a hope a massage could fix me.  There was no comfortable position to alleviate any of that.  I also got the chills, constantly, suddenly switching from shivering cold to so hot i needed to take blankets off - but soon as i took the blankets off I&#39;d be freezing cold again. I was also super nauseous, though i didn&#39;t vomit. I pretty much couldn&#39;t get out of bed much for 24-36 hours. During that time, i was unable to sleep as well, i think mostly due to the chills, constantly having to move about to keep warm or cool off, but not sure.      I did take acetaminophen around 10pm 1/26 (36 hours after injection)- i felt like I knew you&#39;re not supposed to, but I couldn&#39;t take it any more and it might have less anti-inflammatory impact than ibuprofen.  It dulled the pains some, but didn&#39;t make it stop. the chills and nausea mostly stopped and was able to sleep more the second night, last night.       I&#39;m now up and trying to work today (1/27). Head still has pressure headache throughout. Neck is still sore, like a pressure headache. I feel generally foggy and heavy.

I was diagnosed with COVID on 12/28/20, but was first symptomatic on 12/24. I attributed my s/s initially to the vaccine. I was eventually tested on 12/28/20, as my symptoms worsened and I was positive for COVID.  On 1/14/21 I received my second dose, my COVID s/s had been resolved since 1/4/21. On the evening of 1/18/21 I started experiencing mild abdominal pain. This progressed, on the evening 1/20 the pain was no longer tolerable. I went to the ER where I hemorrhaged and needed emergency surgery and a blood transfusion for a miscarriage. The surgery ultimately took place in the early morning hours of 1/22/21, followed by the blood transfusion.

Also, on January 6, 2021 at 1130pm I had horrible stomach pains, then started vomiting,  after I was done vomiting I felt better.   I did take 2 Benadryl and aleve to help When I got back injections and had surgeries I had the same reactions happen to me usually after 8-10 hours after I was out of surgery.  I was given medicine to help with the discomfort either through IV or Benadryl.

Then, I started to feel kind of lightheaded and my legs were weak. I let the staff know and they offered me benadryl but I declined. I waited about 35 minutes then I went home. I continued to feel lightheaded and weak for about 4 hours and I also began to fill nauseous. My arm continued to be sore for a few days and I ran a fever of around 100 from the following day 1/9 and I am still running a fever now on 1/12.

A 44-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included cutaneous t-cell lymphoma from 2017 and ongoing, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing thyroid, covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date not ongoing (lasted about 1-1.5 months; she did not have any breathing problems) and blood cancer. Concomitant medication included bexarotene ongoing for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, rosuvastatin ongoing for cholesterol, levothyroxine ongoing for thyriod. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID 19: positive in Nov2020, found out tested positive around holiday. Clinical course: onset about 26 hours after administered the first dose; onset as soon as she got back to work next day: 06Jan2021. The side effects were at their worst for at least 24-48 hours. Further described as all side effects occurred only on left side of her body: whole left side of face swelled up on 06Jan2021; left eye turned red on 06Jan2021; whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb on 05Jan2021; eye went black/left eye looked bruised on 05Jan2021; pressure in head on 06Jan2021; felt like someone squeezing her eyeball out on 06Jan2021, within the first 24-48 hours, her &#39;left leg went numb&#39;. She called to talk to physician and nurse who advised her to take Benadryl; which she did take and the Benadryl stopped the side effects; but she could not take a lot of Benadryl or anything because she was at work. She stayed at work because at least there were healthcare professionals, adults in case she passed out; at home she has 7 young children and is also raising her grandchild. The side effects did not completely go away. The arm thing was normal; The next day she was at work and had the swelling on left side of face; blackness around the eyes; arriving home she had headaches on 07Jan2021 and then her leg went numb for like 20 mins; the whole left side of her body went numb including even her vagina; left side of her body was so numb and weird and tingly feeling that she started panicking because she was driving on 06Jan2021. She calmed herself down thinking it&#39;s only the left side; you can drive with your right side to get home and be fine. It was more like left side of her body was asleep, tingling, she has never had that happen before. Everything else like the headache, flu feeling was about 48 hours later (on 07Jan2021). She had COVID already back in Nov2020 for about 1-1.5 months; the next side effects she had were like the COVID symptoms she had, like the chills and everything on 06Jan2021. She had the lethargic feeling again, her head was hurting, she felt extremely weak on 06Jan2021. Patient also felt nausea on 06Jan2021, Dizzy on 08Jan2021. Another doctor said it sounded like the side effects she experienced with the vaccine sounded like allergic reaction or Bell&#39;s palsy. Patient was asking the doctor if she could get like an Epi-pen or prescription Benadryl or something because she is afraid to get the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine and not have something to respond to side effects with. The outcome of event whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb was recovered on 07Jan2021, for headaches was recovering, chills and nausea was recovered on 08Jan2021. Outcome of other events was unknown. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                2nd shot: Very different experience. Got the shot in my left arm after work like before. I had a headache and felt tired so took some melatonin, had a hot toddy, and went to bed early. Woke up roughly 18 hours post vaccine with back aches and lower rib pain when I took a breath. Took my temp, it was 100*.  By 21 hours I had a temp of 102*.  My groin, neck, and left arm pit lymph nodes were enlarged as well. After sleeping most of the day away, it felt like my fever &#39;broke&#39; at 28 hours, it came down to 101*.  Finally I took some Tylenol at 34 hours so I could sleep from the back pain.  Woke up the next morning at 45 hours with a stiff back/neck but temp down to 99*.  I also had a swollen and reddened entire deltoid where the shot had been given (painless when shot given and no blood after), almost like a cellulitis or allergic reaction.  My left armpit lymph node remains enlarged but not as painful. Now almost 72 hours out, the only residual effects are a decreasing but enlarged left armpit lymph node, improving swollen/reddened deltoid, decreased appetite, and decreased energy level.

It stayed that way for several hours. 2 days later my arm felt like someone was hitting it over and over with a needle. I had numbing pain in my shoulder and back. I felt nauseated. It has been over a week and I still have pain at the injection site and have body aches. I am unsure who to contact and am not sure what I should do.

                                                I was given my 2nd dose of Covid-19 vaccine on 10 Feb 2021 at about 0800 am, I stayed at the facility for 15 minutes and did not have any issues at that time. My arm was a bit sore and I felt tired for a couple days following the 2nd vaccine.  On 12 Feb early afternoon (around 1100am), I noticed I was dizzy and feeling a bit nauseated like I had motion sickness.  I already had the following week off work, so I napped when I could. I have been tired as well.  I have been experiencing waves of dizziness daily now since 12 Feb (today marks the 12th day). I spoke with my PCM&#39;s team at the Spokane VAMC and they recommended I try to take Meclizine at night to see if I improve. I was advised to have someone drive me to urgent care if my condition worsens where I lose consciousness, faint, or cannot stand up straight.

This 44-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: E19266) via intramuscular at single dose on 20Feb2021 09:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was on 30Jan2021 in left arm. Medical history included splenectomy from Feb2017; pancreatic surgery from Feb2017, they removed her spleen as part of that; soy allergy; poultry allergy. Patient confirmed she had splenectomy. The surgery was sort of emergency based so knowing most likely they were taking her spleen out; she was given 4 vaccinations. In the hospital, she did break out in what appeared to be like a chicken pox type rash. The rash lasted a month and then it started to fade. She did not have any breathing sort of symptoms. The doctors did attribute the rash to one of the vaccinations, she was not clear on what vaccine caused the reaction. Ideally, she was supposed to have 2 weeks prior to the surgery so her body had time to reabsorb but she did not have that kind of time, but she had nothing internally going on. She confirmed she had no names, NDC, Lot number or expiration dates for the vaccines she received at that point in time. Having the splenectomy was the biggest thing. In the past, she did not have any allergies to medications, but did have allergies to soy and poultry. She did break out from certain food and her skin develops those blotches. She did have an extra work up in Feb2020, where they tested a bunch of food sensitivities and allergies, and nothing came back. This was right before COVID hit so she did not really follow back up after that, but she was tested for all major foods and household things and nothing came up. In her late 20&#39;s, she definitely tested for a soy allergy and allergy to poultry. She did check off yes, she had a reaction previously when she was filling out the form at the COVID-19 vaccine site knowing that she had this prior experience. She was held 30 minutes each time for that reason. Concomitant medication was none. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was no. On 20Feb2021, patient was very faint, thought she was going to pass out, eyes were watering, blotches on her neck and chest, tingly experience on her tongue and lips, severely shaking, overwhelming chills, extreme nausea. On an unspecified date, patient experienced headache, general weakness, in her legs especially, no energy, no appetite, chills that come and go, diarrhea and green colored stools. Patient received her second shot of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on 20Feb2021. She had had symptoms ever since. She had a reaction on site at the vaccine center. She eventually had to go to the Emergency Room by ambulance. Her symptoms were still going on and tomorrow would mark a week since she received the second dose. The symptoms she experienced on site were different than what she was currently experiencing. She felt like she had a true reaction at the vaccine facility site. Within 6 minutes of receiving the second vaccine, she became very faint, her eyes were watering. She thought she was going to pass out for a bit. She was told she had blotches on her neck and chest. She had a tingly experience on her tongue and lips. She was severely shaking and had overwhelming chills. She stated this happened for a couple of hours. Basically, there were 3 waves of these symptoms kind of happening. The third wave happened probably a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. At that point, she had been given two pills of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), taken orally. With the third wave, she thought she was going to pass out, which she thought multiple times before, but then with this particular wave, she experienced extreme nausea which was kind of a new symptom. The doctor on site said to the EMT that he wanted her to go to the Emergency Room. Patient confirmed she was taken to the ER via ambulance the day she received the vaccine, 20Feb2021. She was never admitted into the hospital; she was only seen in the Emergency Room for a couple of hours. She was given IV fluids, she had blood work done. She didn&#39;t have a copy of her labs but she was told they were okay. She was injected with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) via IV before she was released. A lot more symptoms came after she was released from the hospital (ER). She came home and she had just a crazy headache that she really woke up with every single day until this morning. She had been taking a lot of caffeine/paracetamol (EXCEDRIN, Lot#: H044G, Expiry Date: Jun2022) for her headaches. She experienced extreme weakness, nausea. She clarified she had weakness in her legs. She had this exhaustion, and she felt this general weakness sort of in her legs especially. She was still taking stuff for a headache, and she was taking nausea pills. She had been out of work all week. She had no energy, no appetite really. She had chills that come and go. She had diarrhea. She clarified she had more diarrhea in the beginning days after receiving the vaccine, but it was always been a green colored stool as well. The ER called and checked in and were very surprised she had been having the symptoms still so severely. They wanted her to go get an actual COVID test. She went to the Urgent Care to get COVID tested on 23Feb2021 and had a rapid and PCR test. The rapid test came back negative. She had not received the results for the PCR test yet. She was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride but she stopped taking that. The hospital directed her stop taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride earlier in the week. She clarified she was taking a generic version (Lot#: P113966, Expiry Date: Feb2021), coated mini tablets. She clarified the nausea pills she had been taking was the generic for ZOFRAN, ondansetron 4 mg tablet, by mouth, every 8 hours. She confirmed this product was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date on it. She clarified she also had been taking the generic version of TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH, it was the Up and Up Brand acetaminophen (Lot#: P122699, Expiry Date: Nov2022) gel caps, 500mg. COVID-19 rapid test was negative on 23Feb2021; COVID-19 PCR test on 23Feb2021 was unknown results. Patient asked if there was a hotline she can call or an information number where she can talk to somebody about her symptoms. She also reported this to her doctor but the doctor made it clear since it was a private practice, they had limited information. The doctor did take down similar information, she just did not know if there was any further information or a hotline she could call. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                The day after the injection I had a itchy red knot appear at the injection site. Starting 27 hours after injection I had chills, anxiety, slight shortness of breath, headaches, body aches. Today I have had nausea that comes and goes, the red knot is still present on my right arm and the redness has increased a small amount from the marking placed last night. The injection is not in my deltoid muscle or even close and I am wondering if that is at the least what created the redness and the knot.

The dizzy/spinning episodes would happen randomly when I first woke up, through out the day/night, about 6-7 times a day, and lasting  about 10 seconds. A few times I felt like I would faint. Treated with rest, sleep, drinking water, and took off work for 1 week due to the danger of driving or going outside the home.  3. I would randomly wake up with hot sweats and nausea from 01/01/2021-04/01/2021, treated by drinking water, and resting.  4.

I felt like I might need to use the restroom (soon) and I was at the grocery store.  So, I immediately left.  My house is 5-7 minutes from the store.  During this time, I experienced terrible pains in my stomach and lower abdomen.  I barely made it through my door and had to run to my bathroom.  I experienced diarrhea like I?ve never experienced in my life.  It was painful and explosive.  This lasted about 30 minutes on and off.  Mostly on.  Once I cleaned myself up, I was very tired and weak.  I felt nauseous this entire night but have not had any other episodes.  I also have not invested anything except water since this happened.

Felt like more than any vaccine I&#39;d received in my life, so decided to report just since this is a new vaccine.   About 10 hours after vaccine, chills and fever started, fever up to 101, body weakness, lack of appetite, headache/migraine. Insomnia that night, up all night due to symptoms. . All symptoms except migraine resolved over the next 24 hours. Migraine continued so I took 50 mg imitrex x 3 over the course of the next 36  hours until that finally resolved . So all symptoms gone after around 2.5=3 days.

I had axilla lymphadenopathy, dizziness, nausea, joint pain, muscle pain and periods of tachycardia when standing.  This lasted for 7 days.  The lymphadenopathy was diagnosed in a routine mammogram/ultrasound screening 9 days after the vaccine.  I finally started feeling better the week I was scheduled to receive my second shot.  I got my second shot on 1/14/2021.  Within 12 hours, I had a 101 fever and muscle aches.  I also had axilla lymphadenopathy.  Within 3 days, I was feeling better, however about 8 days post vaccine, I started to experience bouts of tachycardia and dizziness again.  As time progresses, these symptoms are slowly improving.

The patient did not visit the emergency room or a physician&#39;s office, although stated it probably did require it. The patient queried whether to receive the second dose today as her symptoms were worsening. The clinical outcome of &#34;increasingly more and more dizziness with visual disturbances/she feels things are moving that aren&#39;t&#34; was not resolved, and of nauseous, &#34;impairing her from driving/ bothering her while driving&#34; and panic were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal relationship causality between events dizziness with visual disturbances and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

A 46-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right deltoid on 30Dec2020 08:15 at a single dose for vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history included tested positive for COVID-19 from Jul2020. There were no concomitant medications. Around 30Dec2020 9:00 AM, she began experiencing extreme nausea and dizziness, extreme fatigue, different waves of chills to the point of she could not even move, sweating, severe headache, and just crap now. The patient&#39;s physician told that this is something she should report. It could possibly have been an immune response because she had possibly been exposed to COVID-19 that she probably had some sort of antibodies from then until now on Dec2020, even though she tested negative for COVID-19 and continued to test negative for COVID-19 on 2020. She smells metal on Dec2020. She has no sense of smell other than stinky metallic smell. Her taste is fine. Outcome of the headache was not recovered, of the metallic smell was unknown, of the remaining events was recovered on 30Dec2020 13:00.

                                                15 minutes and 21 seconds after shot was given, I felt suddenly very hot, lightheaded and I could feel my pulse escalating. Nurse in the post-shot monitoring tent took vitals to confirm pulse at 95, when typically 68. I was laid down and BP dropped to 110/78. Chest tightness that I am familiar with from asthma started to develop and my neck and throat and upper shoulders felt very tight and constricted. I had some trouble swallowing water as though my throat was constricted and my breathing felt shallow. Nurses provided care and I was asked to get up and sit in a chair again. Within a minute, I felt dizzy and disoriented again and heart rate went up. The tightness in my chest and throat and shallow breathing continued along with my voice becoming hoarse.  The doctor on call asked if I?d had these symptoms before and I said I had after eating shrimp years ago. He decided to transfer me to the ER for monitoring . I stayed at the ER for about an hour and a half and was monitored. The constricted throat and asthma  chest tightness did not subside but did not get worse. Doctor recommended Benadryl every 6 hours as symptoms persisted. Within a half hour of taking 25 mg of Benadryl, I started to feel improved breathing and less throat constriction and easier swallowing. After the second dose of Benadryl, symptoms were much 70% gone, except for hoarse voice abs very slight tightness with swallowing.  I had informed the injection staff prior to receiving my vaccine that I am a person with a history of anaphylaxis (not to a vaccine) that required and epi pen and overnight hospital stay in the past .

                                                About 5 min after receiving vaccine - had just sat down after vaccine and had a weird sensation: like felt like rushed through my body and then instantly my heart started racing and I felt it thump into my throat. Let nurse in attendance know and she took me to another area secluded from others and told me to relax. Sat down. Hooked me up to monitors; blood pressure cuff  and  finger pulse and she left to go get someone and she brought EMT back with her. Felt tight in chest; in neck felt like there&#39;s tightening; but could still breathe; felt heavy: chest. Neck felt tight. Felt like I needed an inhaler. I don&#39;t have it with me as I only have asthma in spring and fall. They kept telling me to calm down and I wasn&#39;t feeling nervous. I was trying to relax. EMT asked questions and he said that the same thing happened to him. He told me I couldn&#39;t leave  Event Center until things calmed down for me. Released her when I felt fine but was just really tired and kind of shaky. I felt so exhausted. Told EMT that and he told me he would feel that way if he had just ran a marathon. I had slept 12 hours the night before. He didn&#39;t tell me what my heartrate went up to.  I left event center  at 9:49 pm. Started feeling strange again when doing errands and was at store afterwards (about 30 or 40 min later) - nauseous; dizzy; sweaty, clammy. Heart was racing again. I told husband I didn&#39;t feel right. Felt like I needed to sit because I was shaky. Left and went to vehicle. As we sat in car, I told him something wasn&#39;t feeling right. Mouth was so dry. He started driving. I felt like we were driving down a tunnel.Husband looked at me and said you don&#39;t look right either. Took me to ER in nearest hospital: blood pressure high; heart rate elevated; ER           (Hospital) The doctor did lab work. Triponin levels elevated; potassium levels low - sign of a heart episode and needed to get in control. Gave me potassium and took  more blood work and troponin levels started coming down. Dr advised me not to go back to get second dose. Personal Care Dr confirmed that I shouldn&#39;t get the 2nd dose - put in my records that I am allergic to this vaccine.  The next day I had severe diarrhea and terrible pain in my arm that went all the way down and up into my neck and whole right side head hurt. (really bad headache). Extreme fatigue. Went back to work on the following Monday evening and was exhausted doing my job. When I say family Dr on Tuesday, I didn&#39;t want to be taken off work because I was in the right place where people could take care of me and I&#39;d taken time off at holidays. That entire week was a lot of exhaustion and tiredness.

At about 1:45am on 1/13/2021, was feeling very achy and uncomfortable, so I went downstairs to get some Tylenol. Rapid heart rate and sweating, so much I had to sit down in the kitchen for a few minutes. Eventually took the Tylenol, and as I was heading back upstairs, I passed out (I don&#39;t remember going down to the floor) and dropped the cup of water I was taking with me. Was out for less than 30 seconds. A couple episodes of heaving/vomiting small amounts of liquid while on the floor. Made it back to bed and was starting to feel improved around 4:00am.

A 46-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (lot: EL3247, Expiry Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 15Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included food allergic. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced allergic reaction on 15Jan2021. The patient alerted she wasn&#39;t feeling well a few minutes after receiving vaccine. The patient was experiencing being flushed, had a fast heart rate, and her heart rate kept increasing over time, despite two benadryl, the patient had allergic reactions in the past due to food, so the patient knew what it felt like, so could expect it, so the patient spoke up soon, and the Epipen was given 28-30 minutes later, and after that, the patient said her throat felt thick and she had trouble swallowing, so was taken to the hospital. The patient seemed to be getting worse, after time, after the Epipen. The patient was most likely admitted to the hospital. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Within a few minutes of vaccine, I got a severe piercing headache and nausea / vomiting which we attributed to nerves and I went to go home without reporting. During the drive the headache and nausea got worse and my extremities and face began to tingle. My chest felt tight. My body was shaking. My colleague noted weak pulses and pale complexion. I am a doctor and gave myself epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and within 60 to 90 seconds the symptoms improved dramatically. I had my husband pick me up at the office and went home. The headache and nausea worsened on the drive but then settled down significantly. I rested for a few hours, then took oral pred 20 mg at about 2:45. I noticed that my headache was back and very intense at about 3:15 pm. No nausea this time, but my left eye began itching and it was very tight / hard to breathe. My extremities began tingling and I had spasms / tremors of my muscles. I injected another 0.3 mg epi into my thigh and followed with dex sodium phosphate 4 mg IM. Symptoms resolved within about 2 to 3 minutes. I took 40mg more of oral pred. I also took 10 mg of pepcid PO.   I am still feeling well now with no headaches or other symptoms at this writing (7:30 pm), but I have another doctor with me and we are 2 minutes from the ER if needed. I am marking unknown below since it has only been a few hours without symptoms.

                                                Throat swelling; severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine; chills; sweats; nausea; This is a spontaneous report from two contactable physicians. A 46-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Feb2021 at a single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included herpes Simplex I, back pain, SI joint dysfunction, difficulty sleeping and allergy to raw tomatoes. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced throat swelling, severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine, chills, sweats, nausea, the seriousness of throat swelling, severe allergic reaction was reported as hospitalization, seriousness of the other events was reported as medically significant.  Under anaphylaxis that the patient has EpiPen at home for raw tomatoes Clinical course: she had a severe reaction to the first shot presenting the following side effects: chills, sweats  and nausea within 5 minutes and then developed throat swelling within 10 minutes, the patient was administered with an EpiPen, Benadryl and was sent to the ER where she received Benadryl IV monitored, eventually her symptoms diminished from 10 of 10 to a 6 in a scale of 10, the patient also received Prednisone 40 mg everyday for 4 days. She did have nausea and sweats. It was six out of ten in the ER. Then it went to four or five out of ten. It took four to five days to get back to normal. By five days after the vaccination she was back to normal. She had a virtual visit with a patient who apparently had a severe reaction after the first vaccine. It was set up in physical therapy office.  HCP wants to know if it is safe for the patient to receive the second dose of the vaccine. HCP mentioned that this is her first patient who has a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. She was feeling better. She was told to call her doctor about getting the second shot. The bottom line is if they acted as severely as they did she would think the answer would be not to get the second. She was better. She felt fine. She has an allergy to raw tomatoes. She knows she is not supposed to have raw tomatoes. A couple of days ago she had a dressing that must have had raw tomatoes in it because she had throat swelling. The patient said what happened with Pfizer was more. She knew it when it was happening because it has happened before. She had no hypoxia. The patient reported that her pulse ox was checked and was in the high 90&#39;s. The patient was able to swallow. No drooling. She did have nausea and sweats. It was six out of ten in the ER. Then it went to four or five out of ten. It took four to five days to get back to normal. By five days after the vaccination she was back to normal. On 23Nov2020, the patient weighed 150 pounds and her height was 66 inches. The outcome of events was recovering.  There is a causality, because it happened with 5 to 10 minutes after receiving the vaccination. She had to wait for 15 minutes. The patient had chills, sweats, and nausea within 5 minutes. She felt fine upon immediately receiving and then within 5 minutes she had chills, sweat, nausea, headache. Then within 5 to 10 minutes throat swelling.

                                                Summary: Abdominal pain (similar to that experienced years previously, but not experienced approx. 2 years previous to Pfizer COVID-21 vaccination) recurred after first vaccination, worsened after second vaccination, leading to 2 ER admission and hospital admission. Ultimate cause still not determined or successfully treated; pain continues treated by opoids, gabapentin, anti-nausea medication.  Patient has not been able to work since March 4th, 2021 (currently March 23rd, 2021).  Details: The day after the first vaccination, abdominal pain similar to that the patient had previously experienced, but which had not presented severely for around a two years, recurred quite severely for 4-5 days.  Missed 2 days of work. Pain reduced enough to resume work after 4-5 days.  The day after the second vaccine dosage (2 Feb 2021), the abdominal pain worsened again, becoming more severe and more prolonged than after the first dosage. Missed four days of work (not consecutive).  Pain worsened. 12 March 2021 visited PCP, who recommended immediate ER/hospital admittance.  ER could not any definite cause of pain (though 8cm fibroid present, thought to be causing lower abdominal pain but not upper abdominal) and released patient.  Abdominal pain became somewhat better but still continued.  March 6th, abdominal pain greatly increased, leading to ER visit and hospital admittance March 6th-March 9th, 2021.  CT scan 6 March 2021.  Relevant results:  Bowel: Multiple dilated loops of distal small bowel with fecalization of small bowel contents and a slow transition to normal caliber at the terminal ileum. The appendix is not visualized. The stomach is unremarkable. The colon is not dilated.   Mesentery/Peritoneum: Small indeterminate density fluid adjacent to dilated loops of bowel in the right lower quadrant.   Nodes: Scattered small abdominal nodes, none meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.   Pelvis: Large uterine leiomyoma.  Uterine fibroid identified as probably source of pelvic and lower abdominal pain.  Mid and upper abdominal pain thought not to be related, however, and may be related to dilated loops of distal small bowel and adjacent fluid.  Pain treated with opoids, gabapentin, anti-nausea drugs, patient released 9 March 2021.  Abdominal pain continues, partially controlled with pain medications.  Lower pelvic pain has not recurred (birth control pills started at end of hospital visit).  Patient has been been able to work since March 4th (currently March 23rd, 2021).  Patient is applying for short-term disability due to extended absence from work caused by these issues.

Then I began to have difficulty swallowing my saliva. And then the lump inside my throat started to feel larger and larger. By this time Dr  had already injected me with Epipen and the pharmacist injected me with Solumedrol and I still felt as if I was having difficulty breathing and then I was taken to  ER and I really can&#39;t remember too much after that. I was very groggy and then I was discharged from  ED about 9:30 pm.

My physical body did not seem affected by the fatigue but my brain/head felt very &#34;fuzzy&#34;. I had a hard time getting words out. Similar feeling to etoh intoxication. I was a bit off balance and dizzy. I remember shaking my head to try to clear it. I also had a very&#34;plastic&#34; taste in my mouth and felt nauseous. At the 48 hour mark (almost exactly) I felt better. At 60 hour mark brain/head symptoms completely resolved. Only experienced a very slight nauseated feeling.

I was barely able to move the left arm, and I could not bend it due to severe pain in the elbow joint. At approximately 0800, I started having diarrhea that lasted for no more than an hour. By noon the soreness and aching had reduced to a moderate pain (5/10). I was able to bend my left arm, but the arm remained sore at the elbow joint until 01/10/2021. By the morning of 01/10/2021, all the symptoms were gone.

                                                12 hours after receiving the vaccine (at 11:00pm on Saturday), I woke with nausea, stomach pains and the chills. I was up the remainder of the night. By morning I had a bad headache and terrible body/muscle aches. I was unable to report to work that day. By midafternoon, the nausea and stomach pains subsided, all other symptoms remained along with then getting a 100.5 fever. I was taking Tylenol every 4 hours since 1am and keeping hydrated. By midnight I was exhausted and was finally able to sleep. I woke the following morning with a dull headache and just felt achy. I felt much better by that evening (now Monday). Tuesday morning I woke with discomfort to my left armpit and clavicle area. I then noticed swelling, the areas felt ?lumpy? and were very tender to touch. That lasted about 2 days.

It took three days for the symptoms to go away.

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL0140), intramuscular in left arm on 20Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination was administered in a hospital. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Medical history included hypertension, overweight, and known allergies to bee stings and hair dye. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included multivitamins. On 20Dec2020, within 15 minutes, the patient began feeling dry throat, then itching, then it felt like she had a lump inside her throat. Then she began to have difficulty swallowing her saliva. And then the lump inside her throat started to feel larger and larger. By this time, the doctor had already injected the patient with Epipen and the pharmacist injected her with Solumedrol and she still felt as if she was having difficulty breathing and then she was taken to ER and she really can&#39;t remember too much after that. The patient was very groggy and then was discharged from ED about 9:30 pm. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date. Treatment for the events included epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of feeling dry throat, itching, felt like having lump inside her throat, having difficulty swallowing saliva, difficulty breathing and very groggy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I was vaccinated at 3:30pm .  At 5:27pm while driving home i felt a cold sensation in the back of my neck and back of my throat which began spreading to the back of my head . My heart felt as if I was startled by something.  I looked at my smart watch and my heart rate was 145.  I began trembling and having abdominal cramping . The back of my head felt like I had swelling or collection of fluid.  I opened my windows and began taking slow deep breaths to bring down my heart rate . It took quite a while to get it below 100. I felt as if I was going to pass out.  After deep breathing for what felt like atleasr 15 to 20 minutes , my pulse came down and I closed my windows . As soon as my body warmed back up in the car , the symptoms returned and my heart rate went back up to 130s , 140s . I had to keep my windows down and deep breathe the entire way home which took an hour . My body was trembling.  When I got home I felt as if I was too week to get out of the car . I still felt that startled feeling in my heart and was afraid of what could happen next . My lips and face were swollen.  My lips were also slightly itchy. I called 911 for help . By the time they arrived my vital signs had stabilized but I still had swelling in my face and lips . My EKG , vital signs and oxygen levels checked out normal so I did not go to the ER. That night I took benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 2 post vaccine the collection of fluid or swelling in the back of my head had now spread to the top . That night I had the feeling that my throat was swelling do I took benadryl and Tylenol and my face and lips were still slightly swollen . Day 3 post vaccine I woke up with slightly blurry vision. The swelling in my head now feels like it has encompassed my entire head and have a slight headache.  I went to the urgent care requesting an MRI of the head and an epi pen . I was given Medrol dose pack , an RX for epi pen for emergencies and advised to continue benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 4 post vaccine,  slight headache continues. Slightly blurry vision

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 11:00 in left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Patient take medications for mood and sleep with were very low doses. But she didn&#39;t have any medical problem. She took 10 mg of fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC), 150 mg of bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN) and 10 mg of doxepin for sleep. Yesterday after the vaccination towards the end of the day (09Jan2021 approximately 11 o&#39; clock am), she developed a stomach ache about 5 pm and it went on throughout the night and she normally didn&#39;t have issues with her stomach. Maybe it was because she was hungry because she went ice skating with her son where they wore mask in the afternoon yesterday and she was feeling perfectly fine. But when she came home, she noticed her stomach started hurting at 5 pm and she wondered maybe it is because she was hungry. And after she ate it was still bothering her and then it got progressively worst in the middle of the night where it would wake her up periodically. But she was so fatigue that she was able to sleep still. But she noticed in the middle of the night that her stomach would wake her up because it was aching and cramping in the middle of the night. And then she also had some sweating in the middle of the night as well as some pain behind her eyes. And today (10Jan2021) she had some fatigue which she noticed was not usual, she had mild headache which she saw was a common side effect. And then in the morning (10Jan2021) some fatigue and weakness like when she walked to the bathroom it was hard for her to walk. And when she went to use the bathroom she had some loose stools which was not common for her unless at all she was sick or have eaten something that makes her stomach really sick which was very unusual for her. Her stomach was still hurting her, if she walked it will start getting cramped so she was sitting down. The only thing she toon this morning was 2 acetaminophen medicine tablets because she was having pain behind her eyes when she woke up. She was just going to say she had influenza type A and type B on several occasions. And these symptoms are similar to when she had type B influenza, which was not as difficult as type A. So this is, they seemed to be like a mild version of type B influenza which she had terrible stomach issues, diarrhea and fatigue and pain behind the eyes from type B influenza. She had not any sickness because she work from home and she had limited field contact. So, she hadn&#39;t had illness from past year now. Because she worked from home. She provided mental health counselling remotely. So, she didn&#39;t think it could be attributed from anything else. The left on arm which was up toward like shoulder area and it was sore but it was tolerable in Jan2021. Outcome of stomach ache/stomach cramping was not recovered, and outcome of other events were unknown.

A 47-year-old female patient received first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EI1686; expiry date: unknown) intramuscular in the right arm, on 04Jan2021 at 12:00 at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetic/ diabetes diagnosed in 2015, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, all prior vaccination. The patient has no relevant family history. The patient has no concomitant medications. Patient has no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The patient received the first shot of the vaccine 04Jan2021 at 12:00, and she started feeling unwell during the weekend (Saturday; 09Jan2021). She&#39;s still experiencing these symptoms: fatigue, nausea, sore throat, and she&#39;s feeling worse. She called the COVID hotline because she was having fatigue and nausea. They told her to call her PCP and call Pfizer to report. After first dose on 04Jan2021, she felt ok over the weekend. She was just fatigued last night and had nausea and her throat hurts. She wanted to know about getting her second shot that is scheduled for 26Jan2021, if it is recommended or not. There was no prescriber. She received the vaccine through work clinic. She was extra tired this weekend, so Saturday would have been the start for that. She went to bed early and that was when the nausea started. It woke her up. Her throat hurt off and on through winter. But last night, it was worse than it has been. It comes and goes without any medication or anything. She was sure it was given in the muscle. NO emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office required. She called COVID hotline and they are making her go to the doctor before she can return to work. She has not gone yet. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 47-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot Number EL3249, via an unspecified route of administration from 25Jan2021 14:00 (at the age of 47 years old), Dose 2, as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included she had her tonsils out on an unknown date. She was a nurse that works with COVID patients; she got tested twice last week (Jan2021), both were negative. She had no pre-existing medical conditions. She has never had a problem with vaccines. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously received dose 1 of BNT162B2 on 04Jan2021 (Lot # EX9231) and experienced no reaction then. The patient had the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine around 2 PM yesterday (25Jan2021) and she kept moving around in bed and feeling sick last night. That night she was just tired and achy but she thought that could just be from working. She went to bed early and she woke up around 1:50 or 2 AM with chills so she went and got a thermometer. She woke up at about 2 AM (26Jan2021) with a 103 fever and chills and her right carotid on her neck felt swollen and her face felt swollen, but her right carotid hurt. Her skin just burns; she went to take a shower. With the skin burning she knew it was sore to touch but when she got in the shower, that was when she noticed it hurt. She was really achy; her legs were aching and she was having shooting pains in different spots. She commented that she called out today (26Jan2021), she never calls out; all she wanted to do was take a shower and she wondered if she needed to go to the doctor. Her skin burns even when she was showering; every part her skin burns. She was also having muscle and joint pain and cough and the back of her ribs hurt (Jan2021). The other thing was nausea (Jan2021).  The fever and chills were persisting and were about the same. She was hoping for it to go down so she could go to work to tomorrow (27Jan2021). The clinical outcome of the fever, chills, and her right carotid on her neck felt swollen and hurt was not recovered.   The clinical outcome of feeling sick, tired and achy, face feels swollen, skin burning, muscle and joint pain, cough, back of her ribs hurt, nausea, and shooting pains in different spots was unknown. The reporter states she thinks what she is reporting was directly related to the product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of the reported events cannot be excluded.

                                                I was diagnosed with shingles on my left side on 12/31/2020, with symptoms (burning/skin sensitivity on my back (probably on 12/27, definitely by 12/28 progressing to waves of pain in my back to abdomen).  On 12/30, a rash appeared on my abdomen starting below my navel and going around my left side to about an inch before my spine.   I submitted a picture and it was diagnosed as shingles via a virtual visit.  It is  responding to antiviral therapy, although I still have a rash and pain (but improving). I did not go through the COVID vaccine side effect virtual visit route because I did not really think it was a side effect and knew I had a history of chicken pox and have been experiencing ongoing stress.  The provider for the virtual visit told me to still report it for it to be investigated, but she too, thought it was likely unrelated, but still should be investigated.

A 48-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) Lot #EH9899, via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 at single dose by injection in the right deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included borderline hypertension from 2018 and ongoing.  Concomitant medication included olmesartan medoxomil (BENICAR) from 2018 and ongoing for borderline hypertension. The nurse reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine last 16Dec2020 but tested positive via Nasal Swab test on 24Dec2020. She said this kinda weird. She received the COVID vaccine on 16Dec2020. She tested positive for COVID on 24Dec2020. Obviously she was exposed to COVID prior to the vaccine. She was scheduled to have the 2nd dose on 05Jan2021 but her hospital deferred it to 23Mar2021. She was asking if this was what&#39;s recommended.She said this was another weird thing, regarding the weight last week she was 167 and this week she was 180 (in Dec2020). She was very bloated in Dec2020, it was bizarre. He husband did not receive the vaccine and had symptoms on 24Dec2020. She had normal seasonal allergy symptoms. She did not think much of it. She took her Xyzal and her normal things.She took her husband to get tested and he tested positive, so she got tested, and was positive. She worked at (address withheld), and all of her patients were immunocompromised. She was shocked. She did not think this had anything to do with the vaccine. If anything, it has helped her fight the virus.By Christmas day 25Dec2020 her fever was 102, she had body aches, she went into overdrive. She had headaches and lots of gas in Dec2020.She went into overdrive from partial recognition from the vaccine.She was very very weak, almost lethargic. Her O2 saturation have stayed good around 98% in Dec2020. She has done really well. Yesterday or the day before she felt really bad again. She did a virtual visit with (name withheld), and the doctor started her on steroids and gave her an inhaler just in case she needed it. She felt better on 30De2020. On 29De2020 she was so bad and bloated, she only had one dose of the steroids, but had unusual weight gain. Then 2 pounds were gone this morning on 30De2020.She had no pitting edema or edema period. She was very fatigued, but had more energy this morning, probably because of the steroids. She had the vaccine, even though day 7 post-injection, instead of day 10, which was about 50%, her body reacted more so than her husbands because her body recognized it. The outcome of the events was unknown. She was unsure of the outcome. It was up and down. She has felt worse and she has felt better. The reporter considered the event Tested positive for COVID was Not serious and unrelated to the BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: While reporter causality is noted, a possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

                                                On January 4th we were made aware of the following: A few minutes after receiving the vaccine at 8 am on 12-23-2020, the associate suffered from a severe headache 8/10, tingling sensation, BP checked Systolic in 180s, Extremely weak and tired, Severe nausea and dry heaving. Rapid response called, and associate was sent to ER.   Headache 7/10.  1 gram Tylenol. Associate states ?Shaking, and I experienced delayed response when questioned by staff. 1 liter saline. Hives treated with Benedryl. In ER from 8am to 11:30am. It was determined that this was not an anaphylactic response. Associate went home with a headache 4/10. Groggy all day from Benedryl. I still have headaches constantly in frontal lobe. The headache pain Can rise from 2 / 10  to 8 /10. The constant headache is in the left frontal lobe. When the headache increases, It radiates into the temporal area as well.  Dec 31, I went to Patient First. I was given Toradol IM, but the headache didn?t go away. I was given Flexeril, but it doesn?t help the pain. I am now using Excedrin to take the edge off. Associate is awaiting physician?s return call, but Dr. is out of town. Another doctor in the clinic would not see associate, as they don?t cover other physician?s patients.  No fever, no respiratory symptoms.

Seemed to subside after 30 minutes . However throughout the rest of the day, waves of similar symptoms recurred predominantly tachycardia and GI along with skin sensitivity. Overnight did ok, but the following morning, again re urged with sustained tachycardia at which time sought ED evaluation. Had one episode in ED with HR in 151, other vital signs maintained. Received solumedrol and Benadryl. After treatment and monitoring without recurrence, discharged home on prednisone , Benadryl. Ativan if needed.

                                                I waited 15 minutes and was fine. As I was driving to my work, my injection site began to hurt severely and I felt my throat swelling, it became increasingly difficult to swallow. My tongue felt larger and my lips and face began to feel numb. I felt flushed and I became tachycardic. It lasted about 45 seconds and then waned and then would flare again.  I was able to speak and called my husband (a physician) who stayed on the phone with me while I drove to the hospital. I went straight to an outpatient unit and was given hydrocortisone IV, loratidine PO and famotidine. By the time I was on the unit, my throat only felt slightly tight with tachycardia down to 103. Following the injection of steroids, I only had one further flare of throat tightness and tachycardia that was transient lasting 30-40 seconds. Everything resolved within 40 minutes of receiving therapy. Of note, I apparently had erythema on the anterior of my neck which corresponded to the area of throat tightness.

I?m thankful I could receive it.

A 48-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number not reported, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, from 05Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure (abnormal).  Concomitant medication included ongoing hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure. On 06Jan2021, the patient has had body aches, headache and no appetite. On 08Jan2021, she had diarrhea. She was going to work today but was unable to because she had to run to the bathroom. She has gone to the bathroom 6 times. She called her doctor at 7:30am but has not heard back. She is unsure what to do. She is asking if these are side effects of the vaccine. She is unsure if the lot number on the card is SK4176 or PK4176. Outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

I had blood work 01/14/21 and an ultrasound 01/19/21, both showing no signs of common bile duct blockage or pancreatic issues.

A 48-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 07:50 at a single dose on Left Upper Arm Muscle for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid disorder and antidepressant therapy. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid disorder, duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA) as Antidepressant and multivitamins. The patient stated that she is calling about the COVID Vaccine, she just had the shot at 7:50AM this morning. After getting the shot she heard that she is not suppose to get the shot if she had tested positive for COVID before the vaccine. She wanted to know if this was true or a rumor. Back around Nov2020 she did test positive for COVID. It was the week before the holidays on Wednesday 18Nov2020 when she lost taste and smell, she then got tested on 19Nov2020 Thursday then got results Friday or Saturday morning, the weekend before the holidays that she was positive. The test was a nasal swab. The girls in the office said she was not suppose to get the shot if it had not been 3 months. When she had COVID shot they didn&#39;t tell her if she could take it or not. This morning she woke up everything was fine, she drove over to get vaccine, after they put the vaccine in, they made her wait 15- 30 minute, while waiting she was getting a headache, then the headache went away and she then felt funny in the head. She was a little nauseous then that went away. Then she had this overwhelming feeling of tiredness like she could go to bed. She felt bad a little bit. When she then drove back to work at the school she had this funny taste in the mouth. Her boss wanted to call and see if this is all normal. The date of first dose was 13Jan2021, all the symptoms she experienced occurred within half hour of receiving the vaccine. She thinks she is fine. At the moment she does not have the taste in mouth any longer and her headache left. She still feels funny in head as well as she just feels bad inside, she has the feeling of overwhelming tiredness, she just feels like something is coming on, like she knows she is getting sick. She has no Lot or Expiry to share, she vaccine CDC card is outside in the car and not physically with her. Her drive to get the vaccine was an hour away to a Hospital and all the medication was taken an hour before. She went to the hospital to have the vaccine administered. Then she drove to work at a school. She has had an antibody test, in which they draw blood, it was negative but that was even before she caught COVID, it was back in Aug2020 or Sep2020. She has had no issues with vaccines in the past. The outcome of the event headache, a funny taste in the mouth, and nausea was recovered on 13Jan2021, tiredness/overwhelming feeling of tiredness was unknown, feeling &#34;funny&#34; in the head was not recovered. The events were assessed as non-serious.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Was told is was shingles but wasn?t treated. Was told to get the second vaccine in the opposite arm to see if the same thing happens.  Received 2nd injection in left arm and ended up with full blown symptoms of COVID.  Uncontrollable shakes, cold, fever, severe body aches, cough, diarrhea and the rash still remains.  As of today, I have an upper respiratory infection as well as the open rash, which the PCP listed has taken control of and deemed the cause side effects of the second injection.

It actually started yesterday (22Dec2020) and she took the vaccine two days ago (21Dec2020) and it is on the same side as her injection. So it is on her left side on her left eye and the injection was given on her left Deltoid. It seems to be getting a little better now though the sensation by touch is not as much as it was this morning or yesterday. So she think like it is like going away but it is just something that she think may be should be looked at as one of the possible side effect. She did get neck pain, headache, and bit of headache. She think she was a little bit feverish and nausea and joint pain and a lot of fatigue. She had a harsh soreness around her both temples and her face was like when smile or laugh it was sore.

                                                throat swelling; Initially had headache; dizziness; irritability; Throat tingling; difficulty swallowing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP) (patient). A 49-year-old female patient received a single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot#: EJ1685) as the first dose via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Dec2020 06:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia, asthma, prediabetes, and carpal tunnel syndrome. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were not any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient had no previous allergies to vaccines. The patient allergies to medications which included: doxycycline, medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO-PROVERA), metoclopramide (REGLAN), gluten. The patient initially had headache, dizziness and irritability, throat tingling, throat swelling, and difficulty swallowing started around 12 hours after injection, event onset date reported as 29Dec2020 18:00. The events resulted in emergency room/ department or urgent care. The events were reported as non-serious by HCP. Treatment received for the events included diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine embonate (HYDROXYZINE PAMOATE). The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported pharyngeal swelling together with other symptoms was likely related to the single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                After the awcond vaccine:  Woke up at 4 am the next morning with body aches, chills, nausea and a mild headache that was intermittent.  I had malaise and fatigue.  I took some cold medicine 3 times in the course of 24 hours and woke up the next morning with none of those symptoms but did have lympadenopathy under my left arm that decreased through the course of the day.  It was painful to touch and tender once the lymph node decreased in size.  The only other reaction was the site pain and tenderness and warmth.  That lasted a few days.

                                                I woke up early in am (2:35am) with terrible bone pain, joint pain, it hurt to MOVE.  My pain level was 8 out of 10.  When I tried to get out of bed, I was dizzy and had to hold to the walls to make it to the bathroom.  I had severe dry mouth, nausea, muscle weakness, loss of appetite and chills.  I was unable to go to work.  The symptoms did not begin to subside until later in the evening the next day around 6:30pm.  Today I am still weak but making it.  Still having chills, and some minor muscle aches and spasms.

A 49-year-old female (not pregnant) patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: ek9231) second dose on 06Jan2021 on left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism and allergies to penicillin. Concomitant medications in two weeks included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), liothyronine, magnesium carbonate (MAG 2), trimebutine maleate (MOTRI), zinc, curcuma longa (CURCUMA).

Not sure if related to vaccine. No COVID prior vaccination. COVID tested post vaccination (Nasal Swab, PCR) on 17Feb2021 and result was Negative. The outcome of the event was recovering. AE resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization]. Hospitalization for 2 days. Patient received symptomatic management as treatment.; Sender&#39;s Comments: It is unclear what was the indication for the mentioned &#39;steroid epidural with contrast &#39; performed one month after the second dose of BNT162B2. The reported systemic reaction with numbness, tingling, extreme nausea, headache, thirst, palpitations, hypertensive crisis, changes to color of extremities, cold/heat intolerance, extreme thirst, mental fog, diuresis, inability to eat or sleep seems attributable to the reported procedure, or the unspecified indication for the procedure, rather than BNT162B2 vaccine.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Vaccine received at 11:40 AM. At approximately 9pm I began to experience whole body chills, teeth chattering, and extreme fatigue. I took Ibuprofen and went to sleep. I experienced chills until approx 3 AM. My watch alerted my heart rate rose above 120 bpm three separate times during the night in the 1, 2 and 3:00 hours. Upon review of the summary it appears to have been sustained at just over 120 for that entire time. I awoke at noon, with a temp of approx 99.5 F, I felt extreme fatigue and a sense of cold but body was warm to touch and I was very sweaty this entire time. I slept most of the day and at 5 pm awoke with a temp of 102.4F. I contacted my physician who directed me to use tylenol and Benadryl. I took a dose at 5 pm, anther at 9 PM. Upon waking the next morning I was afebrile. At that time I felt slightly dizzy and lightheaded but also dehydrated. Forcing fluids relieved symptoms. I experienced a very mild headache and very mild queasiness as well.

A 50-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: E10140), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Diabetic for at least 7 years, ongoing hit in the head (She was a psych nurse and was hit in the head at work maybe a month to two months ago in 2020.  She did have headaches from that incident). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced headache on 23Dec2020, fever on 24Dec2020 14:30, nausea on 23Dec2020, cough on 24Dec2020, really lazy on 24Dec2020, chills on 24Dec2020 14:30, body aches on 24Dec2020, sometimes her headaches were migraines on an unspecified date. Specifically, it was reported that when she first got the vaccine, she didn&#39;t have anything but a headache and a little bit of nausea. She had worked the night before and didn&#39;t sleep before the shot. So maybe that had a part in it. She was a diabetic. It was fine, and no big deal that night. Then, the next day on 24Dec2020 at 2:30 pm she woke up and she was freezing and couldn&#39;t get warm. She had chills and a fever of 102.1 on 24Dec2020. She took Tylenol, and it came down to 101 on an unspecified date in Dec2020. All weekend long, she has had a fever. It has been controlled by Tylenol. She had chills so bad she had to use her heated blanket. She has had a cough. She has been really lazy. She has had chills and body aches. She has had nausea here and there. She has had a headache. She received the vaccine on the 23Dec2020, which was Wednesday. She had to stay 15 minutes after. That is when she developed the headache and nausea. Sometimes her headaches were migraines. She developed the fever on 24Dec2020 14:30. Or noticed the fever when she woke up. Her fever was 101.2 this morning on 28Dec2020. Within the 15 minutes of getting the vaccine, she developed the nausea. It has gotten better. Her body aches are getting better. She still has chills when she is running a fever. She has gotten better overall. Thursday (24Dec2020), Friday (25Dec2020), and Saturday (26Dec2020) it was awful. Sunday (27Dec2020) the symptoms lightened up. Today (28Dec2020) she was better. She still had a headache and fever this morning, but nothing like she had been feeling. She felt like dying those days. She was a Psych nurse, and she got hit in the head. So she did get headaches from that incident. They are about the same as these headaches so she didn&#39;t know if it was related. It just went along with the flu like symptoms. But sometimes these headaches were migraines. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever and chills. The outcome of the events headache, chills was not recovered. The outcome of the event really lazy was recovered on 27Dec2020. The outcome of the events fever, nausea, cough, body aches was recovering. The outcome of the event migraines was unknown.

The detail clinical course was provided as following: the nurse reported side effects and want to verify if side effects that &#34;keep coming and going back every couple days&#34; are &#34;normal&#34;. Received first dose last 17Dec2020 and felt side effects on the evening. Returned on Monday last week, lasted until Friday, and back on 06Jan2021.

I drank some water and sat up in bed for a while.  The pounding heartbeat settled down in about half an hour.  I did not take Advil or anything else because of the nausea.  Later in the morning I had some nasal congestion.  Symptoms persisted but slowly waned until 6:00pm that day.  After that, fatigue was the only symptom that lasted until about the 48 hour mark.

                                                Received the 2nd shot on 2/11/2021. I started feeling a little &#34;off&#34; later in the evening. I woke up at 0300 with severe joint pain, headache and chills. Nausea started shortly afterwards. The joint pain was excruciating and it was very difficult to move. By 0330, I started vomiting. Vomiting continued until approximately 0745. I felt dehydrated but was not able to hold down any water. I contacted the Nurse Advice line and spoke to a nurse. She asked me a series of questions, all relating to signs indicative of an allergic reaction. I knew I was not experiencing a typical allergic reaction. But I was experiencing a bad reaction. Based on my responses to her questions, she did not recommend that I go an Urgent Care Clinic or see a Doctor. The severe joint pain continued through 02/14/2021. I started to feel better on 02/15/2021. Even though I did not experience an allergic reaction, given the severity of my joint pain and vomiting, I still feel it is important for what I did experience to be documented. Thank you.

She got chills last night on 06Jan2021 and her body was not feeling well, she felt like she was getting the flu. Her joints were sore and her head started to hurt. The nausea, light headedness and tired feeling got worse last and she went to bed even earlier that night. She took her temperature this morning, she didn&#39;t take it last night as she knew she would get some symptoms from the shot, and she had no fever. Sometimes got light symptoms from the flu vaccine that she got every year, she had no product name, NDC, Lot, or Expiry for that product. When she woke up her head was still killing her but felt sickly. She went to work, she just thought she would power through it but she felt like she could go home and go right to sleep. The day of the shot she took a One a Day Women for 50 and over and a Zyrtec. Yesterday morning she took the Zyrtec but not the vitamin and she didn&#39;t take either this morning due to her stomach. She was told she should take Tylenol so maybe she would take that today. It was also noted that her left upper arm was sore where she got the shot on 05Jan2021, it had gotten better today. The outcome of events feeling unwell and flu-like illness was unknown. The outcome of event pain in arm was recovering, the outcome of rest events was not recovered.

                                                Day 7 post vaccine, woke with vertigo, nausea and double vision prior to my alarm going off at 5:30am, told my husband that I did not feel right and it felt like something was wrong with me. I asked him to send a message to work that I was not feeling well and would not be in. I was not able to see my phone clearly as I had double vision.  I went back to sleep to try to get relief, woke up and called out to husband for help and he said I was just making groaning noises but I know in my head I was saying please help me as I could not move my right side and I was not sleeping or having a dream. At approximately 9:30am my husband kept telling me someone was trying to text me and needed a response. I tried to get up and still could not move my right side. He helped me sit up and I could not use my right arm and hand. He helped me get some clothes on and took me to the ED. When we arrived I still could not use my right hand and my arm still felt weak. The weakness resolved within a couple of hours and I got the strength back in my hand.   I did have some concern that my TIA type symptoms could possibly be related to vaccine but it was just a thought until I received my second dose. 3 hours post vaccine my face became numb and tingly. It remained that way until I went to sleep. This is why I am reporting this incident.

                                                yesterday started a flare up but she is not sure if this is related to the vaccine use; fever/was 105.00 with Tylenol; increased dizziness/light-headed; body aches; severe headache; nausea; chills; sweating/sweats; Fatigue; feeling crappy; blood pressure tends to be low but was 95/81 at the time she got the shot; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: no adverse effect. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 25Jan2021 this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 51-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3247, expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 17:45 at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing severe Crohn&#39;s disease, pneumonia, allergy to eggs/anaphylactic reactions to eggs, anaphylactic with bee stings on 2020 (this has happen twice in 2020), collapsed her lung (reaction to anesthesia that collapsed her lung), high fever, anaphylactic reactions. Concomitant medication included sertraline (SERTRALINE), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]). The patient previously took Hep B and experienced fever, flu like symptoms, achy, and lethargic (no issue with the first 2 doses but with the 3rd dose she had a high fever); MMR and had an adverse reaction. It was reported that the shot was given on 19Jan2021. She experienced the following severe dizziness which started that day (17:45) and lasted 3 days. It has resolved. Nausea which started that day (17:45) and stayed constant for 3 days. Now it has only been happing in the late afternoons or evenings. Light headed which started that day and last 3 days. Headache (17:45), the initial headache felt like her whole head was going to explode into a 1000 piece. Now it just starts about 4-5pm in the evening. It was better and not as severe but like a migraine with nausea (17:45), feeling crappy (17:45), and body aches. Body aches which started on the day of the shot (17:45) and lasted 3 days. Fatigue which started on the day she got the shot (17:45) and was ongoing in the evening now chills and sweats which started on the day she got the shot and was ongoing. Her husband asked about if this was being related to the change of life but she doesn&#39;t think so. Fever which happened on the day she got the shot (17:45) but not at the site, later that night and was 105.00 with Tylenol. It has resolved. She noted that her blood pressure tends to be low but was 95/81 at the time she got the shot (17:45). The patient has not taken her blood pressure and does know if this has resolved. It was relayed that she took Tylenol and Benadryl before the shot due to her history and was still taking it as treatment for the symptoms. She has a lot of drug and other allergies, the only that was anaphylaxis was bees and egg. This was why she brought 2 EpiPens when she had the shot. She didn&#39;t have to use her EpiPen and was really proud of that but did have some reactions.  The patient reported she did not go to the doctor. At this point she was somewhat expected that she had a not great reaction so the fact that she could still breath after getting it was a good thing. She also noted she could not have driven home due to dizziness. The patient was not brought to the emergency room and did not went to a physician&#39;s office. The patient has an ongoing medical history of Crohn&#39;s disease and reported that yesterday (as reported) started a flare up but she was not sure if this was related to the vaccine use. The patient recovered from fever on 23Jan2021; was recovering from dizziness, body aches, severe headache, nausea, chills, sweating, and fatigue; while outcome of blood pressure tends to be low, feeling crappy and Crohn&#39;s flare up was unknown.

The patient reported that her weight on 21Dec2020 when she got the vaccine, was 200.6, but her weight today, was 196.0 pounds. The patient received the vaccine on 21Dec2020, and as soon as she got the shot, her arm was sore like a flu shot. When she got the shot, she could not raise her arm past her shoulder without pain, but now she can raise her arm again. On Thursday, 24Dec2020, patient got a chill, and later that same night, food was not tasting right.  On 25Dec2020, the chill continued, and she had a little bit of a sore throat with a mild cough, like she needed to be clearing her throat. On 26Dec2020 morning, the patient experienced vomiting when she woke up, and the top of her stomach had a bad burning sensation, and she had diarrhea. The patient stated that while she was vomiting, she got choked on some saline and sweat ran down her face, and she had to concentrate on breathing. But the patient stated that she vomited, had diarrhea, and the burning sensation, the whole day on Saturday. The patient stated that on 27Dec2020, it calmed down, and she did not vomit at all. The patient stated that she felt like she needed to vomit, but she did not. The patient states that on Sunday, she still had the chills a little, and the top part of her stomach was still burning. The patient took some Pepto-Bismol and that helped calm down the caller&#39;s stomach. The patient stated that she could feel the Pepto-Bismol cooling her stomach off, like it had been hot, and patient stated that the top of her stomach felt swollen and gassy. The patient stated that later Sunday night, things calmed down, but she still has the burning sensation and she did not feel like she needed to vomit anymore.

This persisted at that level for the day. It continued albeit milder, for the next 36 hours. It is now Monday morning and I still have stomach pain. It is not accompanied by any nausea or diarrhea.  I do feel some mild constipation and bloating. None of this is typical for me. I have had no changes in eating that I can correlate. No one else in my family has been ill.

                                                Migraine headache began the next morning about 7am and increased as the day progressed including nausea and light sensitivity. Waves of nausea and headache continued into the next day. I had not had a migraine in over 2 years prior to this event. Treated with OTC Excedrin at first on Jan 10th, then when that was ineffective took butabital at lunch time and when that was ineffective took Maxalt with phenergan about 5p. The next day on Jan 11th, thought I was better but by 630a nausea returned in waves and headache began building again. Took Maxalt with phenergan about 930a and again at 9p.

Next day still had fever, severe body aches and cough got worse with shortness of breath. I did home nebulizer several times and started prednisone 40mg. 1/6/21 shortness of breath worsened to the point I couldn&#39;t talk, chest tightness with burning. Went into ED at hospital where they gave me another breathing treatment x 2, magnesium sulfate, IV solu medrol. They were going to admit me but I decided against it with all the covid patients.

The medical providers assessed me and since my heart was not racing and I did not have a rash all over my body, deemed I was okay.  When I went home, I noticed a rash on my chest from my collarbone to my sternum and alongside my ears on my neck.  My sister is an ER Doctor and I did a video conference with her. She had me take Benadryl.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccine nor have I ever had to take Benadryl.

She has had vertigo all day and weakness in the muscles. Chills was described as unbearable, heavy chills that she could not control. Fever: Temperature of 102-102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The high fever hit around 3:00am on 07Jan2021. When her high fever hit around 3:00am she thought she would go to the emergency room but she did not want to scare her family so she stayed home and tried to pull through it. Today she took a Tylenol after she threw up this morning just to get through the day. Since she cannot walk without assistance or walk straight today that&#39;s the only lingering symptom that really worries her; she may go to the emergency room tonight if she did not get any better. She just did not want to scare her family and the emergency room was another copay cost so she really did not want to go to the emergency room at her workplace; but she may go there tonight and be kept overnight under observation. Prior to taking this second dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she was completely fine. She expected to have body aches, chills and fever; but she never thought the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine would put her into a place where she is falling like this with the nausea and vertigo; she has never in her life had vertigo or falling like this. She reported she had no other vaccinations on the same date as Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine second dose. Has had no other vaccines in the recent past. She had never felt like this before with any other vaccines; she had never felt so weak in her muscles and never fallen down like this with any other vaccines. Seriousness criteria and outcome of all events unknown. The reporter considered all events were related to Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

She stated that her arm was still swollen, when she got shot she was fine, her arm was sore that evening (Dec2020) and then nothing, then a weekend after new years her arm and shoulder became swollen (Jan2021) and she had been to the ER and the doctor thought the swelling was because of the shot, but she also had something else going on in her shoulder (Jan2021). So in the meantime she went to the ER and they took X rays, and they told her that she was starting to develop pneumonia. She was going back to work tomorrow, being that she was on the antibiotics now, still had swelling in the arm, and had pneumonia, should she still get the 2nd shot. She noticed the swelling Saturday after New Years. She was also achy all over in her neck, arm, and shoulder (Jan2021). She felt sick to her stomach, this was all the first Week of Jan2021. She went to the ER, she was not admitted and came home the same day. She went to the ER on 08Jan2021. 08Jan2021 was also when the pneumonia was diagnosed. The name of antibiotic she was prescribed was doxycycline. She started it on Saturday 09Jan2021, she was prescribed 100 mg 2 pills a day for 10 days. When they did the X ray, they said that the pneumonia had showed up, or she was just starting to get pneumonia. Patient stated that she didn&#39;t believe because they made a comment about the way she was laying however she had been taking the medication and feeling better. She was schedule for the second dose today. She did reschedule for Friday, and wanted to know if she should still get it. In the ER, they said it could have been a blood clot and so they did a scan to find blood clots but it was negative. The outcome of event pneumonia was resolving; events left arm swelling and shoulder became swollen was not resolved. The outcome of rest evens was unknown..

A 52-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal asthma diagnosed when she was a child and has a rescue inhaler she only uses once in a while if she needs it; she stated her thyroid was giving her problem, she takes a thyroid medicine; and stated weight was thanks to menopause. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), fish oil (OMEGA 3), and curcuma longa (TURMERIC). The patient reported that she was aggravated and upset on an unspecified date. She reported that she was not feeling bad before taking the shot and nobody was telling her what to do about it. She was asking what she should do about her symptoms of joint pain, restless leg syndrome and fatigue after getting her first vaccination on 22Dec2020. She was crying and stated that her boss can&#39;t tell her anything, she doesn&#39;t want to go to her doctor because, what was he going to tell her. She doesn&#39;t want to waste a copay. She reported taking Advil and Tylenol for her joint pain without relief and asked what else she should do. She stated she wanted directions, she doesn&#39;t want people reading off of a card. She stated she shouldn&#39;t have to pay a copay and she doesn&#39;t want more medicine to mask her symptoms, she wanted an answer. Additionally, the patient was calling about Pfizer COVID shot, she took first dose 22Dec2020, had a reaction, 35 minutes after she sat for 30 minutes, she works at a hospital, and she walked out to her car, she got sick and nauseous, then after the shot, she had flu like symptoms that lasted, and the next day was terrible, it lasted another week and a half, then she took the second shot 11Jan2021, to this day, she still has restless leg syndrome, fatigue, and her joints were hurting her. She had the same thing before, but this hurts a lot worse, and it was not going away, she was taking Turmeric, everything, and everyone says to just keep taking Tylenol or Advil but she can&#39;t keep taking it because now it was upsetting her stomach, or like arthritis medicine, she was taking Omega 3, vitamins, she was 52 years old, she does Spartan races, Cross fit, she does paleo and keto eating, if one looks at her they wouldn&#39;t know she was 52, and she was hurting everyday and doesn&#39;t know what else do to, and doctors weren&#39;t knowledgeable, she doesn&#39;t want a stupid answer. She called work, the CDC knows about it, now VAERS, and they said to call Pfizer, when she calls her doctor she doesn&#39;t want to pay a copayment and get an idiotic answer. She got this because she works at a hospital and she was trying to protect herself and everyone else, she doesn&#39;t like feeling this way, it was to the point she was getting angry, not at Pfizer, but she gets up and runs, with her dog, she was busy all the time, she has 3 boys in the military, and she meets up to do obstacles with them, but she doesn&#39;t feel like doing crap and was miserable everyday. She was a CNA in nursing school. She doesn&#39;t know if she even wanted to see her doctor, she doesn&#39;t want to get an idiotic answer. She hasn&#39;t seen him in while, she switched insurance, been primary for years. Stated this was her first day speaking to DSU before she decides what else to do after this, she was angry. Stated about 35 minutes after the first shot, after 30 minutes they said she could go, she said ok, she walked out to her car, was nauseous and threw up and didn&#39;t eat that morning, and the next day, she felt like she was in a car accident, that was how bad she felt, she had cold chills, flu like stuff that night before, she runs low like 96.6 to 96.8 and she took her temperature, she got in a blanket and went to bed that night, she was 95.5, and didn&#39;t bother taking another temperature, she took a bunch of Advil and went to bed, and Benadryl to go to sleep. This all started on 22Dec2020, and it took about 2 weeks, she just had joint pain, not like now, but those days she didn&#39;t feel good, but by the third week she was ok, and she went to take the second shot next time, and all hell broke loose. The second shot was 11Jan2021, and that night it she noted her joints were starting all over again, and she had restless leg syndrome, cold chills and everything, so she went to bed, she didn&#39;t have Benadryl, so she got up, and that night took Tylenol, she didn&#39;t get very much sleep, and she was very annoyed the next day, she felt like the first time, that like she got it an accident, feeling terrible, that night, and she can lay on the couch to relax, but with the restless leg syndrome, and her joints all day long, she just went yesterday to buy Advil Arthritis, and she never had arthritis before or anything. Restless leg syndrome depends, sometimes it was better than other time. Joint pain was not improving, she was so aggravated about that, she was not feeling 100%, people look at her and say she doesn&#39;t look like she feels good, she doesn&#39;t, and she was ready to bite their heads off, she was very active, always in the gym or something, she has 3 kids in the military, and was always meeting up with them to do military runs and just this was ridiculous. Stated she took a picture of the vaccine card, as she sent it to a few people. This was definitely the Pfizer vaccine, she has told many people, many people know do not take this, she was so irritated, it&#39;s not even funny. The case was reported as non-serious. The outcome was not recovered for the events joint pain, restless leg syndrome and fatigue; and unknown for the rest of the events.

This 52-year-old female patient received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3302) at single dose on 27Jan2021 via an unknown route in left arm for Covid-19 immunization. She was diagnosed diabetes six years ago (as of 23Feb2021), and her last A1C was 6.1 in Dec2020, had chronic edema since her last child was born 26 years ago. Concomitant drugs included furosemide (LASIX) 400 mg twice daily, potassium 10 meg three times daily, omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 40 mg once daily, and metformin hydrochloride (METFORMIN ER) 1000 mg twice daily, all ongoing. She did not feel like the medication she takes are relevant because she had been taking them for a very long time. Historical Vaccine included 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL0140) intramuscular injection in left arm on 04Jan2021 for Covid-19 immunization and experienced back pain, diagnosed with COVID in between the first and second vaccine, headache, arm pain at the injection area, severe back spasms in the thoracic and lumbar (AER 2021200627).  Patient experienced back pain 2-3 days after the first dose, headache, arm pain at the injection area, back pain and severe back spasms in the thoracic and lumbar. It was sharp, stabbing, crushing pain then she would have spasms. She went to urgent care and was given Voltaren and Flexeril. She was taking 1 gram of Tylenol every 8 hours. That lasted two to three days. That started on the 06Jan2021. She thought she was doing great and then on the sixth was when it started. By the morning of the ninth it was over. The reporter assessed headache, arm pain at the injection area, back pain, severe back spasms in the thoracic and lumbar were related to suspect vaccine.  After the 2nd dose of the vaccine, patient experienced back pain in Jan2021, sharp, stabbing, crushing pain and spasms in Jan2021, fever for a couple of days in Jan2021, knees would buckle in Jan2021, glands were swollen and when swallows, sharp pain on one side on 09Feb2021, felt like the inside of her eyes were on fire in Jan2021, moist cough in Jan2021, spine pain in Jan2021, nausea and vomiting in Jan2021, numbness and tingling around the outside of mouth in Jan2021, pain in the arm at the injection site in Jan2021, injection site was about a silver dollar size and was red and warm to touch in Jan2021. The event clinical course was as follows: The second dose was given on 27Jan2021. She was getting over COVID and had to wait until the 27Jan2021 to get second dose. COVID symptoms started on 11Jan2021. She had PCR test on 12Jan2021 with results of her PCR test on 13Jan2021.  She was diagnosed with COVID in between the first and second vaccine due to an exposure not the vaccine. At hour 25 after receiving the second dose symptoms started. Severe back pain in the entire spine. It was sharp, stabbing, crushing pain and spasms. When the back would spasm her knees would buckle. She had a fever for a couple of days. 102 fever and she felt like the inside of her eyes were on fire. She has never had that before. She had a moist cough and still has a moist cough. The spine pain was better, but it is not gone away yet. Normally she does not have back pain. At first the pain was an 8 out 10 now (as of 23Feb2021) it was 5 out of 10. Also had nausea and vomiting. She had numbness and tingling around the outside of mouth. That lasted for two days. She had pain in the arm at the injection site. The injection site was about a silver dollar size and was red and warm to touch. She had pain at the injection site and pain in the arm. Both vaccines were given in the left arm because she was left-handed. She thought she would be using that arm more. She did go to Urgent Care after the second dose as well. They gave her a shot of Toradol and another prescription for Voltaren twice a day and Flexeril at bedtime because she can&#39;t stay awake when she takes it. She has missed work because of this. The back pain and cough was almost a month now (as of 23Feb2021). She reported no matter what she did she did not get it to go away. She did a zoom call with her doctor because of COVID symptoms and because she took vaccine. She took 1000mg of Tylenol prior to receiving both doses and thought maybe it wouldn&#39;t hurt and would keep her from getting a fever. She has been taking 1000mg Tylenol three times a day and now she was taking it two times a day.  She used Tylenol and generic, SunMark Acetaminophen (Lot number: OLE2349B, expiry: Sep2022). Regarding seriousness of headache, made a different in the vision. It was throbbing. for back pain: it was seven out of 10. It was disabling. She had to miss work and could barely walk across the floor. for arm pain at the injection area: gripping was not easy and moving her arm was painful. She is left handed. Heat worked better than ice.

Medical history included MS and transverse myelitis, and peanuts allergy. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination. Concomitant medications included lamotrigine; amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL); and ocrelizumab (OCREVUS); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the dose 1 BNT162B2 administered in right arm on 01Mar2021 16:00 (Lot Number: EN6202) (at age 52 years old) for covid-19 immunisation. No other vaccine was given in four weeks. The patient stated that she is not sure if this is related to the vaccine, but it&#39;s the only thing she has done differently.

                                                I developed a raised rash on my left arm at injection site , had chills and nausea and lots of tenderness at injection site at 3 am (1/1/21)  following injection. The nausea had resolved when I woke up, the rash subsided throughout the day as did the chills.  The most distressing event began on 1/1/2021 , that being sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes which continued and got much worse over the next two days, despite taking sudafed as often as possible.  No other cold or flu symptoms were present and it felt like allergies although I have never had any sort of seasonal allergies.  I finally took Zyrtec for it the evening of 1/3/21 and the symptoms stopped.   Congestion, light sensitivity remain.  I am reluctant to take another dose due to  drowsiness side effect.  Hoping symptoms will all be gone by tomorrow.

I had tried Sprix, Zomig 5mg and Promethazine 12.5mg.  The nausea went away, but the headache persisted.  I had originally thought it was a migraine and treated it as such, but my rescue medications did not work, so I thought it could be a side effect of the vaccination.

It was affecting her legs and she had no taste; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs). A contactable consumer (patient) reported a 53-year-old female received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown, did not see this information on the vaccination card), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 20Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization (certified nurse assistant in healthcare). Other products, patient history and investigation assessment was No. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was vaccinated with the COVID Vaccine on 20Dec2020 but tested positive afterwards on 27Dec2020. The patent thought she had COVID in the vaccine and COVID in her body. She was scheduled for next dose on 10Jan2021 and would like to know if she should get the scheduled dose or if she needs to wait longer and re-schedule it. She was now a COVID patient and sick. She was waiting to get better. Before the vaccine she tested negative and felt great. Then she got the vaccine. She had a runny nose and felt achy. She asked her coworker, and her coworker felt the same. She thought if it continued that maybe it was a side effect. Caller confirmed her symptoms were runny nose, feeling achy, and coughing. She took Tylenol and the aches went away. They then came back, and she had more aching and she was wondering why. Caller clarified that these symptoms did not start the next day after receiving the vaccine. Achiness/body aches was started on 23Dec2020 when she was at work. It would wake her up at night. She did have aches right now, but her fever had lowered down. She was also dizzy and weak. It was affecting her legs and she had no taste. She was not eating but needs to eat. If she did, she eat something sweet. Runny nose was started on 24Dec2020. She went back to work on 26Dec2020 but told them she could not work because she had symptoms of COVID. She went to her second job where they do COVID testing and asked her boss for a test. She tested positive on 27Dec2020. Dose was unknown. She said she thought she got 1 vial. The whole thing. The outcome of events &#34;tested positive for COVID after receiving the vaccine&#34; was not recovered.   Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

Lower back at kidney sites are so painful. Weakness. No energy to lift up arms or legs. Have difficult to get up and get out of bed to get medicine or food. So sleepy, maybe because Tylenol 500mg q4h to help for pain but reduce just little from 10 down to 8 for a short time enough to get out of bed to get something.  Ice pack at armpit, heat pat at lower back but just reduce the pain from 10 down to 9 only. No appetite. Eat lentil and rice porridge but indigestible and have to take Pepcid. All symptoms prolong until Friday 1/15/2021 around 1pm. I pushed myself hard to get up to drive to employee health for testing which I missed on Thursday due to unable to get up. After that the symptoms down to moderate that I able to report CDC. I wonder why 2 dose is so horrible to me.

On 27Jan2021 at 07:00, the patient felt dizzy. Shortly after, at 07:15, the nausea started. The patient wanted to know if these could be side effects and would it still be okay to get the scheduled second dose on 29Jan2021. The patient also asked if she can get the second dose if she has a fever on the day she is supposed to get the second dose. The events did not require emergency room or physician&#39;s office visits. The patient was recovering from the events. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious.

                                                Within 24 hours of receiving vaccine, I became very dizzy , had severe weakness, nausea, severe headache, muscle and joint pain,  chills, fever (temperature-102.8),and exhaustion. Redness, pain, and swelling at injection site that has continued to worsen even after 48 hours.  Could not perform regular activities of daily living. I could not drive home from work the day after the injection because the adverse reactions were getting more severe, especially after the 24 hour mark.   Treatment: treated my symptoms at home with medications (I am a nurse),  after researching possible adverse reactions. I figured there was not anything someone else would to treat me besides treat my symptoms.

                                                I got Pfizer vaccine on 12/29. Had muscle soreness at site, Stomach cramp same day after 35 mins of shot. Mild lower back pain that evening (vaccine on left arm and pain on same side). On 12/30 soreness was only to palpation. Rhinorrhea all day long, took NyQuil, moderate back pain, took naproxen and did some back stretches.  On 12/31 no sore arm but little tender. Increased back pain , used back brace , took naproxen  not that much help  though. used heat pack  finally fall asleep around 3 am. on 01/01/2121 around 6 am woke up with excruciating left lower back pain, could not move, get off the bed. took a while to get off the bed. Have to drag my legs very slowly to walk. Went to ER. X-ray did not show anything.  In ER took Narco 5 and Baclofen. MD thinks that it might not be side effects of vaccine. But I wonder,  I never had left lower back pain before. Taking Baclofen and Advil TID since 0101/2021.  01/04 still in pain. increase pain after 6-7 hours after meds.

Severe dizziness, heavy headedness , nausea and vomiting and a horrible headache.  My husband had to physically muscle me back to my car. He wanted to take me to the ER and I would not let him because of the waiting room is full of COVID positive patients.  I threw up along the way home and multiple times to the point I had drive heaves.  I am a Registered Nurse and felt the symptoms I were experiencing were Vertigo.  I had one bout with Vertigo in 2015 and it was extreme.  I had Meclizine on hand and and took one tablet and slept.  The severity of this was so bad I could not walk unassisted or sit up without falling over. After 6 hours of sleeping I got up, dizziness continued, and vision a little off.  I still do not feel 100% I have had a headache since.  It never dawned on me this could be from the vaccine I had taken a week before.

A 54-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 30Dec2020 14:28 at the 54 years old at 0.3 mL single for where she works she was exposed to patients who need rehab that were exposed and getting COVID.  The patient medical history included Primary Essential Tremors and ongoing (had these for about 10-11 years. Her mother and grandmother also had them. Normally they were very fine, small tremors that people didn&#39;t notice. She can hold and turn her head and hide it) and Sulfa drug allergy (would get shortness of breath). The concomitant product was none. The patient previously took flu vaccine and experienced preservative made neck twitch and joint sores. Yesterday the patient got the COVID Vaccine and had a pretty significant adverse event. She was calling to report it and to see if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. The patient was also a licensed speech pathologist. She received the vaccine yesterday at 2:28 PM. She was allergic to Sulfa drugs and would get shortness of breath, so they wanted her to wait 30 minutes for monitoring. She was feeling giddy on 30Dec2020, but she ran into a friend that she had not seen before quarantine, so they were talking. It was exciting. After her 30 minutes she went to her car and felt a little funny. She thought she was hungry so she ate half a banana and had some water. She had an appointment to get to so she started to drive off, and by the time she got to the interstate she was feeling funny. She got on her left side, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face on 30Dec2020. This was like the precursor. Then on 30Dec2020 her face started to go numb. It felt like a dental block you would get with Lidocaine. It went from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips. It was midline on the left side. She was breathing fine. She was trying to figure out if she should pull over or call(Number), but her airway did not close up. Her upper esophageal sphincter got tight and felt funny like she was going to throw up. She drove to the hospital close to her house which is affiliated with where she got the vaccine. She normally had primary tremors, small to where people do not notice. But her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs on 30Dec2020. She looked like a bobble head. But she could still breath. They took her right in and they did an EKG to make sure it was not her heart. Her blood pressure was up on 30Dec2020, she assumes for being stressed. They monitored her. They gave her Pepcid and Benadryl. She did not want any nausea medications. She stayed for about 2 hours and slept some from the Benadryl. Her face slowly became less numb. The numbness went away started from her lips and outward to her check and temple area. Then it just felt funny. When she touched it, which she never lost sensation, it was like, whose face is this? It was strange. She is not numb anymore. It took a while for it to go away, and it still felt weird. When she woke up this morning it was completely gone. She had recovered completely from all of these things. The only thing she has now was some transient nausea. It was very mild. It comes and goes. It had improved. She had not taken anything for it.  The events Feeling funny, her face started to go numb, upper esophageal sphincter got tight, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, were all assessed as Medically significant. The outcome of the event Nausea was recovering, the events Felt giddy, blood pressure was up, Stress was recovered on 31Dec2020, the other events were recovered on 30Dec2020.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that the events Feeling funny, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Face started to go numb from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips, upper esophageal sphincter got tight , whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, Nausea, were related to the product BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events.

A 54-years-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 17Dec2020 at 19:15, at a single dose for vaccination.

She called to ask if there is any data about if the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine will be just like the first shot or if the events are just hit or miss; she is really hoping not to be that sick again with the second dose. Serious reactions to the COVID-19 Vaccine further described as sick for like 2 days straight. Afternoon of 18Dec2020 she was throwing up; had fever; body aches; thought she had contracted COVID-19 in between injection and onset of symptoms; she had no lung issues; her whole body hurt; she could not stop throwing up; her whole intestines hurt; it was horrible; she could not hold anything down for like 2 straight days and then just left on 20Dec2020. Scheduled date for second dose was on 06Jan2021, she has no plan to change dose schedule. The outcome of the event of tired recovered in Dec2020, while other events recovered on 20Dec2020.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 08Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 54-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in deltoid left on 29Dec2020 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing sleep apnoea (diagnosed about 3-4 years ago, wear her CPAP religiously), Hashimoto&#39;s hypothyroid, and chronic low vitamin d (lack of sunlight). Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from 2016 and ongoing for Hashimoto&#39;s hypothyroid, ergocalciferol (VIT D) from 2018 for chronic low vitamin d; lack of sunlight (She did not take it religiously, but was supposed to take it everyday). At 10:30 AM (29Dec2020), she started to get cold and shake. She thought that this was insane and it was in her head. It became so severe she could not use her computer her hands were shaking so hard. She went back up to where they were giving vaccines, they took her temperature and it was 100. It had been normal the morning before she got the vaccine. Her heart rate was elevated at 100. They put a blanket on her and said they wanted to watch her for 15 minutes. In that time her fever went to 101 and her heart rate was 110. They took her to the ER. She was there for 5 hours. Her heart rate went to the high 120s. They did a 12 lead EKG. Her temperature had gone to 102.6, which was the highest. They gave her a liter of Normal Saline. She also had a headache, backache, and felt nauseated. The liter of fluid helped, no doubt. She was not admitted. She was wiped out the next day (30Dec2020) with aches and pains still. Their concern was they said they did not give her epinephrine because her heart was too high. She had no breathing issues. Just extreme cold. At one point she had woke up in the ER (29 or 30Dec2020) and her chest was hurting, she knows from her heart rate being too fast. She was so cold. She had on 6 blankets. The next day (30Dec2020) she still had the aches and pains, she was tired, and had brain fog. It all went away on 30Dec2020. She had nothing after that. What scared her was the heart rhythm. The ER doctor says its not great, but felt that getting the second dose was better than her having COVID. The Electrophysiologist she saw, said she was unsure if she should get the second dose. The hospital said that for this next dose, they would give her the injection, wait 15 minutes, then send her home, expecting that she would have the same thing happen. When after the first dose, she was in the ER on a 12 lead EKG with an intravenous (IV). She had no arm pain the whole time. The reporter assessed all events related. She felt fine prior, walking in to get the vaccine. But she was much better the next day and recovered completely. She was just worried about the second dose. The outcome of events was recovered on 30Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I waited for 30 minutes; I walked to my car and didn&#39;t feel well; I thought maybe I was hungry I ate 1/2 banana and drank some water. I started to drive home.  It felt like a huge cold railroad spike was being driven up the top of my shoulder to my neck, it was a cold sensation anteriorly and posteriorly on my neck.  Then my face (left side) started to go numb, it started just about the top of my left ear and went all the way to my lips. It stopped midline.  It felt like a dental block.  I could still swallow and breathe.  I started shaking, felt nausea, my upper esophageal sphincter started to spasm.  I kept checking my tongue and airway to see if I should pull over and call 911.  I drove to the ER.  My left side of face was numb, I was trembling, tremoring.  They gave me small dose of IV Bendadryl (12.5 mg) and Pepcid, I slowly started to feel better and the feeling came back to my face moving from midline lip to cheek.  It still felt &#34;funny&#34; but much better.  I was in the ER for around 2 hours. I have had more tremoring since my vaccine in my neck and hand (I do have primary essential tremors but it is tremoring much more now) and more neck pain (could be due to the increased tremors)

I woke up at 8:00 still with the horrible headache and vertigo but had horribe nausea. I never vomited. I felt weak all day, had no appetite and my neck felt very stiff all day. In the evening my knees were aching. The next day I continued to have a mild headache and neck stiffness.

I couldn&#39;t get comfortable . I started taking 3 Tylenol ES, Ibuprofen 800mg, and Pepto Bismol at same time every 4 hours. After about 18 hours I started feeling normal. The testing site told me some people are having reactions.

I stayed for 45 minutes after my vaccine due to my blood pressure was high. I also felt a little fuzzy.  About an hour later I got nauseous, had chills and felt very fatigued.  The next morning when I woke up, my left eye was crusted over. I did not think anything of it until I got the second vaccine and it crusted over with it as well.  I was very fatigued for 2  1/2 days.  Arm was a little sore.

A 55-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) solution for injection, intramuscular on her arm on 30Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included neuropathy in feet and thyroid condition. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient reported she was having some of the symptoms like the body ache and just the normal and not the really difficult symptoms or whatever just the tiredness, headache, muscle pain and chills, and pain and a little bit of nausea but last night her ears were ringing and her left eye was twitching a lot and she hadn&#39;t taken her temperature because she really didn&#39;t think she had a temperature. Then she decided to go ahead and take it and at 5 o&#39;clock it (temperature) was 99.2 and at 6:20 it was 98.8 at 9 o&#39;clock it a 99.5 and at 3 AM it was 101 and the information in the packet doesn&#39;t say like if she can take Tylenol or Motrin trying to get this headache to go away. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. Outcome of the event headache was not recovered, ear ringing was recovering, left eye was twitching a lot was recovered, while the other events was unknown.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

A 55-year-old female patient (medical assistant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 15:00 (3:00pm) at a single dose on the left deltoid as vaccination. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported having side effects from her first dose of Pfizer Coronavirus Vaccine administered on 02Jan2021. She tried reporting this information online but has been unsuccessful. Starting the evening of 04Jan2021, she had a headache, chills, felt nauseous, did not feel very well at all, diarrhea, and got a hemorrhoid. She still has a slight headache today; and when she woke up this morning, she felt a little nauseous but that went away; other side effects have improved at this time. Her doctor made her go get a Coronavirus test today in order to go back to work; because he said that the diarrhea and something else of the side effects, she did not remember were not a symptom of the Pfizer Coronavirus Vaccine. She had the Coronavirus test this morning on 06Jan2021 (unknown result); but would not get the results of that test until 48-72 hours after being tested. They would email her those results. Second dose was scheduled for 23Jan2021 at 3:45pm; she still plans to get the second dose. The outcome of the event nauseous was recovered on 06Jan2021 as it already went away while of the remaining events was recovering.

I woke up about 230 am and my stomach was hurting.  I thought I would have to have a bm in a little while but was able to go back to sleep.  About an hour and a half later, I again woke up with stomach pain, maybe some bloating.  I decided to go into the bathroom and I sat on the floor beside the toilet and began vomiting.  I vomited 5 times and had one dry heave.  The vomitus was clear in color, thin with some small pieces of food.  I had felt very hot before vomiting, but was unable to check my temperature due tp nausea and vomiting.  I checked my temperature a little while later and it was 100.2 F.  I was able to go back to sleep for a while and kept checking temperature during the day.  It was between 99.1 and 99.8 for most of the day.

                                                When i first got the shot I didn&#39;t think it was bad at all I actually hardly  felt the needle. around 5 o&#39;clock I started feeling ill and then i started about quarter to 6 I started getting cold and shaking bad but it wasn&#39;t like a seizure. So really severe chills. When i got home i got under heated blanket then I started getting itchy and noticed hives all over body. then I started getting blisters on palms of my hands and they were like water blisters. I was uncontrollably itchy. I started looking up online  what to do and asked friends and family and started taking Benadryl.  I had to take it for 4-4.5 days so then the hives finally went away but I was still itchy. I&#39;ve just been very very exhausted and been having to push myself to get up. I had anxiety about getting  the vaccine but I decided to get it. I still don&#39;t feel like myself, I don&#39;t have much of an appetite but not losing weight because I&#39;ve been forcing myself to eat. I&#39;m taking vitamins and praying I feel better but I just don&#39;t feel like myself. I don&#39;t have as much energy and exhaustion is the big thing. My joints started hurting really bad.

A 55-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL8982, unknown expiration), via injection once to right arm on 14Jan2021 at a single dose as she is eligible with first tier for vaccination.  Medical history and concomitant medications reported as none. The patient reported that she received the first dose of COVID vaccine on 14Jan2021 (Thursday). The next day (15Jan2021), her arm was sore for 24 hours after the shot, and she didn&#39;t have any side effects over the weekend. On 19Jan2021, Tuesday, she started having constant headache, and was experiencing problems with gas and bloating, it is very rare for her to have this issue, and it was building the last of couple days, she was uncomfortable and was taking over the counter medication for relief. She was keeping the headaches at bay with generic ibuprofen (lot: S200378, expiry: Mar2023), but if she missed a dose or is feeling better and doesn&#39;t take, it is coming back, it is consistent. Gas and bloating are primarily after eating, on Wednesday, after 24 hours it was ridiculous. She got some generic Extra Strength Gas Relief one tablet after eating (lot: 75257, expiry: Jun2022), and it was giving her some relief until early this morning. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the gas and bloating was worse. Last night, her entire chest, she wanted to burp so bad, but couldn&#39;t because it really hurt, and it took a while for the next tablet to kick in and give relief, she was like where is this coming from, she didn&#39;t know it could build up so much. On 22Jan2021, she had a terrible diarrhea.  Diarrhea was painful and intense, she took generic Pepto Bismol 1-2 tablets, and she took 4, The first time she woke up at 04:30 AM and at 7 another wave hit her, so she took another two tablets. Right now, she is feeling okay, but the gas is building up, her chest is filling, she is uncomfortable. The patient asked if these are reported side effects.  She works in a dental office, and the doctor is knowledgeable and sensitive to COVID, and even though those symptoms are not listed as side effects on the information sheet, the doctor said they are symptoms of COVID, and even though those symptoms are not listed as side effects on the information sheet, the doctor said they are symptoms of COVID, are these side effects or may she have COVID, though she doesn&#39;t know who she could have gotten COVID from. Out of protection for patients at dental clinic, the HCP at clinic wants her to get the COVID test as he believes it could be COVID and not side effect of the vaccine. She doesn&#39;t want to quarantine for nothing if it is just side effects of the vaccine. She will be getting rapid diagnostic for COVID and not the antibody test. She thinks she should get tested, but there is no testing appointment available until tomorrow, and she does not want to self-quarantine needlessly, she will live through it, she is happy to get the test, but she doesn&#39;t want to lose 2 weeks of pay if others are reporting the same side effects. She was happy to get the vaccine. The patient recovered from the event arm sore on 16Jan2021; not yet recovered from events constant headache, gas, and bloating; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.

Eyes felt swollen then began to feel nauseous (tried to vomit, but no food came up) and then a runny nose  (clear fluid).   I took another Claritin 10mg and also Zofran 8mg ODT which resolved the nausea.  Had to blow my nose 2 times.   Went to sleep with my Epipen at bedside but didnt have to use it.   Woke up at 815am and only symptom remaining was arm soreness.   Felt like my normal self and played 3 hrs of tennis.  Arm soreness at injection site worsened during the day.  By 72 hrs post-injection, arm soreness resolved.

                                                From the evening of the day I have received the vaccination, my left arm started to feel dull continuous pressure pain, progressed stronger and stronger as the time goes.  No treatment given.  Following day, the pain was worse and stayed same.  The IM insertion site was also painful to touch or pressure.  Then afternoon of the same day, I started nausea, light headache, dizziness, and occasionally chills  as well as occasional dry cough accompanied by itchy throat or without itchy throat.  At this point, I took Advil 200mg 1 tab around 3pm.  The muscle pain on my left arm and headache is eased but other symptoms stayed same at this time, 4:30pm.

Able to stay at work until 4pm, went home, felt lightheaded, ate a meal and felt somewhat better.

Apparently fell on buttocks, which are sore.  No other symptoms.  Constitutional symptoms have resolved. Evaluated in ED today.

A 56-Year-old female consumer (patient) reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1686), via unspecified route at left upper arm on 12Jan2021 about 9:15am at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type was hospital. Medical history and concomitant drugs were not reported. Weight: 175-180 lbs. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Past drug included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) been using the product more than 10 years and never had a problem with it, she didn&#39;t think that was related to her experience. Patient received first vaccine yesterday 12Jan2021. 45 minutes after receiving vaccine (12Jan2021 10 AM), she developed hot flashes in sternum (flushing sensation in her sternum or upper chest area. It was like when she had a dye injected), anxiety, dizziness/ light headedness, muscle weakness, significant dissociation, depersonalization, shakey, mild nausea, arm pain. The patient explained that this was why she was in the MRI scanner (Jan2021). This came a couple of times yesterday and had not been experienced this today (13Jan2021). It (dizziness) was ongoing and sporadic and had happened couple times yesterday and today. There were a few hours yesterday 12Jan2021 where she felt like herself but then it all started again last night. The patient reported feeling disassociated from her body, this was within about 20 minutes of the flushing and went in and out of being more or less alarming. She stated she felt disconnecting from where she was and space she was in, mentally. She knew where she was but could feel no connection to where she was or her body. The patient would touch her hand but couldn&#39;t feel her hands, it was like they weren&#39;t hers. This was during the half hour of the events occurring. She had mild nausea, this started not long after the flushing and it came and went a little bit but it was not too troublesome. The patient felt disconnect from her body and had shakiness like her lower leg feel shaky and weak and tingly. This happened on and off since the episodes started. The patient reported she slept great and had a few hours yesterday where she felt good. Her arm was tender, this might have been yesterday but she thought it was this morning and was only tender to touch. The hand on that same side was painful, but not unbearable, just uncomfortable. The patient apologized for being emotional and tearful. She felt completely overwhelmed. She couldn&#39;t believe that she put herself in this position and she was perfectly fine before the shot. She did contact her doctor. No AE required a visit to emergency room/ physician office. There had been no treatment, she didn&#39;t know what to do. She remarked she was not going back for the second dose. Outcome of event dizziness was not recovered, and the rest of events was unknown.

                                                On the evening of Sunday December 27th I became violently ill.  I began vomiting and continued all night long.  I had severe body aches and chills.  I was unable to find my thermometer so am not sure of tempertature.  I had lower back pain so severe I couldn&#39;t lie down.  I tried to take Tylenol but was unable to keep it down.  By morning  I got access to Tylenol suppositories,  Dramamine, and a thermometer.  My temperature before Tylenol was 104.4.  These symptoms continued over the next 3 days though vastly improved with Tylenol, Dramamine and IV fluids.  I received a negative COVID test on Thursday.  I have only been this ill once before in my life.  By Thursday I was not longer febrile, only weak and exhausted.  I have to now determine whether or not to get the second vaccination.   I know  this seems to be a somewhat delayed reaction.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Approx. 45 minutes later she became flushed, felt lightheaded/intoxicated/giddy/silly while driving home. She said she was extremely hungry (&#34;like a big dose of steroids&#34;). She states her ears were ringing and when she laid down at 2130 she could feel her heart beating throughout her body. This AM she reports feeling &#34;hungover/groggy/nauseated&#34;. She denied any lip/tongue swelling, any lip or extremity tingling, difficulty breathing, any injection site redness/heat/swollen/painful area, fever, chills, or ever having a vaccine reaction previously. Spoke with individual w/pharmacy. Advised to report to VAERS. Not an expected reaction. Possibly related to aleve vs. covid vaccine.

Took 1000 mg of Tylenol; and I was feeling okay. Just arm was sore. Not extremely sore. 8 pm at night - started shaking; knees were knocking together; severe chills; and it took a few minutes to recognize what was happening - took temp. 99.4; took another 1000mg tylenol; went to bathroom and without notice -  puked; woke up an hour after going to bed with worsened chills; 10:30 pm - temp 102.4; too early to take more Tylenol and so took pharmacy&#39;s version of Nyquil. Slept through the night after Nyquil but woke up with chills continuing - temp 103. 8 at 4:30 am; and then sat at side of bed and took tylenol 1000 mg  and got up to go to bathroom and couldn&#39;t walk forward and felt my arm hurt really really bad; couldn&#39;t walk forward; I leaned against the wall and bounced against the next wall and kept walking and grabbed a bedroom doorknob and got into the bathroom and fell on toilet and then crawled to couch because I couldn&#39;t walk straight. Stayed on a couch for two hours and then it was gone. Fever and chills continued that whole day on 24th. Didn&#39;t eat/had no appetite. Christmas day -no fever. Felt shaky though - like I&#39;d been super sick. No appetite still. Felt woozy and shaky inside (felt shaky inside) and that lasted for several days.  Appetite still remains poor. 02 stats were low through all of it - four liters (up two liters than normal.  Contacted: a pulmonologist - Dr. and she helped with O2 questions.

It was through the roof/Blood pressure was high and she was concerned she would have a stroke; Muscle soreness; Arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (physical therapist). A 57-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular on the left arm on 21Dec2020 08:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; and sumatriptan from 25Dec2020 to an unspecified date at unknown dose and frequency (standard unknown dose/ She only gets 9 pills a month) for migraine. Medical history included ongoing migraine, obesity (She would say she was kind of obese), coeliac disease (She had Celiac disease and cannot eat gluten which was diagnosed since she was 4), chronic back pain (this was diagnosed a couple of years before she took the COVID vaccine), spinal stenosis (this was diagnosed a couple of years before she took the COVID vaccine), and pain (she took hydrocodone for pain but did not take any that day).  Concomitant medication included hydrocodone for pain. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and events following prior vaccinations were none. The patient had the vaccine on 21Dec2020, and she got sick on Christmas day. She was vomiting at 14:00 and did not know if it was a side effect or not.  She did have arm soreness muscle soreness at 15:00, that evening and the next day too. She normally gets a migraine once a month. She does not normally throw up with a headache though. The vomiting started when she threw up twice on 25Dec2020, then once on morning of 26Dec2020.  She also had very high blood pressure. It was through the roof.  She did not know if that was related to drug for migraine or vaccine. She also had the headache at 14:00 the whole time. She believed she threw up before she took Sumatriptan. The muscles got rigid and tight in her neck and she doesn&#39;t think she took it. She threw up and then she took it. She did not have a lot or expiration. There was no ER nor physician&#39;s office required. She would have it if her car was not buried in snow. Her blood pressure was high and she was concerned she would have a stroke. It was usually around 110/70 and was always very low usually. She did not know if it was accurate, but it was 165/124 at one point and she did know her pulse was accurate. She did not provide her pulse rate. She did not know if she was throwing up because her blood pressure was high and did not know if blood  pressure was high because of Sumatriptan. She only gets 9 pills a month. She did not know if high blood pressure was one of the side effects. It was not a real safe medication to take once a day. She only took it once a month and only once that day. She had never thrown up with  migraines before and was just concerned. She doesn&#39;t usually take her blood pressure and doesn&#39;t know if the Sumatriptan always makes it go up or not. She doesn&#39;t know if she had the flu bug or not. The action taken in response to the events for bnt162b2 was not applicable, while for sumatriptan was unknown. Clinical outcome of sickness and influenza was unknown, for headache was recovered on 27Dec2020, while for the other events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the elevated BP and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.   This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

We gave diphenhydramine 50mg at 2:16 pm. Then at 2:35 pm her symptoms were not improved her blood pressure was 80/40 so we gave one dose of 0.3mg epinephrine by auto-injector and called an ambulance. Post epinephrine her vision improved but her skin was still red and starting  to itch. She was talking and said she was feeling a little better. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital for additional treatment. There was not reaction visible at the injection site it appeared to  be all systemic.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EK5730, expiration date: Mar2021, NDC number was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm (also reported as upper shoulder) on 07Jan2021 at 11:30 30 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported she was feeling exhausted, freezing cold, slightly nauseous, and did &#34;not feel as zippy as she normally do&#34; on 08Jan2021. She wanted these effects recorded, and would like to know if they were normal, and would they happen to the same or higher intensity with the second dose. The patient further reported she had no adverse reaction on 07Jan2021 other than her arm hurting a little. Starting on 08Jan2021, she had felt exhausted like she could just lay down and go to sleep, freezing cold, and slightly nauseous. She had been reading and was sure or was guessing this was normal, but wanted to verify that. She was not running a fever as of yet. Every time she tried to get up, she just laid back down. She felt fairly decent when she woke up, these events started later at the time of the report on 08Jan2021. She would not say these events were life threatening, but the CDC patient vaccine record card said to call to report any adverse events. She was scheduled for a second dose on 28Jan2021 and at this time did not plan to change dosing unless event worsening would occur. The patient had the vaccination, because she was always coming into contact with people with COVID at work. The patient had no investigation assessment. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient was recovering from the event &#34;arm hurting a little,&#34; she was not recovered from the events &#34;exhausted/exhausted like she could just lay down and go to sleep, freezing cold, and slightly nauseous,&#34; while the outcome of the event &#34;not feel as zippy as she normally do&#34; was unknown.

A 57-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization; diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and paracetamol (TYLENOL), both via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unknown dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included high blood pressure from 2008 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included amlodipine from 2017 and ongoing at 5 mg at night for high blood pressure, losartan from 2017 and ongoing at 12mg once in the morning for high blood pressure. Following her 1st dose of the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020, the patient had throat tightening, metallic taste in her mouth. She was scheduled to have her 2nd dose today (07Jan2021) and would like to know what to do and if she was still covered 80% from the 1st dose of her COVID vaccine shot. When she got her first COVID shot 3 weeks ago she got a metallic taste in her mouth and her throat tightened up a little. Throat tightening happened right after she got the shot and lasted about less than 2 minutes. She also turned red when she got it. Then about 14 hours later, on the same day she got nausea, diarrhea, and was pretty weak. This lasted until about 20Dec2020 as well. She was supposed to get 2nd dose today (07Jan2021). Before her first shot she had taken paracetamol and hydrochloride prior. She also took both of those today (07Jan2021). But then she was reading through the paperwork and it says that a severe reaction includes tightening of the throat. She was not sure if what she had was truly a reaction or not. She did not have other allergies. She had many flu shots and never had any difficulty with those. She was a nurse, she wanted the second dose, but she was concerned about the throat tightening, and it getting worse with the second dose. She was unsure of seriousness. She figured that she would get aches and pains. Everyone else who got it said their arm hurt, but nothing else. She thought it was weird. She was just wired differently she guesses. The action taken in response to the events for paracetamol and hydrochloride was  unknown. The outcome of events throat tightening, turned red was recovered on 17Dec2020. The outcome of event metallic taste in her mouth, nausea, diarrhea, and was pretty weak was recovered on 20Dec2020.

                                                Approximately 4-6 hours post vaccine I experienced site soreness and felt my hands were stiff, felt swollen, especially the right. Within a few more hours my arm became heavy and I had some general muscular achiness. By approximately 11pm I had intense muscular pain on the back of my legs making it difficult to stand. It felt like I had been hit repeatedly with 2x4s. About that time my posterior ribcage hurt also. I couldn&#39;t sleep, turning frequently as my hips hurt. This is what I felt like when I had COVID. Intense pain.  At 0630 (1/14) I got out of bed and felt I was going to faint, was extremely nauseous (I did not vomit) and had a very bad, global headache. I had to lay down again. My temp was 100.1 orally. I could not go to work. I was able to take Tylenol. It helped the pain but two hours later my temp was 100.8. I could not get out of bed  until 6pm, I felt delirious when I tried.  I was able to go to work on 1/15. Of note, following my first dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer BioNtech Lot #EH9899 on 12/23/20) I had site soreness, heaviness of my left arm, T of 99.5 same day (about 10-12 hours post vaccination), and mild body aches for about a day.

A 57-year-old female patient received single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, lot number: EL0142, exp date not reported), intramuscular (by injection once left arm, below shoulder blade in muscle) on 13Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization (because of job). Medical history included two stroked from 1998 and 2005. Concomitant medication included oral donepezil started taking 3 months ago (Oct2020) for something having to do with muscles because of stroke. She takes a blood thinner, as she had 2 strokes; and takes muscle relaxers too. By 15Jan2021 (Friday morning) the patient was feeling bad, she couldn&#39;t go to work, she lost her taste and her smell, part of smell. Part of taste was back at the time of reporting, but she was tired and sleeping all the time (onset date reported as 15Jan2021). She saw her neurologist because she had 2 strokes, they referred her to Pfizer, as they said she may have already had COVID 19 with the symptoms she has, but as far as she knows, she didn&#39;t have it, she took a test with the center a month before giving the vaccine, she took the vaccine because of her job, because of the kind of job she has, and they wanted her to let Pfizer know she was sick. She doesn&#39;t know if she wanted to get the other dose, as she was not feeling well at all. She was laying down sleeping every day. Her doctor said to tell Pfizer what was going on. She still doesn&#39;t feel good the day of reporting. She still hasn&#39;t eaten a whole meal since 15Jan2021. She thinks she was probably getting better, but was getting better slowly, she has no taste, she was not able to eat, no smell at all, which was really not a good thing. She can&#39;t tell the outcome of no smell she thinks. She can&#39;t smell nothing at all. She can&#39;t smell what she was cooking. It was the same as taste, she thought that is probably why she can&#39;t eat, she can&#39;t taste what she was eating. Taste was improved, but not well enough for her, it is hard to explain, you know how you enjoy food, like how it tastes, and if you can&#39;t taste, you can&#39;t eat. She sleeps all day, she was up now, but is probably going to go to sleep, she feels tired and needs to lay down. She told her doctor she will call and see what Pfizer says, they will go from there. She doesn&#39;t know if she will have to go see if she has COVID 19, or what was going on.  No further investigation assessment was performed. The patient took a test a month before (results unknown). No taste was recovering (ongoing at the time of reporting) while outcome of other events was not recovered.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after vaccination (during post vaccination observation), patient reported feeling ?off? and that her throat hurt. I was contacted via radio to aid with assessment.  Upon my arrival, patient reported that that she was experiencing slight difficulty swallowing, was feeling ?off? and felt ?like her head was in a fog?. Assessment of vitals revealed an intial vital signs of respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, pulse of 74 beats per minute, 97% oxygen saturation levels. Blood pressure was obtained prior to arrival and was reported as 121/74. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Clear S1 and S2 were present upon cardiac auscultation with no mumurs or gallops noted. Patient appeared slightly pale with a slightly hoarse voice. Patient did not have noticeable pharyngeal edema upon examination. Patiney had no increased work of breathing and was not using accessory Muscles for breathing. Patient was given a swallow test using bottled water and then solid food and demonstrated intact ability to swallow with no regurgitation, choking or drooling noted. Continuous oxygen saturation monitoring revealed 02 that never fell below 96%. Continuous pulse monitoring revealed a pulse that was between 74-79. Given the stability the vital signs, demonstrated ability to swallow and inappropriately labeled IM medication in emergency kit (ie three loose syringes were not drawn up by myself. Medications were labeled by hand with no expiration date, route or dose), I elected to give the patient 25 mg of oral diphenhydramine. Patient declined to seek emergency medical attention several times. Patient?s daughter was then called so that the patient could be driven home. Patient was advised to seek emergency medical attention if her symptoms worsened, she developed increased difficultly breathing or otherwise felt unwell. Advised to follow up with PCP within next 24 hours.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left upper arm, on 30Jan2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, at a nursing home. Medical history included ongoing allergies which the patient was diagnosed before having the vaccine. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. On 30Jan2021, 2 hours after the vaccination, the patient experienced nausea. On 31Jn2021 at 03:00, the patient experienced chills, was coughing and sneezing. She stated that she was not coughing constantly, and it comes off and on. On 02Feb2021, the patient experienced diarrhea. She called her doctor and treatment included Tylenol and inhaler if needed. Her doctor would not give her prednisone so her lungs could get strong. The patient stated that she was scheduled to get her second dose on 20Feb2021. The patient recovered from nausea on 31Jan2021; was recovering from chills, cough and sneezing; and has not recovered from diarrhea.

Speech clear, no stridor noted. Pt stated does have a significant allergy history and sees an allergist. Medicated with Benadryl 50 mg po and immediately to ED, registered right away, pt then c/o head and back itching, and taken into triage for assessment by triage nurse.   Per Hospital Note: Patient initially developed hives and itching with progression in symptoms to include shortness of breath and throat tightening. She reported feeling as though her tongue were swelling and having difficulty speaking and having difficulty swallowing. Concerns of impending loss of airway prompted administration of IV Solu-Medrol, Benadryl and 2 doses of intramuscular epinephrine which were unsuccessful and therefore emergent intubation was performed.   Patient apparently has had prior anaphylactoid reactions in the past including bee stings and shellfish.

                                                Levels of TSH, among other indicators that pointed towards onset of hyperthyroidism. My doctor told me that this was acute thyroiditis. My heart rate was very high (122 bpm) when I visited my doctor&#39;s office and it was 130 bpm when I was triaged in the Emergency Room. Upon my doctor&#39;s advice, I went to the ER in the afternoon of 03/12/2021 where I was further tested. I was given medications to counteract inflammation, nausea and headache. In addition, I was given medication (beta blocker) to lower my heart rate. When my blood pressure was taken after a couple of hours, the readings revealed that my pressure had also started to fall. I spent overnight in the telemetry unit of the ER - I was given 2 liters of IV fluids to stabilize my vitals. The following day (03/13/2021), I met with endocrinologists who told me to what extent my thyroids were affected and what further medications to take. I had told them and other ER doctors as to what precipitated all of this. I was given anti inflammatory medication and a beta blocker that day before I was discharged in the evening.        I have no history of thyroid issues or heart issues. I do not suffer from any chronic illness. I was not sick before I took the second dose of the vaccine. I started to feel ill within 5 hours of taking the vaccine shot, and the symptoms worsened over nearly the following two weeks. Now, following medical intervention, I am continuing treatment with various medications. I don&#39;t feel well yet, and I understand that the process towards recovery is going to be slow and unpredictable.        I wanted to report this, since I feel that scientists and researchers should have this knowledge that thyroiditis can happen as an adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech).

A 58-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number= EH9899), intramuscular on 19Dec2020 07:00 at SINGLE DOSE at Left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included breast cancer female and allergies to shell fish and Latex. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. 30 minutes after receiving vaccine on 19Dec2020 07:30 am, patient reported &#39;heart racing, dizziness, flushing, burning pain in her chest, dizziness. tachycardia, nausea and throat tightness. Patient was taken to the ED where she received IV Benadryl and was observed for 4 hours. Patient was discharged home and symptoms subsided. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible temporal relationship between immunization and onset of allergic reaction in a subject with a positive medical history for allergy to food (shellfish); causality cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

On December 27th at 4:00 PM sudden onset worst bone pain ever unrelieved with Tylenol, malaise and nausea. December 28th at 1:00 AM awoke in pain and &#34;on fire&#34; I have never been so hot, truly felt like my skin was on fire. Tympanic thermometer 99.0F. Awoke feeling fine and went to work thinking this was SE however symptoms recurred later that morning so I went for testing as I could not differentiate between SE vs illness. Covid negative. If this was a delayed response to vaccine, wanted to report: severe bone pain unrelieved w Tylenol , malaise, nausea, 48 hours. thanks, NP

(No symptoms at all with first immunization) Symptoms of fatigue began approx. 12 hrs. late,  then fever after midnight, chills, body aches, severe headache, abd cramping, and extreme fatigue. Highest fever recorded was 101.8 the next day (Sunday) around  4pm.  Didn&#39;t take Tylenol or Motrin.  As of writing this (Monday 12:07 pm) my fever is gone but headache and extreme fatigue remain. Injection site still sore and today I notice I have a very swollen and painful lymph node left axilla opposite injection site.  I had to call in sick today and possible will tomorrow if the extreme fatigue and headache don&#39;t go away.

Tylenol was taken, which offered very little relief. 1/8/2021; I awoke with extreme fatigue, unable to sit up,  nausea, and diarrhea with stomach pain, headache, which wasn&#39;t unrelieved by 1000mgs of Tylenol, unable to raise R arm due to swelling and pain, aching and weakness all over body, joints, and muscles. It also caused a Fibromyalgia flare-up, which I wasn&#39;t experiencing prior to vaccine. It was 1/10/2021 before I was starting to feel better.

                                                Received vaccine on Monday by Wed afternoon lower abdominal cramping and feeling very unwell.  By Wed evening had chills and low grade fever 99.4.  Called out of work Thursday.  Felt terrible.  Thursday morning lower abdominal cramping consistent and pain scale between 4-5 with occasional spikes to 8.  Also felt terrible.  Had body aches, could only lay on couch.   Called my gastroenterologist.  Office returned call late afternoon and stated probably from vaccine and if it worsens or fever to call primary and to fill out VAERS form.  Thursday evening had temp of 100.4 and started with a cough where it felt I couldn&#39;t take deep breaths.  Only lasted a few hours.  Abdominal pain persisted.  Friday morning woke up and now have headache, but abdominal pain is now down to a 2 and I feel achy, but feeling a bit better.  Had to call out of work still too sick to go in.  No cough.  No fever.  Since I was feeling better my hope was since it was vaccine related that I would wake on Saturday and be totally fine, unfortunately, not the case.  Saturday morning abdominal pain same at a 2 and headache was on and off through the day into the night.  Still pretty much rested all day into the night.  Sunday morning much better.  Headache gone and abdominal pain down to a 1 and sometimes just vague.   Although I&#39;m feeling better my head feels out of sorts, kind of like my brain can&#39;t keep up with my eyes?  And new symptoms? right ear crackling and teeth on right side feel sensitive also,  pain under left armpit.  It&#39;s tender and lasts through the day.  Monday still feeling a bit lightheaded and fatigued and armpit pain still there but not worse and feel able to go to work to see if I can.  Tooth sensitivity also still there but ear pain gone.  Called primary doctor she suggests getting Covid test and have appointment for phone conference for Tuesday with doctor, also had  Covid test today at work  (was Covid tested last Monday also for work and negative) into Monday night head is still feeling &#34;off&#34;.  Tuesday armpit pain still same and dizzy head feeling same, mild abdominal pain comes and goes - Not bad enough to stop daily activity.  Spoke with primary doctor and she said side effects could possibly last this long and let her know when yesterday&#39;s Covid test comes in.........

                                                Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   I received the first Pfizer Vaccine (EH9899) on 12/19/20. A few days later, I felt like my head, on the side of my right ear, had a great deal of pressure in it and it felt &#34;funny &#34; but it did not really hurt. It was uncomfortable and distracting. I waited to see if it would go away. I noticed my hearing was decreased . On 01/06/20 when I woke up, my hearing was completely gone in my right ear. I could hear nothing out of that ear.  I had a noise in my head. Just a loud roaring noise. I had severe vertigo and could not walk across the room. I describe this as I felt like I was on a merry-go-round and someone was spinning me really fast. (continue)  Additional information for Item 18: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   continued:    I also experienced severe vomiting and could not stop. My husband took me to the doctor. Since I could not get in to my regular doctor that day, we went to an ear doctor I had visited a couple of years ago because that was the only person I could find to see me on short notice. I had regular hearing test in the past and my hearing was normal last time he checked it.  After doing a hearing test, he verified my Hearing was severely decreased in my right ear. I explained to him, I also feel &#34;foggy&#34; and I have problems concentrating, was having vertigo, and vomiting. I am not sure if that is because of the constant sound in my ear that distracts me but it is a definite problem and interferes with my work. I cannot concentrate. He started me on Steroids (Prednisone) 60 mg a day for 7 days, then 40 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for three days, Antivert 12.5 mg three times a day as needed, and Zofran for the vomiting if I needed that.  I have not experienced anymore vomiting and the Vertigo has been very limited. Mostly when I lay down now instead of when I stand up.  My blood pressure has also been slightly elevated, but it could be from the Steroids.   I was scheduled to take the 2nd Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21. Since I was receiving the high doses of Steroids, I was concerned that the vaccine would not be effective or may interact with the steroids so I went to my family doctor 01/08/21, for a visit. He said he would check and let me know if it was contraindicated for me to take the Vaccine on high doses of steroids. When I did not hear from him, because I had to take the vaccine the next day, I called the Pharmacy and talked to someone there and they told me the agency was still recommending you take the Vaccine even if you are on the steroids. I received the second Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21.  My hearing is now coming and going but I can hardly hear anything out of that right ear. . There is a constant noise, like a roaring, in my head and I still have problems concentrating. I have had no more vomiting and my vertigo has hot been as severe but I have experienced some at times.   I reported to the Pharmacy the day I received my vaccine, 01/09/21, about the things I had experienced this since my first vaccine. They took my information and said they would call me but today is 01/12/21 and I have not heard from them yet so I thought I would go ahead and report this. I am concerned this was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I return to the doctor 01/20/21 for a repeat hearing exam.   The Doctor expressed this condition could be a permanent and disabling  issue but currently being treated and will follow up with more testing.   I am also concerned about how the second vaccine affected me because I was receiving the high doses of Steroids at the time I received it.    I am sending this from a work email so if you reply, please reply to personal email.

She clarified that she had a previous history of paralysis in her left trapezius muscle and had surgery in 1998 on her left shoulder. She said she had a weird feeling that went around where her scar was from the surgery on the back of her left shoulder.

Clarified her joint pain was in her ankles, wrists, hips, neck,  back, and knees. She said the joint pain felt like &#34;flu&#34; joint pain. She stated she normally has joint pain with the other issues she has, but this joint pain felt different.

She said she was sweating like crazy, and then would get chills. She clarified she is used to being hot and cold in her normal life because of her thyroid problems, but stated what she experienced last night was beyond that. She said her hot and cold issue was bumped up several levels last night. She said she was chilled or sweating all the time last night, but did not have a temperature. She clarified her normal body temperature is 96.7, and when she checked her temperature at one point, her temperature was 98 degrees.

Reported her last blood work was done on 04Dec2020 and everything was kind of normal. She clarified her thyroid was a little off, and her doctor adjusted her medication. She said her potassium was a little down. Reported she was told when she got the COVID-19 Vaccine shot she has to be a little more careful, and she might not be as protected as some people. She said she was told there have not been enough studies on the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she was told that information by a person at the site where she received the COVID-19 Vaccination, saying the person was helping her with the COVID-19 Vaccination authorization form. Reported she thought she was doing OK after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine, until after last night and yesterday afternoon. She said if she continues feeling the way she is, she will see her doctor. She said her system seems off. She said she normally tries everything she knows first, like drinking a lot of water, and drinking electrolytes, and will take potassium to see if that is the issue. She said those are her own things that she does before she calls her doctor. Clarified sometimes she has numbness in her face due to not having her B-12. She said she still has a little numbness in face. She said on 05Jan2021, the numbness went across her face from the bridge of her nose down through to her mouth. She said the numbness was nothing like paralysis in her face, but her face was really hot at the same time she had the numbness. Reported she took Tylenol (clarified as (company) brand Tylenol, stating she doesn&#39;t have the UPC, Lot and Expiration Date). She said the Tylenol wasn&#39;t kicking in, so she took Ibuprofen (clarified as (company)brand Ibuprofen, and she doesn&#39;t have the Ibuprofen NDC, Lot and Expiration date).

I had a dull headache, nausea, I was yawning all day, muscle fatigue, esp my quads, lightheaded enough to lay on the floor a few times during day. These symptoms did not stop me from painting, but I did feel horrible but I pushed through it.    Sunday still nauseous, just feeling not my self.....

This 58-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot  EJ1685 or FJ1685), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 09Jan2021 06:00 for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation on unknown date (1 episode), allergic to Keflex. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot  EJ1685 or FJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 22Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunisation.  On 10Jan2021 01:00 AM, the patient experienced: I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in i was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive (loss of consciousness) (medically significant), I had my 2nd vaccine at work early sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day (feeling abnormal), Iwoke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise (malaise), I was covered in sweat (hyperhidrosis), vomited (vomiting), I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F (pyrexia), sore (pain), I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response (seizure). No treatment required. The outcome of the events was recovered.   The events were described as follows: I am healthy RN with no active medical problems. I had my 2nd vaccine at work early Sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day, I expected this so was not alarmed and went to bed around 10pm. I woke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise and went to the bathroom in case I might vomit, etc. and I tried to have a BM. I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in I was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive. He yelled at me for about 10 seconds and I came to, I was covered in sweat. I asked him to walk me back to the bedroom where I again passed out, fell to the floor and hit the bed, then was unresponsive again for about 10 seconds then came to again and vomited. After this I felt completely relieved of my malaise. I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F. After this I was sore but otherwise completely okay, the next day I had a temp of 99.5°F. Today I am back to normal. I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response. The vaccine was administered at Hospital Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event &#34;began to pass out&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

That continued on through that night and into the next morning.  So I had to call in at work that morning 1/14.  I finally started feeling better by friday night, 1/15.  The headache was gone and the chills were only slight and I could finally keep some toast down.  Before that I could only slightly keep liquids down.

EMS was called as I made my way outside.  Upon my arrival patient was leaning out of the car and stating that she could not breath.  She was able to tell me that she was allergic to penicillin.  Oxygen was immediately placed on the patient with minimal relief.  Lung sounds were coarse throughout.  She then  began to vomit about every 20-30 seconds.  Epipen was administered in the right leg with no relief.  Patient continued to complain of troubles breathing and vomiting.  A second epipen was administered in the patients right arm again with no relief.  A few minutes later patient was given racemic epinephrine through the oxygen mask.  There appeared to be mild improvement in her breathing as she appeared more comfortable, but still complaining of shortness of breath and vomiting.  When EMS arrived patient was unable to transport herself to the stretcher.  When EMS and clinical staff transferred patient to the stretcher she became unresponsive.  She appeared to still be breathing.  She did not respond to verbal stimuli.  Per ED report large amount of fluid was suctioned from the patients lungs following intubation in the ambulance.  When patient arrived to the ED she was extubated and re-intubated without difficulty and further fluid was suctioned.  At that time patient was found to be in PEA, shock was delivered.  Shortly thereafter no cardiac activity was found and patient pronounced dead.

A 59-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at the 59-year-old at single dose for Covid virus. The medical history included Congested, head cold and Covid virus. There was no concomitant medication. The patient work at a hospital and she went for a Covid shot (clarified as Covid 19 vaccine) on 22Dec2020 and she got a very bad reaction from it which bothered her, she had severe headaches in Dec2020 and it was just too uncomfortable and on 24th she was very tired,  she didn&#39;t had too much of upset stomach in Dec2020 but it was not all that bad by 9 in the clock by morning she was at work and everything and she was told by if she was not feeling well she can walk by a day, but her question and her concern was back on November okay she had called in sick around, she had a funeral that she gone too and people that were at the funeral, unfortunately were smoking outside and smoke bothers me very much, she get congested and she get head cold from it you know and I was thinking it&#39;s nothing it&#39;s just a cold and somebody told her no (name) you better go get yourself to the employee health office and get checked out and she didn&#39;t bother doing that, she said no it&#39;s just the cold she will be fine but then it just got worse down the road and she said to herself may be she better just to say she did it, so she called in sick on 24th because she had the cold still and she called and she went to employee health office on 25th she still had the headache and she still had the cold, however when she went to the health office they said to her well stay out of work and we will get back in touch with her and she said okay and she will do that so when they got back in touch with her they said they do have the Covid and she said ohhh she said okay so she stayed out of work and she went to work on the 07Dec so she was wondering whole time, so her confusion was this she was told if you already had the virus in her which at that time, she did not know what it was she just thought it was from cigarette smoke because it got her all congested and she got the head cold in Dec2020 and the whole thing that went along with it and the health employee officer know you had the virus and it&#39;s just the virus and she go oh great and that&#39;s when they told her to stay out of work and she said okay fine then she just have to that, so in the meantime everybody in the work said hi calling me checking up on her and she said it&#39;s so nice of you people, she appreciate it but then she went back to work she was still feeling you know much better than she was but she had little whooping cough in Dec2020 but that was not really that bad, so they said you going to get the shot or not, and she said she don&#39;t know she kind of debatable, she don&#39;t know if she should get it, because she work in the hospital or she should not get, she said she don&#39;t know she was kind of up and some people like she get it sometime your health was not that good but on the other hand everybody that is working here in the hospital working with patients because was work right in the ICU, all over the floor you know spreading right there so she said oh alright so she kicked myself and said go get the shot, get it just over with and get it out of here so that is when she took  her shot that was on 22nd and on 24th she was very tired all day no she was tired all day but she was kind of dragging most of the day but she had on the 20th no that was fine on the 20th okay for some reason she guess it was after work that week on 19th, she came home and her head was so congested and she had the worst headache and she felt like a wand had hit her over the head, it was horrible and all she could smell was cigarette smoke, like is her neighbor smoking here so she went down the hall because in live in building that used to be hotel but now they turned that into Condominium and she walk up and down the hall and she was like was somebody smoking or why this or why smell this so strong and the all the lights off in a hallway and she don&#39;t want to offend anybody but they had to go to work and somebody elsewhere and she am like she can&#39;t stand this smell and they gave this shot and she went for this shot, and they told us to come back she think it was a week or something like that to get the second shot, and she am saying if this going to cost her going to feel this way again, she don&#39;t want to get the second shot, she told them that and they told her to call this number and talk to them.The only reason she got it because they encouraged to get it. Even though she had the Covid virus, people said if you already have the virus you don&#39;t need to get a shot but people were encouraging because that&#39;s she thought well she guess she will get it. But she was mad that she got because it made her sick in Dec2020. And because we already got it they want us to go back and get the second shot and what she was m trying to say to you is, without take and hour 3 hour of conversation here she just want to say she don&#39;t want to get back and get the second shot and if it is okay by you guys somehow send her a letter or whatever it is, whoever she have to talk to because she don&#39;t want to go back and get the second shot just because of getting sick. She took Excedrin because that works for my headache. She didn&#39;t understand why you need all this information history with all this when all she want to say was she didn&#39;t want to get a second shot. The outcome of events Head cold and Headache was not recovered, the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                About 2 min after receiving injection, I felt an intense flushing feeling all over, it felt as if my blood had turned into lava. About a minute after that I felt a &#34;tickle&#34; in my throat. The same sensation I felt  when I had my reaction to Gadolinium.  I tried to swallow, and it was a little difficult. I did NOT feel short of breath. I tried to calm down by doing slow concentrated breathing. I continued to take small sips of water to gauge my swallowing ability. After about 2-3 minutes, the flushing sensation subsided, and swallowing started to improve.  I had brought my Epinephrine pen with me.  About 1-2 min after the flushing sensation had subsided,, it came back and my swallowing ability got much worse, to the point I couldn&#39;t  swallow a small sip. I was breathing well, and did NOT feel short of breath, but gave myself my Epinephrine injection at that time. A Rapid Response was called at that time, my vitals signs taken, an IV inserted, 911 called. O2 sats were fine mid 90&#39;s, heart rate was mid 80&#39;s, BP was elevated,  I don&#39;t remember the exact systolic 170-180, but my diastolic was 116. It took the ambulance approximately 10-15 min to arrive. By the time the ambulance arrived, I was feeling close to my baseline and my BP was improving.  I was seen by the ER MD, and feeling fairly well, my throat still felt a tiny bit tight, but no difficulties swallowing.  The plan was to complete  treatment with IV steroids, Benadryl, and Pepcid, then be observed for a few more hours. This was approximately around 16:30. Not more than 5 min after MD left my room, I got the flushing feeling, and throat closing feeling again. While the medications were being prepared these  symptoms increased, ( I could still breath adequately and vital signs were still  OK.  It took about 10 minutes after meds were given for symptoms to begin to subside ( No epi given) I was observed until 21:30 then discharged. I am taking 50 mg daily x 3 days, 25mg Benadryl q 8hrs x 3 days, and 20mg Pepcid bid x 3 days. I feel fine , no further episodes

                                                I received 2nd injection of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine at 1015AM on 1-12-21 and was doing great. I had taken one 325mg Tylenol and one  200mg Ibuprofen approximately 60 minutes prior to receiving vaccine (which is what I did prior to the first vaccine). I was doing great initially following the vaccine. I took another 325mg Tylenol and 200mg Ibuprofen when I went to bed at 2000  1-12-21. At 0300 1-13-21 I woke up feeling nauseated and when attempting to turn over to my right side I moaned loudly because I could not hardly move my left arm. My husband was woken and turned on the bedroom light and we noted a 3 inch bruise and large knot on my left deltoid at the injection site. He told me that I felt warm. I took my temperature that was 101.2 degrees. I took 650mg Tylenol and that time. At 0500 1-13-21 I was having chills, muscle and joint aches. I could not fully close my hands into a grip. My &#34;brain&#34; hurt, not a headache but literally it hurt to move my head. I would occasionally get a sharp pain in the front and back of my head. My temperature went to its highest at approximately 1500 1-13-21 to 102.5 degrees. I continued to offset Tylenol with Ibuprofen throughout the day. At 2000 1-13-21 my temperature was 101.8 and began to trend downward.  I went to bed and when I woke up on 1-14-21 I felt 100% better with just a little fatigue from the inability to sleep the day prior.

On Friday I felt no arm discomfort, but had a stomach ache all day. Saturday I was very tired and in the evening I noticed my left shot shoulder/arm pit area, bra line area was swollen and uncomfortable. Woke up in the night feeling like my left arm pit, and breast area was more swollen and if I had to paint it I would describe it as tiny bubbles all enlarged underneath my skin. Guessing it is my lymph nodes? This unusual feeling has since spread to the left side of my neck inside my throat and out.  It is not painful, I have taken a warm shower,  only wearing loose, comfy clothing and am sitting with a warm bean pillow on my neck. I just wanted to report how I am feeling if others are having similar reactions.&#34;

I share this because I got my second dose 2/17/21 batch EL9266 in left arm and again two days out got sores on my lip and tongue (total of 2 sores that hurt). The one on my tongue has made it hard to swallow, because it is far back on my tongue. I have used a peroxide product to lesson the pain. I am 5 days out from my second vaccine, and the sores are not getting worse and I hope they lesson and go away as the first batch did after about 6 days.

                                                Had Covid fairly bad I got pneumonia with it; Super tired; 103 to 104.6 fever; Glands in neck and under arm on the side where got the shot swelled up; hurt quite badly; huge swollen lymph nodes; Body ache; Could barely walk; could walk to shuffle my feet; joints stiff; Horrible headaches; Diarrhea; I was dizzy and foggy; Night I break out into a horrible sweat in night like I have to change my pajamas twice; I am like wet; Arm sore/My arm was just little bit sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 59-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 59) as a single dose, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included an unspecified heart condition and a flu shot un an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) and ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS [ASCORBIC ACID;ERGOCALCIFEROL;NICOTINAMIDE;RETINOL;RIBOFLAVIN;THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE). The patient stated, &#34;I am calling about the side effects I had from my Covid shot vaccine. I am concerned about getting the second one because my reaction was so big. I got it on Saturday, this past Saturday about 12:45 I think 12:30 and I did fine, the shot didn&#39;t hurt at all. That night I was a little bit tired but that&#39;s it. My arm was just little bit sore. The next day I got up, I still felt good I went to work for 2 hours and then about 12 o&#39;clock it hit me all at once. This Sunday I ran anywhere from a 103 to 104.6 fever and that was me taking Tylenol and I took Tylenol every 4 hour because my fever was still high. The glands in my neck and the glands under my arm on the side where I got the shot swelled up, they are still swollen. My whole body ached. I had Covid fairly bad I got pneumonia with it all for &#34;two weeks&#34; (not clarified) but my fever was not as high as got with the shot, the vaccine like I could barely walk after the vaccine because my joints were so stiff only way I could walk was to shuffle my feet, it was horrible. I had a fever yesterday all day but it was only in the 102.3 and 4, it never went back to 103. Glands in my arm and my neck hurt quite badly. My arm where I got it, it wasn&#39;t swollen but I get the same reaction when I get a Flu shot (unspecified shot) so that&#39;s not a big deal. I got horrible headaches. I had diarrhea all day Sunday and yesterday and so this morning my fever is only right around 101 like 101.1, 101.2, I am still super tired and also yesterday and day before I was dizzy and foggy. I still have a slight fever today. My lymph nodes are still swollen, my neck and under my arm, my arm where I got the shot is still swollen and sore but I can tolerate that. My joints are stiff a little bit but not nearly as bad as they were, so I don&#39;t know if I should get the second shot, everyone says the second shot is worst like all those heart palpitations start with it as well.&#34; One of my other symptom is at night I break out into a horrible sweat like I have to change my pajamas twice. It was last night and the night before. I am like really wet.&#34;  The outcome of the events was not reported.
