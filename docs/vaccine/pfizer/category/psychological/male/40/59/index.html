                                                Per reporter: &#34;I received the COVID vaccine on 12/29/2020 (first dose). The first couple days I had a really sore left arm, but didn?t feel any ?side effects? until about Wednesday, 1/6 (about a week later). I remember waking up to a sore left side of my upper body. The left side of my neck, chest, arm, and lymph node (under my left arm) felt weird. It was until about Saturday night, 1/9, that I felt my left under arm lymph node noticeably swollen. I had a bad headache and loss of energy, and overall feeling unwell. No fever or night sweats to report. I was absent from work on 1/11 and 1/12, as a result.  1/13 was my first day back and feel better. The swollen left lymph node is no longer present, but still slightly tired. I did not seek Medical Care for my symptoms.

Drove to a nearby store and stopped, felt a bit disoriented when trying to call my wife. Drank water and waited at a store for approximately 15 minutes until I felt better. This was about 40 minutes after the vaccine was administered. When driving home still some discomfort/numbing of the tongue and throat. Ate at 1:30 and symptoms had stopped.

                                                I had difficulty concentrating and focusing on Wednesday evening, a little over a day after getting my first shot. The focusing/concentration issues went away by the next morning when I woke up, however I have been feeling very tired physically since then. I&#39;m yawning all day and have very little energy or interest in doing things I need to be doing.  I&#39;m not certain that this is vaccine related, and I&#39;m not super concerned about it yet as I&#39;m on Spring break from school, but I start virtual classes again on Monday and will be concerned if I&#39;m still super tired. If it doesn&#39;t go away by next weekend, I will likely resubmit/add on to this report if that is an option.  It is not a serious concern yet so I haven&#39;t contacted medical professionals yet, but I thought it might be a good idea to at least report that this has been going on to VAERS

                                                Starting at 8pm on vaccination day I got loopy and disoriented, and had a hard time speaking intelligibly.  I also had trouble with balance and fine motor skills.  Had some personality changes too: became very moody with erratic mood swings. The next day I slept all day because of exhaustion and aches. When I woke up on Wednesday (36hrs later) I was literally screaming in pain because of how bad my arm and shoulder hurt. It hurt to move it, and hurt not to move it.  It was excruciating and ibuprofen didn&#39;t seem to help at all. Throughout Wednesday I could hardly move my left arm. Getting dressed or washing my hair was very difficult and very painful.  I was also still very uncoordinated. My left armpits lymph nodes were so swollen that (1) it filled in my entire armpit so there was no more pit, just a very soft bulge, and (2) the fluid extended all the way to my chest and it looked like I had one breast and one pec.

                                                I developed sudden-onset, severe, crushing pain in my left shoulder, radiating down my left arm.  This is the location where I received my vaccine one month prior.  The pain was 8/10 and lasted approximately 7 hours.  It woke me from sleep.  I also experienced nausea.  I tried Tylenol 1000mg, ice, and heat.  Nothing helped.  I went to the Urgent Care.  They did multiple EKGs and lab tests.  They ruled out a heart attack and pulmonary embolism.  There was no injury.  They were unable to find any cause for the pain.  They administered aspirin, protonix, and nitroglycerin.  The pain resolved after the third dose of nitroglycerin.  (I was told by the cardiology PA that this was probably a coincidence.)

                                                Started 5/11 in the morning with headache and dizziness. Left arm started feeling heavy and numb also finger tips got tingling.  Started to get sharp chest pains near my heart then started to feel fatigue. Then my tongue started to get swollen/numb and I couldn&#39;t really talk. Went to urgent care and due to my condition they called the ambulance and went to hospital. They did an EKG/chest x-rays and blood work. Couple hours later they send me home with no diagnosis just to see primary doctor.  Symptoms were mild for 2 days then again on 5/14 symptoms came back and went back to urgent care. They did an EKG/Covid test/ only and doctor just said it was a panic attack. I disagree I still don&#39;t feel completely right.

At the twelve hour mark, about, I almost immediately started shivering uncontrollably. I was very cold ad sweating. I wasnt able to think clearly. My wife said I had a fever. Also, I had a headache. This occurred for about 6 hours. I was still cold and sweating, with a headache, for about another 4 hours, but it wasn&#39;t as extreme. I was still unable to think well. I had a desire to drink gatorade, not water, at this time. This was unusual. I drank about 2L of gatorade. I began to not feel cold, and only had a minor fever. Not sure how correlated these are. Over the next 10hrs or so, I slowly improved and was able to carryon daily activities.

                                                Walking to the observation room approximately 2 minutes post shot I felt extreme dizziness.  Felt like I could potentially pass out so I waited 30 minutes in the observation room before leaving.  After I was fairly confident I would not pass out I left the facility.  When I made it outside it felt like the right side of my brain was &#34;not there,&#34; like a portion of my brain was dead.  While driving home approximately 45 minutes post shot I felt numbness and  tingling on the right side of my face.  Mental confusion also started.  I don&#39;t recall the numbness and tingling in my face continuing at this time.  Proceeded home, laid down on the couch to relax and about 3 hours post shot felt my heart racing.  Checked heart rate with pulse oximeter and heart rate was 120 w/98 oxygen.  5 minutes later the heart rate went down to around 90 but blood oxygen went to 90.  I sat up, drank water and pulse/oxygen returned to normal.  The next day the mental confusion continued.  Approx. 24 hours post shot tingling and numbness felt on right side of face.  Couldn&#39;t move lips properly, communicate to my facial muscles.  This lasted around an hour or two.  30 hrs post shot short term memory loss caused confusion when typing texts, following conversation, etc.  Symptoms improved greatly over the next couple of days.  Tiredness/general unwell feeling approximately 48hrs post shot but unremarkable.  By the time I went to a GP 84hours post shot I felt 95%.  Went to a neurologist 108hrs post shot who performed standard tests and all was well.  1 week post shot got into an argument and felt tingling and numbness on right side which lasted approximately 10 seconds.

                                                From the patient  I participated in phase 3 randomized, Double-Blind, placebo controlled Center study for Clinical Research back in December of 2020 to determine the safety and efficacy of AstraZenecas, a combination of 2 of their monoclonal antibodies (AZD8895 and AZD1061) to preexposure prophylaxis in COVID-19 I was told to wait at 90 days before I got my vaccine and I think I should have waited much longer.  Not long after I received the monoclonal antibody treatment I started to have really bad depression issues and anger problems that seemed to last up to around mid April of 2021. I also had my hepatitis viral load go from 180,000 to 580,000 in just a few months so a massive jump in hep c viral load. I reported all of this to them and they assured me that I was fine and the promised I?d be ok.  I recently got the Pfizer vaccine with my second dose being on May the 7th 2021. My first dose on April the 16th was felt within minutes and I thought I was going to have to ask a staff worker with help getting out to the car.  I was very sick for a day or so and it made me very frightened to get the second one. So much that I contacted The  council about it. Everyone was extremely polite and very helpful.  I got my second dose and it was not as bad to go through but now I have a constant fungal infection that I can not get rid of and if I eat sweets it gets really bad.  My concern is not for anyone getting just the vaccine but for the people who have had the monoclonal antibodies and then getting the vaccine within 3 months.  The second dose seemed to make me angry but it did not last as long.  I?m worried about the effects other people may have had by combining the 2 or maybe not waiting longer before getting the actual vaccine. I don?t know but I can?t get rid of this fungus and I?m not sure else who to report it to. I?ve obviously shown it to my doctor. He gave me anti fungal creams but it turns out I have an allergy to fungal creams.  I did let the drug trial site know what happened as well.  I do not think it?s a Pfizer thing but a combination of it with the AstraZeneca monoclonal antibodies and the vaccine.

                                                Within about 5 minutes of patient of patient receiving the vaccine, he had a seizure in the lobby of the pharmacy. The seizure was not witnessed by any employee, but by his companion and a customer. I immediately had a technician call 911 and ran out with our emergency kit when I heard the patient&#39;s companion screaming for help. When I got to the patient he was in a seated position in a chair in the lobby and was coming to.  He was disoriented and looking around. I asked if he knew his name and what day it was, he did know. I asked if he knew where he was and he responded correctly. He said he felt week and hot, he appeared sweaty. I checked his blood pressure (100/58) and pulse (50 bpm). His temperature was 97.1. His companion stated he had never had a seizure before when asked. I gave him some water and sat with him until EMS arrived. He remained seated the entire time and said he felt week. A few minutes after EMS arrived, the patient left via stretcher by ambulance, but remained conscience.

                                                2 days post vaccination onset of acute arthritic symptoms symmetrically along body beginning in the hips, and escalating to back, neck, shoulders, wrists, hands, and knees, in that order. Right side is now becoming more severe for pain and stiffness, but still roughly symmetrical. Symptoms are more severe upon waking and some mobility is restored by regular movement within an hour, but it is becoming harder and more painful each day. Was taking ex str. Tylenol at 500mg 8 x3 times a day for pain management, have since switched to aspirin 500mg 4-5 x2 times per day but that too is becoming less effective. Severe mobility impact, cannot get groceries, walk dog, open bags, jars, cans, and am starting to develop anxiety around the worsening symptoms. No health coverage. No primary care physician. Sporadicly I have days that the symptoms are almost completely non-existent, but these ?relief days? are never consecutive and the next day will always have the symptoms worsen again.  I have always generally been in pretty good health, and I?ve never taken anything regularly, but this has me terrified.

                                                Following the vaccination on 2/23/21, Pt had fever, chills, fatigue the first two days. On the third and fourth days, he added diarrhea and headache to those symptoms.  He felt awful over the weekend and spoke to his doctor on Monday, 3/1.  The doctor began him on steroids and ivermectin. Over the next 24 hours his breathing began to worsen. He entered the hospital on Tuesday, 3/2, for supplemental oxygen. Things continued to get worse. He was intubated and put on a ventilator on 3/6/21 and ultimately spent 13 days in a coma. He was extubated on 3/19/21 but then had seizures on 3/20/21 and had to be reintubated to secure his airway. Pt was taken back off the ventilator on 3/24/21. He suffered vocal cord paralysis and ultimately wound up with both a PEG tube and tracheotomy. He was discharged from the hospital after 43 days and then spent 10 days in an inpatient rehab center. He continues to deal with vocal cord issues, tracheal stenosis, nerve damage in his neck and shoulder, muscle atrophy, and damaged lungs.

                                                Chest pain that was much more severe when sitting or sleeping. Sleep was disrupted nightly and I was not able to sleep on my left side. The chest pain lasted about 6 weeks and occurred most severely 3-4 times per day. I visited my PCP and he said that he heard a loud murmur or wooshing sound. He checked for a fib but heart ECG was normal. We scheduled an echo but the echo was not performed until 2 months post onset of the symptoms. Symptoms seem to point to subacute pericarditis.   Increase of Petechiae on the torso. One spontaneously bled. Seems to be fading after three months.

                                                The day after had myalgias and fatigue and arm pain.  But on 1/10/21 began developing mild 2/10 headaches.  On 1/11/21 the headache  worsened to 4/10 and was associated with myalgias and neck stiffness.  After a jog, I was in the shower and noticed a rash all over my body that had been pruritic.  I went to the ER that night where I tested negative for flu A/B and also tested negative for covid (Antigen then PCR).  Got a CMP, CBC, and coags to rule out ITP.  everything was normal.  The symptoms were so bad I stayed home from work on 1/12/21.  Over the next few days the rash improved and the headache slowly went away

                                                After 1st Pfizer shot I experienced the worst headache of my life 4-6 hours after the shot with localized pulsation in my right temporal region prior to the headache.   The headache persisted through the night and I could not sleep and did not decrease with over the counter medication, my pain was rated 9/10 to 10/10 in the same area the pulsation happened.  This headache continued for 4-6 hours at a severe level than for another 6-8 hours at a moderate to severe level.  I ended up checking in at the Emergency department that I worked at after my shift and got labs and CT scan, this was after my symptoms resolved.    I thought that I might have had a head bleed and wish I would have gotten my CT earlier when experiencing the symptoms.    I was not provided a vaccine disclosure sheet or any information on what to do if experience severe symptoms or what symptoms to expect.  I am upset that I was not provided guidance about what to expect and how to manage post vaccine symptoms, I would have gone into ED sooner with this information and feel I may have missed possible diagnosis due to lack of disclosure and guidance.

Removing for changing the blanket to a thinner one resulted in extreme chills within one minute. Covering with blanket resulted in extreme hot within 10 minutes. Repeated this cycle for several hours until fall asleep.  High discomfort throughout body. Woke up at 10:00 a.m. with mild grade fever of 99.5° (average resting temperature is 96.5).  Felt extreme cold and chills shivering body aches headache until 6:00 p.m.  felt hungry and okay enough to eat.  Main concern is the extreme hot to extreme cold cycle in early morning. It felt as though the body was not in sync. During fever throughout day/afternoon body&#39;s reaction was normal - fever meant chills and shivering, putting on a blanket meant comfortable warmth (after long periods of time).   But in early morning no no fever yet body burning hot almost suffocating sauna heat insider body, and removing the blanket a immediate and severe chills with uncontrollable shaking, instead of relief from heat... Concerned if vaccine affects body&#39;s heart regulation system (hypothalamus, thyroid, etc).  General malaise during this period is an understatement... It was not a single spot or feeling pain it was the whole body wanting to twist itself and feeling &#39;deprssed&#39; and very &#39;ill&#39; all over all at once.

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot: WEN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 41years) at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included scratchy throat the day before the vaccine (27Jan2021). The patient had no concomitant medications and no investigation assessment. The patient got first dose of vaccine 28Jan2021 and was debating whether to get Covid test because of symptoms. The patient had a cough and runny nose on 29Jan2021 and fuzzy headed, scatter brained and not sleeping good in 2021. The patient considered the events as non-serious. Asked if these symptoms were from the vaccine and if getting the vaccine cause a false positive on the Covid test. Stated Friday had cough and runny nose. He stated that it felt like he had a pretty bad head cold and would not think about getting tested but since Covid was around. Wanted to know if these were common side effects of the vaccine or if he needed to get tested. The patient just moved houses and it was a stressful process. Sometimes when one gets stressed that one gets sick and may have contributed to his condition. Later clarified that this was for the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. The patient stated that the cough and runny nose worsened over the weekend and was a little better now and took alpha lipoic acid;minerals nos;quercetrin;vitamins nos (EMERGEN-C). The outcome of the events cough and rhinorrhea was recovering while unknown for the remaining events.

                                                I felt fine at first for the 15 minutes they held me for observation. But as I walked out to my car I quickly got heavy and tired and started to ache and have a headache. I had to rest in my car for a while before driving home. Once home I crashed immediately for around 4 hours in the middle of the day which is not like me. I had an important dinner meeting i had to attend for my livelihood. I thought I was feeling better but half way through Dinner  I started feeling bad again. Got to the point that I stopped eating and excused myself to get home and rest. Symptoms progressed rapidly. Unfortunately I was pulled over for a minor traffic stop and  tried to explain that I was having a bad reaction to the vaccine and needed to get home. They wouldn?t believe me  and torturously treated me like an OVI. I?m hoping that I can get some kind of documentation and or assistance. I have court on the 1st and it will be devastating if I am convicted. I was not intoxicated  and was not warned about the dangers of driving after the vaccine. Please call me. I need help

Since then there has been nausea and headache, and I have trouble sleeping in. I feel some more discomfort after eating food.  I have intermittent fever also. It has been about 10 days today since I got my COVID Pfizer shot  and I still don&#39;t feel physically well. I just wanted to report this, as the impression from documentation I read is that symptoms should go away in 3-4 days.

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included drug hypersensitivity from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Allergic to sulfa, PCN and amoxicillin. The patients concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date the patient experienced sleep for a few minutes, I didnt pass out but it was similar, was pulled over for minor traffic violation. He was told to get out of the car and had a field sobriety test, and I looked intoxicated, felt heavy and tired/run down, had a headache, bad diarrhea, upset stomach, sleep for a few minutes, I didnt pass out but it was similar, crashed for 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day which I never do, aching, overall weakness, started feeling sick again at dinner, he went to the bathroom a few times, woke up feeling really bad. The patient was worried because everything was coming to a head right now. The caller got the first shot, he waited for 15 minutes and felt fine. As the caller walked to his car he began feeling heavy, had severe diarrhea, headache, aching, it was almost like he passed out, it felt like he went to sleep. The patient got home and crashed 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day and woke up feeling really bad. The patient went to a very important dinner meeting that night. While the patient was at the meeting he went to the bathroom a few times and then excused himself because he felt so bad. The patient did not even finish one cocktail with dinner. The caller got pulled over for a minor traffic stop, cutting the corner and crossing the line or something small. The officers believed the caller was driving under the influence and started making him do a sobriety test with 40 degree wind gusts, the patient was miserable. The caller told the officers that he needed to seek medical attention but they ignored him. The officers forced the caller to do the urine test. It has been 5 days since his vaccination and he is just now feeling better. The outcome of events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed.  No further information is expected.

I otherwise felt fine and had a normal day of moderate physical activity.     I awoke in the middle of the night with chills and body aches and a strong feeling of anxiety.   I was able to fall back asleep and woke up as normal a few hours later.  I had a very strong head ache centered behind my sinuses,  body aches in my pelvis and legs, and hot flashes mixed with chills.  Aches were manageable with Tylenol.  As the day progressed those continued and I was very fatigued.   I went to bed earlier than normal and after a full night&#39;s sleep symptoms subsided.

                                                3/26 @ 3:15pm ? Got the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for the 1:10pm appointment. However actual time received was around 3:15pm. No vaccine reaction was observed and drove back home. However did not eat or drink much from morning till 4:30pm due to the long line at the vaccination center   4/4 @ 9:00pm ? Experienced first sign of near-syncope at the dinner table upon picking up a glass of milk  4/6 @ 8:45am ? Experienced brain fog, to be exact head felt like it was filled with cotton candy, at the back and top of the head. Felt this way the entire day. Went to work as usual. Logged out at around 5:30pm  4/7 @ 9:00am ? dizziness started getting worse. Started feeling imbalance and started losing depth perception which climbing down staircase  4/8 @ 10:00am ? started to get easily startled by any unexpected trigger. Whole body would ?twitch? or ?startle? upon slightest unexpected event. For e.g., sound, touch, taste (hot/cold)  4/10 @ 12:00pm ? Went to ER. ER ordered series of book tests, EKG, chest x-ray. Everything came out normal. ER doctor said to wait it out and after a week symptom may go away. ER doctor felt body?s immune response was over-working due to the vaccine immune response and possibly pollen allergy I may have experienced right after getting the vaccine. No prescription meds give. Advised to take Meclizine 25mg and Zyrtec. Below are the symptoms experienced on 4/10:  ? Lightheadedness/Sudden Jerking body movements when triggered/passing out momentarily for a second when taking strain/not in my elements ? Feeling extremely fatigued. Did not sleep well at night on 4/8 and 4/9 ? Head feels Intoxicated, foggy, lightheaded, as if stuffed with cotton candy. Startled when unexpected things happen like a sudden jerking movement along with momentary passing out while anything unexpected happens. E.g., when I am pushing myself on the sofa to re-position, I feel my whole body is turning off for a second. Simply does not feel normal ? Rubbery legs ? Worsens after shower. I feel like I need to lay down as the foggy feeling worsens after shower ? Lightheadedness. Losing control sometimes. ? I am easily startled when climbing down the stairs - no Depth perception. ? Don?t have the strength to blow nose or cough. Feels like momentary fainting when doing these activities ? Dis-equilibrium. Whole body is twitching when something unexpected happens to my senses. ? Unable to control while laughing feels like momentary faint. I have felt like this when I was down with a fever. Tickled easily ? Difficulty pulling myself out of bed. Felt like muscle was giving away ? Tingling feeling in the right abdomen area ? Difficulty staying alert or focused and random rather unpleasant thoughts constantly coming to mind. Felt a bit of panic attack.  4/11 ? Went to PCP. Body weakness and fatigue got worse. PCP did blood sugar test and flushed out the left ear. Ordered Brain MRI to see if structurally anything was wrong. Brain MRI came out OK as well however noticed minor sinusitis. Prescribed Amoxicillin antibiotics and nasal spray. Referred me to Neurologist and Head and Neck Specialist.  4/11 ? 4/15 - Above symptoms progressively got worse. Especially weakness in the arms and shoulders. Arms quivered every time trying to stand up and felt like fainting. Hand-eye coordination progressively got worse. For e.g., could not pick up water bottle, hands were quivering badly  4/15 ? Neurologist conducted certain diagnostic tests and concluded that there are no neurological issues. Said with rest and plenty of fluids it should get better. Spinal tap was not recommended and said if symptoms got worse a spinal tap can be done during the next visit. Follow up visit with neurologist scheduled on 4/27  4/15 ? 4/27 ? Weakness in arms got better. Arm strength and coordination has improved however it?s still not back to normal. Brain fog and dizziness still persists with no improvement. Left limb and arms are stronger than the left. Difficulty climbing up and down stairs. Dizziness worsens after shower. Not feeling myself. In addition, not able to multitask - getting startled and need to be deliberate about having to do everyday chores need to just focus on one task 100% completely and if something else comes up then my body just goes into a momentary shock. Mostly I can feel my head feeling heavy and my eyelids shutting down when something shocking happens ? a feeling like body is ?turning off?, almost a fainting or passing out feeling. Sometimes when I turn to one side and sleep, I can feel a flickering sensation in the ear. Still always feeling woozy and as if there is something in my head ? a medicated or intoxicated feeling in the head  4/27 ? Neurologist said she sees a lot of improvement and reiterated again that I don?t have any neurological issues. She said I can go back to work starting 5/1. She said I may have Conversion Disorder / Disequilibrium. It?s hard for me to fathom why she would diagnose me with Conversion Disorder when so many people are reporting very similar symptoms that I am facing on the below forum: https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/dizziness-among-common-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/  4/30 ? Next appointment with Head and Neck / Audiology

Started my work day from home with a meeting at 0900 and knew by 0920 that I had to take the day off.   Spent the entire rest of the day and night in bed. Fever peaked at 101.1F , nausea, constant headache, shaking chills and then sweats, extreme fatigue and full body severe muscle soreness. Light headed and very weak.  I slept all day until almost 1500. When I woke up my fever was gone. I&#39;m left tonight feeling hungry again along with some residual sore muscles and aches.  The fever responded well to Ibuprofen. I hydrated with water and Gatorade.  It pretty much felt like influenza for just under 48 hours. I feel like I&#39;m past the worst of it now, but I&#39;m not fully recovered.

                                                On April 18 and 19, following my 2nd injection, I had very bad chills and could not get warm. I was nauseous although I did not vomit. On April 22, I began having severe sharp stabbing pains just to the right of my belly button. It felt like I was being stabbed with a very hot knife, and after about 15-90 seconds, it would go away. Anytime I reached for something, bent over, twisted, turned or tried to hug someone, I would get this same pain and it would double me over in pain.  On Monday April 26 at 7pm, I finally checked into the Emergency Room  at the direction of my Primary Doctor.  They did a bunch of blood work on me and sent me for a CT Scan of my abdomen.  All of the blood work came back in normal ranges, and the CT Scan showed my appendix was &#34;borderline&#34; according to the surgeon. They consulted with Dr and decided to admit me for a surgical consult and further examination.  They gave me fluids and morphine through an IV for the first 24 - 36 hrs, and then switched to Norco by mouth. I continued having pain throughout my stay.  On Thursday, April 29, they took me to surgery for &#34;exploratory surgery&#34; with the intention of removing my appendix and looking around to see if anything else stood out to them that would cause me this pain.  They stated my appendix had scar tissue on it and they removed it, but said they did not know if this would stop the pain I was having.  On Friday April 30, I was released from the hospital at approximately 6pm.  By 9pm on Friday, I began having those same sharp, stabbing, burning pains in my abdomen again, now to the right of my belly button again and further towards my right side.  I also had sharp burning pain in the inside of my upper right arm, between my bicep and tricep muscles.  This pain continued on through the weekend occurring more frequently and more severe.  On Monday morning at about 1:30am, I woke up with severe abdominal pains all over and went into the bathroom.  I had diarrhea and nausea and felt like I was going to vomit.  Between 1:30am and 7:30am, I went to the bathroom 6 times.  I went to work on Monday and continued having abdominal pains and diarrhea all day and night.  On Tuesday, I went to the bathroom a total of 17 times. On Wednesday, I saw my primary Dr.,  who examined my abdomen and pains.  He suggested I take immodium for the diarrhea and a supplement for muscle pain, as he felt this was the cause of my pain. On Wednesday, I went to the bathroom 21 times and was very nauseaus.  I started the Imodium and it had no effect on me whatsoever.  On Thursday, I had to call off work because I couldn&#39;t stop using the bathroom.  By 4pm, I had been to the bathroom 18 times.  I returned to the ER.  They took a stool sample and did an ultrasound in the ER.  They decided to admit me again for surgical consult and pain management.  On Friday, Dr ordered another ultrasound of my abdomen, specifically my gallbladder, kidney, and liver.  He also sent me for a CT Scan with contrast.  They completed a total lab workup of my blood.  All of these results came back normal, and nothing on the images showed anything wrong with my organs.   On Saturday May 8, Dr came to the hospital to examine me. He stated everything related to my GI was fine.  He asked if I have back pain, which I told him I do.  At this time, I was in extreme pain and I couldn&#39;t even touch my skin. Dr attempted to examine my abdomen, and just by placing his hand on my stomach, I screamed in pain.  He then put his hand behind my back and pushed a little, and it cause extreme pain in my abdomen.  At this time, Dr suggested that maybe the pain is caused by something going on in my back.  Maybe a pinched nerve or something.  He ordered an X-ray of my upper and lower spine.  Later that day, the results of the X-ray came back and showed there was nothing wrong with my spine.  With these results, Dr then ordered an MRI of my lumbar and thoracic spine.  On Sunday May 9 at 1030am, I was taken to radiology for an MRI.  The initial report shows that I do not have any pinched nerves and nothing notable that would cause this type of pain in my body.   As of now, no diagnosis or explanation for the pain I am experiencing. The pain is gradually getting worse and at times I am unable to move at all without extreme severe pain in my body.  At times, my right groin hurts and I am unable to stand on my feet, as it feels as if I have pulled a groin muscle.  The pain in my abdomen takes my breath away and feels like I am being set on fire in that area of my body.  The pain no longer goes away and is constant, but moves throughout my right side from my groin to my shoulder only.  I am not able to put my right arm behind my back because I get this pain in the back of my shoulder area.  This pain is only on my right side at this time.  So far, there is no explanation for this pain.  I never had anything like this until I got the vaccine.

A 41-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 14Apr2021 (at the age of 41-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. He reports that on Monday 19Apr2021 he experienced a burning sensation, discomfort, and aching in his arm &#34;right where he got the shot&#34; and reports that it feels like he just received the vaccine. He tells me that right after he got the vaccine he worked out and that night (Wednesday night on 14Apr2021) he did not sleep well. He states on Thursday night he slept okay, Friday and Saturday night did not sleep good, Sunday &#34;so so&#34;, and then states yesterday (22Apr2021) he started to ache and today he was feeling &#34;more achy.&#34; Caller would like to know if it was normal to have a reaction this late to the vaccine. He was concerned about whether he should take the second dose of the vaccine because of this, and states his next dose was due 5May2021. Response: Spoke from the prescribing information PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE to let caller know that side effects were reported over a 7-day period following each dose of the vaccine and also let caller know that &#34;the mean duration of pain at the injection site after dose 2 was 2.5 days (range 1 to 36 days).&#34; Spoke from the attached documents regarding contraindications to receiving a dose of the vaccine and what signs of a severe allergic reaction could include. Referred caller to healthcare professional (HCP) for further guidance. Caller would like to know if it was okay to take a medication such as Advil to treat his symptoms that he was experiencing after receiving the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Response: Spoke from the attached document regarding the use of medications such as Tylenol and Ibuprofen after vaccination to treat symptoms. Referred caller to HCP for any further guidance on medication recommendations. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Malaise;  Night sweat about 36 hours after first dose;  Chills all night one night after the second dose. Soreness at injection site for first 30 hours after first dose, not as much after second dose.  Fatigue, depression and irritability in the weeks after the first dose. After the second dose it is too soon to tell.

Worst I&#39;ve ever felt in my adult life, like my whole body was rebelling against me.  Long-term (for roughly 10 days after both shots): Serious shortness of breath, irregular and very high heartbeat, extreme fatigue. Couldn&#39;t do any physical activity without immediately becoming out of breath (normally very healthy and active). Heart would race unpredictably, reaching 120 bpm (normal resting for me is 60-70). General malaise. Felt more like 80 years old than 40. Was unable to do normal physical activity and work for weeks.  Feeling better overall, but still sometimes feel like I get tired unusually easily and heart behaves strangely now and then.

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 23Apr2021 14:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0171, not sure if the 0 is a O or a 0) as single dose at the age of 41-year-old for covid-19 immunisation, administered not at a military facility.  Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease diagnosed about 10 years ago, ongoing vitamin D deficiency diagnosed about 8 years ago, ongoing vitamin b12 deficiency diagnosed about 8 years ago, lung neoplasm malignant. Family history included: dad had lung cancer, mother had thyroid issues and Alzheimer&#39;s. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events following prior vaccinations. The patient experienced terrible pain in his stomach which made him scream to the point where he lost his voice on 24Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 27Apr2021, metallic taste in the mouth on 23Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 24Apr2021, had diarrhea on 24Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 26Apr2021, a fever of 103°F on 24Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 26Apr2021, he was shivering due to lack of energy on 24Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 27Apr2021, lost his voice on 24Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 27Apr2021, threw up on 24Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 27Apr2021, sleeping for 48 hours on 24Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 27Apr2021.   The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body mass index: 37 on an unknown date, body temperature: 103 Fahrenheit on 24Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible pain in his stomach which made him scream to the point where he lost his voice, had diarrhea, threw up. The course of events was as follows: Within the 1st 24 hours, he mentioned that he was fine and easy but had a metallic taste in the mouth for 24 hours. He mentioned that the next 72 hours were really bad for him. On 24Apr2021, that night, he started to feel terrible pain in his stomach which made him scream to the point where he lost his voice. It was like knives cutting his stomach. He threw up everything he ate, had diarrhea for 2 days along with a fever of 103 degree F for 2 days. He would try to go to the bathroom and he was shivering due to lack of energy that he could not go to the bathroom. He slept for 48 hours after the 1st 24 hours after vaccination due to the side effects. By Monday afternoon, 26Apr2021, he noticed that his side effects were subsiding and by Tuesday, 27Apr2021, he was a different person and was like nothing happened, he was able to resume a normal life and go back to work. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or physician Office. He did not go he was taking orange juice and ibuprofen to treat himself. No relevant tests. He asked if this was contraindicated with him to get the 2nd dose. He has not spoken to his doctor yet. He queried if he should get the second dose or is it contraindicated. Patient mentioned he is very large at 6&#39;6&#34; and 320 lbs. He is wondering if he should have a different dose because he is so big.  This report is not related to a study or program.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. No further information is expected.

My whole body was sweating and my vision was affected (everything was bright).  I was able to return to the store but was close to passing out.  I sat down for about 10-15 minutes while the symptoms persisted and I was not able to see well.  After that time the sweating stopped and my sight was no longer affected.  This was not anxiety and I have no history of fainting with shots.  This was a reaction to the shot.  After about an hour I felt fine except for muscle soreness at the injection sight.  If the reaction was any worse I would have passed out or asked for help.  I am hesitant to get a second dose out of concern that the reaction could be worse.

                                                Muscular pain in both upper arms well after initial vaccine reaction had subsided, normal movement of arm up and/or back and rapid movements in other axes cause intense muscle pain followed by severe minutes of pain fading to dull ache. The pain issue has only worsened since it&#39;s onset. The pain in each arm is proportionate to the initial vaccine reaction, meaning the arm that got the second dose experiences more sever pain than the one that got the first. The pain in both is preventing normal activities and affecting quality of life.

I have sporadically experienced ringing in my Right ear as well but not nearly to the extent I have in my left ear. I also experienced frequent, daily headaches for about the first month or so after the shot. I also experienced neck/right shoulder stiffness for about 3 weeks following the shot. I continue to wake up on a daily basis with a feeling in my head and ears like I&#39;ve been listening to loud music or been in a loud sporting event for several hours (on top of the still nonstop/constant ringing in my left ear that will not go away). I have also experienced swelling in my feet and ankles anytime i&#39;m active for an extended period of time

                                                I was vaccinated on 1/2/2021 and developed oral parasthesias the day of the vaccination. On day 3 after the vaccine, I developed a severe headache with ?brain fog,? confusion, and hyperacusis. The headache has now persisted for 10 days and was severe enough that I missed several days of work this week as I was unable to carry out my clinical duties. I was seen in ED this past weekend and ultimately followed up with neurology after the headache had persisted for 7&#43; days. The working theory is that I may have developed aseptic meningitis as a side effect of the vaccine and I am currently on a steroid taper which has resulting in partial but significant improvement in my symptoms. I am back at work but still experiencing a mild headache and facial parasthesias. I did request a Covid test in ED 1 on 1/10/21 and tested negative.

I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

Once i would start to feel better after sleeping 4-6 hours. I get out of bed thinking I was better, then another hour or so later the symptoms were back, so I would go back to bed shivering uncontrollably off and on again, sweating and uncomfortable until falling back to sleep.. This lasted for about 48 hours, which started 72 after receiving my vaccination.  No adverse symptoms the first 2 days following the vaccination. I got vaccinated on Tuesday, 1/19/21 - symptoms started Friday, 1/22/21 - Saturday, 1/23/21.  Sunday, 1/24/21 I finally felt normal again.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

                                                Day of the shot (in the afternoon) I felt began feeling ?off?.    Day after the shot I had pretty severe body aches and exhaustion that lasted for two full days and lingered for a third day although not as severe.  It?s now a week since the last vaccination shot and I went for my first run since the vaccination.  I regularly run about 5 miles 3x a week in the mornings.  On this run,; which was at about 75% of my normal pace,  my lungs felt very heavy with very labored breathing, having to stop and catch my breath periodically.  I eventually had to stop at mile 3.

                                                On Monday I had the COVID vaccination. I noticed no side effects on Tuesday other than tenderness at the injection site. On Wednesday, I noticed light bruising up and down my arms. Thursday morning around 10 AM, I started to have side effect - some so severe they must be documented. At 10 AM, I felt lightheaded and had brain fog. By noon my head was pounding with a headache followed by an upset stomach. At 2 PM things started getting bad and continued to worse. It was not the headache or stomach that need to be noted but a sudden and severe onset of depression and anxiety. - Depression like I have not felt in years when I was at my worst. Throughout the day the depression worsened and by 7 PM, I was unable to stop crying and was overwhelmed with anxiety and  PTSD panic attacks. While I have the training to understand  this is temporary, - I am very worried about what I?m feeling , because there was no warning or mention of this side effect. I have the resources needed for this but people that are more fragile need to prepare for the sudden o set of critical/ debilitating depression.

The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccine this past Thursday, 28Jan2021. The next morning (29Jan2021), he woke up with real soreness at the point of administration of his left arm, well beyond what he remembered for a flu vaccine. The second night (30Jan2021), the soreness progressed. It was hard to sleep on his left arm. It was like he had been punched. He had to sleep on his right side versus his left side. On 29Jan2021, the muscle soreness at the point of injection spread to his whole body, it was like aches all over his body. The soreness has gotten a little bit better day by day.

The fatigue really started to set in on Friday evening (29Jan2021), it was like he got hit by a truck.  He was typically a high energy person and its very out of the ordinary for him to feel this way. He normally has class on Saturday from 9-noon but he had to cancel going with the amount of fatigue he was experiencing. He also had some cognitive fuzziness on Jan2021. His fatigue was still there, but it has gotten a little better. He was normally very high energy, but he missed two classes and skipped his internship today. He doesn&#39;t feel like himself. He also has had frequent urination which he noticed probably Friday night (29Jan2021), all the way up until now. However, he has been drinking a lot of water. The patient received a test/report showing he has no chromosomal issues and no likelihood of issues on an unspecified date. The outcome of soreness at the point of administration of his left arm and Frequent urination was not recovered; Muscle soreness/muscle soreness at the point of injection spread to his whole body and fatigue was recovering; it was like aches all over his body and cognitive fuzziness was unknown.

I lost all energy and struggled to get out of bed and walk. Laid in bed all day, took Tylenol, slept off and on. Didn&#39;t subside until 6:00pm the next evening when I broke out in a sweat and got some energy back.

                                                30-35 minutes after injection, while I was driving home, I felt some minor difficulty swallowing., but no impediment to breathing or speaking.  I rerouted to a plaza with a grocery store and urgent care clinic, and bought some Benadryl and took it at about 2:55PM.  I waited 20 minutes in the parking lot before deciding I was safe to drive home. When I read about the possibility of a biphasic reaction, where my throat could close up again later, I went to a Clinic (5:40PM walk-in appointment with NP), and they could not treat me, and advised me to go to the Emergency Room. I initially decided to just go home, but went to the Emergency Room out of an abundance of caution at around 7PM.  Dr.  gave me a prescription for an epi pen and prednisone, just in case symptoms worsened.  They did not, and I did not use either drug.  The throat swelling started around 2:45PM and worsened for about half an hour. It remained steady (no airway constriction, no difficulty taking pills or drinking water) without getting worse, and started to subside around 5PM.  By the time I woke up this morning (3/31), I don&#39;t think there is any lingering swelling.  I can feel a very slight lump in my throat, but I can&#39;t tell if that is a very small amount of residual swelling or just hyper-vigilance based on yesterday&#39;s experience.  Note: This swelling feeling is identical to my memory of what I felt when I was diagnosed as allergic to penicillin in 2000 or 2001. Back then, the only &#34;treatment&#34; was to immediately stop taking penicillin (and to never take it again), based on a phone call with my doctor&#39;s office.  I did have a strong immune response after that (102° fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain), but I don&#39;t consider that an adverse reaction.  This report is focused on what appeared to be a mild anaphylactic reaction.

Third day was the same.  Loss of appetite and dehydrated.  Severe itching on my back.  Today is the fourth day and I broke out with a rash on my back.  Cortisone has relieved it thus far.  My appetite is back.  I did not vomit but still experiencing diarrhea.

                                                Paramedic called to observation for 42 YO male with dizziness, lightheaded, and anxiety.  Upon arrival PT found sitting in chair A&amp;OX4, skins: pink/warm/dry, pupils: Equal and reactive. Pt speaks very little English and PT&#39;s wife translated for him.   PT states that he started feeling symptoms 10 minutes after receiving his Pfizer vaccine. Upon assessment PT states he has 10/10 chest pain non radiating/dull in nature with increased pain on inspiration. Pt states that this has happed before a few months ago and was diagnosed with HTN but was not prescribed any medication by his primary care physician. PT does not take any medications and has no allergies. Pt status did not improve or decrease while in the care of the paramedic. Pt vitals then assessed and were as follows: 0943: BP 172/118, HR 71, RR 24, SPO2 99% RA, Lungs clear/equal bilaterally. 1002: BP 180/131, HR 80, RR22, SPO2 98% RA, Lungs clear/equal bilaterally. The paramedic made the decision to activate the EMS 911 system.  Upon EMS arrival report given to responding paramedics and PT care transferred. EMS Paramedics began to treat patient for Chest Pain Protocol, and transported PT to Local ER.

                                                1 minute after vaccine injection I experienced a tightening of my throat.  It was very uncomfortable and made it difficult to swallow  and felt like a &#34;lump in my throat&#34;.  I asked an onsite nurse if this was a common reaction, and she offered medical attention.  I denied it because it was not getting worse.  She gave me a bottle of water and it seemed to help it a bit while drinking.  But, quickly returned after water was swallowed.  I was monitored for 30 minutes as recommended.  The tightness remained for 1 hour post vaccine injection and disappeared as quickly as it started.  I fear the second dose may be worse.

                                                I had a strange feeling in the left side of my face that I wasn&#39;t sure if it was a reaction or not.  It happened within the first 15 minutes but did not last more than 30 minutes.  I did not experience anything else until the first evening when my arm was very sore.  The next day my arm was more sore and I had a mild circular red mark around the injection site and the arm was much harder on that side.  I also felt a little in my back and neck.  By the second day in the evening the only thing I felt was pain in the arm which eventually traveled into my armpit by day 3.  It wasn&#39;t until day 5 that all the pain was completely gone.  I may have experienced fatigue the first two days also.

                                                Starting the night of the injection, my left arm gets numb from my elbow to my fingertips. Only my ring and pinky finger are affected.  The color and temp of the fingers are normal, but it feels like the circulation is cut off. If I get up and work it for about a half-hour it is completely normal (and stays so throughout the day). This wakes me up 3-4 times a night and continues to this day &gt;3 weeks later.  I started Zeposia medication a few days before this shot. I didn&#39;t have this effect with my 2nd shot in my other arm.  I did use an ax to chop wood for 4 hours 2 days before the shot, and my arm was sore from that before the injection. It&#39;s possible this is unrelated to the shot altogether, and I did something to trigger some sort of carpal tunnel with the ax. I plan on discussing with my Dr at some point.

                                                Pt was found in severe distress in the bathroom by his wife.  He couldn&#39;t walk or stand, complained of being dizzy with slurred speech and was throwing up a lot. 911 was immediately called. The EMTs during their assessment said his BP was normal but when he was asked his name, he started saying the alphabet&#34;ABC... XYZ&#34;.  He was transported by ambulance to ER. Cat scan showed he had a bleed on the brain.  The doctors told us it was because he had very high blood pressure, however where the bleed was, they said he wouldn&#39;t need surgery and that the body would reabsorb it over time.  He was admitted to the ICU and has been there ever since.  Several days later, he started having difficulty breathing and they discovered several blood clots in his right leg that had broken off into his heart and lungs.  He had emergency surgery to remove the clots in his heart (approximately 10) and was given heparin in small doses over an 8 hour period so that it wouldn&#39;t cause the bleed in his brain to increase.  The doctor should fill in the rest.

I ended up checking myself into the emergency room 5 hours after the vaccine shot because my heart rate wouldn&#39;t slow down and my blood pressure increased. They found out my heart had gone into atrial fibrillation. I have had no known history of atrial fibrillation in the past and prior EKG&#39;s at physicals have been normal.   I am an otherwise healthy individual.The doctor conducted an emergency  Cardioversion to return the heart rhythm to normal.

He said the rest of the week he didn&#39;t feel quite right.  A week after the vaccine he started with red capillary veins popping up all over his legs. By Saturday his legs were purple and swollen. He has multiple tests run at the hospital. They doctor believes it is vasculitis that has resulted from patient getting the covid vaccine.

                                                About six hours after receiving my shot, my arm became extremely sore, as to be expected.  Circa 9pm I began to have  significant trouble breathing, experienced acute pain in my abdomen, and began to hear ringing in my ears combined with feeling like I was going to pass out. I didn?t feel dizzy, rather I started getting tunnel vision that blocked out more of my field of view as the ringing increased.  Circa 11pm, I lost consciousness while trying to move and collapsed on the floor. My wife called 911 while I was unresponsive, and I regained consciousness while being attended to by EMTs who checked my vitals. Around 12am I didn?t feel like I was going to lose consciousness again, and the EMTs recommended I be taken to the hospital. Since I was feeling better I politely declined.   Today I am still feeling foggy and have joint pain (in addition to some bruising from falling after losing consciousness , but I no longer have the acute abdominal pain.

Paced around my house and backyard in a fog, confused, not clear of thought. Had a hard time spelling words in emails. Symptoms went away within 45-60 minutes and did not return. Since that time felt a little tired but nothing serious. Today I feel completely normal.

                                                initially began as what felt like jolts to my chest area from inside my chest over five days beginning on March 31, 21 @ 1:20am; next on April 01, 2021 @ 12:02am; then April 02, 2021 @1:02am; then April 03, 2021 @ 1:36am; and on April 04, 2021 @ 2:46am. I ended up in the emergency room the afternoon of Sunday March 04, 2021 with severe chest, abdominal, and intestinal pain. I followed up with doctors on April 05, 2021; April 09, 2021; and April 28, 2021 with continued painful symptoms described below. All they has done so far is 1) took a chest X-ray, 2) taken blood, and 3) referred me to a sleep laboratory.  The X-ray and blood work came back negative per ER.  Symptoms: 1. Inability to sleep. most nights feels as if I just drank five cups of coffee before bed. When I am able to fall asleep, pain and/or jolts coming from inside my trunk/core area wake me up within about an hour.  2. Constant pain coming from my chest, abdomen, and intestines. Intestinal and abdominal pain (gut wrenching, pain/burning sensation, cramps). At times feels like radiation or waves/currents are passing through my intestines/trunk. I wake up with intestines feeling sore. I also have discomfort when I eat or drink something the following morning. Also, my trunk/core area feels tight all day and night. I constantly feel a burning sensation in my chest and gut areas. The discomfort in my chest area (tightness, burning sensation) with occasional burst of pain the size of a nickel that comes from the left side of my chest and underneath my rib cage.  3. Limbs twitch/jerk on their own (both hands, both feet, neck, both shoulders, both legs, fingers) during the day and during the night. tingling sensations in legs.  4. ringing in the ears with headaches. 5. Woke up from sleep due to both nostrils getting clogged while I slept; woke up gasping for air.  6. Penis no longer has the same sensation and difficulty with erection.

A 42-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL1284, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm (at the age of 42 years old) on 08Jan2021 14:30 as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There were no medical history (reported as none) and no concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (brand as Pfizer) for Covid-19 immunisation on 18Dec2020 (at the age of 42 years old) at 03:30 PM administered on the right arm. The vaccine was administered on a hospital. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. On 08Jan2021 11:00 PM, the patient experienced personality changes, headaches, and extreme fatigue, and also was unaware on conversations that he had. The symptoms lasted about 24 hours acutely, but for the 3 weeks afterwards, patient had high blood pressure and insomnia (2021). It would seem that patient had cerebritis from the shot since an unspecified date in 2021. Adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. There were no treatments received in response to the events reported. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered with lasting effects.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is too limited to make a meaningful medical assessment. Based on the available clinical data, the event encephalitis most likely represented an intercurrent medical condition not related to vaccination with BNT162B2. This case will be re-assessed when relevant follow-up information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I had minor pain prior to second vaccination but beginning in the hours immediately following the second dose it became much worse. It migrates throughout the arm and shoulder throughout the day. I am taking prescription pain medication and muscle relaxers for the first time in my life. I could not go to work for 5 days, I now can make it through the day with heavy medication. I have also been prescribed physical therapy for 7 more weeks.

I missed several days of work and was prescribed muscle relaxers and Norco, I have never taken this type of medication in my life. I cannot sleep more than 4-5 hours total per night due to pain. I have also been prescribed 7 weeks of physical therapy which provides relief at the moment but does not last.

He developed tingling sensations in his arms and legs.  He has had mental fog.  He had some HA and eye pain.  His PCP sent him to the ED for evaluation.  He was evaluated by neuro consult on 4/4, had an LP.  THe LP only showed some elevated protein (somewhat traumatic tap based on 10 RBC in tube 4).  MRI brain, cervical/thoracic spine was unremarkable.  He was dx w/ possible post-infectious polyneurophathy, and suggested f/u w/ neuro clinic for further eval.

He reports that the HA has resolved.   In the past 2-3 days he has had felt less fatigue.  He still has arthralgias, continuous.  They do not seem to be worse in AM or PM.  He can do most activities and just tired working out this week.  Activity does not seem to make it better or worse.  The joints are not red or swollen but feel &#34;tight&#34;.  He has not noticed any fevers but gets occasional nightsweats or sometimes feels flush and measures only a low grade temp that does not last (&lt;100F).  He has had slight decrease in wt but no change in appetite.  No n/v/d.  NO cough, sob, CT/CP, wheezes. No rash. He does have some sinus sx&#39;s which he thinks could be c/w seasonal allergies.

                                                At first it was a lot of joint and muscle pain all over, and then I got shingles by the weekend. I thought they were bug bites and I wasn&#39;t sure where all the pain was coming from and I ended up in the emergency room where I was diagnosed with shingles. After my second shot I started getting shingles by laterally on my right side, but I was already on medication so it didn&#39;t get that bad. I also have a lot of joint pain and burning pain in my hands and wrists that shoot up my arms and haven&#39;t stopped since the symptoms started. It&#39;s much worse at night and keeps me up from sleeping. I have also have been very forgetful and my mind is always cloudy.

Pt states that after receiving his 2nd dose on 05/06, he noticed his leg stiffness got significantly worse. He tells me that he tried to &#34;push through the pain&#34; and mow his lawn but had to stop d/t severe cramping of the LLE and pelvis. He states he rested his leg and went to bed, and when he woke up he noticed that his left leg was severely swollen. Pt decided to take 3 days off work to continue to rest the leg, but ultimately came in for evaluation at the suggestion of his coworkers. Pt denies fever, chills, chest pain, or SOB. He denies history of smoking, prior clotting, long car travel, air travel, leg injury, or recent surgery.    On exam, the left lower extremity is significantly swollen, erythematous, and hot to the touch. Physical exam otherwise unremarkable. Will admit to the hospitalist service for further medical management.   ED Course: Hypertensive with BP 170/93. Initial workup significant for WBC 13, K 3.3, glucose 159. CT chest/a/p with findings suggestive of multiple PE&#39;s of the left and right lower lobes as well as extensive LLE DVT extending slightly into the IVC. Trop &lt;0.03. BNP 66.

After a few hours my arm down to my elbow was VERY soar, my back around my shoulder blade became soar, and over my shoulder up to my neck into the left side of my head was very soar and achy.  Headaches were present most of the first day.  That night, around supper time I felt nauseous and then had some severe stomach cramps.  I didn?t sleep well and woke up with the same bad pain from my elbow to my shoulder and also my shoulder blade to my neck and head.  Most of the symptoms were gone after 48 hrs.

                                                Skin began to ache and became sensitive about 11 hours after vaccine was received.  Began having chills, lethargy, body aches (it felt like both inside of body and outside of skin), nausea, and high fever. Took Tylenol and Advil to attempt to alleviate symptoms. Could not get to sleep until about 12:30 a.m. and woke up at 2:30 a.m. with headache, extreme chilling, and intense body aches. I didn&#39;t know if I could walk. I put a sweatshirt and a coat on, and my teeth were chattering uncontrollably. I can&#39;t remember the last time that I was that sick. I contemplated going to the ER but didn&#39;t think I could drive. The entire day was a headache, nausea and lethargy. When at the clinic, I stated that I had heard that there could be some minor side effects with the 2nd shot and was told, &#34;Nah, people make things up.&#34; I&#39;m so glad that I&#39;m vaccinated, but people need to be forewarned of those kinds of side effects. They have to be aware because that was dangerously sick and was totally unprepared to combat it. 103&#43; degree fever and this kinds of symptoms aren&#39;t things that a person should have to try to make it through alone.

This other HCP reported for patient (reporter&#39;s son). A 42-year-old male received (age at vaccination: 42 year) first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0169 and expiry date was reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Right, on 22Apr2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included spinal muscular atrophy, osteoporosis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Concomitant medications included adalimumab (HUMIRA) which was started about a year and a half ago for ankylosing spondylitis, denosumab (PROLIA) which started about a year ago for osteoporotic bones and Evrysdi: (Start: Dec 2020 Stop: Ongoing). This female consumer reported her son/patient received his first injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on 22Apr2021. The patient has been taking Evrysdi over the past year and experienced some gains in muscle function. After receiving the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine, the patient began experiencing a decline in muscle function described further as losing all the muscle function he had gained while taking Evrysdi. The reporter/mother said her son has been sick ever since receiving the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine and was experiencing flare-up and been prescribed prednisone as treatment. The reporter stated that since their son got the vaccine, he had gone downhill and clarified he had generalized aches and pains all over his body since the vaccine, mostly in the spinal and sacral area, but they were also in his arms, elbows, everything ached, he really did not feel well and could not do anything he used to do after the vaccine. He was starting to gain muscle mass and everything and since the vaccine all that was gone. The reporter stated they took him to both doctors, and they have been zooming with him and want him to get the second dose. He really thinks the biologics in the Humira he took and the biologics in the vaccine were counter acting each other and putting him into a major flare. The patient was treating symptoms with a dose pack of prednisone, getting a little better but did not have strength back at all. The reporter also stated that prior to this vaccine, the doctors were saying was an anomaly, the newer medication he was on was supposed to stop the progression of muscular dystrophy and he was doing so well on the medication until he got the vaccine. The patient was scared he was going to get worse; they were looking for information about getting the second dose, stated their doctors did not have a lot of information. The reporter asked could the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine reverse the progress our son made in his muscles while taking Evrysdi for spinal muscular atrophy and should her son get the second dose after what has happened after the first dose of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. Also asked how long you could wait to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine and was there an interaction with Humira. The reporter got response that spoke per FAQ and referred to HCP. Outcome of the event generalized aches and pains was not recovered and for all other events, it was unknown.  Additional information has been requested and will be provided as it becomes available.

My tongue felt strange my lips sweated.  The injection site hurt for 7 days and is still uncomfortable.  My lungs have been extra congested with mucus.  I missed 3 days of work due to the inability to use my left arm (sore) and general fatigue. Experienced strange twitching of the left arm muscle at injection site on the third day.

                                                I was giving my second dose of the Pfizer at the drug store, the shot was administered and a little dribbled out so the pharmacist gave me a double dose.  I don&#39;t believe this was necessary and could have been avoided if the pharmacist would have followed better protocol administering the due to the poor quality of the administration of the shot I missed three days of work. My arm was unusable for 3 days.. I had some mucus buildup in my lungs.. but luckily after 5 days of good rest I&#39;m okay.

For 2nd vaccine- after one week I experienced had excruciating headaches and shakiness that do not go away. I take Tylenol for pain and as a result have upset stomach.  I went to see my PCP who performed exams, lab work, x-rays, CT scan of the head, CT scan of the abdomen and my doctor does not find anything wrong for me. To this day I continue wit the headaches that do not go away. I do not feel well to do my daily living activities and I get anxiety.  I feel very tense and frustrated due to my symptoms.  I do not have the lot # for my vaccines to provide.

                                                myositis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 43-year-old male patient received  first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown) on an unspecified date in Dec2020 reported as around the end of December,  at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date after he received the vaccine he had right arm pain and swelling (states it was in his bicep brachial radialis in the muscle) which is the opposite arm of the injection site. He had an MRI done on an unknown date that showed myositis. He thinks could be due to the vaccine since it started two days after he received the vaccine. His pain peaked at about a week and a half and now the pain was improving and the swelling was down. He still had function in the right arm but when he strained it would hurt. His concern was that the reaction may be an autoimmune reaction and the first response was muted. He was worried the second dose may elicit a larger response. At the time of the reporting the patient was recovering from the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between the myositis and vaccination with BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. Additional information regarding onset latency, relevant medical history, concomitant medications and detailed clinical course around the event onset will aid in comprehensive assessment of the case. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The day after receiving the second vaccination, I began to have mild intermittent abdominal pain2-3/10.  The pain gradually increased, became more intense, and more constant.  Mild fever and chills started happening, and I took Ibuprofen.  By about 4 days after the vaccine, the abdominal pain was severe enough that I had some difficulty walking and I couldn?t sleep at night.  Pain was 6-8/10.  I went to the ER, and CT scan with IV contrast showed 18 mm appendicitis.  I underwent laparoscopic surgery and it was found to be perforated.  It was removed.  I am currently recovering in the hospital.  I received the vaccine as a health care provider at my hospital, specifically I am a practicing pediatrician physician for over 10 years.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

                                                numbness in right side of face and right arm; hard time swallowing; felt foggy; dizzy; disoriented; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 43-year-old male patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm left from 11Jan2021 to 11Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient states about 24 hours later he felt foggy, disoriented, and dizzy (all three occurred on 12Jan2021), states he then woke up at 3 am this morning and had a lot of numbness on right side of face and arm and had a hard time swallowing (both occurred on 13Jan2021), states a couple hours later he went to hospital, went to ER and had to do an MRI, states the MRI of brain and neck came back clear and checked out, states doctors concluded it was an adverse reaction to vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                I had some sort of reaction.  I was glad to get the shot and was not nervous about getting the shot. 5 minutes after the shot I felt something cold go down my left arm from my shoulder to my hand.  A minute or two after that both my hands went numb, then both my arms went numb.  I asked others around me if anyone felt anything and everyone else was fine.  A minute or two after that both my legs went numb. I started to black out but made it to a chair before this happened,  I drank some cold water and felt awake about 5 minutes later.  30 minutes after that i felt comfortable enough to walk.  For the rest of the day i felt like i was legally drunk and felt lots of pins and needles on the back of my hands and feet. I did not feel dizzy or nauseous at that time. i also felt a lot of pressure on the inside of my skin all over my body. I&#39;ve never felt anything like that and it was a bit uncomfortable.  The next day i was too dizzy to walk without becoming very nauseous.  I still had pins and needles on my feet. i had chills as well which i guess is a good sign.  my appetite was fine. i felt clear-headed as well.  Two days after the shot i felt slightly dizzy and by the third day i felt fine except for minor muscle cramps all over my body.  For the three days after the shot i also had some pretty strong forearm and calf muscle cramps and my arms (biceps and triceps) felt pumped up like i just had a great arm workout, but they weren&#39;t swollen at all.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

                                                Severe spinning, nausea, vomiting, occurred at 2:15 a.m. while on duty, was transported to ER and diagnosed with Peripheral Vertigo. Follow ups with ENT, Neuro and PCP have continued with Vestibular Rehabilitation. While in ER, the MRI, MRA, CT, CT with Contrast was done, showed no signs of anything that could have caused this. Ironically tracking back, I received my 2nd Dose of the Pfyzer Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. and this occurred on February 13th at 2:15 a.m. I have not had any other issues before this nor any signs of damage to the nerve or ear that regularly affects Vertigo Patients per my Neuro and ENT. The incident took place 4 weeks and 2 days after the 2nd vaccine. 2 days after the 2nd dose, I experienced Low grade fever, chills, and body aches that lasted only 12 hours, but nothing with the 1st vaccine nor anything after the 2nd dose issue until the Vertigo.  I am unable to drive, conduct my job, which requires me to go to emergency calls and carry a Taser (CEW). I have been off work since this occurred and still not eligible to go back to work.

Patient received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine around 17:30 today and states that he developed hives down his left arm and was having difficulty swallowing. He does have a known egg allergy and states that he has had prior anaphylaxis reactions to the flu vaccine. Patient was given PO Benadryl with complete relief of his symptoms. He has no complaints at this time and states that he feels &#34;perfectly fine&#34;. At bedside for initial evaluation. Discussed plan for continued Benadryl throughout tomorrow and follow-up with his PCP. Patient is agreeable. Plan for discharge. The patient is comfortable with further observation of his symptoms at home.  I discussed our workup, answered all questions and made sure there were no other concerns.  I provided counseling about standard home and self-care measures and advised on standard return precautions including new, persistent, or worsening / concerning symptoms.

                                                Rapid onset of blurred vision and partial blindness, confusion, inability to form complete or coherent thoughts or sentences.  Started with blurred vision around 5:45pm. I immediately sat down on the couch, and tried to explain to my wife what was going on. However, I was unable to complete the thoughts I was trying to form. Eventually I began confusing words (such as saying &#34;king&#34; when I wanted to say &#34;kind&#34; or &#34;kite&#34;) and was unable to produce more than one word every 1-2 seconds with great difficulty. Then a headache came that was both extremely painful and somehow &#34;painless,&#34; as if I was observing myself having the pain as a bystander. All of this happened within one minute of onset.  I laid down and after about 10 minutes from onset the difficulty speaking subsided and I could make complete sentences, although with some difficulty. After around 20 minutes from onset my vision had fully returned.   I called 911 out of concern for stroke-like symptoms. The dispatcher sent an ambulance, and I was taken to the Hospital Emergency Department for treatment.  Around three hours after the onset of the incident I was diagnosed with a complex migraine and discharged.

No chest pain, no fevers, chills, cough. He saw his PCP for these symptoms who ordered EKG and CXR 1 day PTA which per patient were normal--plan was for referral to cardiologist. However on the morning on presentation around 6:45 AM after taking an elevator for work he began feeling lightheaded and lost consciousness, awakening on the floor. He went home as he was not feeling well however proceeded to have another 2-3 episodes of loss of consciousness at home witnessed by his girlfriend--the later 2 occurred while lying down and were not clearly associated with any presyncopal symptoms.

                                                On March 24 I got the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and I experienced side effects almost immediately. By the time I got to the resting/observation area I felt that the site of the injection got really warm and I became dizzy/lightheaded and started to feel heavy on the chest and little problem in swallowing and breathing. I was taken to the paramedics on site, they checked my blood pressure (which a little high 150/90), oxygenation, pulse, and EKG (which were normal). It did not became too bad after and was allowed to come back home.  However, the heavy chest and swallowing problem lasted for three days. The heaviness in the chested turned into a sensation of feeling like my trachea or the anything under the sternum area was behind strangled. Although I felt like this my breathing and swallowing was almost normal. Every now and then when I swallowed I felt some pain but I could withstand it.

                                                At around 10 pm on the day of vaccination, I started to develop a sore throat, runny nose and minor headaches. The following day, April 8, I had more severe symptoms. I had a pounding headache, body aches, chills, fatigue, low grade fever, sore throat, and a runny nose. I spent the day in bed and could not go to work. Towards the end of the day, my low grade fever had subsided, and my sore throat as well. Now I had a slight cough but still had minor chills, fatigue, headache, and body aches. I was able to sleep mostly, and by the following morning, April 9, I was only suffering from body aches, a cough, and a runny nose. I was able to attend work remotely but found my desire to engage in almost any activity very minimal. By that night, most evertything was returning to normal, though a runny nose was still present.

Any movement of my left arm resulted in strong stabbing pain in my shoulder.  After three days it improved and after one week it was completely gone.  The AE reminded me of calcific tendonitis flare up which I have in both shoulders.  I went to urgent care as I could not sleep due to pain and they told me to wait a few days and take OTC pain meds.

                                                Patient while sitting in the post-vaccination area for 15 minutes, started experiencing lightheaded and faint when he got up. I instructed the patient to sit back down and he complied. I went to grab the patient water and calm him because he seemed a little anxious and then he started shaking, so we immediately called 911. I tapped him to see if he was okay, and he said yes was okay but really faint and the patient was sweating. I asked if he was having trouble breathing, but he denied. He drank the water and had chocolate and I kept conversing with him to assess for any physical/mental status changes, and during the conversation the patient said he usually feels faint and anxious when he gets blood drawn but did not mention it during the screening because he never has when receiving vaccinations. The patient was appearing to improve, less anxiousness, less sweating, and getting more color back to his face. When the EMS arrived within 5-10 mins, they assessed his vitals which were all normal and the patient requested not to be taken to the hospital. The EMT personnel felt the patient was doing okay and left. I had the patient stay for another 30 minutes to make sure he was remaining okay before he left.

Then, the next morning, and all day, I&#39;ve been clumsy and uncoordinated.

                                                Had minimum side effects during my first shot on 2/9/21 (lot # EL-9261).  About 3 hours after my second shot on 3/2/21, the room was spinning wildly to the point I could not look at the ceiling, I may have started to have &#34;brain fog&#34; that night as well.  3/3/21 I had chills, no fever.  3/4/21 while talking to a coworker I experienced a &#34;neurological event&#34;, I felt like I received a flash software upgrade to my brain, and things &#34;paused&#34; for a short amount of time.  Later on 3/4/21 brain fog was significantly impacting me and it was hard to complete sentences and communicate effectively.  From 3/2/21 to 3/ 3/7/21 I experienced brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, and chills (no fever).  I was fine on 3/8/21.  All 4 side effects came back on 3/24/21.  I was having chills, no fever, early in the day then led a meeting in the early afternoon and could barely finish my briefing.  I was having issues with fatigue, some dizziness, and brain fog.  From 3/24/21 to 4/19/21 the side effects that mainly bothered me was dizziness/vertigo and some brain fog.  Majority of time throughout this period the side effects were sporadic.  I was able to function at 100% then wham, I was out of commission for 2-3 hours, then back to normal again for a multi-hour window.   Hydrochlorothiazide worked well.  I also took Meclizine with limited impacts.  Also took a prednisone pack that took the edge off.

This was 28 min after initial shot (2nd dose).  Concerned that airway would be restricted.  In a panic went to ER at different hospital that I was near.  No signs of anaphylaxis.  Waited in hospital for ~3 hours.  Symptoms did not get worse and could breath through nose.  Decided no steroid shot (did not want to negate covid shot).  Went home without additional treatment.  Mouth was dry for 1 additional day, but not as extreme as initial dryness.

Dull kinda pain, soreness...not super sharp or anything. It was severe enough that I couldn&#39;t sleep at night.  I still kept my second vaccine appointment which was in a couple days and booked an appt. with my doctor. It was about a week until I could get in to the office. In that time I got a small herpetic rash about the size of two fifty cent pieces on my right side. I went to the office and the doctor identified it as Shingles...which is not something I&#39;ve had before. He put me on an oral steroid for 6 days, anti-viral medicine(Valacyclovir), and something for nerve pain (Gabapentin). All of which helped and I appear to have recovered so far.

A 43-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine, solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), 1ST DOSE SINGLE via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 27Mar2021 for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced chest pain made him go to the emergency room because it was too much, it was multiple throughout the day not just one time, has had a bad headache where it feels like he has vibrating inside of his head, in his chest and on 31Mar2021, when he falls asleep he wakes up in an hour 31Mar2021, getting shocked in the middle of the night when he is sleeping- in his chest and intestines on 31Mar2021, getting shocked in the middle of the night when he is sleeping- in his chest and intestines on 31Mar2021, limbs twitch on 31Mar2021, his penis sensations are a lot different. It was reported that 5 days after he got the first dose of the COVID vaccine he started getting pains and the major thing is at night. If he falls asleep, he wakes up in an hour and that has been every night for a month and a half. That is the main thing that is pissing him off. He confirms that he is having issues with his chest and his intestines like he mentioned previously and he has started keeping track and has kept a journal of the pains. This stuff is new. He has never experienced this before and it has been happening every day starting 5 days after when he got the COVID vaccine. He had the COVID vaccine on 27Mar2021 and on 31Mar2021 he got the first shock in his chest at 0120 in the morning when he was sleeping. Then that went on for a week, he had it on 31Mar2021, 01Apr2021, 02Apr2021, 03Apr2021 and 04Apr2021 where he was getting shocked in the middle of the night when he is sleeping. On 04Apr2021 he had to go to the emergency room and have them look at him. But since 31Mar2021 he has been getting up every hour after he falls asleep. This was all worse when it first started because he has never experienced anything like this. The first shock he had was a hard feeling in his chest and then he couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. It is so bad. After he went to the emergency room, that is when it started being not as much of a shock pain that woke him up but he was still waking up every hour. The pains are in his upper chest and in his intestines. Also his limbs twitch and he has had a bad headache where it feels like he has vibrating inside of his head, in his chest and in his abdomen. He confirmed that these also began on 31Mar2021 and have been happening whenever they want and he has never experienced all of that before. Never. Everything has all stayed the same. The sad part is that he just thinks that he is getting used to this &#34;new normal&#34; because he is now going on the second month of this and his body is adapting but this is not normal. Also, he guesses that he shouldn&#39;t be shy now but the last thing is that his penis sensations are a lot different and he didn&#39;t notice until the first time that he was having relations with his wife after the COVID vaccine and it is all different. He noticed and she did too as far as whenever they were trying to have relations. It has been more than once, it has been every time they have tried afterwards. He says his doctor is going to send him to a sleep lab but he wasn&#39;t expecting that. He thought that maybe he would need to go somewhere else. But there he will go to sleep and be hooked up and they will read his whole body and tell the reason why he is waking up every hour. The outcome of the event headache, sleep disorder, chest discomfort, muscle twitching was not recovered and penis order, headache was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 19May2021 visit with his primary care doctor diagnosed a 4th nerve palsy of my left eye. This was confirmed by a 19May2021 visit to an ophthalmologist. It is now 21May2021 and nothing has improved and an MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) was pending. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in Pharmacy or Drug Store. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was not recovered.

                                                With my 1st vaccine I just had soreness around the injection site. After the 2nd vaccine I woke up at 4am on 1/31/2021 with muffled hearing in my left ear and mild numbness in the entire left side of my body from top of my head to bottom of my feet. I experienced vomiting and diarrhea also. I had blood pressure of 150 /105 and pulse rate of 100. My doctor was afraid I had a stroke, so I went to the ER and had a CT scan in brain. I tried to go to work the next day but my head was foggy so I had to leave work. I had a test for carotid arteries and heart test that came back fine. I was sent to a neurologist. He suspected I had possible swelling in the spinal cord, but since I was feeling a little better he thought it was ok to wait to have a spinal tap. He described that the symptoms were MS dialed symptoms but did not feel I had MS. I&#39;ve gotten better but continue to have a neuropathy pain in my left foot, left hand, and left side of my face. It tends to get worse at night but in the morning it is ok. It continues through the day. None of these symptoms were there before the vaccine.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.

I went to home and had a slight fever with chills and could not sleep that night. I called off from work and stayed home. Over the weekend the pain in my neck. shoulder and arm continued.  I went to a chiropractor treatment that Tuesday 3/2/21. He made some adjustments and the shoulder / upper arm still did not feel better.  My right arm became more numb and weak on Thursday 3/4/2021 . My wife was sitting next me on our couch when I suddenly had a spasm in the upper arm.  The next morning I waking and had even more trouble lifting the arm or moving it. I attempted to suffer through it thinking it would get better.  Over that weekend conditions with the arm became even worse and was unable to lift it. I returned to chiropractor. He evaluated me and i described what had happened after the second covid shot.  He  recommend an MRI and I attempted to contact my PCP. With no answer from the PCP i went to the ED who said My PCP would need to order a MRI. I was then sent to physical  therapy and Orthopedics. They ordered an X ray and MRI. Both showed nothing.  Still seeing physical therapy with some improvement and movement. Have a EMG scheduled for April 22,2021

Through the weekend things were fairly normal till Sunday night. I had a hard time sleeping and a low grade temperature 99.4. Over night I hoped it would get better but in the morning it got a little worse 100.0. Didn&#39;t sleep till 2am. A little bit ago I took my temp again and it&#39;s 100.2. I don&#39;t have flu type symptoms, just tired and fever. I&#39;ve been taking Tylenol every 8 hrs or so. Drinking water and resting.

He requested water and as I was giving it to him he started to pass out.  He was conscious but slightly convulsing.  He appeared to have a minor seizure for approximately 5-10 seconds.  He was transferred to a wheelchair and sent into our recovery room.  As we were transporting him, he had two episodes of vomiting and continued to feel diaphoretic and weak.  He rested laying down but was not feeling better.  He could not tolerate any water or juice.

I began to feel a developing despair and decline to overall mental function.  As if a switch had been turned in my brain, and it became more difficult to focus.  Myself and others close to me started to notice that I would space out and kind of shut down at random moments without regard to what was currently going on around me. I must note that I did not have anxiety related to receiving the vaccine, even after becoming ill after the first dose.  I cannot get back to my baseline level of functioning (mentally), and I struggle every single day (some worse than others) to focus, be productive, stay connected to those around me, and sometimes just stay on track getting through the day.  I understand &#34;battle-fatigue&#34; and this long, on-going pandemic and it&#39;s toll of myself and others around me.  I am an infection preventionist, during the pandemic, in an acute care hospital, being only in my role for a year when it all hit.  Absolutely something occurred after  receiving the vaccine.  I have waited this long to help rule-out other potential causes, and to see if things would get better.  I feel broken, though things are not getting worse, I cannot get back to where I was.

May 2 09:00 woke up with severe muscle soreness, joint pain, mental fog, extreme fatigue and a slight temp. Took Advil and went back to sleep. Didn&#39;t get out of bed majority of the day due to continued fatigue and muscle soreness and joint pain.  May 3 went to work with continued mental fog, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness (still everywhere), and joint pain. Continued taking Advil to keep working. Condition did not get better at all throughout this day.  May 4 woke up with mental fog lifted, fatigue gone, however; the muscle soreness and joint pain continued... but ONLY from my lower back all the way down both legs. I have never felt anything quite like this before. Continued to take Advil to deal with the pain  May 5 aching and pain still present in lower back and both legs  May 6 aching and pain still present and annoying in lower back and both legs and is not getting better. At this point I&#39;m concerned as I was completely healthy before receiving the second dose of the vaccine with ZERO health problems and ZERO pain. Please tell me what is going on and if this will pass with time. I was healthy before and want to be healthy again. I&#39;m dealing with the pain and will not miss work if I can help it. My wife is a pharmacist and insisted I get the vaccine.

For the next week every morning, diarrhea and unsettled stomach, lack of energy, excessive sleep, no ability to exercise without severe fatigue or a return of digestive problems. This lasted a week. Sexual activity also impossible, erection quality greatly reduced. Many of these symptoms got better but have now returned with my second dose. Second dose has given me significant fatigue, digestive problems again, diarrhea, and reduced erection quality once more. I hope these problems resolve themselves. The vaccine has made going to work very difficult and I will seriously reconsider taking any vaccine in the future.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Mar2021 at around 13:00 or 13:30 (at the age of 44 years old) (Lot Number: EP7534, unknown expiration) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020; sneezing and runny nose both on 21Mar2021. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient reported that he received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 22Mar2021. He felt fine after receiving the vaccine, but there was little bit rash on arms just afterwards and felt maybe a little restless but felt fine and went for a walk on 22Mar2021. As the night went on, he really noticed how sore his arm was/pain in his arm and when he was sleeping, he had trouble sleeping/problems with sleep (Mar2021) and felt movements in his chest at times (Mar2021). It felt like he had COVID all over again and had chills, soreness, and his smell was kind of gone in Mar2021. He was previously feeling pretty good. He had COVID-19 in Nov2020, and his symptoms feel very similar including loss of sense of smell but no coughing. He had a fever but that has gone away in Mar2021 and he did not take aspirin or anything for it. He also had fatigue, some swollen in lymph nodes, and his heart rate accelerated in Mar2021.  He had sneezing and runny nose the day prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient would like to know if his symptoms are related to the vaccine or if he possibly has COVID-19 again.  His symptoms are the same as COVID as far as what he can see, and his symptoms are really high. He would like to know if he can still receive the second dose of the vaccine if he has a positive COVID test after the first dose of the vaccine. The patient mentioned that there was very pretty high percentage of people having the symptoms after having the vaccine, kind of virus &#34;causing&#34;.  The patient asked if he needs to be tested to see if he had the virus before he was vaccinated and to know if these are one of the side effects or one of the symptoms of the virus, and to make sure that these are not actually corona virus. The patient recovered from fever in Mar2021, while unknown outcome for the remaining events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Symptoms of the spike included wild mood swings, VERY strong emotional reactions to otherwise manageable situations, and very erratic, even reckless, behavior.   I can&#39;t remember ever having symptoms this severe before. No other source for the symptoms could be identified.

It varies in intensity, it is generally the worst in the morning and evening or at least I block it out enough to do my job. Pain is in the back of my head/upper neck, in front of my ears on the sides of my head, sometimes I also get it on the crown of  my head. I have also been nauseous pretty much every day since then. I have vomited once. Nausea is worst in the mornings. Occasionally I feel like I have a concussion, hard to describe that feeling.

I lost my sense of smell 10 years ago due to sinusitis. I experienced lethargy about 5 days after the shot up to 4 weeks after. I had some tightness in my chest, my albuterol inhaler helped with that. The  tingling in my hand and feet happened on a few occasions. I had numbness that lasted about an hour. I had frequent night sweats that woke me. I had muscle tightness in my leg and abdomen. I also had soreness in my arm, which made it hard to grasp a pen. I did test my reflexes which were normal.

I feel the mental effects could put patients in danger if healthcare practitioners are not aware of the possibility of this and receive the vaccine while on duty.  I did not experience this with the first dose.

                                                Starting from the first night after the vaccination and each and every night after that to date of this form completion, I have had extremely interrupted sleep.  I have woken up several times in the middle of the night (i.e., 2 am, 4 am, etc..). Each time I have woken up and felt wide awake and difficulty going back to sleep.  As a consequence each of the following days after this poor sleep I have been in extreme fatigue and not able to function properly.  I do not have any other notable side effects.  No fever or major headaches.  This disturbed sleep which coincidentally started right after the vaccination is highly concerning for me, especially since it has happened on 4 consecutive nights.  This has not happened to me before.  In the past even if I woke up in the middle of the night, I would fall back asleep relatively quickly.  Furthermore, it has not been the case of this type of lack of sleep for this many consecutive nights. Another observation is that my feeling of hunger seems to have increased for some reason.  Even in the middle of the night when I wake up I have felt great hunger and then starting in the morning that hunger continues.  This is more hunger than normal for me.  My diet and eating patterns have not changed compared to what it was before getting the first dose of the vaccination. Given that today is Martin Luther King Day and a Holiday my PCP is closed, so could not make an appointment or report this to her.  I will call my PCP again tomorrow, 01/19/21. If this disturbed sleep continues, then I am sure how I can properly function during a normal work day on the job. Given all the above I am also concerned about the second dose of the vaccination and what side effects that may result in.

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I felt like my heart rate raised a couple of times a day. The spikes in my blood pressure and heart rate lasted about four days. It felt a little like an anxiety attack. I was prescribed a Diuretic which  I took for a week. When you got the second dose I did not have any of the same symptoms.

However, the atypical AEs included daily and persistent dizziness, &#34;brain fog&#34;, fatigue, difficulty going up the stairs without getting winded (difficulty with physical exertion).  These symptoms are still present on March 31st (11 days post injection).  GI / diarrhea symptoms are also present.  Of note, I did have COVID in the past (January 2021) - and had similar symptoms that had resolved at the time of the vaccine.  These symptoms are severe enough that it may prevent the second shot (due to concerns of worsening AEs or prolonged events).  Of note, the fatigue was worse with the actual disease vs. the vaccine.

Symptoms prompted me to take the day easy (took off work and stayed in bed). Symptoms completely resolved by the next morning. I did not take any medication.

                                                Within 60 seconds of receiving the injection, I experienced moderate breathing difficulty.   After 10-20 minutes, I noticed that my throat felt slightly swollen (slight difficulty swallowing).  Due to a hyperallergic event that occurred about 12 years ago, I occasionally run into something that triggers the respiratory effect  - although usually the reaction is milder than that caused by the vaccine.  However, the throat swelling is new.  I took a single puff of an Albuterol inhaler around 5 minutes after the injection,  but it had no effect (usually the case for me when the cause is allergic in nature).  About 37 minutes after the injection, medical staff advised me to take an antihistamine.  I took approximately 6 mg of doxylamine succinate (orally).  However, by this point, the breathing had already started to ease slightly.  Approximately 30 minutes later, my breathing was back to normal and the throat inflamation was gone.  It&#39;s uncertain how much of that would have occurred through time alone and how much of it was the antihistamine starting to take effect.  My BP was very high when measured during treatment.  Partially explained by the albuterol inhaler combined with pseudoephedrine taken earlier in the day, along with anxiety and exertion from the event itself.

However, family member insisted he had an allergic reaction to the vaccine and he mentioned he started to feel lightheaded and nervous afterwards. His BP was 107/81 mmHg and pulse 100 bpm and he mentioned he wanted to take something for allergies, so patient was given 50 mg Benadryl after confirming his weight (80 kg). After 15 minutes waiting, patient mentioned he was feeling fine, and he wanted to leave. BP was taken again and it was 125/76 mmHg and pulse was 89 bpm.

Took recommended dose of Tylenol.  4 hours after that (8 hours after vaccination) he was still experiencing extreme headache and also vomiting and took another dose of Tylenol.  Was still feeling poor at 1am but coherent and talking, not thinking  that it was serious enough to warrant going to hospital, as he believed it was just a bad headache and the vomiting was from the headache.  At 6am, he was found blue/dead in his bed.

Responding staff observed Subject had vomited on himself in the car. Subject reports he felt very euphoric, leaned his head back and was floating.  Thinks he may have passed out (does not know how long) and woke up with vomit all over him.  Thinks he may have had a seizure as his neck was stiff and had bite marks on his tongue.  As of 4/23/2021 Subject reports full recovery.  Has passed out before after having blood drawn x 2 in the past, but not shots.

I left work and went home to sleep.  I was unable to sleep due to the headache. I took my temperature with a digital thermometer around 4PM.  I was running a 102 fever.  I took three 200 mg Advil around 6pm.  My headache got better over the next hour.  My fever broke around 9pm that night.  I soaked through a shirt.  That afternoon and evening I experience joint pain.  It felt like needles being jabbed into my joints.  Or like lightening strikes in my joints.  I got a full nights sleep and the next day I felt 95% better.  This was my second shot.  I got it at the pharmacy.

He and his wife were having a conversation. According to his wife, he seemed to become dazed. Their conversation just stopped. The car started to veer off the road and they were onto the rumble strips. He wasn&#39;t making a correction, so his wife had to tell him to drive back into their lane, but he overcorrected and ended up into the lane of oncoming traffic. He was able to correct that and pull the car off of the road. He and his wife switched so that she was driving. He seemed to have a glazed look on his face, but he didn&#39;t have any difficulty walking or getting in/out of the vehicle. He does not remember the incident of the car veering and overcorrecting. When they got to the track meet he felt tired and just laid down for 10-15 minutes. Afterwards, he felt like he was fine. They entire incident lasted about 30 minutes. He has been fine since.

                                                When I woke up the day after (Day #2) being given the vaccine I was extremely tired exhausted, I had intense chills and hot flashes. Never a fever. I felt nauseated. Completely lethargic. Muscle aches all over my body, was hard to move. I couldn&#39;t stay awake. My eyes hurt. I had intense migraines.  And no appetite. My right arm hurt, but not as bad as many others&#39; reported.  I took ibuprofen to help, it didn&#39;t. I drank lots of water and gatorade zero for the electrolytes. It didn&#39;t help either.  On day #3, this was when it got scary. The previous  symptoms carried over, minus the nausea and I was able to be mobile (less lethargic).  But something new started to happen. I took my dog out for a short walk, a slow pace, I am very athletic, and I had shortness of breath. I was winded from just walking slowly. Then the brain fog started to set in. This I hated the most. I wasn&#39;t able to comprehend things. I tried to assemble an item I bought from Amazon and it was extremely hard to follow simple instructions. I wasn&#39;t able to see clearly for some reason. And even comprehending emails that I was receiving was troublesome. I kept drinking water, and was able to eat a little. Had two more bottles of Gatorade Zero.  On day 3, most of all the symptoms subsided except that I still got winded from movement.  On day 4, I was fine.

Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

No arm pain -- but nine days of brain pain, waking up feeling like my head was split, at least five days of altered vision, and most disturbed were my breathing and my heart. I felt for many days like I had a Brillo Pad in my lungs and heart, as well as lots of pressure in the chest and shortness of breath/labored breathing. Two days ago I thought I might be having a heart attack. The symptoms lightened yesterday morning (day nine) though I still have strange sensations in the head and taking a full, deep breath is not totally easy yet. .

States he told the emergency room about the bites and bumps and that he had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and they gave him the Ibuprofen and sent him home. The patient stated that this was a real concern for him due to the blood clots stuff coming out about how people have different reactions after a vaccine. States he felt like the hospital did not even do anything; he could have hit his head a couple of times on a chandelier; states the emergency took an image of his head and they did not address the bumps or anything else and said his head was not bleeding and gave him Ibuprofen and he did not think you should take Ibuprofen like when you have COVID and they sent him home and nothing was done.

He ate a burger and had extreme cramps and diarrhea for days and this was after his Pfizer COVID vaccine and he is doing this again with stomach cramps and diarrhea; he can&#39;t distinguish what the cramps and diarrhea were from and maybe he ate something bad and is confused about his body; states the cramps are way worse and the diarrhea began after the burger. States the diarrhea is a lot and this time is less diarrhea but more abdominal cramps and he threw up several times last night and did not throw up a lot but was so nauseous and threw up twice a little bit. Patient stated that the reported events were just like when he had covid and after waking up at 12:00 he had body pains and was not able to go back to sleep until 4:00; states he had pretty bad headaches which are ongoing and had had headaches ever since he was diagnosed with COVID, stated it is the same thing also as when he had covid; states with covid he got sick and was up from 12:00 4:00 and had fatigue, had body pain, had headaches and nausea and then it got better and he started sleeping through the night. States the Pfizer COVID shot and it was like the same all over again where he was up from 12:00 4:00, had pain and was disorientated, just not feeling good at all which has gone on since the shot; states there were two nights where he slept through the night and was up in a cold sweat which wakes him up and drenches him head to toe and he has to get out of bed to change clothes and sit there til he is tired again and sometimes goes to sleep in the chair and then sleeps ok. Patient stated he took Benadryl just to sleep through the night and did not and got up once and then went back to sleep. He stated on the left side where the headaches were and he had neck pain and it was kind of the left side and felt weird. The patient stated also that in the emergency room he was given Valium in his arm and also has a knot on the back of his neck and tried to address it with the emergency room and they said it was a spasm and did not seem concerned and it felt hard and not a bump under his skin in his neck and it just felt like maybe a pea sized hard knot and noticed this after his Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Caller stated he actually felt pretty good and was sleeping through the night after he had COVID and felt back to normal and then after his Pfizer COVID vaccine everything went downhill. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Tinnitus got worse. I had very low level tinnitus before. The second night after the vaccine the tinnitus was quite bad, then the next day it settled down to be two or three times as noticeable as my baseline tinnitus was prior to the vaccine, at least. At this point, normally don&#39;t hear it, but when I&#39;m going to sleep it&#39;s very noticeable. Ten weeks later, it&#39;s steady and hasn&#39;t gotten worse or better since  it steadied out on the third day.

He was very pale, clammy, hot and somewhat disoriented from the reaction. After some water, food, and sitting patient recovered almost fully.  He does report having similar reactions to other vaccines/blood draws. He was checked on by phone that same night and about 36 hours later and overall was doing ok.

                                                Upon injection, felt immediate soreness at injection site (left arm, near shoulder). Had also felt soreness after first shot in series, which went away. Ten weeks after the second shot, I still feel considerable soreness at the injection site, which sometimes increases from general soreness to mild pain. A specific example is a general difficulty sleeping on my left side, which will wake me with pain and often cause mild pain for the remainder of the day.

                                                From hospital discharge summary:  &#34;45 y.o. right-hand-dominant male who presents with few hours of improving left arm heaviness/left hand cramping in the setting of getting his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in his right arm 3 days ago and 3 weeks of mildly increased exercise/intermittent fasting. The patient reports getting his first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on April 7, 2021. Reports some mild symptoms afterwards. Around that same time, the patient reports having a checkup with his primary care doctor that was notable for a cholesterol elevation to 200. This prompted him to try and lose weight including intermittent fasting and increase in exercise, especially for exercises and cardio.  The patient reports approximately 20 pound weight loss over the past 3 weeks. 3 days ago, the patient reports getting his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in his right arm.  Reports fever (maximum 103 Fahrenheit) and mild headache the subsequent 2 days after the vaccine.  Last night, the patient went to sleep on his left side at around 8 PM.  He woke up at 4 AM with significant left arm heaviness and left hand cramping.  He tried to massage his hand with some slight improvement of the symptoms but otherwise the symptoms persisted.  Hence, this morning, he called his PCP, who told him to come into the ER for further evaluation. Here, the patient reports improving left arm heaviness/left hand cramping.  He also does report family history of heart attack and an uncle at a similar age and massive heart attack of his grandfather in their 60s. He denies fever, anorexia, unexpected weight change, headache, blurry vision, sinus pressure, cough, hemoptysis, orthopnea, PND, SOB, DOE, chest pain, pleurisy, changes in taste/smell, N/V/D, abdominal pain, flank pain, urinary sxs, genital sxs, black stools, incontinence, absence of flatus, calf pain, leg swelling, numbness/tingling, streaking redness/rash/skin changes, easy bruising. Also, deny history of HTN, DM, smoking, prior MI, prior PCI, prior CABG, prior TIA/CVA, or history of PAD. Further, denies recent trauma/fall, history of cancer, blood thinner use, recent drug use, recent travel, sick contacts, family history of connective tissue disease/congenital aortic anomaly, or family history of similar sxs. --- Hospital Course by Problem  # Troponinemia (Likely myopericarditis)  The patient has a family history notable for MI and CABG in relatives aged 50-70 on his mother&#39;s side. The patient notes that most of these family members were heavy smokers and drinkers, which he is not (never-smoker, rare EtOH, never illicit drugs). His symptoms are notable for L arm heaviness/cramping that began around 8pm on 4/30/21 at 9/10 severity and subsequently was 3-4/10 severity on presentation to ED and is 0-1/10 severity at time of admission to the floor; he has no associated numbness, weakness, coolness, or pallor. His symptoms are non-exertional. He denies CP, SOB, lightheadedness, nausea, jaw pain, abdominal pain, fatigue. He noes that he recently got the second COVID shot in the R arm, and had a post-vaccine course notable for Tmax 103 ~3d ago and 101 as recently as yesterday. His EKG was notable for ST-elevation in II/III/aVF and his troponins were elevated 305 -- &gt; 298 -- &gt; 328. Of note, his CRP was elevated at 69. The patients symptoms and findings could certainly be compatible with atypical ACS and, given the low risk of bleeding associated with heparin, he was treated conservatively upon admission with heparin infusion, metoprolol tartrate 6.25mg q6h, atorvastatin 80mg (he received ASA 325mg in the ED). However, given his recent covid vaccination and elevated CRP and reported fevers, this could also be compatible with myocarditis or other inflammatory etiology.  TTE on 5/3 demonstrated preserved EF 55% with no WMA. Given reassuring TTE, a cMRI was ordered to assess for myocarditis vs scar tissue from recent ischemic event. Cardiac MRI on 5/5 was notable for finding consistent with myopericarditis (see below). Aspirin and atorvastatin was stopped on discharge. Patient was discharged with metoprolol 25 mg daily.&#34;

Approximately 10 days afterwards (around 2/25), I experienced symptoms of a minor stroke - I experienced lack of coordination in typing and later that evening experienced difficulty with speaking and comprehension, but only for a few minutes. A few days later, that weekend, I had some issues playing songs on the piano I had played before, making a lot of mistakes.  About another 2 weeks afterwards, on 3/9/2021, I experienced more symptoms of stroke. For most of the day I had issues with typing, and later that evening I had some coordination issues with closing a soda bottle. On the morning of 3/10/2021, I continued to experience issues with typing and also had difficulty speaking and understanding my wife. At this point I went to the emergency room and was found/diagnosed to have experienced multiple TIA strokes.

                                                After the 1st dose (3/29/2021), neck inflammation started on the right-side of the neck. The neck inflammation got worse after the 2nd dose (4/19/2021). The neck inflammation is still present.    Starting 5/11/2021: Intense adrenaline surges started happening every night between 3 am-7 am. My heart feels like it is beating extremely hard. I have checked my pulse and it is normal during the events (ranges from 65-90 bpm). I have checked blood pressure and it is usually in the 120/80 range (normal for me). However, there have been occasions where blood pressure drops to 100/70. These adrenaline surges and hard heart beats tend to get better if I stand up and move around. It will get worse again if I lay down. I have these on occasion during the day, but I am usually able to calm myself down. I have had scenarios where I feel fine during the day, but will lay down. The hard heart beats start almost immediately. I&#39;m also exercise intolerant now. If I do anything more than a brisk walk, I feel very terrible and faint with a hard heart beat. One interesting data point, my father has the same symptoms and his started about the same general timeframe after his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

I also became very tired even though I was well rested.  The nausea and dizziness lasted approx 2-3 hours.  At that time I developed moderate injection site pain.  I was very fatigued for the remainder of the night and through the next day (6 Jan).  I was no longer fatigued as of 7 Jan but starting that morning I had a very difficult time focusing mentally.  That condition lasted until late on the evening of 7 Jan.  As of 8 Jan, all symptoms have resolved and I feel fine.

                                                Approx 8 hours after injection I suddenly became slightly dizzy and had moderate nausea.  I also became very tired and fell asleep for about 1.5 hrs even though I was well rested.  For the remainder of the night of 5 Jan and all day on 6 Jan I was fatigued and had moderate injection site pain.  On  7 Jan, I felt much better (no fatigue or injection site pain) but had a very hard time mentally focusing.  All symptoms resolved by the night of 7 Jan and as of 8 Jan feel normal.

While eating I become nauseous. I stopped eating but still vomited (only once). At this time I started having shoulder pains and headache was worsting so I left work. About 2/3 hours after taking vaccine my entire upper body(shoulders up) was stiff! I took muscle relaxers and rested remainder of day. About 10/12 hrs after vaccine my headache was gone but still had moderate muscle pains.  Upon waking up up my body aches were only moderate so I went to work. 26 hrs after vaccine, I&#39;m still having mild/moderate body aches.

                                                Got First Pfizer Covid vaccine on 06JAN2021. About 4 days after that I started noticing allergy symptoms and mild intermittent wheezing. Then on about the 5th day after, my lower back pain increased, causing significant sciatic pain worse than ever before. On 22JAN21 I ended up going to urgent care for increased breathing problems, and also had to have pain management appointment within days as sciatic pain was debilitating and also significantly interfered with my sleep.  After steroid injection (In spine)on FEB 3rd for sciatica/back pain, and steroids/inhaler treatment for the breathing stuff, I would say I was pretty good to go . I didn&#39;t think too much of these unusual events for me both in timing and severity. On 12FEB2021, I got my second pfizer covid dose. I 14FEB I started noticing allergy symptoms again, and slight shortness of breath, used inhaler I had from before to help as breathing in seemed to not give me full breaths. Then, on 15FEB2021, in the evening out of nowhere while walking, my lower back/sciatica pain came back in full force, as if my leg were a lighting rod like before. So it almost seems as if the covid vaccine triggered an inflammatory reaction in my body. I am not certain, but because the series of events seem the same and in timing after my first covid vaccine, I figured I would at least report it.

A 46-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown; Expiration Date: unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 15:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included learning disability (found out last March he has a genetic disability, MECP2, which is a gene that carries Rhett&#39;s, autism, and Asperger&#39;s), rectal hemorrhage, fecaloma. The patient previously took Lipitor and experienced blood creatine phosphokinase increased, Aricept (2 doses, 1 in am and 1 in pm) and experienced gait inability and rhabdomyolysis, simvastatin (20mg for years and that was discontinued back in Jan or Feb of 2020), atorvastatin and experienced rhabdomyolysis and coumadin and experienced atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medications was not reported. Around Apr or Mar of 2020, the patient was hospitalized, and his creatinine kinase level was about 6000 and got better and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. The creatinine kinase level on 16Jun2020 was 131 and on 17Dec2020 his creatinine kinase total level was 56 and that the range is 44-196. After receiving the first dose of vaccine, the patient wasn&#39;t feeling well, he reportedly has at baseline of being unable to articulate how he feels due to depressed ability to speak, but &#34;he began talking to himself, had nausea and wasn&#39;t feeling well&#34;. So they took him to the doctor and had labs drawn on 12Feb2021 which showed elevated creatinine kinase levels measuring 1,019. They were instructed to speak to a rheumatologist and got another level on 22Feb which came back as 66. The pharmacist reported that back in Dec2020, the patient&#39;s kinase level was 55.  Kinase was 1015 (blood creatine phosphokinase increased) on 12Feb2021, feeling unwell, nausea, unable to articulate how he feels due to depressed ability to speak, panic, anxiety in 2021. The pharmacist reported that he was told by the physician that it is possible the COVID vaccine is not safe. They were instructed to speak to a Rheumatologist and got another level on 22Feb which came back as 66. The patient&#39;s appointment is the same day as COVID vaccine, 28Feb2021. The patient is scheduled to receive his second dose of the vaccine this Thursday and he asked if it is safe to receive the second dose of the vaccine after reacting to the first. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatine phosphokinase: 6000 on 2020, 131 on 16Jun2020, 55 on Dec2020, 56 on 17Dec2020, 1015 on 12Feb2021, 1019 on 13Feb2021, 66 on 22Feb2021, magnetic resonance imaging: diagnosed with MECP2 on 12Feb2021, weight: 180-190 lbs, weight: 141-142 lbs, weight: 140.2 or 140.8 lbs on 12Feb2021. The reporter assessed the events to be non-serious. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/Batch requested.

I was perfectly healthy before the shot.. then several days after developed an ache in my right abdomen, fatigue and constant ringing in ears that will not go away.  I&#39;m also having a very hard time sleeping.. sometimes only being able to get 2 or 3 hours a night regardless of how tired I am.  I&#39;m very disappointed and not sure if I should get the second shot or not given how I&#39;m feeling now.  Before the shot I was perfectly healthy.  I eat well, exercise and have never in my life experienced tinnitus or any type of hearing problem.  This shot was the ONLY thing that could have caused this.  I&#39;m not sure what to do next or if I should get the second shot which could make it worse.  I&#39;m very worried because the ringing and aches have been constant for 10 days..  some days worse than others.

Reports that his cough and shortness of breath now seems to be improving.  Continues to have some mild chest tightness, intermittent cough.  Robitussin significantly helped.  Extensive workup including CT angiogram of the thorax reveals no evidence for pulmonary embolism or infiltrate.  COVID-19 PCR testing is negative x2, severe respiratory isolation has been discontinued.  Patient has a negative D-dimer, LDH, ferritin, CRP.   Cardiac troponin has been negative x2.  Patient does have some wheeze, after cough, suggesting some bronchospasm.  Will trial albuterol inhaler q.i.d..

                                                Following the first shot I have developed what appears to be tennis elbow in my left arm.  Not sure if it is related or not.  Symptoms did not begin until after I received the shot.  Also, I have not been sleeping as well.  I have never had a sleeping issue but now find myself waking up around 4-5AM whereas this never occurred before.  These are not terrible side effects but just wanted to report them to see if anyone else is experiencing anything similar.

                                                On March 25, 8 days after the vaccine shot in my left arm, I began experiencing intense pain on the left side of my neck and head. By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

                                                Within seconds of my first vaccine I had a massive headache. 20 mins later I had brain fog. An hour later I had exhaustion and then injection site arm began hurting. This lasted for 48 hours and then I was fine. It came on fast and stayed. I had difficult time thinking or retaining a memory. Second shot had no instant reaction, injection site just slowly began hurting. An hour later, and very suddenly, brain fog hit me and i lost all short term memory, mid sentence. Similar to what I would consider a form of Alzheimer?s. At the same time I developed a headache, not as severe as the first shot, but I was more exhausted than the first shot. Forming sentences, being able to think was very difficult for 72 hours. I was exhausted, arm hurt. After the 72 hours, I lost my sense to smell. I am in my 96 hour since my second injection and still have no sense of smell. I can taste. Never had a fever but for both shots it felt like it was absorbed by my muscles and was then converted to something else which was then released back into my system. It was like I had sore muscles it was like my muscles became the poison. This effect was grossly more profound  after the second vaccine.  The ability to think was the scariest side effect.

                                                On 4/14, had a series of rashes on left side of face - eye lid, eye brow, forehead and well into the scalp.   Following a visit to Dr,  He confirmed this to be Shingles and referred me to the Ophthalmologist as the Shingles had affected eye surroundings. I have been prescribed and taking Valacyclovir, Gabapentin, and Prednisolone eye drops to treat the Shingles.   Into week 3, Shingles rashes have all healed, blisters have all crusted out and cleared, however nerve pain continues in the head and around the eyes. The ophthalmologist suspects this to be post-Shingles effect, i.e., Postherpetic Neuralgia. My current condition results in Insomnia during various nights, and itchiness/tingling sensations, for which I have to apply cold/wet compress and Calamine Lotion to provide temporary relief.  As a result of above following the 1st COVID vaccine, I have postponed my 2nd COVID-19 (Pfizer) vaccine to 5/22. However, my confidence level to proceed and get this 2nd vaccine on 5/22 is low at this time, until CDC is able to let me know whether there is a link between the COVID-19 vaccine and this causing Shingles in rare cases, to help me avoid a repeat of the stressful experience after the 1st COVID-19 shot.  I would greatly appreciate a callback or an email.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (father) or other non health care professional.   A 46-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left on 24Mar2021 as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Parkinsons diagnosed 12 years ago and dystonia diagnosed 8 years ago from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing states the patient has had four deep brain stimulations and was in neurological care and takes a lot of medications. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to receiving Covid 19 vaccine. On 24Mar2021, the patient had the Pfizer Vaccine and a day and a half later could not feel his legs and has not been able to walk since; states the vaccine was the only different thing he had and everything else was routine and going on for years and his dystonia did not just jump and he can&#39;t say the reason this happened but it should be looked at. He can&#39;t say the Pfizer Vaccine was the reason for the reported events and he can&#39;t say it isn&#39;t the reason. On 26Mar2021, the caller stated that in the morning but could have been the night before as the patient was in bed and said he could not feel his legs and couldn&#39;t walk; states he could not stand up to this day on an unknown date and was in a wheelchair and everything was done in a wheelchair. Caller stated the patient had nothing new and no kinds of other medication or vaccines done other than what was prescribed by his doctor. Stated he was healthy other than what the disease has done to him. Stated for treatment everything was exactly the way it has always been and they adjust his deep brain stimulations once in a while and basically try to help out the dystonia and the Parkinsons seems to be taken care of but the dystonia was really the culprit. Stated that the patient had the Pfizer Vaccine and a day and a half later could not feel his legs and had not been able to walk since, the patient went to the health care professional and was going back again next week and the health care professional tried to adjust the batteries and increased his medication to see if that would help and the increased medication did nothing and nothing changed. The medication that did nothing was Carvidopa or Levodopa or whatever it was called and he went from taking 2 pills twice per day to taking three pills twice per day after the incident with the Pfizer Vaccine trying to help out and nothing changed. Caller states for some reason the Pfizer Vaccine just went in and did something to some part of his brain and must have gone after the weakest point and he was only guessing this as no doctor has answers and they don&#39;t know. The patient had been Carvidopa Levodopa for 12 years. Patient was afraid to take 2nd dose which was scheduled on 14Apr2021, and the patient did not take that. The event he could not stand up to this day and was in a wheelchair and everything was done in a wheelchair was assessed as serious (disability).The adverse events resulted in physician office visit. The vaccination facility type was reported as hospital. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

He lay down on the floor, and our technician asked him if he was OK.  I immediately went out to him, and he told me he was already feeling better.  I had him put his feet up on the chair, and he told me that he thought this reaction was due to anxiety.  He was talking and breathing  normally.  I offered to check his blood pressure and get him some water, but he declined.  He rested on the floor for approximately 5 minutes and then said he was feeling well enough to go.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

Within two hours, I had a bad headache. I became slightly agitated that day. The headache lasted throughout the day - I took Ibuprofen but that didn&#39;t help much. Sunday, the headache was still there. It wasn&#39;t a migraine; but intense. I was agitated.  My agitation level grew and my irritability grew and the headache I had the whole day. Sunday evening about 7 pm the agitation and irritability got very intense - I was having impulse control issues with it. I don&#39;t have anger issues but I wanted to yell at TV or throw my phone. From 8- midnight, I was lethargic and fatigued - I didn&#39;t have the energy to roll over;: had extreme anxiety I was sweating and having weird thoughts like harming my animals and harming myself; my  mind was racing and then I would get really depressed. Until about midnight, I have had past struggles with anxiety and depression - there had been a past feeling like this - but it was really extreme - it was worse night of my life. Lasted four hours, and finally I slept for about one hour. I remember thinking, I finally can take a breath. My racing thoughts were gone and sweating was gone. The irritability had subsided enough that I could try to gain control of my thoughts again. I had really bad nightmares the rest of that night; I was confused _ I didn&#39;t know where I was - confused about that - occurred about three different times until I got up at 5:30 am for work. To summarize, for the next week, I had moments of anxiety and depression. I had mental fog. I played pro football - and I had post concussion syndrome. It was very identifiable to what I had had. So this was occurring in moments - forgetful; depressed; and random moments of anxiety - like I was going to go play football again. 7-10 days - it got a little better each day. Ten days it took to subside. I still exercised and taking extra fluids to get back to my normal.  Exercised help. No fever occurred. With COVID - I had had a sense of anxiety and depression and some mental fog when I had COVID I didn&#39;t have it to this extreme.  Did not get the second dose.

I was tired the next morning the 23rd of March, but by the afternoon I felt normal again. My left shoulder where I got the shot had a little muscle soreness for about a day.

ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.  Completed 5 day course of high dose steroids, 6 days of IVIG and on ongoing PLEX. Neurological improvement noted 3/25

                                                Got my first Pfizer shot on March 24 at 2 pm. The first day I felt way off like I was drunk or on some kind of drug that gets you high with bouts of dizziness and some major hypertension. My back and chest were very tight the whole time. The tension finally subsided around 11 pm that night but I was still uneasy. The 2nd day I felt ok in the morning and throughout the day until about 3 or 4 pm I started getting really nauseated and tired. I went to lay down to sleep and felt a little better when I woke an hour later. Day 3 I started feeling extremely tired and fatigued with some major chills. Basically slept most of that evening and throughout the night. Woke that next day and couldn&#39;t get that dizzy foggy feeling out of my head the whole day. Day 4-5 still bouts of dizziness, chills and fatigue with some nausea also I noticed I developed a wheezing dry cough which points towards respiratory distress. Day 6 still feeling yucky, tired, fatigued, some nausea and that dam cough. Today  03-31-21, still feeling weak and tired with some episodes of dizzy spells, nausea and respiratory distress cough.   Also forgot to mention on day 2 and 3 I had some major tingling on the right side of my head for most of the day. Felt like spiders crawling on my head and face. The last time I felt tingling like that I got shingles which also got me very sick and put me in the ER and ICU years ago. So there is also some post traumatic stress from that as well.  Made an appointment to see a Doctor on 03-30-21 to have my blood pressure checked and get an overall check up.  My blood pressure is elevated and stress levels are high with anxiety.  Dr prescribed me some anxiety medication. No other recommendations from the Doctor.

He presented to the emergency room with the a several day history of fluctuating blood pressure and nausea/vomiting and generally feeling very poorly.  He has been having a lot of new onset health issues lately and so his wife and family were concerned.  He was brought into the emergency room.  He denies any severe abdominal pain.  However, he states he has been feeling extremely nauseous.  He is vomited at least once a day for the last 5 days.  He does admit that he is under an extraordinary amount of stress between his new onset Parkinson&#39;s, his insurance business, and his full-time job as a pastor.  The patient also does have a history of alpha-gal allergy.  He states it is possible he ate some cross contaminated meat, but states that this nausea and vomiting does not act like his typical response to eating something that he is allergic to.   The patient states that about a month and a half his neurologist did increase his Requip up from 0.5 mg 3 times a day to 1.5 mg 3 times per day.  However, it has never made him nauseous before.  He denies any definite chest pain.  He denies any exertional dyspnea.  He does admit that his blood pressure has been fluctuating for quite some time.  He states he was having a skin biopsy done last week and they almost abandon the procedure because his blood pressure was so high.  He currently takes a combination of Benicar and hydrochlorothiazide.   In the emergency room his lipase was found to be a little bit elevated.  Creatinine was found to be a little bit elevated.  His blood pressure was very elevated in the systolic 170 range and he did require some IV labetalol.  The patient states he really has not missed any doses of his medications.

                                                feeling of swelling in tongue and lower lip. Scratchy feeling also in same areas. Started about 25 minutes after shot on drive home. Took allegra and it went away in 30-60 minutes. Tongue was sore the next day.  I also suffered a mild anxiety attack at the same time. Treatment for that was meditation and cessation of throat swelling symptoms.  Lastly, I also had a severe flare up of my fibromyalgia symptoms in my forearms starting 3 days after the injection. I don&#39;t know if this was a primary effect from the vaccine, or secondary from the additional nociceptive input from the joint and muscle pain I was experiencing in my forearms. I increased my lyrica to compensate. Two weeks out from the shot I&#39;m almost back to baseline.

                                                First day after the COVID 19 second shot was good. Felt tired in the afternoon and slept early at 9 PM. Woke up at 1 AM and since then couldnt sleep. Later in the night got a sinking feeling like when you are coming down on an elevator at high speed. In the morning when I tried to get out of the bed I couldnt sit as I had sever Vertego. Finally had to ask my wife to help me sit. After few mins was ok then my wife walked to the restroom. I was feeling dizzy the whole time. I came back and was lying on the bed. Next time when I tried to wake up same problem. I was trying to sit and falling down. The dizziness was there for about couple of hours after that I didnt face that issue again. I never had Vertego problem in my life and this was a severe one on the second after taking the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Since that afternoon I am feeling normal but thought of reporting this adverse event.

Heart rate started to decrease after 10 minutes and returned to normal within 30-40 minutes.  Numb areas returned to normal within 45-60 minutes.  Slight feeling of anxiety for several hours, but this could have been simply from stress from the initial reaction.  I also occasionally have random panic attacks and could have potentially had a small one at the onset of my face going numb which could have contributed to the length of unease.

                                                Difficulty operating a motor vehicle at speeds over about 45 mph. I drove to the first vaccination appointment that morning (3/2/2021) and everything was fine. Driving home from the jab I started to experience trouble driving my car when crossing a major bridge in Pittsburgh. The feeling was akin to the anticipatory feeling of being on a climbing roller coaster or drop ride in an amusement park. Elevated heart rate; disorientation and a sort of adrenaline like rush. The feeling returns every time I attempt to drive on a freeway/bridge/etc though local driving is fine. (I was driven to the 2nd jab.) The issue continues now, close to 2 months after it began 45 minutes after receiving the 1st jab. In the several months prior to the jab I was driving extensively with no issues.

This happened about three days after my first dose for about 4 days. Starting to feel better now though. I didn&#39;t know what was happening and was tempted to go to the emergency room a couple of times but didn&#39;t. I&#39;m just finding out about this from an article I&#39;m just reading about 30 minutes ago and thought I should report this. I&#39;ve only had my first dose and now I&#39;m very concerned about the second due June 22nd.

                                                Patient experienced usual arm soreness from the shot, but as the days wore on, the soreness progressed into pain. Within a few days, patient realized the pain was more than a usual vaccination soreness. Within 7 days, Patient&#39;s shoulder was making loud popping sounds, and he kept feeling like it was falling out of socket. Basic movements like combing hair, teeth brushing, driving, and typing were painful and difficult with his left arm. Patient visited a physical therapist, and he said it isn&#39;t rotator cuff, but it could be a laberal tear. An MRI would better diagnose the issue. The physical therapist recommended 6 weeks of immobility on his shoulder. Patient purchased a brace and is wearing that to prevent mobility. Patient had not done anything else to injure his shoulder and was perfectly healthy when he presented himself to be vaccinated.

                                                After the injection my arm got really sore.  I began to feel really tired and begin to have chills and shakes.  I started having diarreah and began throwing up. I had  a sever headache and body aches which all symptoms lasted for about 3 days and I felt so bad so on Wed 12/30 I went to Urgent Care and was given fluids which did make me begin to feel a little better. On Monday I was sent for a COVID test which was negative.  On Friday 1/1 i was finally able to return back to work.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

                                                8 minutes after the vaccine i satrt to experience some tingling to my left earlobe. It then radiated to my left jaw line where i felt an onset of numbness. the numbness hten radited to my left shoulder all the way down to my left extrremity digits. atthat time i waived over a nurse who waived a physician who check my radial pulse, pulse was noted in the 70&#39;s. At that time the physician  asked a EMT perofrmed four evalautions of my BP and my BP was reading syttolically between was 140-150 and my datolics was reading 110-115. Throughout that time the numbness was still to my left side of my face and shoulder and arm and to myfingers. This was only localized to those two areas.  At that time it was requested for me to go to the hospital to seek medical attention. I deferrred to going home to check my BP and at that time i was running 150/100.  The numbness was still present and mu thought process my body was stressed out. I then took a nice cold shower with breathing techniques. I did orthastatics on myself. I then followed with my PCP the next day and she ordered bunch of labs, CRP, triponents, CBC, bubble study and chest x-ray and EKG. ALl the testes were deemed to be negative.  My systolics were 120/80 when i saw my PCP, however i was recommedned to take the whole week off and was recommended to go back to work after the new year.  After five days the numbness went away to my digits went away but not to my face.  My grips were equal. I had no Bal palsy nor stroke.  The numbness sill persisted up till day 9 and the umbness to the face went away.

                                                Within 30 seconds pain on my arm and it increased slightly. I was able to do my work. But every time I was stable and tried to use it again I felt pain again. Pain was always there - it was tolerable. I was told to take Ibuprofen about three hours later. Second day,  I could feel it but I didn&#39;t take medication. It slowly went away. No swelling, nothing. On January 4th started having symptoms nose bleeding; diarrhea; cold sweats; had a fever - but I didn&#39;t take it to know what it was. I very tired/ extremely sleepy; my eyes started feeling warm- these symptoms creeped up on me. It started around 10:00 am and within an hour an a half I had to tell my boss and they told me to leave work - but I couldn&#39;t drive. I stayed in my car and just slept and I was extremely tired. I had a coworker keep an eye on my because I looked really bad. I slept two or three hours in my car. I was still tired and I couldn&#39;t drive yet. So I stayed in my car a little longer until I felt stronger and drove home. I had started coughing and knocked out - but I was beginning to coughing a lot  on drive home- the  first hour I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was coughing so much - lasted an hour. Chest coldness for a couple of days - cold chest. It wasn&#39;t tight. Next day,  January 5, 2021 - went to doctor and they ordered COVID test. Dr thought I had a stomach virus. Diarrhea continued for two days. Weak and fatigue for 5 days. My Fever - temperature was on the first day was one day only. Second day, I did have a lot of fatigue and I was coughing a lot.  The fatigue lasted 10 days.

So much that I was worried my muscles would begin to sieze up and cramp.  I had warm clothes and 5 blankets and could not get warm for over 2 hours.  Elevated heart rate and breathing.  Nothing warmed me.  Eventually (and with ibuprofen) the incident subsided.  I felt weak and just &#34;off&#34; with slight body aces and fatigue for the next day and a half.

Felt fine Monday morning. Monday about 11 am began to feel tightness in chest, thought it was bad heartburn. Pain kept me awake Monday night, and continued into Tuesday morning. Called the doctor, was sent to urgent care. Urgent care detected elevated tritonin and had me transported to the emergency room. Elevated heart rate and rising tritonin levels had me admitted to the hospital. Given heperin and a beta-blocker, given a CT scan, and monitored over night. On Wednesday had a echocardiogram and then a heart catherter and imaging, which showed a healthy heart, no plaque, no blockages. Tritonin levels and heart rate returned to normal. Released from hospital on evening of 3/10.

                                                In the past, I have had a very mild  and intermittent case of tinnitus.  However, immediately after receiving my first Pfizer dose -- within an hour -- I noticed that my tinnitus got much, much worse and louder -- it became a constant loud hissing in both ears.  More than a week later, the tinnitus is almost debilitating --  CONSTANT and never getting any lower.    A &#34;whooshing&#34; sound that just won&#39;t stop.  It&#39;s maddening.    I&#39;ve never had tinnitus this bad in my life and there is no reason for it to have gotten worse besides the vaccine.    It is high-pitched, and constant, and this is two weeks after receiving my dose.     It&#39;s only getting worse -- there has been no hint of quieting down.   I am very upset over this and it&#39;s obvious that my tinnitus got severe directly after I got the first Pfizer vaccine.   I&#39;ve been living at home alone for the last year so it&#39;s certainly not due to loud music or anything like that.

                                                I started shivering around 1am.  It got so bad that my teeth were chattering, too.  I slept poorly and at 6am took my temperature.   It was 101.4.  I used a digital thermometer under the tongue.  I took 2 acetaminophen at 8am.  At around 10am my fever broke.  My temperature stayed around 99 throughout the day.  I felt &#34;whoozy&#34; and weak for the rest of the day.  Today, April 18th at 10am I don&#39;t have any symptoms.

                                                7 days after vaccine I had a pretty intense, unprovoked anxiety attack. I was not under any stress, have never had anything like this occur, was not doing anything strenuous and all of a sudden had what I thought might even be a stroke or heart attack. I walked back to the house and took BP and it was 172/75 and pulse rate was only 64...but I was sweating, faint feeling, blurred vision, completely exhausted and it felt like my heart was pounding...but it wasn?t.??  I took BP multiple times but it was fine.  Just a really strange anxiety attack I guess that lasted a few hours.  I wasn?t worried about it and was t going to report it but have had 3 other people who unsolicited told me about their anxiety attack between 5 -7 days after shots. Two were phizer and one was Modena. Figured I would report it in case it helped someone else to not panic if they had an event like this.  It was quite scary and I don?t get worried about things like that!

During this time I also had some confusion and difficulty comprehending reading and verbal explanations. Unsure what day it was. I found myself misspeaking words with the wrong meanings. I also was confused if I had completed tasks such as going for a scheduled unrelated blood test, taking my car in for maintenance, etc, and could not recall if I had done these things or if they still needed done.   I would stay awake no more than a few hours, 5 at most, then sleep for 8-10 hours. This went on until the fifth day.

He has been having fever since yesterday morning running 102.7-103.9F. Called PCP and was advised to present to the ED yesterday but he did not. He fell after losing his balance today. Endorses nausea, confusion. Has extensive medical history. Patient has signs of sepsis with likely bacterial infection acute cystitis/pyelonephritis.  His lactate and procalcitonin are unremarkable and vitals remained stable however he does have an elevated total bilirubin as a possible sign of a more serious systemic response.  The patient does have chronic cirrhosis and persistent fever and tachycardia.  Given these clinical findings he is referred for admission for IV antibiotics and further close monitoring. Unfortunately, urine cultures were not sent.  His blood cultures however did grow 2 of 2 bottles positive for Klebsiella pneumonia.  These are both sensitive to Levaquin.  In the course of his hospitalization, he has improved.  He is now requesting discharge.  Will discharge home on p.o. Levaquin.  Is discharged in improved condition.

                                                Patient told pharmacist he has habit of passing out when giving blood or getting shots.  He was nervous.  He did well getting shot, set in room for 5 min., then moved him to waiting room where I asked him to stay 15-20 more min. Over a few min he looked very pale, we offered him water. (he barely sipped any). after 5 min he started sweating. He did not call for help, but technician on duty saw him put his head in his lap. We both went out to tend to him. While we were talking to him, he passed out. We called 911. While giving vitals and info to 911, he came to before they got on scene.  While paramedics were assessing him, after about 5-10 more min...he passed out again. This time when he came to, seconds later...he projectile vomited on the paramedics.  They tended to him until about 1:15-1:30. PT refused their suggestion and urging to go with them to hospital. Paramedics left him in pharmacy to leave facility on his own will. Pt refused our suggestion to call someone to come pick him up and not drive.  After sitting outside to get some fresh air, PT came through our drive thru to tell us he was much better and leaving Store. We told him we would call and check on him 5/17/2021. We have called now 2 days (5/17/ and 5/18) and can not get him to return our call.

                                                Strong shoulder pain started on Sat 4/17 in the early morning that woke me up. Went away by 10a after taking tylenol and having a coffee. Sun 4/18: pain again woke me up and was more severe. Had to get out of bed to move around as pain was pretty bad. Went to urgent care. Found nothing serious (not a heart attack or clots, etc). Referred me to go see my PCP if it did not resolve in a few days. Thu 4/22: went to PCP. Pain had subsided for the most part, but started having reduced range of motion when lifting arm straight forward...could not get past 90 degrees (straight out) without pain and a feeling of physical binding in the joint. Suspected bursitis. Prescribed a steroid pack and muscle relaxer.  Sat: 4/24: my son noticed my shoulder blade sticking out when attempting to reach for a glass of water while seated. Decided to make appt with an orthopedic. Fri 4/30: went to orthopedic. Took xray. Found no physical damage, trauma, etc. Noticed winged scapula as reason for lack of range of motion. Prescribed physical therapy. Fir 5/14: still same lack of range of motion and no pain. Went to first PT appt. They took range of motion measurements and agreed I was limited. Tested for other pain or signs of trauma and found none. Prescribed a PT regimen.   After my own research combined with symptoms, and no physical trauma as the source. My suspicion is Parsonage Turner Syndrome brought on by the vaccination.

                                                My first symptoms from COVID developed in Apr 2020 after having been presumed positive with COVID. I had never had problems with nausea before, but have needed nausea meds ever since for every meal since that time. No change since then.  Vaccine dose 1 given Mar 18. On Mar 24 began having body temperature regulation issues. For example my feet would be freezing and buzzing, similar to restless leg/body, but my upper body would be so hot I couldn&#39;t rest my hands on my chest.  This happened every time I would lay down.  Walking around or sitting up made it netter, but laying down the symptoms would begin quickly. This made it impossible to sleep without taking some type of strong medicine that would relax my body enough to even it out. Luckily I was taking morphine for back pain and that seemed to help. Normal OTC pain killers would not make any effect.  This still occurs nightly, or even daily if I&#39;m trying to nap during the day.  Without morphine or something similar in my system at the time my body temperature and buzzing / restless body feeling  continues.  On Mar 27 I began experiencing a worse inability to stay asleep than I have ever experienced.  This continues to this day. I awake every hour to an hour and a half regardless of how exhausted I am.  Without a significant sleeping pill, which I am not currently prescribed, I cannot remain asleep through the night.  Xanax has helped but does not always keep me asleep.  I am still searching for a sleep doctor to assist to help address this sleep issue which was largely controlled by my CPAP once I finally was diagnosed and treated with sleep apnea.  But now I am having nightly issues of awakeness, what appears to be called &#34;coronasomnia&#34; in some places, which makes me exhausted during the day.  Finally, I ended up in the ER for kidney stones on Apr 8, the day I was scheduled for my second vaccination shot.  I have never had kidneybstones before.  Though I understand they would not develop so quickly, I understand there have been many reports of kidney stones making themselves known shortly following COVID vaccinations.  I have not received my second vaccination and do not plan to do so given the effects I&#39;ve had so far.

This is the first of two reports.  This physician which was a 49-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on the right deltoid 17Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated that he received the first dose of the COVID vaccine and he had a pretty bad rash that started 3 days after (noted on 20Dec2020). The rash has since improved since it started but it took forever to improve and mentioned that he was super itchy at night. He also used to be itchy in the day, but now it was just at nigh which was driving him insane. The physician also mentioned that it was a raised maculopapular rash. It started on his neck on the left side as well and increased of both elbows and behind his knees (it was diffuse). He mentioned that he was able to carry on during the day, but he cannot sleep great. He mentioned that it reminded him of poison ivy - the thought of it happening again makes him want to cringe especially with all the terrible stuff he has seen he was scared that his skin will slough off or its going to kill him or something. But overall, he was more concerned about the itching. The physician took over the counter antihistamines and hydrocortisone cream. He did take one dose of expired liquid prednisone (from 5 years ago that his daughter who had for an ear infection). He downed a sip of prednisone and it prevented his itchiness for a day and now was thinking of getting on steroids. The physician also stated that there was one guy he worked with had something similar (AER 2021010285). He received the same lot number and has been itching like crazy. They have both been trying to figure out what to do. It was clear as mud. Then, last week (Jan2021) they saw each other, and they were both having the same issue and suffering separately. They had no exposure to anything similar besides the vaccine. The physician stated that he was about due for 2nd shot. He has been researching and trying to figure out what to do, if he should get the second dose or not. He reported this to VAERs and talked to CDC, but nobody has any recommendations or information. He also tried to look up trial data to see if anyone had reported a similar rash, and he did not find anything. He was calling to see if he should get the second dose, and if Pfizer has any information on this rash being reported. Outcome of pruritic rash was not recovered; recovering from maculopapular rash and unknown for the remaining event. As per causality: He was unsure. It was most likely from the vaccine as he has done nothing differently.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

                                                Early Wednesday morning (2/24) around 5:00AM, I woke up to extreme pain in my left arm, primarily along the upper forearm, inside of my elbow, and lower bicep. There was no trauma or unusual behavior prior to onset of pain. It came on suddenly and worsened with extension of the arm. Symptoms worsened over the next few days, with pain intensifying and extending down into my hand and up into my armpit and shoulder. I tried ice, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vicodin for pain relief, but nothing really helped other than the ice. On Saturday morning (2/27), I visited Urgent Care and was diagnosed as brachial plexis neuritis, aka Parsonage-Turner Syndrome by Dr and prescribed Prednisone and rest. On Sunday evening (2/28), I went to the ER seeking pain relief and second opinion. On Monday (3/1) morning, I was seen by ED doctors, and then three different neurologists. After doing an ultrasound which ruled out vein/artery thrombosis, the neuro team diagnosed Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. They&#39;ve prescribed Gabapentin, Acetaminophen, and Ibuprofen for pain relief,  a follow-up neuro consult, an MRI for next Friday, and an EMG in a few weeks. Last night while sitting and reading, the same pain began in my right arm, similarly to how it presented in my left arm last week. The right arm pain is less than the left arm pain, but at this point seven days later, I am experiencing neuropathic pain in both arms.

I also felt like I had a bit of a lump in my throat. I called the Doctor&#39;s office and spoke with a nurse who suggested I take Benadryl.  I did so at around midnight and that seemed to take care of things.  Went to bed and woke up the next morning feeling ok (though groggy from the Benadryl).

The episode lasted a full week before subsiding.

Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL9269) on 02Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. On 24Mar2021, patient had some facial numbness and mild palsy in the left side of the face. He stated he had some previous nerve damage in his neck that had not been acting up in about a year, but it was acting up then. He stated it was the feeling like when you go to sleep on something, and it felt heavier. He asked what he should do, if he should seek medical attention and for information on this. After providing information from the Prescribing information, he asked if the Bell&#39;s Palsy went away in these individuals in the clinical trials? He stated his wife just said that the left side of his face was sagging. He stated he did not think it was a stroke though because he could move that side of his face and can articulate everything. He felt loopy but did not feel like it was a stroke. Patient reported that basically he felt numbness on the side of his face and cheek. There were reactions when he smiled, it seemed a little bit off. There was a weird feeling and numbness in his face. The numbness went from his cheek up on to the temple area and jaw area, the numbness was primarily on the left side of his face. Patient had nerve damage in his neck already. Patient wanted to know if he should go somewhere with it, was it ok, what was going on with the numbness in his face. Patient thought the numbness in his face and cheek had worsened. Felt like face was heavy on that side or drooping:  Caller reported that looking in mirror, the left side of his face did not react the same. Patient&#39;s face felt like it was heavy or drooping on the left side, but that it pulls up higher. Patient reported that his face looked ok. Mouth pulls weird: Patient reported that this could be from his prior nerve damage, it was like he had got some weird palsy going on in his face. Patient stated that he just wanted someone to tell him dude wait it out, go to the emergency room, go to the doctor. Patient inquired if the facial numbness was because he had prior nerve condition and if the Covid-19 vaccine had exacerbated his existing nerve condition. The outcome of the events were unknown.

He had headache, nausea, disoriented.  Then he went to bed, woke up at 9:00 AM and had a seizure, which he has had in the past but it had been over a year.  He rested after the seizure and knew what to do and it took 2-3 days to recover from that due to the weakness in the legs, disoriented.   He has gotten stronger and is pretty much back to his normal self.  He has not had any additional seizures since then.   He had his FU physical today and she is aware of the seizure and told them to report the incident.

                                                I went with my wife, whom we were more concerned about possible reactions to the vaccine given her history of anaphylaxis reactions to bee and wasp stings, has had to carry a Epi-pen always, so we stayed an additional 15 minutes for 30 minutes total before we left.  She was completely fine throughout, I however as we were walking out I began to feel a little ?Off?, not necessarily nauseous or dizzy, just a bit Off.  Told my wife that and that I wasn?t sure I should drive us home (I drove us there), so she drove.  About 15-20 minutes into the drive, it got worse and I passed out.  My wife says my eyes rolled in the back of my head with my eyes open but no responsive.  She says she kept hitting my chest but I didn?t respond. I came to about 2 minutes after passing out.  She asked me if I felt like I needed to goto the hospital, I told her I needed to eat, that I felt like what I needed was food, then we go from there.  I did eat breakfast, an English muffin at about 8am that morning, it was almost 12:30 by that point.  When I finally got food in me I felt much better and have had no adverse reactions since.

                                                Started experiencing some dizziness on March 8th that lasted for approximately 3 weeks. Did get the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and a week later felt a sort of hot feeling in my head similar to that ballon sensation when first coming down with the flu but nowhere near as intense. The dizziness was worst on March 10th then slowly resolved itself over the next few weeks. It was mild to moderate in intensity, I could feel a continuation of movement after turning my head sideways, it felt like the head was still going. Strange. I was still able to go to work but the effect was noticable. The only variables in my life recently were beginning Humira on Feb 2nd 2021 and getting the series of Pfizer Covid vaccines on Feb 19 and March 12. I did notify my gasteroenterologist because at first I assumed it was the Humira. He said that is not a side effect. On further research I have seen a lot of people reporting vertigo several weeks out after the Covid shots as if the antibody formation produces and inflammatory response in the ear in some patients. Unknown the symptoms are related to the shot or not. I had one outbreak of Meniere&#39;s Disease in 2006 and has not recurred. Perhaps the vaccine can cause a recurrance?

I started with severe vertigo and left ear pressure on 4-3-21. I have never had this problem in my life. I was okay by 4-5-21, and I though everything was fine. On 4-15-21, the severe ear pressure in my left ear returned along with the severe vertigo. I have now had 24-7 vertigo daily since 4-15-21. I went to my family doctor, on 4-16-21. I was given meclazine which has done absolutely nothing. I feel absolutely awful, and it is at its worse after 6 pm. I can not live like this. Daily activities are an absolute chore now.

                                                He felt very bad the night he received the 2nd shot of Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on April 27. He even joked he probably would die that night. He also complained that despite his protest, the person who administered the shot insisted to inject on his shoulder joint.  He developed a bigger-than-quarter-size bruise on his right inner arm the next day. He was feeling tired the following days. On May 4 around 3:30, I heard he was making loud noises. I came to his side immediately. At the time I thought he was making louder than usual snores. I nudged him gently but he didn&#39;t respond.  After about 15 seconds, the sound stopped, and he had no breath. I then called 911 within 10 seconds, tried to do CPR on him. It took EMS 6 minutes to arrive even though we live very close to a fire station in a well-accessed urban area. EMS worked on him for about 30 minutes before transported him to hospital. They continued to work on him for a while. He never regained breath.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Woke up at 12;30AM with a 101 degree fever and intense pain in lower back/upper buttocks. Fever/pain persisted and worsened throughout the night. Aches spread to other areas of my body but still centralized to back/buttocks. Headache introduced in the AM. Fever bounced all day between 102 and 104.2 degrees all day until about 8:30PM on Sunday. Tried ibuprofen to manage pain and temperature but had minimal effect. General tingly and buzzy feel after 8:30PM and into Monday. Headeache reappeared on Monday evening with cold sweats. Strange calf ache in right leg Monday night into Tuesday AM that consistently woke me up. Tried massage, stretching, to no avail. Tuesday AM most everything dissipated with just a bit of fogginess throughout Tuesday (though less than Monday).

A 49-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 at vaccination age of 49-year-old on 31Mar2021 15:00 (Lot Number: EP6755) as 2nd dose, single dose; and dose 1 on 10Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6206) as 1st dose, single dose, both via an unspecified route of administration for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing systemic lupus erythematosus (diagnosed lupus diagnosed 15 years ago [2006]), antiphospholipid syndrome which is also called hughes syndrome and he was diagnosed 15 years ago [2006] (his numbers are so high that University came over and taken his blood samples as he is a unique case. It is on the national order of rare diseases), ongoing overweight, tachycardia, thyroid under-productive, ongoing neuropathy peripheral, lupus anticoagulant, ministrokes and 2 massive strokes that affected his left side. It was reported that his blood was clotting in his veins and he was having mini strokes and then he had 2 massive strokes. He has a lot of joint and RA factor in his blood. In his back, he had L4-5 disc removed in January and he has stiffness and pain from Lupus. He mentioned that his family has many autoimmune disorders. His son has the worst case of Grave&#39;s disease. Concomitant medications included gabapentin (GABAPENTIN) taken for neuropathy peripheral from Feb2021 (reported as taken a month before the first vaccine) to unknown date; iron oxides taken for an unspecified indication from an unknown date in 2021 (reported as few months before the first vaccine) to an unknown date; and propranolol to keep away tachycardia. The patient did not receive other vaccines on the day of covid-19 vaccination. The patient narrated that his plasma was high that he sells his plasma and they make test kits out of his antiphospholipid titers and he never runs under 4,000 on any of those. The patient mentioned that he has been 15 years they have been checking his titers. They checked his titers before the which was 4400 and after the vaccine (07Apr2021), they were 275. The patient mentioned that he has taken the 2 shots and the vaccine put his Lupus in remission (07Apr2021). The patient added that it knocked his titers for anticardiolipin IgM, and alphaglycoproteins IgM down (2021). The patient stated that it has been going on with him for 15 years, and nothing else has brought them down like that. The only new medications he started this year (2021) were Gabapentin and Iron pill so nothing else could have affected his titers except for the Covid vaccine. They checked his titers again (unknown result) so they could do his draws, they could not believe it. The patient further stated that he got a hold of the CDC and health department and they are supposed to be getting ahold of Pfizer. The patient stated that this is a good thing, the vaccine basically put his Lupus in remission and mentioned that he does not know the correlation. The patient has had no rashes, boils, hives, his joint pain has greatly decreased. The vaccine is suppressing all of those antiphospholipids that cause all of those problems. He does not know how close to a cure for Lupus the vaccine is, but this happened a week after the second shot. This has never happened before, so the patient thinks there has to be something there and Pfizer may have stumbled onto something amazing. The patient stated that every medicine he has been on for Lupus, and nothing has controlled his Lupus and Antiphospholipid syndrome. He further added that he has connective tissue pain, it is still there but not near as much as it was and his back was messed up and now that the Lupus is under control his back does not have real pain, just discomfort. In his back, he had L4-5 disc removed in January and he has stiffness and pain from Lupus and now it is not anywhere near as bad. He mentioned that after that it seems like once they got his results, they could not believe it. He has never been turned down for draws before and this was the first time that it was normal. He further mentioned that it is as if the Lupus has gone away. He stated that he had very little side effects from shots which included he felt Bleh and had a low-grade fever on 01Apr2021. The patient added that after the first shot, he had no problems. After the second on 01Apr2021 to 02Apr2021, he felt like he had a little cold or sickness, achy and he was lethargic for a couple of days, and then after that, he was normal again. The patient stated that he has not been having the flare ups that he usually has with Lupus. The inhibitors are what causes his Lupus and APLS which he has had them for 15 years, with no relief. The first time he has relief, was getting a vaccine for a Covid strain. The patient did not received treatment for the adverse events. The patient contacted the main guy that makes the test panel kits, and all they can think of is there is something in the vaccine that is suppressing his immune system. He does not know how long it will last but so far it has lasted about 4 weeks. He feels way better than before, and he will know if it wears off because his symptoms will start. The adverse events did not result in emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of the events &#39;titers before the vaccine and they were 4400, after the vaccine they were 275&#39; and &#39;vaccine put his Lupus in remission&#39; were unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovered on 02Apr2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information expected.

I fell at work when I was just standing by my desk when I suddenly became extremely dizzy. At home I am having to hold onto things to help with balance. I am also having headaches, tinnitus, confusion, some mild congestion, and extreme tiredness. The vaccine is the only thing thing that is different the last couple of months. None of my medications have changed. I am due for the second shot next week, but I am not getting it due to the side effects I am experiencing.

I was having a difficult time concentrating and my immediate supervisor noticed right away and sent me home.  Walking out of the workplace I was extremely dizzy and dropped my bag once, but thankfully didn&#39;t break my laptop.  That evening I began to feel an extremely sore throat and nausea.  For the next several days 7-8 days I had a wet cough with thick yellow mucus, and fatigue.  After 2 weeks I slowly began to have less of a cough.  15 days (day of this report) my cough is minimal but still present.  Symptoms are continuing to lessen daily.

                                                On 04/06/2021 Patient got his first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.  Within 24 hours, he got sharp pain in the injection site and shoulders with an increase in brain fog type issues.  He thought it was due to induced immune response depleting energy from the body.  However, a week or so in his usual daily activities started slowing down (e.g., going from daily showers to 3 times a week, not getting chores done in a timely manner).  On 04/27/21, he got his second shot, resulting in complete mental shutdown. Patient was  not showering  or shaving and only ate when forced.  All internal sense of motivation and intuition was gone. He experienced memory issues, trouble speaking, and suffered from a  ?complete state of nothingness which I?ve never experienced before? also known as abulia. He rarely took part in activities he did daily before the vaccine such as spending time on PC and reading the news. On 5/16/21, his condition started to improve and his precious feelings of &#34;nothingness&#34; turned to anger.  He got intense neuropathy escalation in fingertips at this time which lasted about a week and  half. His reaction lasted two months and now he is currently able to shower, shave, and exercise daily but still has memory and executive functioning issues.

Palpitations became so frequent that I went to my PCP&#39;s office, where I was found to have an abnormal rhythm on my EKG (non-sustained V-tach, runs of 4-5 beats at a time).  I then went to hospital where I was admitted to observation in the ED for monitoring.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

Unable to eat anything I started to vomit stomach acid. It is now 2 days later and I still have a degree of nausea and am unable to work today. I got the 2nd vaccine on Monday.  It is Wednesday and I still have no appetite for food and have lost about 7 lbs since the weekend. I feel that I am starting to round the corner to recovery though.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

Tried to re-arrange pillows but could not get arms to complete the process even though fully mobile. A minor amount of weakness in arms/legs and tingling across the lower face, particularly on the right side. Once up, had an inability to form words even though thoughts were coherent. Minor difficulty swallowing water. Speech slurred badly enough to be incomprehensible to my wife. By 7:30 we arrived at the hospital where symptoms were improving.

But nausea and loss of appetite which started 5 days later on April 1 still remain as of today 4/7.  It doesn&#39;t prevent me from eating or any other problems just definitely not myself.     What&#39;s even more strange is my desire to drink 7up because of feeling sick. Haven&#39;t drank this stuff in over 30 years. But the feeling of nausea triggered past memoires of drinking 7up to feel better.

Higher fever (topped at about 101 and change), severe fatigue, slept 18 hrs and took off work. Alternated tylenol and ibuprofin every 2 hours.  Also chills, heavy night sweat body aches..  Next day, sub 100 fever that &#34;rollercoastered&#34; all day.  Alternated tylenol and ibuprofin every 2 hours. Body aches, arm ached at injection site. Worked from home.

                                                Vaccine administered 9.20am. Fatigue shortly after vaccine was administered - slept most of afternoon. Injection site pain - feels like been punched in arm. Headache in the evening. Night chills and complained of &#34;tight&#34; (not acute) chest pain... but no breathing problems. Morning fever of 101F. Headache, Dizzy, Fatigue, Muscle Pain (esp in legs, asif he had &#34;run a marathon&#34;). He spent most of the day &#34;resting&#34;.  Evening on day two, we noticed a large bump under his vaccinated arm. Radius about 5cm - larger than what I know swollen lymph nodes to look like - almost looks like a bicep between his armpit and nipple. Tender to touch. Morning of day three (48 hours after vaccine) bump under his arm remains and all other symptoms seem milder.

I got in my house and told my wife I was not feeling right and started to notice a dizziness coming on. I was to call the pharmacy to find out what I should do, but noticed my heart rate was up, I looked at my Apple watch monitor and my BPM was 164. I felt flush and told my wife to call 911. Ambulance arrived and took my vitals and ( I do not recall the blood pressure, but it was high for me) when they put me into the ambulance I began to shake uncontrollably and then began to sweat profusely. They took me to the emergency room, but did not administer any drugs. The Dr. came in and said he did not think it was related to the vaccine, but my personal Dr. agreed with me based on my medical history that it had to be related to the vaccine. My resting heart rate (I monitor this daily) is between 45 - 60 and my last blood pressure reading at my yearly physical on April 2nd, 2021 was 100/70.

I looked in mirror and saw two pimple size type spots itchy. over the neck 30 mins another itchy pimple grew and neck got a bit red  and under an ear got red and itchy.   over the next hour my breathing felt a little more difficult, though oxygen level oximeter reading still good.  8.5 hours after vaccination both sides of my upper back/shoulders were covered in hives.  I felt a bit foggy also.  I administered epinephrine pen to my thigh.  Over next few minutes the hives disappeared (except for a few pimple size spots though they basically disappeared)and the itch was gone.   My breathing felt fine.  I monitored signs and symptoms with no noticeable issues for the next day&#43;.  This was the 1st time I ever used an epi pen.

                                                Was flying on 2 Apr 21 at cruise about 1 hour into flight, experienced loss of color in vision, went from full color to red and gray, somewhat washed out, experienced lightheadedness and a bit of disorientation but not dizziness. Needed to use the bathroom and try to move to improve circulation and had to think about moving my body. I was not uncoordinated but my steps and balance were deliberate vs. unconscious and automatic. I was able to walk down the aisle to the lavatory without any problem but my vision did not immediately improve as I had hoped.  I went into the lavatory and leaned against the side (I&#39;m 6&#39;4&#34; and it was the rear lavatory on a 737). I was not dizzy and my lightheadedness began to clear up slowly as I urinated. The color was also coming back slowly as I finished up and walked back to my seat, again, I had to think about each step and my balance, although I was okay walking back. As soon as I sat down, I began sweating profusely. It lasted about two minutes or less, not long at all and I didn&#39;t get wet from the sweat. As suddenly as the sweat came, it went. My eyesight went back to normal and I felt nothing had happened. I am sure I was awake, aware and lucid the entire time, although it felt like what I imagine a psychedelic episode would be like (I&#39;ve never used any form of hallucinogen, however). I was back to normal when I disembarked the aircraft, felt no adverse or lingering effects either. Nothing to report since.

                                                Shortness of breath, heart palpitations, vertigo/dizziness, phantom body pains appearing and disappearing in various places, occasional itching sensation, numbness, brain fog, double-vision, extreme tiredness. Symptoms tapered off over 3-5 days. Similar experience with 2nd vaccine but less pronounced with a shorter timeframe, tapering off after 2-3 days. Strongest side effects after first vaccine, symptoms did not become noticeable until a couple of hours after it was administered, increasing next 24 hours before lessening over time. Basically identical to long covid symptoms but lasting only for a few days after vaccinations and not before.

                                                About 4 hours after receiving the 2nd dose, my left arm started to become sore (where the shot was given) About 10 hours after receiving the 2nd dose, I started feeling &#34;fluish&#34; (achy, feverish, nauseous) All throughout that evening, the symptoms became worse and worse where I repeatedly took my temperature thinking I had a very high temperature only for it to read &#34;below&#34; normal at 97.3. The symptoms continued to get worse, without much sleep throughout the night and into the next day and evening.  I almost scheduled an appointment with my primary care physician on 4/24 because I felt so horrible.  It wasn&#39;t until about 11 am on the 2nd day  after receiving the shot (4/25) that I felt somewhat better and by that evening around 6pm, felt normal again. The 2nd dose was absolutely, without a doubt, MUCH worse of symptoms than the first dose. I hope this helps and please contact me with any questions or to help further.

                                                I felt well for the 8-9 hours after the shot, around 8pm that  evening, a headache and mild fever started.   By 1am, fever, chills, increased headache, severe joint pain were in full swing, muscle almost felt like they were on fire.  Even rolling over in bed HURT.  Fever got as high as 101.8 (I usually am around 97.6 or so).  Symptoms started to abate by mid morning, but I was essentially useless until that evening.  By May 6, I felt like I had a really bad hangover all day, then was mostly recovered by that evening.  It is now May 9.  I have a long history of knee/arthritis pain, and am generally a rather active person, but since the second dose, my knee pain as well as my hands to a large degree, have been extraordinarily sore and painful.  My knees in particular, while the symptoms were really peaking, I experienced some very acute,atypical pains a couple times in both knees that seem to keep recurring 2-3 times per day, as well as exacerbated, continual soreness and general pain when I am active.

                                                I was just falling asleep when my body started shaking.  It was not violent, but enough to wake me and confuse me.  I would call them tremors or convulsions but not sure if there&#39;s a better description.  It lasted about 1 minute.  The &#34;tremors&#34; were at a rate of roughly 2.5 per second somewhat like a very rapid heartbeat almost.  In fact, I checked my pulse with my watch thinking it may be a heart issue but it only registered 58 bpm.

                                                After first shot an uptick in paranoia as every day got worse.  Before second shot I was having the vivid dreams.  I was also hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting things that weren&#39;t there.  The second shot put me over the edge immediately.  I felt as if I was being poisoned, the vial with medicine inside turned amber color and I shut down as paranoia turned into an orchestrated conspiracy against me.  for the next 3- 4 weeks I hallucinated daily,  I believed reality was a dream and fiction was my reality.  My wife tried multiple times to make me understand that what I was going through was not real, yet because my paranoia and psychosis I remained shut down and basically sleeping for two weeks. I could not speak about what was going on b/c I could not formulate a tangible and coherent thought.  During this time I believed everyone was against me, which now I know is not true.  It was a nightmare that lasted months.  On June 4th I saw Dr., whom recommended a psychologist.  I was able to book the first appointment on June 15th and have been going to Dr. on a weekly basis.  The internal hysteria, paranoia, hallucinations kept me mute for about a month.  About a month after my second shot I began to speak about it although it was disjointed.  It was on May 13th.  It took weeks of trying to formulate thoughts to go to a doctor.  I am still having issues remembering words.  Psychologist suggests I see a neurologist.  That is why it has taken me so long to report.

The patient received treatment with DECADRON (steroid) and Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent Nasal Swab COVID test (COVID Nasal/Nasopharynx COVID test) on 28Feb2021 and the result was negative. The outcome of the events was resolved on an unknown date in 2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

Both IM through my left arm. Directly for about less 48H post vaccination I had muscle pain that were self-resolved.  On Jan 18, 2021, I started having funny sensation (like having a foreign body) over my left eye medial /innercantus area. The next 2 days I started to have pain over my left external ear canal, then it progressed into pain over my left lower jaw, left vertex of my head, inner side of left eye. My SS progressed on 1/30/21 at around 3:30 PM to numbness over my left sided tongue and left sided lip. Then on 1/31/21 at around 5 AM, I started having left facial paralysis. I have left BELL&#39;s PALSY which was confirmed. following a negative non-contrast brain MRI to rule out stroke and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR test. I start taking Prednisone 60 mg daily and Acyclovir 1 g TID on Jan 31, 2021. To this date I still have left facial paralysis but not worsening.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization.

On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

I went back to vaccination location and was given a cold compress. I was taken to the ER and given Benadryl and multiple nausea meds. I was there for about 5 hours. I was released and instructed to drink lots of water. I was told by the doctor that my body was doing what it was supposed to do, but to come back if I got worse. I took 2 days off and returned to work with no remaining complications.

                                                I was given the first shot and sent to an observation room. I felt slightly flushed, it went away. By the evening, I started to feel flushed again. I commented to my wife that I felt like my blood pressure was up. (I don&#39;t have high blood pressure). That is the best way I can describe it. I can&#39;t recall if the ringing in my ears was noticeable at that time. My the next day I could still feel the flushed feeling and the ringing  was clearly noticeable and increased over time, until it can overcome TV or someone speaking to me. I also had a feeling of persistent light headedness. About Feb 3 I had pain in my ear and went to a clinic. I was diagnosed with a minor ear infection (right). I was given and took a course of anti-biotics. The infection went away but the ringing never did, sometimes it would lessen, but always louder than prior to the shot. I went ahead and took the second shot on Feb 11, thinking my problem was probably and ear infection. I the ringing could get so loud it would wake me up and keep me awake. On Feb20 I woke up to very loud ringing, nausea, and general feeling of unease. I went to a clinic the next day. I was told there was probably some inflammation and was given a steroid shot. After about 4 hrs the ringing lessened and I felt better, the first relief I had from the start. On Feb 23, I saw my ENT Dr. He gave me a course of steroids and ordered a brain MRI. The MRI came back with negative results...no abnormal indications. The ringing is starting to increase again as of the last several days.

                                                I received the vaccine at 12:15 PM.  I was a little tired but generally fine the rest of the day. I woke up at 2:30 and didn?t feel well. I got up to go to the bathroom. I started getting the chills and feeling dizzy. I passed out. My wife found me  passed out on the ground and bleeding. I needed six stitches in my head and have a black eye as well as other facial lacerations. I have no recollection of anything until my wife woke me.  I have never passed out in my life prior to this.

                                                Tingling and numbness in both arms and hands, but mainly in the left arm.  The tingling and numbness began about a day after the shot and I thought at first that it had to do with yardwork, but it has continued for about nine days so far.  It goes away for a few hours a day and some nights are not as bad as others, but it&#39;s painful - like your hand/arm falling asleep for an extended period of time - and interferes with sleep as well as concentration during the day.

                                                Within 30-minutes of vaccination, the patient reported a headache, slurred speech, and right side weakness. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was hypertensive (197/129) with a FSBG of 95mg/dL. During stroke assessment, the patient had new onset facial palsy/droop and need speech abnormality which signaled a stroke alert. 12-lead EKG was unremarkable. EMS transported the patient to Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient presented with a headache, chest heaviness, and slurred speech, but no aphasia. NIH stroke scale was 0. Patient remained hypertensive (170/109). Labs, tests, and imaging did not indicate rtPA administration. ED physician administered 0.4mg SL Nitroglycerin, 10mg IV Hydralazine, and 325mg PO Aspirin prior to admission for suspected Transient Ischemic Attack. Upon admission, differential was TIA vs. CVA vs. ACS. Admitting physician ordered HbA1C, lipid panel, MRI brain, CTA head/neck, 2D echo, and neurology consult. Throughout course of admission, patient had recurring midsternal chest pain that was relieved with Nitroglycerin. Imaging ruled out CVA. Given elevated TGs and Cholesterol, patient was started on Atorvastatin 40mg PO. Suspected TIA and ACS.  Neurology consult reviewed the labs and imaging, and stated the episodes of stuttering are most commonly associated with anxiety or stress reaction.

                                                Had a sore arm immediately after the shot.  didn&#39;t think much of it, of course, I just had a shot.  I was already on some prednisone for Gout from the first shot, After this shot, the Gout really kicked up even higher, so my Dr. increased the steroid, pain in arm/shoulder was there, but again, just thought was normal shot kind of thing.  (saw dr. a week after shot for Gout pain increase). Pain in arm stayed steady, now pain is just worse and worse each day, and it&#39;s been well over a month, so I know this is NOT normal.  I went to Dr. on 4/26.  He was unfamiliar with SIRVA.  He said see how it goes, and we can do a shot in the arm (I&#39;m AFRAID Of a SHOT in the ARM) , an MRI, to see what is happening.  We decided to give another week.  Well, this week was HORRIBLE!  I cannot sleep, the pain at night is unbearable, and taking aleve, tylenol, etc do nothing.  The pain during the day is getting more each day, I&#39;ve been doing  exercises I&#39;ve found online with no relief.

This rash at first did not itch but later itched mildly and intermittently this rash continues today, May 5th 2021.  Furthermore I&#39;ve suffered what I can only describe as brain fog that has left me discombobulated, absent mind, stumbling for words.  Also my mood is significantly altered as I am suffering from anxiety and a short temper.

A 51-years-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 14Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 51 years as single dose. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. Historical v for covid-19 immunisation accine included the first dose of BNT162B2 administered on left arm on 24Mar2021 at age of 51 years for covid-19 immunisation and experienced no issues. Patient reported that after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, he had a fever for 8 days and was diagnosed with pneumonia on 21Apr2021. Patient reported that he was tested for both Covid-19, Influenza A, and Influenza B twice on 19Apr2021 and 21Apr2021 and tested negative for Covid-19 and influenza both times. Patient reported that he had no pre-conditions and that he was feeling great the night before he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, 13Apr2021. Patient reported that he was planning to go to work following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 14Apr2021. He began running a low-grade fever (102 degrees) on 14Apr2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and then his temperature flared up to 103.5 degrees on 15Apr2021. Fever: He received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at 10:45 on 14Apr2021 and about 2:00 in afternoon on 14Apr2021 was the first fever that was significant. The last fever he had on 21Apr2021, his temperature was 103.9. He was put on antibiotics for pneumonia. He contacted the on-call nurse for his company. The on-call nurse advised him to see a doctor on Saturday, 17Apr2021.He went to the doctor on Monday, 19Apr2021. The doctor only ran a Covid-19 swab for testing and a flu swab. His doctor did not do blood work and stated that the patientwas experiencing an ill effect of the Covid-19 vaccine and sent the patient home. He went back to the doctor on Wednesday, 21Apr2021. When he went back to the doctor, the staff performed a chest X-ray and ran 4 different blood works to see what the patient had. The second Covid-19 test that he received on 22Apr2021 was performed with both the rapid test and the test that was sent off. Both Covid-19 tests came back negative. SARS test on 22Apr2021 was negative. 508-3 High Sensitivity CRP: One of his numbers that was parts per liter, 3 is considered to be high risk and he had 300 (300&#43;) of whatever it was on 21Apr2021. He went back to the physician and was given another steroid shot an additional prescription. He had been back to the doctor 3 times since then. Fever: His fever was 103 consistently after 15Apr2021. 508-3 High sensitivity CRP: This value showed abnormal. The results said that relative risk was greater than 1 mg/liter and high was greater than 3. 1000 CBC with auto differential on 21Apr2021: The abnormal results were red blood cells measured at 4.38; hematocrit measured at 13.82; MCHC measured at 36.4; Neutrophils measured at 84; Lymphocytes measured at 12; and absolute Lymphocytes measured at 0.57. He wore a Garmin and that it recorded that he received no more than 2-3 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights. He didn&#39;t know anything about pneumonia previously and that he had specifically told his physician&#39;s office everything about what he was experiencing. He told his physician about the wheezing in his chest (on 17Apr2021), cough (on 16Apr2021), fever, and chills (on 14Apr2021). His physician told him it was a normal reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine and sent him home on 19Apr2021. He then consulted Google and started to realize that his side effect were very atypical. Wheezing: When he breathed really light, the crackling would continue. If he breathed shallow, the wheezing was audible but if he breathed deeply, it was not. The pneumonia was in the left side of his chest. He was still being treated for the pneumonia. He has his last dose of medication tomorrow, 27Apr2021, and that he was also being released to go back to work tomorrow. Cough: He had a little cough that would then go away. The cough began late Friday, 16Apr2021. It was interesting because it wasn&#39;t a main part of the illness. The cough was just kind of a hacking cough every once in awhile. The cough was not continuous like go and go and go and stop. The cough came, went away for awhile, then came again.The cough being worse was relative. He was coughing more than he did on Wednesday 21Apr2021, Thursday 22Apr2021, and Friday 23Apr2021. The cough was consistent more so at night when he laid down. He would probably say that it was a different feel towards the cough but it was still a cough. The cough was still the same volume but not the same effect. Headache (on 18Apr2021): He had been waking up with headaches in the morning and going to bed with them at night. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, the headache was due to dehydration from the fever and night sweats. Once he got away from the dehydration headaches, the headache got better but he had woken up with a headache the last few days and had a headache at bedtime a few nights in a row. The headache was usually a frontal headache and this morning, 26Apr2021, the headache was toward the back of his head. The headaches last a few hours until he started moving around. On Saturday, 17Apr2021 he experienced a migraine that would not go away. He didn&#39;t usually get migraines. The migraine lasted hours if not for a day and that the headache was something furious. Sunday 18Apr2021 was pretty much the same thing with the headache. Because of the massive fever, he couldn&#39;t eat anything at all (17Apr2021). The headache was mostly due to low blood sugar and dehydration. Appetite: His appetite improved after his second doctor&#39;s appointment on 21Apr2021. The second provider was a lot more straightforward and advised the patient that he needed to start taking care of himself and trying to force himself to eat. He forced himself to eat on 21Apr2021 and by Thursday 22Apr2021, he had a full appetite and was craving food again. Shortness of breath (Apr2021): Patient reported that the shortness of breath was just from being fatigued. Patient reported that he got out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He was unsure when the shortness of breath began because he was moving very little, but that he noticed the shortness of breath on Monday, 19Apr2021 when he got up to go to the doctor.On Friday 16Apr2021 and Saturday 17Apr2021, he had a really good break.On Friday 16Apr2021 from 9 AM to 1 PM, he had no fever and it was like the sun was coming out, then the fever hit really hard. The same thing happened on Saturday, 17Apr2021, but the fever free period lasted maybe a little longer. His fever returned and that the afternoon of Saturday 17Apr2021 was the worst he had been the entire time. On 13Apr2021 to get away from arm soreness, he did a few laps in the pool. On 13Apr2021 he had a new best time on the 100 in freestyle in the pool and that he felt really strong going into 14Apr2021 to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. There was nothing that would have indicated that he had anything going on before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Up until Saturday, 17Apr2021, he had only been taking Motrin and just taking 2 tablets. He had no break in between fevers and chills and was not able to get ahead of the fever with the Motrin. There was a long stretch where the Motrin wasn&#39;t working and his temperature didn&#39;t get below 100 for several days. He tried to cycle acetaminophen in beginning Saturday 17Apr2021 to try to get the acetaminophen in between the Motrin doses.  When he went back to the doctor on 21Apr2021, the provider told him that he could take 3 to 4 Motrin tablets at a time but not to exceed 4 doses per day. He never took more than 3 tablets. Motrin was generic ibuprofen. Night sweats (on 21Apr2021): The last couple of nights have been the same. He had a fan on to keep a little cooler and that it was 61 degrees outside and he felt the night sweats. He had a buckwheat mat that was cool that he put on the floor to stay cooler with the night sweats. Come Thursday, 22Apr2021, he said we&#39;re done with this and he couldn&#39;t sleep from it (Apr2021). Last night, 25Apr2021, he knew that he had night sweats because he was sweating at night and the temperature in the room was 64 degrees. AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room. AEs required a visit to Physician Office for fever, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chills. Outcome of events was unknown.

I had been doing fine that week until the day after the second shot. I had severe shortness of breath, bad enough to keep me home and using my rescue inhaler several times that next day. This also occured when I had Covid in November 2020. It took me longer to test negative, 3 weeks. I believe that the shot caused an immune reaction, like it should, but also triggered an asthma attack that lasted several days but progressively reduced as time went on. Last week I had dizziness and heart palpitations. I have no idea if it was the shot still or the meds for my asthma, but I thought I should include it.

They tried to give me muscle relaxants and pain meds. But It did not cure anything. I have had a low-grade temperature(usually exactly 99.5 but sometimes higher ) for 38 days and does not go away. I felt inflammation and at the hospital, they did a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and it showed 144 mg/L. I entered the hospital from 5/21/2021 till 5/25/2021. They ran many tests but found no infections. They did possibly find some preexisting condition that I might have had all along.  The only problem I have is I was completely healthy per se (even with the preexisting condition that I didn?t know about) right before the vaccine I was able to exercise, able to lift weights, good energy level, and eating properly. I feel like the vaccine is still somehow working in my body even that is not supposed to be the case. I feel like my body is still in a state of hyper inflammation and it killing me.

                                                On 5/20/21 the patient was at home with his mother when he had acute nausea, light-headedness, and abdominal pain. He presented to the ED by ambulance. Excerpt from ED notes od MD follows: &#34;Initial ED interventions: iv fluids, low dose iv ativan, iv toradol, iv zofran.  ED course: patient arrives very anxious, writhing on bed, difficult to redirect. With chronic tonicity, not seizing. Mother arrives, and he recognizes her, seems to be consoled somewhat by her presence, but she is unable to direct him, and describes his behavior as irregular, and events acute this evening at her home.  Patient rests, and then HR decrease to 50s on monitior and patient found to be pulseless - I immediately start chest compressions, and achieve ROSC after PEA arrest with administration of EPI/compressions. Patient intubated per procedure note without complication. L femoral central attained per procedure note without complication. CPR performed over ED course intermittently (always PEA arrest) with ROSC achieved with administration of EPI, EPI drip started in addition to sedation meds, and iv fluids. No obvious STEMI on ECG to administer lytics, with suspicion of dissection and AAA prominent. I am able to stabilze and accompany patient to CT suite, where I recognize B/L massive PE immediately. I discuss with Dr. of Cardiology, who agrees with admininstration of alteplase. I disucss risks with mother who consents verbally. Patient without response to alteplase, and with continued pattern of PEA arrest following bradycardia. I discuss etiology of presentation with mother,and that patient is with very poor prognosis of survival, and likely poorer prognosis of neurological status, and patient is made comfort care, and fentanyl drip increased, patient is taken off of ventilation and drips. Pronounced deceased at 22:00.  MDM: Initial concern for but not limited to appendicitis, AAA, diverticulitis, renal stones, pyelonephritis, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis, toxic ingestion, ACS, obstruction, perforation, sepsis (2/2 PNA, UTI, meningitis, intra-abdominal infection), AAA, dissection, PE - as ED course progresses, differential narrows and consider more likely PEA arrest secondary to ACS, PE, dissection, AAA, necrotic pancreatitis, tension PNX (less likely). Considered but do not suspect seizures, stroke. Imaging studies reviewed - CXR with ETT in place, no acute pathology. CTA chest/A/P remarkable for massive proximal B/L PE. Labs reviewed. ECGs without STEMI, with sinus tach initially, LBBB after initial ROSC, and then AFib in RVR on subsequent ECG. Per above, patient suffered massive B/L PE, with subsequent cardiac arrest, despite heoric efforts including thrombolysis. Death called art 22:00.  Diagnosis: massive B/L PEs, PEA arrest.  Disposition: deceased.&#34;

A 51-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09May2021 11:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation at the age of 51-year-old. Medical history included Infected abscess. The patient previously took the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Apr2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation at the age of 51-year-old. The patient received Antibiotics within 2 weeks of vaccination, but no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported I had 12 of the side effects but 2 weeks later, and after missing 2 weeks of work I still have serious &#34;brain fog&#34;.  I have an Infected abscess and the infection got really bad at the Same time as my vaccination. The events started on 10May2021 12:00, and result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient was put on antibiotics. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination but tested for COVID-19 on 15May2021 with negative result.  Information on lot number/batch number was requested.

After 2 weeks still having trouble with normal activities. Heart beat feels different and I get weak whenever moving quickly for example doing laundry or cleaning the house.

The flu symptoms passed, but continued to have problems with lymph nodes. Fatigue set in just after flu symptoms, have never recovered. In June, I started having pain in my upper maxillary. Saw my dentist, who sent me to a dental surgeon. They determined that it was wire from a jaw surgery 30 years ago. They removed the wire, but all of the other wires are giving me pain, and may need to be removed. They had not bothered me prior to the vaccine. Mental health has also declined and not recovered. My medications are now higher than pre vaccine. Fatigue is still a major problem.

My fever was 102.8 when I first woke up. I was very nauseous and my fever felt worse. My thermometer would not read any more until my temp came down. I can only guess how high it got but at least 103 degrees. I took Advil Liquid Gells and then my fever broke. I was actually scare for my life. In March I actually caught coronavirus and developed  anti bodies for Covid. I can only guess my body was fighting for it&#39;s life.

A 52-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 12:00 PM  (at the age of 52-years-old) via an unspecified route of administration at an unspecified dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included hypertension, high blood cholesterol from unknown dates. Allergy information was not provided.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was administered the vaccine at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility.  Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN/HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), fenofibric acid (FENOFIBRIC ACID), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine on Monday 28Dec2020. A PCR test for COVID was done on Tuesday and a rapid test on Wednesday both of which were negative. The patient experienced some scratchy throat late Friday night on Saturday, 02Jan2021 the patient called out sick to work as a cough had started. A PCR test was done on 02Jan2021 and he received results Monday (4th) as positive. The patient continued to say that the cough had subsided, as he took Delsym.  He lost taste and smell on Monday. He reports running a fever that varies from 99-101.5. He took Tylenol and Motrin to control the fever. In addition he has experienced fatigue. It was also reported, in contradiction of the above reported chronology of events, that the onset date of events was 25Dec2020 (CONFIRMATION PENDING for onset date of events relative to vaccine administration). The patient experiences of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue resulted in a physician office visit (date not specified).  The patient underwent lab tests that includes a PCR test on 29Dec2020 which was negative, a rapid test on 30Dec2020 which was negative and a PCR test on 02Jan2021 which was positive. Treatment for the events was reported as Motrin and Tylenol for fever and Delsym. for cough. The clinical outcome of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue was reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 28Dec2020, and COVID-19 PCR test positive on 02Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: None, this was the first dose. No other vaccine administered on the same date. The patient had no events prior vaccination within 4 weeks. In all his life. He had vaccines that received and had no adverse event or side effect whatsoever. He had had the regular flu vaccine early November. The patient experienced feeling anxiousness in the brain, Heaviness in the head, feeling weak in Feb2021, Localized soreness and pain in Jan2021, Goosebumps tingly sensation in head, Blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat is getting higher and higher on 04Feb2021. The patient could not take Benadryl as he cannot tolerate Benadryl. With Zyterc he does not have secondary effects like he does with Benadryl. The first week after getting the vaccine he only had kind of had localized soreness and pain in the area. He later clarified it was in the area where got the injection, vaccine. He just had pain soreness in that area. Other than that he had no side effects at that time. The third week, initially stated as, about 5-7 days ago he started to have a feeling of anxiousness in the brain. He could feel anxiousness and sensation in his brain that he did not feel before. It was like he had the flu kind of thing, but he did not have a temperature. However, the feeling is in his head. It is like heaviness feeling from the flu in his head. He has been having the heaviness in the head feeling for 4-5 days. He later further clarified and initially clarified the localized pain and soreness was noticed the second day, the day after getting the vaccine. This only lasted a few days. He does not remember exactly when this ended. He did not take anything for the localized pain and soreness in the same area as the injection. He confirmed he has recovered completely from this event. Caller further clarified the feeling of anxiousness started Thursday or Friday of last week, maybe 05Feb2021. Stated it was like this feeling is getting worse and worse.

It started with that and slowly over the past few days it has changed and transformed into this heaviness feeling that one would feel from the flu, but he has no fever or anything; it is just in his head. Also, along with that feeling at the same time his blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat was getting higher and higher. His regular blood pressure medications won&#39;t work anymore to bring it down. His blood pressure typically ranges in the 130/85 or less range with all the blood pressure medications he was taking. Once he started having this tingling sensation in his head he had the higher blood pressure and higher heart rate. Now his blood pressure would average being about 170/110 to 180/115. This was like the upper and lower range. His heart rate was typically around 70-75 and now it goes about 80-85. Later during call, he also added, every six months or so his blood pressure may be elevated on these medications. Sometimes his blood pressure was not maintained by the three different blood pressure medications he takes. He was also prescribed two other medications for emergent use Clonidine and Xanax.

However, this time, he took two Clonidine and Xanax starting last Thursday when had the high blood pressure episode and they were failing to bring the blood pressure down.

He went to see his primary care provider on Monday. On Monday the doctor doubled the dose of Carvedilol. Since then instead of taking 12.5 twice a day, he is now taking 25mg twice a day. On Tuesday, yesterday, he went to get blood work done. Blood was drawn but has no results yet. Localized pain and soreness time of onset didn&#39;t remember, stated he may have had a little pain right after getting the vaccine, but it was around 21:00 25Jan2021 he really noticed the soreness and pain. The following morning around 9 AM it woke him from his sleep and he could feel it more compared to the first day. Anxiousness in the brain around 16:00. The patient had no emergency visit.

This 52-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number and expiration date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 09Mar2021 at 09:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included High blood pressure (had a history of drugs having unusual reactions in his system). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 in the right arm on 16Feb2021 at 10:00 for COVID-19 immunisation and had light head. the patient not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine; other medications the patient not received within 2 weeks of vaccination; 30 minutes after the first shot he felt light head. Not too bad but a bit concerning. About 30 minutes after the second shot (09Mar2021 09:30) patient began to get very light headed. The feeling intensified further over the next 20 minutes until the feeling became almost a psychedelic experience. his pupils were tiny, the my perceptions were off any his &#34;way of thinking&#34; had changed. he had take psychedelics in my youth (but not in 30 years) and it were not for that previous experience and ability to stay calm he was very well may have ended up in the emergency room. The whole experience lasted till he went to bed but the &#34;peak high&#34; lasted about an hour. The next morning he again felt like someone who had done a psychedelic drug the night before. The only other effect was he would get an uncontrollable tired feeling once a day for about 10 days. No treatment received for the adverse event; Prior to vaccination, the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19; Since the vaccination, the patient not been tested for COVID-19; The outcome of all the events was recovered in 2021.

I received a shot of cortisone 3 weeks before my first dose in the joint and was pain free until 8 hours after my second dose. The pain is still present.

All over body shaking.  Not unlike &#34;chills&#34; but didn&#39;t have the cold feeling with it.  No accompanying fever at the time.  Lasted until 5:30am.   6am - 15 hours after vaccine . Shortly after the shaking stopped, spiked a 101.5 degree fever.  That continued until approximately 5am the following day.  Took 500mg acetaminophen at 7am, and again at 4pm, and again at 12am.  Throughout the following day - 15 hours to 36 hours after vaccine - general body aches (most noticeable in the back), lethargic - but that could have been a result of no sleep the night prior due to shaking.   5pm following day - 27 hours after vaccine - bad headache.  That lasted until midnight 5am the next morning - most all side effects gone.  Some lethargy but temperature at 98.6 degrees, body aches no longer apparent, headache gone.

                                                Upper arm soreness started at about 8:30 pm, about 10 h after injection. Went to be like normal and arm was just sore, but nothing else at that time. At 1:10 am, patient woke up with horrible shakes, verging on convulsions, and the feeling of freezing to death. Uncontrollable shivers/shaking.  At around 1:40 am, patient was able to move enough to get out of bed to find a second blanket and extra strength Tylenol and took the Tylenol with some seltzer water and hid under blankets to get warmer. After about an hour, around 2:30 - 2:40 am, the shaking was reduced enough that the patient was able to relax and try to get to sleep. At 5;30 am, the patient woke up with much the same symptoms, but with the addition of the worst headache he had had since he stopped having migraines in his mid 20s and also his whole body ached like he had been hit by a truck (that [getting hit by a truck] had happened to him once about 15 years ago, so he has the actual reference to compare against).  This experience was worst overall body aches/pains ever experienced by the patient. He took additional Tylenol at 6 am and about 30 minutes later, the chills subsided and the pain was reduced enough that he could go to sleep again. Shortly before 10 am the symptoms started to get worse again and he took ibuprofen (400 mg) at 10 am, after the shakes started to come back. He has traded off every 4 hours taking tylenol and ibuprofen, which keeps the temperature perception swings to a minimum and overall body aches lower, but the headache does not go away. He feels exhausted, and has slept for spurts of 15 - 30 minutes on and off all day.  He was able to each crackers at around noon and some homemade chicken vegetable soup at about 1 pm as the nausea had subsided. Prior to that, he could only drink water and Gatorade. He is hoping that within 24 - 48 h he will feel much better, without having to take Tylenol or Ibuprofen.

A 52-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: UNKNOWN) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Apr2021 16:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient received second dose of Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine on Monday 19Apr2021 around 4pm. The next day the patient experienced numb face and arms, felt dizzy, and had to call out of work to rest and sleep all day. Today he felt okay but started feeling dizzy with a headache and blurry eyes. He has diabetes but has been taking his blood sugar in the morning and they have been okay. He has been taking tylenol for the headaches. The patient said he was driving to work next day and face and arm went numb. Had to turn around and go back home. Next day tried going to work again, face and arm went numb also was dizzy and slight headache. Wants to know if this side effect has been reported and what do we suggest. It was reported that the patient went to see his animals and I (sentence incomplete). I am calling you because of the side effects that I am having from the vaccine. Also, I want to know if this was the part of the side effects that was going on with me. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Patient went to the hospital last Saturday due to pain in the back of his leg. The pain started 12 hours after the second Covid vaccine. He wanted to cry he was in so much pain. He could not take anything for it. Patient stated that if the clot breaks off, he was dead. So, he had to put everything on hold because he did the right thing which ended up being the wrong thing. Patient stated that the pain in his leg was a 13 or 14 on a scale of 1-10. Patient took Tylenol and Pain patches did not work on a blood clot.

Patient stated that he went with his 84-year-old mother to get the vaccine. Patient said that the only reason she didn&#39;t get a blood clot was because she was already on blood thinners and said that he is the one who takes care of his mom and now he cannot walk barely, he had Covid in January and that people who had Covid shouldn&#39;t be taking these vaccinations because they have immunity, he talked to a doctor and a woman yesterday who still have their antibodies a year after having Covid. He said that the vaccine was injuring people. He was hospitalized related to his leg pain and diagnosed with the blood clot from 24 Apr 2021 to 27 Apr 2021. In the hospital he was told to him take Oxycontin or Morphine. He said that he did not want to take those and end up addicted. He said after a motor vehicle accident he had in 2002 he took Naprosyn and it helped, he said could not take that now because he was on a blood thinner.

                                                I had COVID in early December 2020.  I waited a few months to get the vaccine.  I was fine the day of the vaccine 16 MAR.  I took the next day off 17 MAR  because I was running a fever and and had body aches.  I did not have any alcohol on St Patty&#39;s day.  I pretty much slept the whole day.  I went back to work on 18 MAR and was feeling better with only a mild ever.  The night of 18 MAR I began to run a fever and had body aches.  The body aches worsened during the night I could not sleep.  The body aches became centralized in my upper back and shoulders,  My neck was hurting too.  I began to feel chest pains.  The chest pains increased in intensity.  I researched the symptom&#39;s which suggested I was having a heart attack.  I took some aspirin to try to alleviate the pain.   The pain continued and more severe so I drove myself to hospital. The staff  gave me an EKG and took blood samples for testing.  The EKG was normal.  The blood test came back with elevated levels of Troponin.  The Dr.  advised that the Troponin level indicated that I probably had a heart attack. the first hospital did not have a cardiac unit so I was transferred to  downtown location.  The staff there ran more test.  The EKG was again normal and the Troponin elevated so a Coronary angiography was conducted with catheter and dye.  The angiography was also normal with no sign of a heart attack the doctor said I probably had a reaction to the vaccine.  He suggested that I still get the second vaccine.  I did  get the second vaccine. After the second vaccine I only had fever and body aches, I pre0-gamed with aprin  and plenty of rest for the second vaccine.

                                                The day after receiving the shot i was very tired.  Slept part of the day.  I am a runner and was unable to run that day but could tell i was very winded even going up and down stairs.  The rest of the week was unable to run from being winded.  Then after a week was able to slowly get back to my normal routine.  I had a calcium score scheduled for 7:00 am on May 19th.  I was called into my doctors office to be given the results the next week because my calcium scan came back fine...but doing the scan they found a 3mm nodule on my lung.  I have never had any type of lung issues.  I do not know that this is related to the shot.  But because of how my lungs felt for a week after the shot, i feel this could be related.  I am not a smoker and never have been.  They say the majority of these type nodules are formed from inflamation or infection.  At the time they told me about the nodule they also did my yearly physical.  Since i know some are getting inflamation around the heart...i&#39;m curious if there can also be inflamation around the lungs which would have given me the nodule.  At this point..the doctor plans to do a ct scan in one year to see if the nodule has grown.   I felt like i should report this since this may not be discovered by many others unless they just happen to go from some type of scan of the lungs.

A 52-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0173 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 08May2021 at 02:38 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included Bug bite (happened 5 days prior to 30Apr2021 and regimen of an antibiotic). He was completely done with the rotation for a least 8 days before he got the vaccine. It might have something to do with this. concomitant medication included dicloxacillin (started it on 30Apr2021 and it was for 5 days. He did not know what it did was). The patient reported that on 08May2021, day one, he experienced, tiredness and injection site pain. On day 2, until now side effects which had not gone away. It hadn&#39;t gotten worse, but it was not any better. The patient felt like congestion, but his nose was bone dry, like crusty dry. It hurts a little bit because it was so dry and he had arm soreness, nothing out of the ordinary. The arm soreness was just normal injection stuff. At first it was a little tender on the injection spot. It went away after about a day. On 10May2021, the patient felt like there were little, tiny baby hands pinching his internal organs randomly throughout his abdomen. It was not a sharp pain, more like a little squeeze all through his abdomen. It felt like his whole throat was swollen. It was not visually swollen, it more felt like a football in his neck. Stretching it was helping. His toes have been locking up like a pre-clamping. He had numbness from his ankles to his feet for 8 days, and now he has numbness from his knees to his feet. It was not completely numb, but it was not normal. The feeling of baby hands pinching his internal organs started the second day after the vaccine and has stayed consistent. The patient&#39;s eyes swollen, and his vision was diminished. Day 2 through today, it felt like his eyes were swollen, his vision was seriously diminished, he had a golf ball sized welt on his arm not at the injection site but 2 inches from it, and he was really dizzy and really lightheaded and almost fainted at the corner store. The feeling like his eyes were swollen started on day 3 after the vaccine. The crease of his eye be-low the eyebrow and on top of the socket got red and puffy and looked like sunburnt skin does. It was at the point that now it feels swollen all the time almost like he had pink eye and his vision has been diminished about 30%. He had a test done yesterday and his vision was 20/25. Some-times he could not even read a text and had to stare at his phone for 10 minutes to make out words. He did not have these issues before. The feeling of his eyes being swollen was a little better in the mornings and about 1300 it gets worse when he gets lightheaded to where was when it started. His vision became diminished about day 3 after the vaccine. It was a little better in the morning, but in the afternoon, it goes to exactly the same as when it started. He noticed the golf ball sized welt on his arm about 3 days ago. The doctor seemed to think a drop of the injection might had travelled from the injection site and his body was creating a defense to it. It was scary to take a shower and then see that. It didn&#39;t hurt. It was not painful, but it was a weird foreign entity. The cramping in his toes started probably day 3 and was consistent. The numbness started on day 2 after the vaccine, and up until 3 days ago it was just his ankles and feet. 3 days ago, it got to the point where it was from his knees to his feet. It has gotten worse since it was now travelling up his legs. On his injection arm- 2 inches away from the injection site appeared a size of a gigantic golf ball - when asked with his doctor he said that he thinks that a drop of the vaccine travelled and his body building a reaction to it and it was very abnormal. The patient also had numbness from his ankle to his feet worsened and from his knees to his feet- almost feels like it was cold and tingly. The patient also had dizziness and lightheaded about day 2 after the vaccine and it was the same. It came in waves but was consistent throughout the day. He would be fine then had a wave of dizziness. He has been laying down so much because he was so tired, ringing ears, felt like his glands were swollen, pressure in his neck to his injection site, and back pains. The patient stated that his doctor was only form urgent care. The patient Felt like whole throat was swollen, toes locking up, really lightheaded, mind has been foggy, and arm soreness. The patient had bizarre side effects from the Covid Vaccine for 11 days now. He thought it was the smart thing to report them to Pfizer. He didn&#39;t like to give personal information. He declined to give his mailing address or his email address. He hated when asked for race, but he guessed it might be important. He did not have a mailing address, phone number, or email address handy for his physician. He went to Urgent Care yesterday to have it checked and they did an EKG and said he had to be sent by ambulance to the ER. The doctor did bloodwork, and she said everything looked alright and to rest a few more days and keep hydrated. The patient underwent the lab work and procedures which included chest X-ray with unspecified result. He thinks it was on 18May2021. His mind has been foggy with all of that. It was yesterday or the day before. He could not be sure. He has been sleeping so much and was in a complete daze. The fogginess he had the whole time as his other symptoms, and it was the same. He has been eating well and hydrating and taking a multivitamin and Gatorade, all the things&#39; people say to do. He asked if Pfizer has heard of this before. He was panicked it might be chronic, and he worries about the safety of the second shot for him. He was sure many people haven&#39;t reacted, but these are freaky side effects. He asked for advice and if Pfizer had heard of this before or if he was some weird anomaly. On his way to get the vaccine he asked 2 people at the city health line if they had taken it and they both said no. He asked 3 other patients and they said they took the Pfizer. One woman said she will take it when they make her. The guy who gave him the shot lied and said he wasn&#39;t eligible. It might have been his way of not having to discuss it. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior vaccination. The patient was tested for Covid post vaccination with Nasal Swab on 18May2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Device Date: 23May2021,Additional information has been requested.

A 52-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 15May2021 10:50 (Lot Number: EW0173; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included vasovagal reactions in high school. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Within 2 minutes of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine he started feeling like something was wrong. He pulled to the side in the parking garage and as soon as he stopped the car he passed out. He woke back up and was able to put the car in park and he passed out a second time. He woke up again and his foot was on the gas pedal and he tried to roll down the window. He was able to roll down the window but he wasn&#39;t able to get anyone&#39;s attention. He passed out a third time. When he woke up again he wasn&#39;t able to get the door open and he was nauseated. He basically had nausea, dizziness, and a definite lack of coordination. He just had sort of a feeling like being really drunk. He doesn&#39;t drink. He had very little strength but he was able to push his car horn. He was out of it. He could see someone in his car mirror a little ways behind his car and the horn didn&#39;t get the person&#39;s attention so he honked a second time and someone came to help him, maybe from the fire department and maybe some emergency medical technicians. He was placed on a golf cart or ATV to be transported downstairs to a waiting ambulance and while on the ride he vomited himself. He mentioned that the EMTs called it a vasovagal reaction. He was brought to the hospital in which he had a lot of tests done. He did not feel well at all and was not able to feel well enough to stand up. He had tests done at the hospital, a chest x-ray and his blood was drawn. He had a cardiac ultrasound later in the afternoon the next day on 16May2021. The doctor&#39;s didn&#39;t find anything wrong other than his cholesterol was high at 208. He was admitted to the hospital on 15May2021. He continued to have his blood drawn through the night and the next morning, on 16May2021, he had a CAT scan. For his cholesterol he was told to eat better and maybe follow up with a doctor in a couple months to check his cholesterol again. No one had any answers to the effect of what happened to him. Everything was fine, his tests were normal. He was told he had a vasovagal reaction. He&#39;s had vasovagal reactions before and he can tell this was much different than the vasovagal reactions he&#39;s had before. In the past when he&#39;s had vasovagal reactions the world went black like looking through a small circle, his vision got blacker and blacker and then he&#39;d pass out. He did not have this feeling with the Covid 19 vaccine. He can only describe this feeling that he had like an occasion in his past when he&#39;s drank to much and he&#39;s stumbling around. He may have passed out briefly to someone helping him move to a bed and his arms are weighted and he can&#39;t lift them and he&#39;s disoriented but still has a sense of what&#39;s going on but he feels like he could vomit at any second. He&#39;s comparing his experience to the Covid 19 vaccine to drinking to much alcohol and then falling asleep or passing out. He was pretty much out of it for 5 hours. Between the fourth and fifth hours after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine he was comfortable enough to stand on his own for brief moments. He was feeling better and was able to use the restroom. By the next day, around the 24 hour period after the vaccine he was feeling almost normal. He was released from the hospital the next day, 16May2021 at around 4:00PM. He was maybe in the hospital for about 27 to 28 hours. At the hospital he had all these tests and he was found to be healthy with no problems. He also had a Covid 19 virus test, he never asked what the results were but he&#39;s going under the assumption that if he was Covid 19 virus positive the hospital staff would have told him. Passing out, nausea, dizziness required a visit to Emergency Room. The outcome was unknown.

                                                On May 21st @ 10:25am, I received my 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute &#34;holding period&#34;, but the following morning, May 22nd @ ~09:00am, I was urinating blood and blood clots with very little urine evacuating.  Proceeded to the Urgent Care facility to which they immediately directed me to the ER.  Upon arrival, they had me give a urine sample which was blood red, and put me on a picc line and pushed fluids, then performed a CT and an ultrasound of my pelvic area.  During this time, my urge to urinate began to become very painful because my bladder was now fully blocked and I could only pass a small amount of blood clots.  They then had to install a large 3 way catheter to relieve the urine and allow the passing of the large blood clots coming from my hemorrhaging left kidney.  After being in the ER for ~8.5 hours, they released me with the catheter still installed with a mobile bag.  I stayed laid up for 2.5 days until Monday when all of the blood clots had passed and my urine had returned to a normal color.  They then removed the catheter and sent me on with medication to continue to take.  I have a follow up appointment, but I am still having restrictions when I urinate and now when I try to ejaculate, so I am very concerned that this has permanently injured me.  I have had ZERO issues in the past and consider myself a very healthy individual who works very hard to stay healthy.  I maintain a weight of 206-210 lbs @ 6&#39;1&#34; through a daily rigorous exercise program, diet, and supplements.  I don&#39;t smoke, do drugs, or drink excessively.   This event has cost me money for my deductible (because I don&#39;t use it), plus the costs of the copays, medications, and 1 day of missed work.  I have all of the paperwork from both the ER visit and Urology visits... Please advise what I can do to recoup my out of pocket costs for a vaccine that the Government has directed the population to receive.  You can reach me at this email.  Thank you.

A 52-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 23Apr2021 (lot number: EN0170), as 2nd dose, single dose, at age 52 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), administered in the left arm, on 24Mar2021 (lot number: EP6955), at age 52 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within four weeks of BNT162B2. On 23Apr2021, the patient received his second dose of BNT162B2. On 23Apr2021 at 19:30, the patient experienced injection pain/injection site extreme pain. The patient did not act on it because he knew the injection site may be sore for a week. On 24Apr2021, the injection site was hurting bad but again he did not act on it because he knew it may sore but it had been a whole month and it was concerning. The reporter stated that the pain was causing the patient&#39;s blood pressure to be elevated. The reporter noticed the blood pressure elevation about 2 weeks after the second injection in the morning time (May2021). The patient also experienced headache at the same time as when the patient&#39;s blood pressure was elevated around the morning time, about 2 weeks after the second injection (May2021). It was reported that the pain was so bad that the patient could not sleep at night within a week of the second injection (Apr2021), time of onset was reported as &#34;around 15:00 or 16:00 and as it goes over to the night 190:0 or 20:00, sometimes he is not going to sleep until 02:00 the next morning&#34;). The events required physician&#39;s office visit on an unspecified date (reported as &#34;the other day&#34;) and the reporter brought the events to the doctor&#39;s attention and stated that the patient was in pain throughout the day. The reporter was thinking of taking the patient to urgent care. Treatment for the event &#34;injection pain/injection site extreme pain&#34; and &#34;pain&#34; included heating pads, ice packs, lidocaine patches, unspecified cream and rubbing lotion to try and ease the pain. The reporter was thinking about Advil and asked every how many hours should the patient take the Advil. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

Once or twice a day when I stand up I get dizzy or wobbly feeling, sometimes it is bad enough I have to sit back down. I no longer sleep well. I used to just lay in one spot all night, barely making a dent in the covers. My dog slept in bed every night for over 7 years. But after vax, she stopped sleeping on bed and I wake up to a trashed bed and the covers all balled up on my head. How or what I eat has changed, I no longer like most of the stuff I always liked. I no longer feel right, just always feel off, tired and by the end of most days the noise in my ear is driving me insane. I have never experienced the ear noise or the getting dizzy ever in my entire life until the Govt stuck poison in my arm.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

                                                I ate nothing that morning of the shot. The first day:  I took the covid-19 vaccine Pfizer shot on Thursday the 4th of March; there was pain at the injection site just as any other vaccine I have been administered during military service.  After the shot I felt tied, and my left arm did hurt from the shot, I started to feel irritable (angry or even aggressive), my chest became tight and my heart rhyme felt somewhat off causing me to start coughing and sometimes uncontrollable to the point I could not catch my breath I thought about seeking medical attention but did not..  The second day:  Pain in my left arm went away at the injection site, tiredness went away, and the feeling of irritable (angry or even aggressiveness) went away, tightness in my chest and coughing went away. I have been having a chronic pain in my left arm for about a year and after the shot the pain was gone I noticed that on the second day. I did notice my body temperature was up and down showing symptoms of histamine reaction but not out of control.

The next day (3/7) the right side of my face was numb and showing symptoms of what doctors later decided was Bells Palsy. on 3/7 I had fatigue and general feeling bad like I had the flu. On Monday 3/8, I was feeling worse and I called the advice nurse who advised I go to the  Emergency room due to right face partial paralysis, numbness, and face drooping. They diagnosed Bells Palsy and prescribed Valtrex and prednosone. From 3/9-12 the right side of my face was numb, droopy and I had ear pain and a lot of fatigue. By Saturday 3/13 I was feeling better and have gradually gotten better through today 3/26. I still have numbness in my right cheek. and occasional tingling in my lips. My doctor has advised me to go ahead and get the second dose of vaccine tomorrow 3/27. Also, during the week of 3/7 - 3/12 I had some dizziness and a general foggy feeling in my head.

The anxiety continued till 7:00PM.   With this event, do I still have to obtain the second dose after 21 days?

Slower heartbeat then what I normally run. 2. Slower breathing and respiratory response 3. Very low energy 4. Loss of appetite 5. Abnormally wide fluctuation of blood pressure while not exerting myself. For example, higher blood pressure readings (155/95) with a slower pulse (60). 6. Difficulty relaxing and sleeping

Then I started to have lower back pain on Saturday (April 10), but I was still mobile,  and was able to perform daily activities.  However, on Sunday morning (April 11th), my lower back pain became better, but I started having very severe pain on my left thigh.  The pain scale is 10 out 10, and I was unable to move around.  I could feel the muscles around the nerve were twitching and cramping, and this gave me such an excruciating pain, and felt like the nerve was squeezed by the thigh muscles.  Because of this severe pain, I was not able to mobilize at all on Sunday, then had to go see physician on Monday urgently.  The physician was puzzled why I devel

Ten days after the shot it was like someone flipped a switch and suddenly the tinnitus was a lot louder, to the point where it is always audible, even over other noise, and does interfere with sleep and concentration.

                                                Two week later, approximately, I started having real bad headaches. I was having them at least 5 times a week. I called my doctor. The headache would last 15 or 20 minutes and then it would go away. Sometimes the pain would wake me up. The headache pain had gone away before I saw the neurologist (the last week of March - maybe the 29th); the doctor had referred me to see a neurologist and they gave me a medication to take: Topiramate. It was a 60 day supply and I&#39;m still currently using it. I have a follow up appt to follow up with neurologist on May 3rd. I&#39;ve not had the headache symptoms. I had the second dose of the vaccine on January 7th, 2021.

A 53-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0151) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 09Apr2021 12:30 at age of 53-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high cholesterol, anxiety disorder, known allergies: Clonazepam (KLONOPIN), food allergies: sea bass and orange roughy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; lovastatin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; ibuprofen taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, lot number EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 18Mar2021 11:00 AM at age of 53-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was currently 11 days out from receiving his second COVID vaccine and he was still having very strong side effects. This included an emergency room visit on 16Apr2021. He was generally very good health and he exercised regularly including running so these were very abnormal effects for him. Beginning one day after receiving his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19: 1. Strong chest pressure and fluctuating heartbeat. 2. Slower breathing and respiratory response. 3. Extreme fatigue &amp; very low energy (for example, walking up two flights of stairs made him very tired and spikes his heart rate, abnormal for him). 4. Loss of appetite and loss of weight. 5. Abnormally wide fluctuation of blood pressure while not exerting himself. For example, higher blood pressure readings (155/95) with a slower pulse (60) or the opposite scenario, (110/89) elevated pulse 98. 6. Difficulty relaxing and sleeping. 7. Nausea and some dizziness. 8. Stomach pain and diarrhea. 9. Headaches. 10. Low grade fever. As of 26Apr2021, it stated the day after the patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination (10Apr2021 12:00 PM), he began to have side effects which he expected to some extent. However, as of today, he has 17 days straight of side effects or perhaps an adverse event. His symptoms began mildly the day after but suddenly increased greatly within the next couple days and he had been dealing with this ever since. He had made two emergency room visits, seen his general practitioner, and as of today (26Apr2021) a cardiologist who ordered imaging. His symptoms range from, extreme fatigue, nausea, strong stomach and intestinal discomfort, weight loss, shortness of breath, sudden increased heart rates and high blood pressure readings, intense chest pressure and some pain, powerful involuntary shaking of my body that comes in waves, and pressure and pain in the back of his head at the cerebellum. His life was basically come to a screeching halt and he was searching for answers! The doctors he had spoken to were unclear as to what was wrong with him and why. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment received for the events. COVID tested post vaccination on 17Apr2021 included PCR and Nasal Swab, both showed negative result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I had Covid-19 back in December 2020. On the 10th day I ended up in the hospital for 3 days due to the start of Covid pneumonia. It took me two months to finally feel 100%. I had my 2nd vaccination shot on Friday 5/7/21, I was sick Saturday with a fever of 101.5 and joint pain in fingers, hands and knees and slept all day.  The adverse event happened on Sunday. I was still very tired during the day but no fever and felt like I was in a fog. Sunday evening went to bed at 9:30pm woke up at 11:30pm with uncontrollable body tremors. The tremors were muscular twitches from my neck to my feet. Everything was twitching at once. My fiance took my temperature and it was 97.5 so no fever when it started but after 45 minutes of tremors I started burning up, she took my temp again and it was 103.5. She wanted to call 911 or take me to the emergency room but I didn&#39;t want to go at that point. I took a baby aspirin thinking about possible blood clots and then 30 minutes later took 2 Tylenol to bring down the fever. The tremors finally stopped and the fever went down to 101. It took me a while to fall asleep and the next morning I woke up still tired and called out of work and slept all day again.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 53-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203; expiration date: Jun2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 18:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing lyme disease. There were no concomitant medications. The patient went through post- vaccination especially because he has Lyme disease. He has had this pre-existing autoimmune disease for 8, almost 9 years, he wants to add this information to the database. Caller states the first shot he would say was kind of catastrophic, the second shot, he will go into. Caller states the second shot, he showed up at the military vaccination place locally and they actually declined his ability to get it with them because of his first reaction even though he had the go ahead from his Lyme specialist and primary doctors. Caller states because of this, he went after four weeks instead of three and he went to a high risk clinic to protect him from anaphylaxis. He has received both doses, the first dose was horrendous and the second was quite easy. Caller states no reaction whatsoever with the second, though he still has remaining symptoms. Reporter Details: Caller states his legal name is (Name), he goes by (Name). Caller states he would prefer if company contacted him and also so that maybe they can warn people with autoimmune or Lyme that the first one is going to be kind of rough. Caller states he works with the public. Prescribing Healthcare Professional: Caller states unsure of email address. Caller states the only thing missing off the initial story is that all in all, the second shot was really good. Caller states he does have some very lingering issues still that he is going to be seeing the Lyme specialist about. Caller states the first dose, it&#39;s pretty intense. Caller states the second one, he had fatigue and neuropathy from the stupid autoimmune stuff. Caller states there is residual symptoms, but nothing like the initial ones. Caller states what he did was he just jotted some notes down about every third or fourth day up until the second shot just to detail each symptom. Caller states he only wrote about 5 days worth of little sentences. Caller states 27Feb2021, the first dose, it was a Saturday so by Monday 29Feb2021, it started with itching, burning rashes, so like a visible rash on his chest with raised bumps, neuropathy- shooting pains in his fingers and toes that feels like bugs are crawling all over him, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. Caller verifies all of these symptoms actually began on 01Mar2021. Itching, burning rashes: Caller states he would say they lasted about 2-3 weeks because he went to the walk-in to have them check and called his primary doctor and went into his primary and had him check. Caller states it ended sometime in Mar2021 and he has recovered completely. Neuropathy: Shooting pains in his fingers and toes: Caller verifies it began 01Mar2021. Caller states he would say he still has about 20% left. Caller states it is hard to sleep at night because he still gets itching and burning and stuff. Caller states it is persisting, but certainly not as bad. Headache: Caller verifies it started 01Mar2021. Caller states it ended Mar2021 and has recovered completely. Fatigue: Caller states began 01Mar2021. Caller states this is one of the bad ones he would say. Caller states he still, he would like to go for a walk or work out and he barely has the amount of energy to work let alone the others. Caller states he can&#39;t workout or walk. Caller states if he goes up and down stairs, he&#39;s exhausted. Caller states that&#39;s definitely a lasting one. Caller verifies it is ongoing, persisting. Dizziness: Caller verifies it began on 01Mar2021 and is ongoing. Caller states when he walks he literally cannot turn his head quickly or he feels like he&#39;s going to throw up or pass out. Caller verifies it is persisting. Caller states he would say about 4 or 5 days later from getting the first shot, this was really interestingly weird, he had mouth sores that wouldn&#39;t heal and debilitating malaise and fatigue. Caller states malaise so bad he couldn&#39;t get through work, he could barely work. Caller states the mouth sores were so weird. Caller states everything he is telling company he has read about online. Caller states he has had canker sores from low immunity, but this was on the tip of his tongue, either side of the tongue tip, it came and went three or four times through the entire month. Caller states it was like his immune system was on the edge of crashing, then he would sleep a lot more. Caller states he would do whatever he could do to make it come back. Caller verifies this debilitating fatigue is different than overall fatigue that began 01Mar2021. Caller states the debilitating malaise began 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. Debilitating Fatigue; Debilitating Malaise: Caller states the debilitating fatigue also began 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. Caller states it is acute. Caller states ended sometime in Mar2021. Caller states recovered completely but is still left with some fatigue. Caller states recovered with lasting effects maybe. Caller says the other one, he could barely get up, he could barely work, he literally couldn&#39;t function. Caller states the overall fatigue has not left, it&#39;s ongoing. Mouth sores that won&#39;t heal: Caller states began around 004Mar2021 or 05Mar2021 and stopped sometime in Apr2021, it took about a month. Caller states he recovered completely. Caller states he just wrote what happened down about every 2 days up until 14Mar2021. Joint Pain: Caller states literally every single joint in his body was killing him and felt inflamed. Caller states it began around 03Mar2021 or 04Mar2021. Caller states joint pain is ongoing, but has improved. Air Hunger, shortness of breath upon exertion: Caller states if he went up and down a few stairs, he would breathe almost as if he was having an asthma attack, it was shortness of breath upon exertion and started about four days after. Caller states it began around 05Mar2021. Caller states he actually had it this morning, felt like he just walked up a flight of stairs. Caller states he is very physically fit, so that should not happen. Caller states it&#39;s ongoing and has improved. Numb Extremities: Caller states a week later from 01Mar2021 he had numb extremities. Caller states he started being very aware of the fact that his fingers and toes were starting to lose feelings on 08Mar2021. Caller states it resolved within a week on 15Mar2021. Caller states it was a weird sensation that happened for a while but is completely resolved now. Body Temperature Regulation Issues: Caller states two days later, he had body temperature regulation issues. Caller states he was cold when he should have been hot and hot when he should have been cold. Caller states began around 03Mar2021/04Mar2021 and is ongoing, but not terrible, it&#39;s probably the least of the issues and has improved. Heart was pounding out of his chest; face was flushed: Caller states a day or two later, his heart was pounding out of his chest and his face was flushed to the point where people were asking if he was okay. Caller states he felt like he got a quick burst of a run and then stood still. His face was visibly red and very aware of his heart beating out of his chest and this is with no exertion. Caller states he was laying on the couch and he could feel his face flush while doing nothing basically. Caller states began 02 or 03Mar2021 and just stopped a week ago around 12Apr2021. He recovered completely, for now, it seems. Caller states he went to (Clinic name) on (Address), he doesn&#39;t have the doctors name, it was a walk-in. Caller states they literally said no big deal, it&#39;s all side effects of the vaccine, they just said he&#39;s fine. Caller states they simply recommended anti-inflammatories, Tylenol, which was smart and he wishes he thought about it. They also recommended Benadryl to stop the reaction. Caller states it was very helpful, the Benadryl really helped a lot. Caller states there was also a good amount of insomnia because of all the symptoms, it would be close to impossible to sleep. Insomnia: Caller states it seemed to get worse, started a week later because it  was getting disconcerting to him so he couldn&#39;t sleep. Caller states it started 08Mar2021 and have had that on and off with Lyme. Caller states has struggled for years, is ongoing and is persisting. Caller states on 14Mar2021, he couldn&#39;t sleep, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, completely weak and dizzy, his left leg and quad was spasming like when he had Lyme&#39;s, left knee itches, tingles, and burns and that&#39;s where he got bit by the tick and that&#39;s when he had his symptoms when he was acute. Caller states it resolved within 3 weeks after the initial onset of the shot. Caller states when he had Lyme initially, that&#39;s what he experienced, his left knee swelled, burned and itched, his left knee cap. Caller states ended 17Apr2021. Caller states its a situation where some of those are still there because of Lyme and some are gone. Caller states the knee cap stuff and can&#39;t get out of bed was gone on 17Apr2021. Caller states he has recovered completely. Caller states he still is weak and dizzy and his left leg and quad are still spasming, but it&#39;s better and is improved. Caller states on 20Mar2021, his left knee cap hurt, was twitching and tight, his left toe was numb, felt like something is chewing on his toe with a sensation of worms under the skin and sleep disturbances. Caller verifies the sensation of worms under the skin and something chewing on his toe is all related to neuropathy, which is still there. Caller states he had written down that on 20Mar2021, he was supposed to get his second shot at 1800, but was denied due to side effects he was experiencing and was rescheduled for 31Mar2021 at a local high-risk clinic. Caller states on 22Mar2021, he slept good, but was fairly weak all day. caller states he took a shower mid-afternoon, and couldn&#39;t get off the couch. Caller states basically all he did was take a shower and threw himself on the cough the whole day. Caller states he has written that he has the sensation of ants crawling over the top of his back, no desires to go outside, and light sensitivity. Caller verifies the ants crawling over the top of his back was also neuropathy, and he recovered completely within 3 weeks. Light Sensitivity: Caller states throughout the whole thing, had it today and is still ongoing and persisting. Caller states began sometime in Mar2021, its been the whole time. Caller states 28Mar2021, he only slept 6 hours and woke up completely fatigued, could not get out of bed until 2:00 in the afternoon, has a complete loss of appetite, had a drink and 2 eggs and laid down, couldn&#39;t move until 1930. Caller states got up, had a nutrition shake, he wasn&#39;t desiring solid foods whatsoever, had 100% malaise, fatigue, no appetite, and was dizzy. Loss of appetite: Caller states he has lost 7 pounds since the first shot. Caller states he wasn&#39;t really interested in eating. Caller states he has a natural desire to eat and nothing sounded good. Caller states started Mar2021, is ongoing, and has improved. Caller states 31Mar2021, he got the second shot, he had a little bit of irritation, tingling and burning at site and definitely a flushed face throughout the day, almost like a sunburn. Caller states he was joking with clients and said the first shot killed him and the second shot cured him. caller states after the second shot, he is 80% better but can list the remaining symptoms. Caller states what he is left with is fatigue, he does not have any energy to do anything other than work, sleep issues, neuropathy, and dizziness. Dizziness: Caller states the dizziness has been consistent and goes with the sleeplessness, ongoing since Mar2021 and is persisting. Irritation, tingling, and burning at injection site: Caller verifies the irritation, tingling, and burning is at the injection site of the second dose. Caller states it happened within a few hours on 31Mar2021 and resolved within a week on or around 07Apr2021. Covid Vaccine: First Dose: Caller verifies he received the injection in his left arm around 1800. Caller unsure of NDC. Covid Vaccine: Second Dose: Caller verifies he received the second dose on 31 Mar2021. LOT: ER8730, Expiry Date: They didn&#39;t write that down so caller unsure. NDC: Caller unsure of NDC. Caller unsure of dosage given. Caller states was given via injection in his right arm around 1300 or 1330. Covid Vaccine: Indication: Caller states first off he owns a business, he did it to be responsible to the public. Caller states he wants his business to appear as safe and compliant as possible. Caller states he definitely was afraid because of the Lyme disease. Concomitant Products: Caller states he made sure he did nothing before purposefully. Test Results: Caller states after the first shot, he went to (Name) family physician, they did a lot of blood work trying to make sure his inflammatory markers weren&#39;t going up, to make sure he wouldn&#39;t have issues. Caller states the good news was he was great, everything looked normal, there was nothing crazy in the blood work. Caller states they though the shots would have triggered an autoimmune response of Lyme. Muscle/Joint: He reports a bit of muscular/joint pain in the area where the shot is, if he goes to reach  The outcome of the event &#34;itching, burning rashes, like a visible rash on his chest with raised bumps&#34;, &#34;headache&#34;, &#34;can&#39;t workout or walk&#34;, &#34;exhausted&#34;, &#34;immune system was on the edge of crashing&#34;, &#34;immune system was on the edge of crashing&#34;, &#34;face was visibly red&#34; was resolved in Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;debilitating malaise&#34; was resolved with Sequel in Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;Numb Extremities&#34; was resolved in 15Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;mouth sores&#34; was resolved in Apr2021, the outcome of the event &#34;face was flushed&#34; was resolved in 12Apr2021; the outcome of the event &#34;couldn&#39;t get out of bed&#34; &#34;left knee itches, tingles, and burns&#34; was resolved in 17Apr2021, the outcome of the event Back disorder was unknown, the outcome of the event &#34;complete loss of appetite&#34;, &#34;Joint Pain&#34;, &#34;Body Temperature Regulation Issues&#34;, &#34;barely has the amount of energy to work let alone the others/Weak&#34; was resolving, the outcome of the other events was not resolved.

But after getting the 2nd shot, about a week ago from yesterday, he experienced double vision for about 15 minutes. When he got the 1st shot, the Monday after, he experienced the worst headache of his life worse than any hang over. He never had neurological issues and it terrified him because could not shake it right away, it lasted for about 15 minutes then it was gone.

First it is started in my left ear after few days of the first doze then the right ear. It started real bad after the second injection. Presently, the clogging ear state has diminished but the buzzing, hissing and cricket alike sounds yet present. This pulsatile emerging sounds of perhaps tinnitus,  disrupts my personal life and to concentrate me at work.

When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn&#39;t breathe, and his mind was racing. The patient&#39;s other brother went to him and he was not responsive, and he passed away on 06Jan2021 around 10:15 AM. It was reported that none of the symptoms occurred until the patient received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting as aforementioned.

I was diagnosed with colitis in the ER and was admitted for several days for treatment due to the severe blood coming out.  CT scan showed severe inflammation, and stool sample showed blood and lactoferrin marker high.  I was given many antibiotics and fluids and was released home on February 14th, 2021.  I am still receiving treatment with oral antibiotics, and appointments with my physician.  I had to be absent from work for over 7 days.

                                                Within approximately a couple of days from the first of two COVID19 Pfizer injections, I developed a progressive, systemic, neuro/neuro-muscular inflammatory pain response.  The inflammation and pain first manifested in my left wrist and hand, greatly worsening recent symptomology that may have been the start of a carpal tunnel syndrome.  The inflammation and pain then progressed to my right wrist and hand and right shoulder.  Then they progressed to my left shoulder, under my clavicles, my hips,  and my upper lumbar/lower thoracic region of my spine.  Muscle groups tightened and hurt, chief among them my hamstrings and upper back.  All within days.  The inflammation and pain were severe, especially from the early a.m. (3 or 4 in the a.m.) to waking hours.  And the conditions left me nearly debilitated and incapable of sleeping well or performing many ADLs.  Then, on Monday, March 29, 2021, I saw an orthopaedic for the pains in my wrists and hands, and he prescribed me a steroid for a preliminary diagnose of bilateral carpal tunnel.  The inflammation and pain throughout my body decreased considerably after only two doses of the steroids.  That led me to seek a consultation with the rheumatologist.

I started taking Tylenol and stayed home from work. It has persisted over the past 4 days but I started to feel better yesterday.

                                                I started feeling drugged about 2 hours after the shot. I then experienced extreme fatigue and felt unwell / sick for 6 days.  My joints were extremely sore in my back, ankles and wrists.  My body felt heavy and it was hard to stand and walk. It felt as if I was losing circulation in my feet. By 5PM each day I was in bed passing out for about 2 hours each day. Most of each day on couch sick. On day 5, I broke out in hives on my face.  All symptoms began to clear on day 7. I was almost feeling normal Apr 28. Today, Apr 29 I feel OK.

HOWEVER, during this time I developed bilateral, persistent high-pitch tinnitus. This problem is significant enough to affect sleep and concentration. The tinnitus remains persistent three weeks later.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 24Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 54 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cholesterol. The patient was diagnosed with BPH a few years back 2016 or 2017 and had a uralist in 2019 and that resolved his issues. The patient had been on no BPH meds and back to normal since that procedure. Co-suspect medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) from an unknown date to 01Apr2021 at 40 mg, 1x/day for blood cholesterol. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced prostate infections, and abdominal discomfort. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced arm pain, and was lightheaded. He described the arm pain as he had deltoid pain but he also had pain like he had been hit from his right pectoral down his arm to about 4-5 inches above his wrist. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, sweat, urinating blood, and dark colored urine. The patient was concerned with the dark urine so he stopped taking atorvastatin, and called his physician who said he didn&#39;t need it anyhow. The patient visited the urologist office and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) as treatment for dark colored urine, urinating blood and prostate infection. On 06Apr2021, the patient experienced leukocytes in urine. Relevant lab data on 06Apr2021 included a urinalysis which resulted in leukocytes and blood &#43;3. The action taken in response to the event dark urine with atorvastatin was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events prostate infection, and abdominal discomfort was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events arm pain, and lightheaded was recovered in 26Mar2021. The outcome of the events couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, and sweat was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of the events urinating blood and dark colored urine was recovered on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the event leukocytes in urine was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the serious events Prostate infection, Blood in urine, and Urine color abnormal are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drugs. Relevant medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may provide a plausible explanation for the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021450744 same patient/SD, different AE/dose

The tinnitus is extremely loud 24/7 making my days feel like I have PTSD and my nights difficult to sleep. I need music, TV, or white noise on 24/7. The elevated level of tinnitus has not subsided since it ramped up.

                                                After the 15 minute  post shot waiting period patient said  he felt &#34;confused&#34; with clammy hands.  He sat in the chair and was slow to talk.  I asked him if he was diabetic, and he responded that he was, but he never feels this way and had eaten before coming in.  After talking a while longer, I was going to ask him if he&#39;d like us to check his sugar, he asked me if we had a blood pressure cuff.  I said we did, but he wanted to use the machine in front of the store because he felt well enough to get up and wanted to walk.   I walked to the machine with him.  He sat and answered the many questions tapping on screen with no issues at all.  The confusion was not evident.  The maching reported 111/68 or very close, with a pulse of 48.  He said, &#34;that&#39;s the issue, my pulse is down.  I need to walk around.&#34; I said he could stay back at the pharmacy where we could see him, or we could call someone for him.  He said staying back here would not help his pulse. I told him there was no hurry, he&#39;d been here for his 15 minutes, but we could keep an eye on him or help him and call whatever he needed.  He said no, he&#39;d be fine, he just needed to walk around.  He now had  pressure in his head, not really a headache just pressure, he said it was all related to his pulse. He said if he needed help later he could always go to an Urgent Care, I offered again to call anywhere for him or call for assistance, he was not interested.

A 54-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 22Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0162; Expiration Date: Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included gabapentin (GABAPENTIN) taken for neuropathy peripheral, start and stop date were not reported.  Patient stated that after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 22Apr2021, he has been terribly sick, he feel like his dying. He had nausea, lethargy, body ache, critical sadness like never before, fatigue (he was tired all the time and cannot get off the couch) and it was not going away on 23Apr2021. He had seen three doctors, tested negative to Covid-19 and his blood tests were normal. He had flu like symptoms for 13 days since 23Apr2021, and it never goes away. The symptoms seem to get better and then he exercises a lot and they come back. Patient has been nauseated, had extreme lethargy, sadness and depression, and body aches. The patient was on a plethora of medications now because of this. He wanted to know what does it say about his immune system? He was scared that he was dying, it feels like he&#39;s dying. He has worn two masks and not socialized at all and does not understand what has happened, he has done everything right. His inflammatory response was checked on 04May2021 which has not come back yet. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: normal on 06May2021, body height: 175 cm on 06May2021, platelet count: normal on 04May2021, red blood cell count: normal   on 04May2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 04May2021, weight: 195-200 on 06May2021. He wanted to know when will these side effects go away and he will start getting better, and asked if he should get the second dose. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

It was reported that 2 days after the vaccination (24May2021 08:00), the patient&#39;s vision was disrupted when he would move his head. He saw almost what you would call double vision whenever he moved his head, like while driving or looking from one side to the other. He couldn&#39;t drive for about 3 days because the movement of one car would look like 2 cars. This didn&#39;t happen when head was still and looking straight. His equilibrium was totally off, his head felt wobbly, his head was in a fog type haze for about 2 weeks. The feeling was scary. He mentioned that he did have covid Nov2020. He added that he made phone call to his doctor and they said to give it 2 weeks before coming in which is exactly when symptoms started to subside but still feel a little off. The patient did not received treatment for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Was sleeping 12 plus hours a day without feeling rested in the least. No problems with sleep. Also had heaviness of chest - felt like rib cage made of iron- this dissipated by the 28-29th. No excessive cough or fever, did have dyspnea with any exertion and this continues but seems to be lessening. Was not able to work due to fatigue. Yesterday remained tired but felt noticeably different-felt lighter-and today seems promising.

I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

The first dose of the vaccine, the pain started the second day and the injection site got swollen. But this second dose was within 2 hours of my vaccine even more and overwhelming fatigue.  - aches, chills, muscle cramps, coughing, sweating - those lasted three days; headache - ever present and felt like head was in a vice; breathing was an issue - asthma was triggered on Sunday  - I started prednisone  - informal dr consultation with a friend - on Tuesday because of the asthma and by Friday I was feeling halfway better again and by the following Sunday about 75% better. 9 days later I was back at work. It took that week back at work though to get back out of the funk and by the following weekend I was close to 90%. Pain in the shoulder lasted about two weeks - it was quite tender for that long.

It stopped in the evening but got constant low headaches afterwards. Around 5pm, felt like a change in taste (saltier taste) that was temporary. Has uncomfortable wrist pain like twisting a screwdriver too much. Started feeling itchy today after 9 am. Face was swollen after waking up today and has subsided greatly since. Had very low fever last night and now feels like no fever. Right now, feeling has a lot of saliva and then have to swallow and little uncomfortable in arms and knees, and weakness. Only took one Aleve pill last night. Around 4:30pm, felt a little blurry for 5 to 10 seconds.

I opened my eyes and I was still seeing the scary faces that were scaring me and causing me to yell and move around in bed while asleep. I girlfriend said I was yelling and moving around a lot prior to waking up. Once awake, I was still seeing the visions for about 2 minutes until I turned on the light and my eyes adjusted to the brightness. When I turned the light off and tried to go back to sleep, the faces appeared again. I was not able to go back to sleep and ended up getting out of bed and going out on the couch to watch TV to avoid being in the darkness and closing my eyes. I&#39;m not one to dream very often and this was certainly and vividly scary night.

On coming into work this morning he feels like he is having a manic episode from his depression.  Arthritis is feeling better after the injection.  His manic episode consists of being overly active.   He has notified his doctor and they told him to call the pharmacy which gave him our number.   About 5 years ago he had a hyperactive thyroid disorder and is in remission from that.

                                                I received the vaccine about two - three inches from the center of the muscle and in back of center - it was more in back of deltoid than the front of my deltoid. When I first got the shot, I had a burning sensation from the site of needle to back of neck to behind my ear area. It felt like a burning aching feeling. My ear felt like it was clogged up and aching. I told the medical site about it and the doctor on site said that more likely they hit a nerve. My blood pressure was very elevated. They had me stay to be observed for 45 minutes. I went back to work. I still felt it at night. The next day, I started feeling up my neck and my collarbone and my left side of my face and my head - my face felt tight and my lip felt numb on the left side and I had a slight confusion too. I went to Emergency room. They did CAT Scan and exam. After that, I noticed it was going all the way down my arm, all the left side of my body to toes. It felt like numbness - like neuropathy type feeling. It felt like constant pain. I went to the Urgent Care and they gave me Prednisone steroid (5 days of it) 5 mg to help with inflammation.  I took that for the five days. I started noticing a little black bruising on my body. After that,  I went to the Urgent Care again and they gave me Naproxen  and and Dr gave me more Naproxen to take.  He took bloodwork, too. I went to the ER and I was still feeling sick and hot. They said it was anxiety. I am still going through it - I feel it on the spot where I got the shot - and on my neck and on my head and on my left eye and down on my legs a lot - some days are worse than others but not as bad as when I had the first symptoms.

Also just not feeling like myself. Lack of concentration,  agitated, general fatigue.  Hand and feet tingling has been worse and night and causing interrupted sleep.

                                                I had pain at injection site, mild night sweats, and increased tinnitus (I have had tinnitus for many years) the night of / after the first and second shots (03/26/21 and 04/16/21)  After the second shot, I had less pain at the injection site, mild body aches, and increased tinnitus the night of the second injection.  However, the real reason I am reporting this is because after the second dose, the increased tinnitus continued intermittent, usually in the evenings. The tinnitus became especially pronounced on day 2 or 3, 4,  5 and day 8 - the ringing became so loud on the evening of day 2 that it seemed I was having trouble hearing the television. And on the evening of day 8 after the second dose, the tinnitus again became quite loud, with the additional symptom that external noises were annoying / irritated me.  I have had constant tinnitus for at least 20 years, and it almost never bothers me (or is even noticeable.) However, the tinnitus symptoms after the second Pfizer shot were pronounced enough that I thought I would report it. Of course, I can&#39;t be sure the tinnitus symptoms - especially those at days 4, 5 and 8 - are indeed side effects of the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, but since I had increased tinnitus symptoms the night after both the first and second Pfizer doses, it would seem to me to probably not be a coincidence.

A 55 year old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, age at vaccination 55 years old. Medical history included Diabetic from 2013 (Diabetes is fairly under control. He has no super high readings. His diet is better); blood pressure (blood pressure abnormal) from 2013; ongoing overweight (obviously he is overweight) from an unknown date; and heart (disorder) from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for an unspecified indication; lisinopril for blood pressure (abnormal); and lovastatin for heart (disorder), start and stop dates were not reported. Patient is taking an unspecified over the counter multivitamin. There were no other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient is due for the second dose on 9April2021, but he tested positive for COVID-19 on 01Apr2021 with a PCR test described as oral saliva test. Patient was negative on a rapid test on an unspecified date. Patient wanted to know if he could reschedule the shot and when is it recommended. The patient had a coworker who tested positive, he decided since his throat was scratchy that maybe he had got it, then two more employees had gotten COVID-19 so he got a rapid test that was negative. On Mar2021, he stated he stayed home because he was experiencing mild congested in his head/congested in his head, which it still actually was, and he lost sense of smell completely. He was really tired, sleeping a lot, had congestion in his ears, and he can&#39;t smell anything. Patient had no fever, and his lungs were clear (unspecified date), so he commented it was deceiving since he feels fine like he can do whatever he wants, then he gets exhausted and sleeps. He stated he can&#39;t work for a whole week. He stated he is assuming his first dose of the shot is helping with it. Patient stated he is doing well, he has it (COVID-19), but he feels pretty good. Outcome of congested in his head was not recovered, while unknown for the other events.

Volume fluctuates. Sounds like crickets or an electronic hum/buzz sound. Very disturbing and it&#39;s hard to concentrate and hard to sleep. The research I&#39;ve done indicates this is Tinnitus.

Soreness at the site of injection on my right arm starting several hours after, (Friday), and lasting through two days (Sunday).  Took a Tylenol a day. Extreme lethargy/tiredness for several days, and somewhat &#34;off&#34;, the first day being the worst. Wasn&#39;t really &#34;myself&#34; again until about Tuesday (fourth day). &#34;Off&#34; meaning tired and not 100% clear-thinking. Worst on Saturday and gradually better each day after.

A 55-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number, Expiration date, NDC and UPC number was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jun2021 at 11:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 55-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Regarding lot number patient stated that it looks like EW, patient thought he was not sure if it was 6185 or 0185, not sure it looks like 0 but it looks like 6 too but patient think it was 0. The patient medical history included shortness of breath, sleep apnea and kidney disease (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient sees a doctor for lot of conditions one was for shortness of breath and sleep apnea and sees a neurologist for Bph. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. Patient explained he was reluctant from getting vaccinated and nervous before the shot. On 06Jun2021, after patient took the shot, probably around 11:30 in the morning, patient was same, soon after 5 min maybe more, patient got a sensation on the left side of his tongue 5-10 mins, then  kind of a weird taste came to his mouth, patient started to get a little dizzy, a little light headedness, weakness in his chest and both his arms, got shortness of breath but had been seeing a doctor for shortness of breath prior taking the Covid shot and had kind of reluctant of taking the shot but some other issues going on side,  patient decided to take it, a couple of hours after the shot, patient had a headache, had the diarrhea. Patient described the weird taste like having a penny in his mouth. Patient explained he consulted a doctor on that Monday (07Jun2021), who said she encountered patients who also had the sensation on their tongues following vaccination, and that it was normal. Today (08Jun2021) patient had feeling just a little bit of nausea and patient kind a feel like a little brain fog, it was just his head doesn&#39;t feel right, the major concern was says some things risks factors and some of them had severe reactions, patient had a reaction difficulty in breathing, dizziness and feel little bit weakness, patient kind of a felt like his throat was going to close and he won&#39;t say he had any difficulty in swallowing, but it was not normal. Patient developed symptoms which spooked and scared him. Patient did not have his lab test but was constantly going to patient had just had right heart catheter right two weeks ago, you know last for him, patient was supposed to take another lab test to conduct at the end of the month for cholesterol, but patient saw neurologist for kidney disease. Events did not improve, patient just had this brain fog you know. Patient had to call a doctor after he got home, they did not prescribe him anything, patient mean he did bunch of appointment with doctor with the phone as soon as he got home from taken a Covid shot he was little worried. Patient stated he was concerned about getting the second dose of vaccine scheduled on 27Jun2021. Patient stated he will not be able to consult his doctor before the vaccination appointment and was not able to get further assistance from a pharmacist. Patient repeated he does not know what to do about the second dose. Patient was kind of reluctant taking the next shot, if he was going to feel the something like this again, he don&#39;t want to, as he already had uneasy you know just had and patient did not had difficulty in breathing all of time this comes and go,  from the sentence he described it says on pamphlet that there was severe reaction to the shot and don&#39;t want to take the second shot and then end up in hospital because patient had more from it so his question was he was afraid to take the second shot. Patient don&#39;t had answer to that he means he would like to talk to somebody who can give him information kind of help me to relax little bit if it was normal and in in response it was responded that decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by the company. Patient was referred to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection, as healthcare provider knows his health situation and had access to information that can better help inform this decision. The outcome of brain fog was not recovered and outcome for other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number is requested.

A 55-years -old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: ER8732), via an unspecified route of administration as single dose on 08Apr2021 at 19:00 into left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pancreatitis. The concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had no other vaccinations the same day as his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine or in the four weeks prior. On 8Apr2021, patient experienced arm soreness. On 19Apr2021, patient COVID-19 PCR test was positive. Patient stated that he was diagnosed 34 years ago, he has been battling it since then and has numerous surgeries and numerous things since. He had symptoms starting Friday. He says this Friday will have been 7 days, on the 23rd. He says on the following Friday, which is the 30th he was told he could get his second shot, but he was scheduled to get his second shot on the 29th, he wonders if that day made a difference. He says he was symptomatic, so he didn&#39;t know where he is at on a timeline to getting the second dose. He says he got the first dose shot the week prior and then that happened to his mom, so going into that weekend he had the allergy symptoms and obviously to play it safely they got tested and they were all negative. He says that following Friday he thought he had normal sinus congestion after cutting the grass, he is also always getting the sniffles from his neighbor&#39;s white pollen tree. He says to play it safe he got tested again Monday and that turned out to be positive. He says on the Wednesday the week prior it was negative after the shot they had on the 8th, then this test he had it. He says that his mom passed on the 13th, then on Tuesday which was the 14th they all were tested and all were negative. He says that he got tested again and it was positive after he felt his runny nose and cough that he had originally thought was normal over the course of the weekend was not feeling normal after all, and to play it safe he got tested. He says after his positive test after his first test was negative, because he was positive the second time everyone got tested, and his daughter was the only one who was negative the second test. Enquired ask how they could get information from the facility about when it would be ok to get the second dose, if it was when they had no more symptoms or if it was after a person tested positive or was asymptomatic 10-14 days that they can go get second dose. Enquired when is the best time to get the second dose after testing positive, whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic.The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I then became goofy. Started laughing etc. Then in the drive home about 20 minutes later I started to be tired. I was in the phone with a friend and slipped into a deep slumber. The next day Saturday I woke groggy like from a hang over minus the headache. I had a sudden urge to eat , i bacon and egg sandwich with mayo then had a urgency to eat a bowl of cereal. (rice crispies. Then tried to work (remotely from home) but I could not concentrate or focus. Finally I just threw in the towel and went back to sleep. Woke up to send this report.  Good night. I still recommend this inoculation to everyone!

Two days later I started having diffuse sporadic and intermittent tingling on various parts of my body.  That lasted about 2 days in its greatest severity.  On day 6 post vaccine, I was walking in an airport and developed chest pain, tachycardia, and shortness of breath out of proportion to my level of exertion.  This chest pain, shortness of breath and tachycardia with minimal exertion (a flight of stairs.  A walk to the end of driveway.) has persisted since then.  A cardiac w/u with Echo and  treadmill stress ECHO were negative.  I also have intermittent fatigue, headaches, and a mild &#34;brain fog.&#34;

It was reported that all the same symptoms the patient had with COVID, the caller had after the vaccine. The next morning was much worse and through that next day. Patient describes his side effects like a mini Covid 19 reaction. The symptoms were very similar to the symptoms he had 4 days into his Covid-19 diagnosis. It was reported that on Friday (26Mar2021) he felt normal and was able to workout on Saturday (27Mar2021) as usual. The patient believes his antibodies are strong following his virus and then the 1st Pfizer vaccine dose.

I checked my standing blood pressures and notices that it was very low 83/56 with a heart rate of 110. This went on for several weeks with standing blood pressures in the 80-90&#39;s/50-60&#39;s .

When I removed my shirt, I noticed that the injection site (as indicated by the location of the bandaid) was in an unusual location.  Instead of in my shoulder muscle, the injection site was further back toward the back side of my shoulder joint.   My shoulder pain got worse throughout the day and I continue to experience pain when I lift my arm over my head or when I put weight on it while laying down.  I have trouble sleeping with this pain.

He was 2 or 3 and almost died but came out of it; His mom had cancer from smoking, he got the worse flu sick of his life. His stomach was sensitive all of the time. If he was too happy or too nervous get upset. He can eat spicy food, not super hot, but he can eat anything and it doesn&#39;t go crazy. He has a little bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes. He can&#39;t take a multivitamin or supplements because he would get sick to his stomach, this was before the vaccine. He was getting that same sick feeling now that he would get if he was taking a multivitamin. He had his blood drawn a week before he had the vaccine to check his kidneys with the pills he is on. It was perfect and normal, and he has had nothing since then. In his 20s he had the flu vaccine, and he had never had the flu in his life. That year he got the worse flu sick of his life. He never got the flu vaccine or other vaccines after that. That was probably between 1987 to 1990. His folks passed away. He had been in the hospital when he was little.Concomitant medications included acetaminophen taken for back pain, sciatica from an unspecified start date and ongoing; nabumetone taken for sciatica, back pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient experienced he passed out for 2 days (medically significant) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, been sick pretty much everyday (non-serious) on 07Apr2021 22:00 with outcome of not recovered, not feeling good in his stomach (non-serious) on 07Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, slept all day for several days (non-serious) on 08Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, responding strangely to people/but is still there and is so weird (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting (non-serious) on 15Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, his whole torso hurt and his stomach (non-serious) on 15Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, diarrhea (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really irritable (non-serious) on 09Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, he had no energy (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of recovering, he was lethargic/weakness (asthenia) (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, dizzy (non-serious) on 10Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast (non-serious) on 17Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, breathing hard (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, wouldn&#39;t feel good (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, arm started hurting where he got the shot (non-serious) on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, headache (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, his arm was a little sore (non-serious) on 13Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, a fast heartbeat (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, chills (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown. Patient got sick around 10:00 at night. He was supposed to get his second dose but he was so sick and they said lets give it a week. Then he talked to his doctor and he said to wait 2-3 weeks to make sure he is back to normal. So he is scheduled for the second dose next week at 6 weeks. He asked if it was okay that the shot was given in the sunlight. He stated that he saw that it was in an ice chest but the person had to walk it over to him 20 feet and deal with his sleeve for a second or two so it was in the sun. He said all that walking it was 100% in the sun and he has read that it should not be in the sun. He asked if this could have caused bacteria and caused his symptoms. He stated his doctor was only concerned about giving him antibiotics for bacteria if it was in the sun and if that was a problem. He just read from CDC, once mixed the vaccine can be left at room temp for 6 hours and mixed vaccine does not need to be protected from light. So it sounds like his first shot was good. He had gotten the shot at about 1430 in the afternoon. He was like he is going to get the shot and everything will be great. He didn&#39;t think there would be an effect. Then strangely enough at about 2200 he was about to eat dinner and he got to not feeling good in his stomach. It had been close to 8 hours. The next day he slept all day, got up and had coffee, and Saturday he was in the chair in the living room. He is never in the chair during the day because he works. He slept all day and all night and the next day. He was responding strangely to people, and he was in and out of it. He had the shot on Wednesday and then his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting. He has back pain anyway and bone spurs on his spine. He was telling his wife whatever pain he is normally in was enhanced. His whole torso hurt and his stomach. The following Monday he had diarrhea. Then he started getting really irritable and didn&#39;t want to talk and was impatient. He was lethargic and had no energy. That was the second week. By the end of the second week he had a couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast. He thought it was a heart attack, then thought it was just pain not a heart attack. Every time he wouldn&#39;t feel good he would start breathing hard. Once in a while he gets pain through his chest area. His stomach would start and he would breath hard every time he didn&#39;t feel good. The third week he was supposed to get the second shot. He called the department of health for New Mexico. The nurse called back and said not to do the shot that week but to wait a week. He rescheduled for a week later. By the third week he was still not feeling good and called the doctor. He asked about the pain in his chest 3 times and he said it seemed to be okay. His arm started hurting where he got the shot in the second week. He still had no energy and he told the doctor this. Patient started taking 2 extra Tylenol during the day for pain. Lately he has been good until one little thing and then all of a sudden his stomach is hurting and he is holding his stomach. He was good today, all he did was eat a cookie and he didn&#39;t get sick. He was worse for a little while in the first or second week, he was really bad. It came and went over the next 2 weeks and now it is coming and going less frequently. He slept through 2 or 3 days. Thursday, Friday, and then Saturday he was in and out. He woke up to take the garbage out on Friday then saw he already took it out and forgot it was out there. And it was Saturday. He was kind of out of it. When he would respond strangely he would respond with a question he just asked and someone answered. It is like brain fog or like he is on something. It started after the weekend, more on 12Apr2021. Once in a while he will forget a little something still, but just once in a while. He would walk and hold his rib cage with both arms when he was hurting. He wrote down that it felt like somebody had hit him in the back with a bat in the lower back. One day it was that bad. His back pain was on Thursday 15Apr2021. The pain now is not like where it hit him with the back. He has back pain every day but more than he used to. The sore like he was hit in the back pain was just the one day. He had diarrhea 12Apr2021, 13Apr2021, and 14Apr2021 then it left for probably a week. Then it came back last week one day. Instead of every day it was every 3 or 4 days. He has not had it in the last 4 days. He hopes it is done. He noticed any time he has salad or lettuce he feels bad in the morning so he stopped eating those. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. The irritable feeling started right away the Friday of the week he got the shot. He is still struggling some, it will come and go. Yesterday he was zonked. With having no energy it is a big thing. He has to do something instead of what he would be doing. He works all day and takes long orders and stuff. Now he does like one order when normally he did 10. One for him is a huge little sore so he will lay on his right side. His left arm still hurts like a pulling hurt from his neck to his arm. It has been every day from 13Apr2021. It is much better and he will move and it will relax a little bit. It was really weird. The whole time he held the phone with his left hand up until one second he moved his phone and it was the same pain. At night the left side where he had the injection pulls on his neck muscle coming from his arm. He was actually taking two Tylenol in the morning and two at night when he went to bed. With the pain he takes 2 during the day, 650mg each. He was just taking 500mg and then his wife said take these. It seems to have gotten a little better. He always took them 2 times a day and now he takes them 3 times a day. After the first dose he experienced difficulty breathing dizziness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, chills, nausea, headache, he passed out for 2 days and has been sick for 5 weeks. He started having some dizziness a couple of days later and reports, it&#39;s like I would stand up too quickly and get a head rush, that kind of dizzy feeling. He confirmed that his dizziness did not start until a couple of days after he received his first dose.

On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t move his body, wasn&#39;t feeling like himself, he started having chills, shivering, and fever yesterday (29Mar2021) then had a rapid test and he came positive, and butt cheeks hurt; on an unspecified date, scalp hurt, and everything hurts. Brushing his teeth hurts. It was further reported that they went to take a rapid test in the morning of 30Mar2021 and he came positive. The patient didn&#39;t have problems Friday/Saturday/Sunday. Yesterday (29Mar2021), he woke up and he felt like he&#39;s been having aches and pains and when he took a shower, washing his head hurt. And his butt cheeks hurt from sitting down. He&#39;s allergic to penicillin and they kept them there for 30 minutes. Everything was fine. No side effects from Friday through Sunday. But yesterday (29Mar2021), he started having chills, shivering, and fever. Additionally, it was reported that the patient was tested for Covid-19 prior to getting vaccinated and the results were negative. The wife also clarified that last night, 29Mar2021, the patient had chills, couldn&#39;t move his body, and had a temperature of 101-102. Therefore, they both made an appointment to get tested at 09:30 this morning (30Mar2021) to get tested. The patient&#39;s test came back positive. The wife again states they are going back tomorrow for a rapid and mouth Covid-19 test. Furthermore, it was reported that yesterday (29Mar2021), her husband woke up and wasn&#39;t feeling like himself. In the night, he was hot, shivering, and his temperature got up to 101. The patient&#39;s temperature was not so high this morning but that he still wasn&#39;t feeling himself. He began not feeling like himself yesterday morning, 29Mar2021. The patient confirmed that he still feels unlike himself today. The wife also reported that every time her husband would move he said that everything hurts. Brushing his teeth hurts. He even said his butt cheeks hurt. When her husband was taking a bath and passed the soap over his head, his scalp hurt. The wife makes the comment that this isn&#39;t like her husband. The patient works like a mule and doesn&#39;t complain about anything. That&#39;s why the wife got worried. For example, the patient had knee surgery and walked out limping but did not use a cane because that was the kind of man he is. He was not whiner so when he tells you something&#39;s wrong, something&#39;s wrong. The patient&#39;s second dose was scheduled 16Apr2021. The patient was allergic to the penicillin class in generalized. When the patient was small, he was hospitalized for 15 days in a bubble following an allergic reaction. The wife reported that the patient drinks (takes) every day religiously one Centrum for men, one Vitamin c, and an aspirin. She clarified all the medications that her husband drinks (takes) he has been on for at least 10 years, since he was 35 or 40 years old, tops. All of these medications are approved by the doctor. She mentions when she try and give her husband a pill, he just looks at it. He won&#39;t even drink (take) a Tylenol. Her husband works construction and was around a lot of dust. Sometimes, he will work with Clorox and stuff like that cleaning towers, so he just takes Vitamin C to stay safe. Their son was a vet and when her husband helps their son with the animals, he takes it to make sure he was clean. She also clarified that her husband drinks (takes) the aspirin that was for arthritis because he&#39;s 57 and has worked very hard. She believes the dose was 325 or 500, she was not sure. She clarified further it&#39;s the aspirin that&#39;s for body and aches. His doctor doesn&#39;t let him take any more than one tablet daily in case he gets cut, he could bleed. The patient takes the aspirin daily because both his dad and mom died of aneurysms so he was told to take an aspirin daily to make sure his arteries and everything are clean. It&#39;s a preventative to make sure he doesn&#39;t get any clogs and for the pain. She makes the comment unfortunately, their son that&#39;s 35 had to have 2 open heart surgeries. She and her husband have not been in contact with anyone. They have 3 small grandkids and a son with a history of open heart surgery. The wife reported that she and her husband live in a bubble. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101-102 on 29Mar2021 and COVID-19 test which was negative on an unspecified date in Mar2021 and then became positive   on 30Mar2021.

A 56-year old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) via unspecified route of administration in the left arm (Batch/Lot number unknown) on 06Mar2021 at 09:30 AM at the age of 56-year old as single dose for Covid-19 immunization and alprazolam (XANAX) 0.25 mg two hours before the vaccine (06Mar2021 at 07:30 AM) Relevant medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that he was very relaxed and calm and had taken less than 0.25 mg of alprazolam two hours prior. In less than two minutes after receiving the injection he felt a &#34;rush&#34; and shakiness as if he just had a cup of coffee. He was not short of breath and had no other symptoms. The patient tried to remain calm. The symptoms subsided in less than 30 seconds. He still felt nervous but may have been out of concern after the &#34;rush&#34; feeling. The site monitor approximately 8 mins. after the injection asked him how he was doing. He told him he was shaky but may have been nervous. He said he was free to leave. The patient took alprazolam that morning because he had prior Emergency Medical experience and was aware of potential anaphylaxis. The outcome of the events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information on Lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                We had to call 911 at 2:00am. He \woke up from sleep with Uvulitis and sore throat with swelling in his throat. He felt like his throat was closing. His wife gave him 2 Benedryl while waiting for the paramedics to arrive. They arrived quickly, within 10 minutes.  The medical team monitored him at home for about 30 minutes. During this time had high Blood Pressure. They offered to take him to the hospital but he declined. He wanted to monitor himself at home to see if it would resolve itself.  He spent the rest of the night in a recliner to help him breath, with his wife by his side.  He did not follow up with any medical professional.  He did NOT get the 2nd vaccination and will NOT.

                                                I had my first Covid vaccine (Pfizer - Lot ER2613) on March 17.  No issues other than a soar arm the next day.  In fact, I went on a hard 7 mile run the next day as part of my normal training routine (currently training for a half Marathon.)  This past Thursday, April 8, at 6:00 pm EST, I had my 2nd shot (Lot EW0161).  For about the next 18 hours, I was fine other than the arm being a little sore in the morning. Late in the morning I noticed my back was getting very stiff and a bit sore when I moved around.  I have a desk job and spend a lot of time in front of the computer, but I normally stretch and move throughout most days, so I don?t have many back issues.  This was a bit worse than normal.  Usually, when I feel something like this, my go to remedy is an easy run.  I had a 5 mile easy run planned for that day, so later in the afternoon, after some dynamic stretching, I went for a run.  As I started, I felt some of the worse back pain I could remember and stopped running after about 50 yards.  I stretched a little more, questioning if I should continue, but decided that movement would be better than doing nothing.  I started running again and although the first mile was much more uncomfortable and painful than normal, I continued on for the 5 miles with everything eventually loosening up as the blood starting flowing.  I felt pretty good the rest of the day and into the evening.  In the middle of the night, I awoke numerous times with a bad ache in my back, which is very unusual for me. I tossed and turned all night from side to side, from front to back but could not stop the burn and pain in my lower back.  I took 2 Advil, but that did little to help.  I got out of bed about an hour earlier than normal and after a little light stretching, my back felt fine again.  I went for my weekly long 14 mile run an hour later and everything was good again and for the rest of the day.  The next 3 days / nights have been similar.  I continue waking each night with a burning and aching in my lower back and it continues all night long.  Once I stand up, get out of bed and start moving around, the pain and burning go away almost immediately.  I?ve never felt anything like this before.  I?m 57, male, am very healthy and fit (aiming for a 1:30 half marathon in 10 days.)  Never had issues with sleeping before this and haven?t experienced any back pain in a very long time.  I can?t think of anything I?ve done recently to trigger this other than the coincidence of the 2nd Pfizer vaccine shot.

The pain  and tingling in his feet is most  severe. The pain wakes him up at night during sleep to the point that  he is unable to fall back asleep, and the pain and tingling is still there when he wakes .  The tingling and pain is not noticeable once the patient is working, and once he wakes he still has the symptoms, but it is not as bad as it is during the night. He had not experienced this pain or tingling ever before having the vaccination.

Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient had nasal swab on 01Apr2021 with negative result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently available is extremely limited and does not allow a meaningful case assessment. However, based solely on an implied temporal association, a causal relationship between events fever,confusion,aphasia,movementdisorder adverse events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

                                                2 days after my initial vaccine injection, my lower body joints/muscles/tendons were extremely painful to move. The pain was evident after sitting or laying down for 10&#43; minutes. During nighttime sleep, the pain does not allow me to move my lower extremities without intense pain keeping me awake and only allowing less than 2 hours of sleep a night. Prior to March 12, I was physically fit and active. I was able to ride a stationary bike, treadmill and attend fitness classes. Now, I need to walk with a cane and I was diagnosed with &#34;arthritis&#34; symptoms as well as micro tears in my left knee. My left knee swells so much that I am unable to bend it without great pain.

                                                Pain on the three joints I have had tendinitis due to sports injuries (left hip, left knee, left elbow). I had felt fine from after the shot at 10:30am that day (Thursday 5/6/21)  until that evening, where I did feel some soreness in those joints. I took two Alleve pills an hour prior to bedtime.  I woke up in pain at 2:00AM that night (5/7/21) on the said joints, about a level 6-7 out of 10.   By morning the pain had subsided a bit, but I was in pain walking for the next day (Friday) and today (Saturday).

                                                Extreme headaches in the back of my head, then radiating to the frontal lobe. Second stage was dizziness/ vertigo seemed like my brain was going to explode.  Ringing in ears and then intense vivid dreams.  It?s been two weeks since the second shot and I am still dealing with the dizzy spells. The headaches have gone . Also another symptom was I would get weak at times not for long but in spells. Still trying to over come this pressure and dizzy feeling other than that now I am getting better.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 at 57-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 31Mar2021 at single dose, and the second dose at 57-year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 21Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, and testosterone, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at an unspecified dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020, and left arm bothered him. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported his tongue and taste buds were &#34;screwed up&#34; and it had been painful to eat which had resulted in weight loss of 50 pounds in the last 5 months and this had gotten worse since being vaccinated. He was fatigued and his whole body hurt and sports injuries from past were very painful. He had previous Covid infection in Dec2020. He had seen many doctors and had an appointment with neurologist coming up. He didn&#39;t have much hope. He felt like he had 75% Covid all the time and his body felt like he had been hit by a truck. Not really that bad but like his taste buds were screwed up and it kind of progressed since he received the vaccine. Ever since the patient got the vaccine, the arm that he got the vaccine in it killed him, every joint in his body hurt, and he had seen lots of doctors about this and no one could figure it out. The patient was 250 pounds before this started. Patient was having something wrong with his tongue and taste buds, it was hard to explain. It was painful to eat, the patient had been to an ENT and they were sending the patient to neurology to figure it out. The tongue thing went away they thought it was thrush, then talked to another ENT and thought it was something neurological. The patient&#39;s whole body hurt. The patient was unsure when all of this started but he stated that it had worsened over the last couple of months. The patient&#39;s mouth was in pain. The patient was fatigued. The patient&#39;s left arm bothered him before the vaccine but it had progressively gotten worse over time. All of the symptoms that the patient had from COVID got progressively worse after the vaccine. The patient&#39;s arms were really lose and it felt like the arms wanted to come out of the socket. The pain could be a 9/10 and nothing touched it. The day after the first shot, the patient got testosterone shots, they found and erratic heartbeat which freaked out the patient. They did and EKG and said it was okay but couldn&#39;t determine what it was. Patient was tested and it showed hypothyroid and they did an intake test. The doctors thought it was thyroiditis but that got better but then it snowballed into what it was. Investigations: The patient was tested for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and all sorts of different things which were all negative. The patient was a healthy guy otherwise, besides these symptoms. Action taken in response to the events for testosterone was unknown. Outcome of events his tongue and taste buds were &#34;screwed up&#34;, the arm that he got the vaccine in it kills him/left arm bothered him before the vaccine but it had progressively gotten worse over time, every joint in his body hurt, and erratic heartbeat was not resolved, and of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I&#39;ve had both the first and second shot, with the second shot initial side effects occurring 10 minutes sooner and lasting  about 6 hours longer.  2nd wave effect occurred 3-4 days after shot;  it&#39;s only been 2 days since the  2nd shot, so that effect hasn&#39;t hit yet.   Note that  I had similar reactions to the flu vaccine&#39;s for 17 straight years , with the exception of the brain fog. Flu shot reactions stopped when I started taking Amway  Double X multivitamins and tripling up on Vitamin A, C, Zinc and echinacea 3 days before through after the vaccine.  Shot 1 - initial  side effects: 40 minutes after shot within a mile of returning to work from hospital, I suddenly got lightheaded and very tired with brain fog creeping in. Since that was closer than home, I continued  on to work hoping it would soon pass.  Brain fog,  dizziness and fatigue all  continued to worsen, and I was taken home. Effects lasted 9 hours. 3-4 days later the symptoms all came back and lasted 2-3  days, with the addition of temperatures in mid to high 96 range. My normal temperature is a degree low at 97.8.

At 10 am he began to feel unwell describing &#34;disorientation&#34; which upon further explanation seems he is describing difficulty with his proprioception, ie not able to tell where his body is in space, and disequilibrium, ie having to stop and hold on to something while walking. This lasted most of the day and subsided by evening. He has continued to have ongoing shorter episodes 3-4 times per day lasting 5-10 minutes. In addition he has noted increasing weakness in his right thigh, particularly when going from sitting to standing and the through swing while walking. He describes these as &#34;paralytic attacks&#34; that occur once or twice per day and last hours. Both symptoms are similar to those he had post CVA in 2019 and greatly improved with PT and home exercises. In addition he has noted fecal urgency and fecal incontinence in the last couple of weeks, he is unsure if this is directly related to the vaccine.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

                                                First started feeling upset stomach and severe headache, then a couple hours later, the body aches and joint pain set in. He said his lower body felt like he&#39;d been in a car accident. He couldn&#39;t keep anything down to take pain medicine all day long so was miserable all day until about 4pm when he was able to drink some water and take some Vicodin, which did not help. He was up and down all night long with the headache and body aches, and I gave him Excedrin about 6am and that finally started alleviating the headache. He took it again at 11am and was able to eat then, and is gradually been feeling better throughout the day. He was finally able to take his regular meds so now the body aches have subsided (48 hours after injection/36 hours after onset of symptoms).

A follow-up call 4 hours after the event was made. Pt stated he was at work and felt fine.

                                                Right Foot started hurting the night after the vaccine. The next day, it hurt to  walk on it. Mainly around the base of my 2nd and 3rd toes. The next day it hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t walk on it and saw the doctor. A red area had developed on top of my foot at the base on my toes. Doctor though could be Gout but didn&#39;t really look like it and usually that is in the big toes. Plus the timing of this issue and my vaccine were suspect. Had X-ray on that Friday, two days after vaccine and everything looked fine they said. I was prescribed Celebrex  and over the weekend took two per day due to the pain. I stayed in bed all weekend and pain got worse before taking another dose of medicine which helped for a while.  Swelling continued to be about the same or a bit more and the redness moved over to my big toe and then up my foot around towards the right side. Today my right side of foot is really soar now as well and still can&#39;t walk on it and still swollen. Doctor at a urgent care sports medicine location prescribed me Prednisone steroid to see if that helps. But so far 5 days after vaccine and my foot is still swollen, red across the top and so painful it keeps me up at night and I can&#39;t walk on it. I&#39;m hoping the steroids work.

At bedtime 3-11-21, I had a fever 100.1. At 0100, fever rose to 101.1. At 0500 fever rose to 102.6. During day on 3-12-21, I felt like I had the flu, fever broke mid-morning. on 3-13-21, I felt OK. On 3-15 and 16, I felt like I generally like I  had a flue bug. I felt better days later and then around March 21-24th I&#39;ve had a pretty continuous headache and neck ache which I have not had before the  vaccine. Lack of energy and feeling crappy. Scheduled for second vaccine April 2nd.

The first night after receiving my first vaccine I got the chills about 16 hours after my shot went away after a few hours. Woke of the next day with my post acute syndrome symptoms  much worse than I had prior to shot,  my fatigue in my legs were to the point I could hardly walk, my brain fog and tremors  were much worse, that lasted about 1 day then the next two nights I woke up in the middle of night with severe sweating. I was then felling like I had before the shot. Then about 4 days after receiving the vaccine the post acute syndrome symptoms again were much worse than before. This last for about 2 weeks then gradual worked back the my original feeling of fatigue, brain fog and tremors  that I had prior to vaccine

A 58-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 21Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cannot see well out of right eye. There were no concomitant medications. Patient had a rash that appeared a couple days after, very mild just itching a little bit on his right arm just inside the elbow. Patient received the vaccine in the opposite arm in the left arm. Patient is going back on 11Feb2021 for the second dose. It was reported that it is better than being on a ventilator. Patient ruled out everything else the rash could have come from, he didn&#39;t change his laundry soap, or anything else. He haven&#39;t changed anything since he took the vaccine. He didn&#39;t speak to his MD about the rash, because he didn&#39;t think about it. He is going to be talking to his Doctor on Monday (unspecified date). He is going to get some calamine lotion but he took some Benadryl, it helped him sleep. It was also reported that the patient had a rash on both arms and swelling in his eyes and he went to the eye doctor who has prescribed him some medication and cream from family doctor. He noticed the rash a couple days after the vaccine and the issues with his eyes too, they were also watering a lot, can hardly see out of the right eye, he had this problem prior to vaccination. The cornea specialist prescribed him some drops, that his eyes were red, itchy, and swollen, he deduced that he was having an allergic reaction. Outcome of the event &#34;took some Benadryl, it helped him sleep&#34; was recovering and of the other events was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                I had surgery for spinal stenosis on 07/09/2020, including a decompression and fusion at L4/L5.  I reported the following symptoms, which I attribute to the COVID-19 vaccination, to my spine surgeon.  I had my second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, March 29th at 5:45 PM.   Lower back pain in the general area of my surgery (07/09/2020) woke me up from sleep around 4:30 AM Tuesday (03/30/2021) morning.  Being woken up from sleep had never happened previously - not before surgery, following surgery, ever.  I recall the pain being a dull throbbing ache, nothing sharp.   I recall being generally pain free Tuesday during the day and went for a mile and half walk Tuesday evening and hit  about 20 40-yard (or less pitch shots) Tuesday evening.   I woke up Wednesday at my usual 6:45 AM.  Although I don&#39;t recall being in pain getting out of bed, I do remember being in excruciating pain the remainder of the day.  It hurt to walk (landing either foot) and the only position that I had any relief was sitting at work.  The pain was frequent, sharp, and up to a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.  I felt exhausted and feel asleep at 7:30 PM Wednesday night.   I was in significantly less pain Thursday, although it was still uncomfortable rising from a seated position and bending at the waist (to assume a putting position in the office) caused pain to the extent that I chose not to fully bend.  Thursday night was generally OK but there was one point, while seated on a couch, where I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the general area of my surgery.  I tried to change positions to alleviate the pain, but it persisted for 30 seconds before finally subsiding.  The pain felt like I was being stabbed and it was a 8 or 9 on a 1 to 10 scale.   Friday was a repeat of Thursday.  Generally, I have very little pain except when I stand from a seated position (1 or 2 on a 10 point scale) or bend slightly at the waist (3 or 4).  The pain is dull but the pain from bending does prevent me from bending comfortably.   All of this pain is new this week since Monday.  This past weekend I worked in the yard, including some heavy lifting and digging.   Is there any chance this is a side effect of the vaccine?  Should I schedule an office visit to evaluate the pain?  NOTE:  I was generally symptom free by Saturday, 04/03/2021 and totally symptom free by 04/05/2021.

                                                I woke at 6:30am on 04/07/2021 in a state of complete confusion and disorientation.  It was a level of disorientation I have never experienced before in my lifetime.  I fainted one time and was having extreme difficulty getting my bearings and walking and was simply in total &#34;mental disarray&#34;.  I was having difficulty producing words, a prolonged stutter, you might say.  I was shaking.  The local paramedics came and I was taken to the local ER.  Because I was having difficulty speaking, the paramedics (and later the physicians) thought I might have had a TIA.  An MRI on 04/07/2021 at 5pm produced a negative result.  So i can only attribute my reaction to the vaccine.  It was very significant, and i thought it made sense to report it.

Armpit glands felt twisted and pulled. I felt worse &amp; asked my wife to call 911. Paramedics came, took vitals, blood, offered to take me to hospital (didn?t go). They stayed an hour until I felt stable.   Sun 3/28/21am, exhausted, slightly better but my mind was spacey, body achy &amp; armpits hurt. 12:00pm: noticed short term memory loss, ate a few crackers, drank water, napped on/ off, went to bed around 900pm.    Mon, 3/29/21, still achy and mentally fuzzy. Side effects diminished over a few days.

                                                passed out/unconscious; feel weak; dizzy; not normal; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 26Mar2021 09:45AM (Lot Number: ER8730) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no other medical history or known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not have COVID test post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. After taking the vaccine the patient waited for 15 minutes prior to departing the facility in order to make sure there was no adverse reactions. At approximately 10:15 10:30 AM the patient drove back home. After driving for about five minutes while stopped at a traffic light the patient completely passed out at 10:45, he was unconscious for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, almost crashed his car and EMT support had to be called. The patient regained his conscience but it took him over a half hour to feel 50% better. Until 8:30 PM 26Mar2021, the patient still felt weak and dizzy and not normal. No treatment was received for events. The outcome of events was recovering.

I went home and fell asleep at about 8:30pm for 13 hours.  Felt tired the entire next day and went home and fell asleep at about 8:30 pm and slept for 14 hours.  Felt tired most of the day.  Felt exhausted and went to bed at 9:30 on Saturday night (the 3rd night) and slept for about 12 hours.  This is very unlike me because I normally stay up and watch a movie with my wife on a Saturday night.  This pattern of feeling exhausted by 6:00pm continues and we are now at about 3 weeks after the vaccine.  It?s improving a bit but it?s still outside the normal pattern for me.  I?m still feeling quite tired early in the evening and going to be much earlier than Normal.    Additionally, I feel like I?m not myself.  At times, my brain feels a bit foggy in that I?m not as aware or clear in my thinking as I normally would be.

A 58-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8734) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:00 at age of 58-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It also stated the patient was one of the most vulnerable against virus so he took the Covid-19 Vaccine. Medical history included ongoing cardiac failure congestive diagnosed probably 10 years ago, ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed probably 20 years ago, ongoing dialysis for 3.5 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing unspecified blood thinner. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t take any blood pressure medications and that she knew the patient took a blood thinner. Caller unable to provide further detail for the patient&#39;s medications as she doesn&#39;t have the patient&#39;s list of medications with her. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EP7534) injected in left arm in Mar2021 at age of 58-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fatigue after the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that it was hard to determine the cause of the fatigue because the patient was on dialysis, but that the patient has been more fatigued since he received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was a compromised fellow with a host of pre-existing conditions as far as heart disease, diabetes, and dialysis. Caller was calling in regard to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she was calling to report a bad reaction that her husband, the patient, received on Sunday, 04Apr2021, following his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Approximately 3 hours after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient had a full blown seizure at 15:00 on Sunday, 04Apr2021. Caller reported that she had to call emergency responders following the patient&#39;s seizure. The patient was doing better but the experience with his seizure was quite traumatic. Caller stated that if it was going to happen, it was going to happen to us. About 3 hours after receiving his Covid-19 vaccine on 04Apr2021, the patient became real sluggish and his speech started getting slow before the seizure occurred. Caller reported that the patient made a gradual descent downwards. Caller reported that she swears the patient has not been the same as far as fatigue goes since the patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior. Caller reported that she thought the fatigue was maybe from dialysis. The patient started to get slow just before the seizure, about 2.5 hours after he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was laying down following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s breathing was off. The patient&#39;s breath was heavier. Caller reported that after she noticed the patient&#39;s breathing was off, she asked the patient if he was ok. Caller reported that this is when she noticed that the patient&#39;s speech was really slow and that he was experiencing confusion. The patient has had no more seizure activity. The patient was still being monitored in the hospital. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t remember any of it. It&#39;s hard to say if the patient&#39;s sluggishness and fatigue were ongoing. Caller reported that she couldn&#39;t go see the patient while he was in the hospital but that the patient&#39;s voice sounds much stronger. For Confusion and Speech: Caller reported that the patient seems to be back/ returned to normal. Caller reported that she knew that the patient&#39;s cardiologist went to see the patient. The patient&#39;s cardiologist said that there was nothing that happened to the patient&#39;s heart, that what the patient experienced was not a heart issue, and that the event had no effect on the patient&#39;s heart. The medical staff stated that the seizure the patient experienced was related to a blood pressure drop. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s blood pressure was very low on 04Apr2021. The patient required a visit to Emergency Room for event seizure, no visit of physician office. Admitted on Sunday, 04Apr2021 for seizure, and still hospitalized. For investigations: Caller reported that the medical staff at the hospital definitely did lab work but she was not sure if any imaging was performed. Caller reported that she has no results available for tests that were performed. The outcome of events confusion and &#34;speech started to get slow&#34; was recovered in Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed.

Each day thereafter my shoulder was really  sore, I am having these burning sensations in my right forearm and my wrist is in pain. It has been 5 days since my second vaccine and each day has been very rough to get through. I have 2 jobs and the pain is interfering with my job duties. And when I&#39;m trying to sleep, it&#39;s very uncomfortable and I haven&#39;t been able to get a full night&#39;s rest. I haven&#39;t seen any doctors or taken any medication because I thought that the symptoms would go away but they haven&#39;t. I don&#39;t know what to do

Again awoke with damp mattress and bedding. For the first 10 minutes after rising I felt a little better, but then the muscle pain intensified and the lethargy too. I spent several hours of the day lying down in bed. Ate normally, which improved my overall feeling and energy level. Also consumed electrolytes and water. In the evening I started to feel not fully recovered, but a lot better than 24 hours prior. I went to bed at 11PM. 2021.05.22 - 11PM - 2021.05.23 - 10AM - I had some chills on preparing my bed, but overall slept better.

                                                Severe tinnitus ( ear ringing) started at 4:20 a.m. ,(woke me up), on Tuesday April 13th, 2021, less than 48 hours after receiving the 1st dose of the COVID Pfizer vaccine injection.  It&#39;s been so severe it&#39;s got to the point that I&#39;ve contemplated considering suicide.  It has totally turned my life upside down as it relates to sleep, working, daily functioning and living. On a scale of &#34;1 to 10&#34; I&#39;d rate my tinnitus a &#34;7&#34; in severity.   It&#39;s a very high pitched tone, it sounds like the test pattern the TV stations used to broadcast at midnight.  It&#39;s maddening. It&#39;s torture.   The first 4 weeks were really hell.  Now it vacillates between a 7 and a 4.  It gets worse at night when I lay down.   So as of today it&#39;s been 7 weeks and 1 day since the onset of this tinnitus.  I called Pfizer Thursday April 15th, they were no help.  I had a zoom call with an MD who recommended not taking the 2nd Pfizer dose and to see and ENT asap. I saw Dr. who prescribed Prednisone tablets.  I am still suffering greatly from this.   Never in my life have I had tinnitus.  Never in my life have I been around loud work environments.  This is a direct result of taking the Pfizer vaccine.  I am certain of this fact.

After receiving the vaccine it became so severe that I was unable to walk or stand for more than a couple minutes, the pain was a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, and it therefore interfered with daily tasks such as cooking, cleaning, showering, shopping and so on.

They put me in a dark room I received a Toradol shot and another shot to get rid of my headache. I was in the hospital for 3 days so they could monitor my migraine. While I was in the hospital, they changed my medicine. I was on 40 mg of Lexapro and they moved me down to 20mg. The first night I was in the hospital was horrible, but I feel that was from the vaccine. I kept pacing back and forth and didn&#39;t want to sit down. I do have anxiety and depression. Nothing has really helped with the headaches. I was given medications to take, but I don&#39;t remember to take them.

                                                About 17 hours after the shot, preparing to go to my office I suddenly became dizzy in a way similar to an episode of vertigo I had 15 years prior.  I notice I had a headache that got worse in minutes. I sucked down 3 and 1/2 two hundred mg Aleve pills and hit the sack. Four hours later I drank 14 oz of water and took another 2 Aleve since the headache was still strongly with me. My body had a general soreness and an ache. I went back to bed thinking I might need to call my MD. About 3 hrs later, I took more water, ate nothing, took 2 more Aleve, and my wife made a call to schedule an appointment with Dr. I was awakened by my wife for dinner. I had an appetite but was foggy and sluggish. I took two more Aleve skipped any alcohol - and went to bed for the evening. The following morning -  Jan 18th, 2021 - I awoke with no headache, no soreness, no vertigo.

                                                Had my 2nd COVID vaccination shot at 2 pm on Monday, January 11, 2021.    Next morning - moderate pain in upper left arm/shoulder (place of injection). Working full shift.    Around 4 pm on Tuesday (after almost 3hrs OR case) - feeling very tired. Completed the working shift at 6 pm. Minor to moderate headache started to develop later in the evening. Two pills of Tylenol at 9 pm, another two around 2 am - while headache was getting worse.  @6:30 am Wednesday - informed managers that I&#39;ll have to stay off work because of bad headache (7 to 8 from 10), called EH as well.    During the day - mostly staying in the bed. Tylenol, water, tea with lemon, apples for hydration. Headache -- up and down (between 4 and 8), occasional fatigue and nausea (after staying upright more than 10-15 minutes), left upper arm pain, moderate pain in joints (knees, hips, low back). No fever.   Troubled night-time sleeping because of headache. 7 am - informed managers and EH about my condition, Got approval for another day off - with request to have a C-Test after that. Similar feeling and treatment.    Slow improvement during the day. Around 5 pm - feeling good enough to start moving more actively, headache and shoulder pain on low level, though getting tired quickly still.    Much better sleeping. No symptoms in the morning. Had a COVID test before returning to work.

                                                Approximately 60 seconds prior to emergency, patient felt a sense of panic (first time ever).  Stated to me (wife) &#34;I feel like I am having a panic attack&#34; as we walked on to a parking garage elevator at 12:30 pm on 1.22.21.  As I turned to push the button to go down, leaned against the wall of the elevator. His eyes fluttered and back, he was a little pale.  When I turned around, again, he fainted and fell face down on the elevator floor.  He never stopped breathing and had no convulsions.  He was out for less than 30 seconds. When he came to, he got up by himself with minimal assist from me (911 was already on their way).  He did not remember saying that he felt like he was having a panic attack; but he remember the fear/panic he felt just prior to.  He was oriented x3.  I had him smile, stick his tongue out and speak to make sure it was not a TIA or stroke and there were no symptoms of that.  His bladder did release.  He went by ambulance to the ER (we were on a mini vacation to celebrate his birthday). They did a CAT scan, checked his blood sugar twice, EKG twice, complete blood work panels and urinalysis  All tests were either normal or negative.  They found nothing.  His BP was normal for the first 30 minutes at the hospital, then increased.  But has been normal ever since (he checks it daily). Absolutely no other symptoms since that episode.  He met with our PCP on 1.29.21 as a follow-up and she directed us to complete this form. She has ordered a consult with a Neurologist and that is scheduled for 3.10.21.  His second shot for the vaccine is due on 2.9.21.

It has increased subsequent to my second dose on 3/4/2021. I had no other significant symptoms after my first dose, but did have sufficient pain at the injection site in my left upper arm the day following my shot to wake me up at night. That went away within 48 hours, but the tinnitus effects have not decreased to date.

Increased to 25 mg BID on March 2, without reported side effects or other issues.  Pt got his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on March 4, and that night was less engaged with staff, felt feverish.

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 06Mar2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pain, high cholesterol, and testosterone low, joint pain, bone pain, muscle pain, any place in his body had pain, and doesn&#39;t have good memory, all ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydrocodone for pain, ongoing atorvastatin for high cholesterol, ongoing clomiphene citrate for testosterone medication because it was low because of his age, ongoing colecalciferol (Vitamin D), ongoing ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), ongoing oxycodone for pain, and unspecified eye medication. He had many different medications that he was taking. Historical vaccines included chicken pox vaccine for immunization and shingles vaccine in Jan2020 for immunization and experienced pain all over. The patient stated that he was a torture survivor and he has been taking pain medication because of him being tortured previously. He was taking medications for the pain, clarified to be hydrocodone and oxycodone. These medications kept his body stable. He was able to sleep and relax. One day after he received his Pfizer COVID vaccine (07Mar2021), he started feeling the pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse but the pain used to be stable with the way he was using his medicines. But now his body was not stable. Any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously because of the damage of torture but now it all came up after the COVID vaccine. Every piece of his body hurt even if he takes his medications. He still had the pain and his body was so weak for about 4 to 5 hours. He used to be able to do his business all day but now after about 3 to 4 hours on his feet he got so tired and he needed to sit. He didn&#39;t know why this happened. He has talked to others that have received COVID vaccines and none have had this kind of reaction like him. He has asked them about it. It was very frustrating to him on an unspecified date. Every month he sees a physician. He would like for Pfizer to contact him with further questions, he can&#39;t understand the pain. This was really killing him especially when the pain goes to his bones. He will keep him up until 3 in the morning and he stays awake on an unspecified date. He then took medicine and he had to wait for 30 minutes for it to start working and then he will be able to sleep. But other than that, the pain jumped. He has had the chicken pox and the shingles vaccines and none did like that. The pain was not going away in his muscles or joints. And now he was getting a headache on an unspecified date, it was really frustrating. He didn&#39;t have good memory from the torture. This morning, when he woke up, he had the pain in his joints and his bones. He didn&#39;t like to use too much medication. He liked to use it only as he needs it. Pain medications are strong. But this COVID vaccine somehow made him need to use more medication and then that caused him to have a headache. His pain should get better with his medications but today, he had pain all over him and he didn&#39;t have any energy to move. He didn&#39;t know how to explain it. The COVID vaccine had really kind of made him weak. Sometimes he drinks a lot of cranberry juice to try and take the vaccine out of his system and it was frustrating because he hasn&#39;t ever been like this. When he had pain like this it reminded him of his torturing and what had happened to him. When the pain came on strong was when it reminded him of that. The medications he was taking were supposed to kill the pain. That was the reason he got so pissed and was trying to ask what was going on. This COVID vaccine is not safe he believed because it has been almost 10 days and it was not helping him. He was still not good. After he got his COVID vaccine on 06Mar2021, he had a little bit of small itching, not much, just a little bit that made him feel not comfortable with it. That was why they kept him for 20 minutes after his vaccine. When he got back home, he was okay, it was nothing serious. But then the day after his COVID vaccine on 07Mar2021, his joints, his muscles and his bones had pain. On 06Mar2021 the itching lasted about 20 minutes. He felt like he was chewing his lip, he was a little uncomfortable and he felt his ribs moving quicker. Nothing happened but he could feel it. He tried to chew his lips a couple of times, but not that much. But after that, he had pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine, 07Mar2021. By the time this vaccine started getting into his body, it was really hurting and getting worse. He had the shingles vaccine and for 1 1/2 to 2 days, he had pain all over and then 2 days after it was all gone, he was back to normal life. The pain was gone. With this COVID vaccine he thought that maybe it was going to be the same but it was not the same and it was hurting. The shingles vaccine was last year in 2020, 3 months before people knew about the coronavirus that was when he got the vaccine for shingles, so maybe Jan2020 was when he had the shingles vaccine. He had no medical conditions or heart and chest problems. No other vaccine he has taken has ever had this type of side effect to him. He took his shingles vaccine in his right arm and the COVID vaccine was in his left. With both he had the same start of having the bad pain. This COVID vaccine goes deeply to the body. The vaccines job is to wake the body. The vaccine&#39;s job is to wake up the body for the virus. The body has to make some kind of soldiers to stand up on the virus and this COVID vaccine had actually made his body weak. After the vaccine is supposed to wake the body, little by little the side effects are supposed to go away. His body was not learning this vaccine. It kept fighting to learn whatever was in this COVID vaccine, his body can&#39;t learn it and fight it. That was the reason his body got weak and the pain has not gone away. His body is still in alert and that&#39;s why the pain was still there. His body was still fighting. Somehow it didn&#39;t match the inside of the body. Maybe for some people that this will happen to, they will be okay but for some they will not be okay. It is not because some people have nothing wrong with them. The patient recovered from itching and discomfort on 06Mar2021; not recovered from any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously/ pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse/ pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine; while outcome of other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Began feeling a little warm and flushed and tired. I felt off overall. On the 8th around 12pm. I cam e home from work around 4:30 and laid down til 5:30 and I woke up feeling a little better but around 6:15 I felt the same as earlier that day and then it got worse. My ears were ringing loudly and I had shortness of breath, I had difficulty breathing, and my chest was tight and I had pain in the center of my chest and I was nauseous and hungry but really couldn&#39;t eat anything. I checked my BP at home and it was 189/127 and then 192/122. I was well hydrated but I drank 2 16 ounce glasses of water and sat down to try and relax. An hour later the ringing stopped and I was feeling much better. I took my BP again and it was up to 202/126. I decided to go to the ER at this time. around 11pm it was 143/89.    Ringing and flushed still present with some stomach issues (4/9)

By 5 I was exhausted, and paranoid about a work situation, paranoia is not part of my normal state of being. By 6pm my left upper arm was very  painful from shoulder to elbow.

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: ER8727, Expiration Date: Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 at 14:30 (at 59-year-old) at single dose in upper left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides. Concomitant medication(s) included hydrochlorothiazide/ lisinopril (LISINOPRIL/HCTZ) hypertension; citalopram; trazodone for sleep disorder; zolpidem for sleep disorder; simvastatin for blood cholesterol; alprazolam for anxiety (doctors said high dose which he needed to be stable, at least 7 years ago); and fenofibrate for blood triglycerides increased. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. E-transmitting possible duplicate AE as caller stated they already reported AE to previous agent. He had near all the side effects listed as well as severe allergic reactions listed. He hasn&#39;t been able to get out of the house since, felt like he had the flu. He has had the symptoms since; tiredness, headache, pain, terrible chills every day, joint pain, nausea, he was a hearty eater and he did not have a good appetite/ no appetite; he felt unwell, completely unwell, a sick feeling and it&#39;s pronounced; and particularly swollen lymph nodes, difficulty breathing at times, definite swelling of face and throat, dizziness and weakness. Caller provided these all started 2 weeks after he got the shot. Started on Saturday, 03Apr2021, and same thing happened everyday (going on). He called the weekend and after a couple weeks he called, the on call doctor and after his second call he was ordered to get to a medical facility/ urgent care facility (went to the doctor and it wasn&#39;t his regular doctor) in the weekend of 11Apr2021 and he has one nearby and they ran a test for COVID and it was negative, also tested for strep throat positive. He was given amoxycillin 30 tablets, 500mg tablets to be taken 3 times a day for 10 days for the strep throat, although he has not had any symptoms of strep throat which for him it is pronounced and painful, he can swallow, has no pain, no cough, nothing, he has nothing. His soreness and everything here was exactly what was in the manual was what he has going on and nothing else, no mucous, nothing like that. Confined to his house, has no energy to do anything chills and hot flashes. He has been taking ibuprofen 800mg tablets with food, 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening and got some relief from the chills and symptoms but not totally and it was waning in it&#39;s effectiveness after the first 3-4 days. All his symptoms were persisting and they had worsened after he started getting then for he guesses 4-5 days and then they kind of leveled as bad as they are now and haven&#39;t tailed off. He was ordered not to take the 2nd dose until he finishes all the amoxicillin and was told quite sternly not to get the 2nd dose until he finishes it. He has 12 pills left so next week sometime Tuesday or Wednesday and his concern was he finished that medicine and feels he would still have these side effects and doesn&#39;t know if he would build up immunity and maybe the 2nd shot won&#39;t be as bad. The nurse practitioner who worked with him at the urgent medical care place said the 2nd shot is a doozy and not to mix it with Amoxicillin as it might have a bad effect on the effectiveness of the strep throat. States he has had strep before and doesn&#39;t feel like that at all and nothing is wrong with his voice, throat or upper respiratory at all. He is supposed to get the 2nd shot tomorrow (16Apr2021), he was scheduled. He was afraid to do it as he hears it&#39;s worse than the 1st one and he is already relegated to his house and has to order in and not risk driving that&#39;s how foggy his brain was with what&#39;s going on his thinking is not straight from the pain. The outcomes of the events were unknown.

A 59-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, lot number: EM6208), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15Mar2021 11:00 (received at 59-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient just got his second Pfizer shot Monday 12Apr2021 10:45 am (lot number: EW0162) administered in Arm Right, and he got his first one on 15Mar2021. He wants to report what he thinks is a side effect. He does not know if it is related or not, but at the end of Mar2021/ beginning of Apr2021, he started having excess mucous. He has fits where he is trying to cough up mucous for 45 minutes. Ever since it started there has been a lot of mucous. He has been taking Benadryl and stuff like that. He headed to urgent care on 11Apr2021 but decided to go to the ER (emergency room) instead because he was having a mucous coughing spell. They checked for pneumonia, but it was negative. The chests x-ray was clear with no pneumonia. They are saying it is allergies, but he has never had a reaction like this with mucous.  He has been wearing his mask too. He knows the allergy season is supposed to be bad, but they said on the news the masks were actually helping with the allergies. That people were having less symptoms. They were contributing it to allergies, but he has never had them this way before. He wants to report because he is thinking maybe it was something from having the vaccine. He thinks the mucous first started the end of Mar2021 or the first day of Apr2021. He went to ER on 11Apr2021. He also went back and forth with the doctor. They gave him allergy medicine. The ER gave him codeine cough syrup and Allegra D. His GP has him on Sudafed now, Flonase, Allegra, and Benadryl. He has fits at night nothing seems to change. He is not sleeping because he is constantly choking and coughing every second. Last night, 13Apr2021, he finally fell asleep at 3 am and woke up at 9am. They do not want to give him prednisone yet. He would have to wait 2 weeks after his last shot for it. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 59-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 12Apr2021 at 10:45 (batch/lot number: EW0162) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 first dose on 15Mar2021 at 11 am (lot number: EM6208) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced excess mucous (started at the end of Mar2021 or beginning of Apr2021), has fits where he was trying to cough up mucous and allergies. The patient reported that he just got his second Pfizer shot Monday 12Apr2021, and he got his first one 15Mar2021. He wanted to report what he thinks was a side effect. He doesn&#39;t know if it was related or not, but at the end of Mar2021 or beginning of Apr2021, he started having excess mucous. He has fits where he was trying to cough up mucous for 45 minutes. Ever since it started there has been a lot of mucous. He has been taking Benadryl and stuff like that. He headed to urgent care Sunday 11Apr2021, but decided to go to the ER instead because he was having a mucous coughing spell. They checked for pneumonia, but it was negative. They were contributing it to allergies, but he has never had them this way before. He wanted to report because he was thinking maybe it was something from having the vaccine. He thinks the mucous first started the end of Mar2021 or the first day of Apr2021. He went to ER on 11Apr2021. He also went back and forth with the doctor. They gave him allergy medicine. The ER gave him codeine cough syrup and Allegra D. Her GP has him on Sudafed now, Flonase, Allegra, and Benadryl. They were saying it was allergies, but he has never had a reaction like this with mucous. He has been wearing his mask too. He knows the allergy season was supposed to be bad, but they said on the news the masks were actually helping with the allergies. That people were having less symptoms. On an unspecified date, excess mucous was reported as worsened. He has fits at night nothing seems to change. He was not sleeping because he was constantly chocking and coughing every second. Last night, he finally fell asleep at 3 am and woke up at 9 am. They don&#39;t want to give him prednisone yet. He would have to wait 2 weeks after his last shot for it. The patient also experienced &#34;feeling funny&#34; on an unspecified date. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest X-ray: negative for pneumonia on 11Apr2021; the chests X-ray was clear with no pneumonia. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The adverse events excess mucous, cough and not sleeping required a visit to the physician&#39;s office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome was not recovered for the events &#34;has fits at night nothing seems to change/ constantly chocking and coughing&#34;, &#34;excess mucous was reported as worsened&#34; and &#34;he was not sleeping because he was constantly chocking and coughing every second&#34;; and unknown for the event &#34;feeling funny&#34;.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Male patient (date of birth: 02/05/1962) received the 1st COVID Vaccine (Pfizer, Lot #: ER8731 and expiration date: 08/2021) on 04/09/2021 at 12:45PM. Client returned to the vaccine site on 04/30/2021, for his second dose. Client was checked in by the ancillary staff and then sat down with a nurse vaccinator at one of the vaccination stations. As the vaccinator screened the client, some medical concerns came up so the vaccinator went over to the lead nurse for a consult. Nurse received a brief report from the vaccinator, and then walked over to the vaccination station to talk to the client. The client explained to Nurse that he received his first dose on his left arm and about 2 days later, he developed &#34;numbness and tingling&#34; in that same arm and it has not resolved. As Nurse asked further questions, she discovered that the client also started to develop that same sensation, of numbness and tingling, in his right hand. The client described that it is painful, if poked in those areas. Nurse also asked if this feeling radiates anywhere else and the client explained that, if he sits for a prolonged period of time, the numbness and tingling will develop in both of his lower extremities and he needs to get up and walk around. Client reported that it is not painful in a way that he can rate it on a pain scale of zero to ten, but he did describe it as being &#34;abnormal for him&#34; and &#34;not comfortable.&#34; Client denied any known drug allergies as well as denied any past medical history. He stated he had his left index finger amputated &#34;years ago, but that is it.&#34; Nurse explained to the client that there are some concerns regarding the new onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine and that she would like to get a medical consult before deciding how to proceed with the second dose. Client agreed. Nurse sent a text message for a medical consult received an answer about 45 minutes later. The medical team recommended waiting to give the second dose until the client is assessed by either a primary care provider or neurologist. They also gave the client the option of receiving the JOHNSON and JOHNSON vaccine 28 days after the first dose, if the client does not wish to receive PFIZER again. Nurse then educated the client on the recommendations. The client expressed to Nurse that he is &#34;very healthy and does not go anywhere,&#34; so he does not wish to be seen by a medical provider right now. The client asked questions regarding vaccine efficacy in the first and second doses and Nurse addressed them. The client told Nurse that at this time, he would like to hold off on getting a medical assessment and did not wish to reschedule for a JOHNSON and JOHNSON vaccine. Nurse respectfully acknowledged his decision and educated him on V- safe and how to proceed if he changes his mind later down the road.

Suffering from full body aches, headache (even my teeth and eyes hurt), chills, uncontrolled shaking, followed by uncontrolled sweating, muscle spasms, nausea, severe pain at injection site, swollen and painful lymph node in left armpit.  Little to no sleep that night.  In a fog all day Sunday, low grade fever just below 100.  Went to bed early (around 8:30pm) with similar but reduced symptoms.  Pain at injection site has subsided by now.  Shakes and chills are far less but still there.  Still sweating, really bad body aches, headache, swollen and tender lymph node under left arm.  Challenge sleeping but did a little better.  Today, Monday, still in a serious fog.  No energy.  Other symptoms appear to be subsiding

Other symptoms after this event: unable to fall asleep for about 4 hours; feeling warm at times, with some minor chills; thirsty during this 4 hour period.

This headache condition has persisted for the last 7 days. At times it is mild and at other times severe . It makes you on edge ,causes loss of focus and disoriented. I rarely ever get a headache , maybe a handful in my lifetime. As of today 5/19/21 @8:40 AM my headache is painful even after taking 2 Tylenol hours ago. i am still dizzy and disoriented and moody. The headache is focused on my front left side , it feels as if someone is sqeezing  my head tightly. Today I may go to clinic . Not sure what they will do except say to stay in bed.

                                                Starting on the day of the vaccine (2nd dose)- I felt &#34;a warm, chemical and electrical sensation&#34; in my chest a few hours after the vaccine. The next morning, I was unable to have a bowel movement, when usually I am very regular.  I was not able to have a bowel movement for a couple of days.  I felt very constipated and would try to force myself to have a bowel movement.  I ate more fiber and fiber pills and drink more water, which was uneffective.  I  was finally able to have a bowel movement but it took a lot of force and would push the point of exhaustion and almost passing out. On 2/19/2021, I decided to seek medical care for my constipation, stomach cramps, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and shortness of breath. The doctor diagnosed me with Covid long hauler (I had a previous covid infection in 11/2020).  I was prescribe probotics (for constipation) and  rest for 2 months.  I am still feeling fatigue and having heart palpitations. They order ECG(normal) and blood work (normal).

                                                Vaccinated at 3:10 pm. Went for a walk at about 5pm for 40 minutes. Resting heart rate that day was 55. O2 was 98%. For the walk my average heart rate was 98. AM BP reading was 87/55. The longer I walked the more I felt a mental fogginess. By the end I could not even remember prayers I have known my entire life. Yes, I was praying or trying to. I honestly wondered if I was having a stroke. I got home and rested and it seemed to go away. I walk every day and  for the next 7 days I had the same effect, but to a lesser degree each day.   I got the first dose on March 18, 2021. Lot number 2613.  Same location. Just felt lethargic and run down for 3-5 days.

The clinical course was reported as follows: This past week he has been feeling kind of crummy, says he&#39;s disabled, and can lose track. He says his brain is scrambled a little bit since he got hit, says he passed out, was dead for a while, states that affects him quite a bit, and he says he loses track. He says when he tells about that, he didn&#39;t know he got the first shot and it had a little place that hopes it didn&#39;t mess up. He states he put on small wounds, corcetin. States when they did the shot, says usually they&#39;ll make you hold, ask you to hold the cotton ball in place, says they get a Band-Aid on tight and push down, says they put compression so it doesn&#39;t leak. He states this was loose when he got home, it was leaking like a little bubble, a little fluid. When he washed it, he washed it off. Right close to it, there were two other places.  He states when they gave him some steroid cream, he put that on there it inflamed the places where you have bumps and dry skin and a cut and looks like a little cut. Says when he put cream, it got inflamed and angry. He stated he was watching Dr, and when she calls it a cyst or something is infected, she calls it angry. He says there was a bunch where they put the Band-Aid, and he put just a dab of corcetin, believe that&#39;s what he had when he put, took it off the first time, and it had two bigger places that were a scab. He says once he put 2 by 3 Band-Aids and left it on for a couple of days, says he did this several times since last year or two, says to try to clear some of this stuff up, don&#39;t scratch, says he did get an itch in that location when he got the shot. He didn&#39;t scratch, said he wanted to pull Band-Aid off and scratch but didn&#39;t do it. He says it cleared up but he&#39;s been feeling a little funny, just maybe a little sick to his stomach, dry mouth, stuff like that. He says he didn&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem, says he had that problem like after 3, 4, or 5 weeks and all of a sudden he has a little episode where he gets to feeling funny, says his judgement is off and the brain things get a little not right. He stated he then fell a lot, says he&#39;s been falling a bunch of times in the last week, he&#39;ll feel better and it won&#39;t bother him. He says it&#39;s a cycle he&#39;s gone through since he lost oxygen. He doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s anything, it&#39;s confusing, says it has so many symptoms, and when he read this it has so many symptoms.  Confirmed patient was referring to COVID vaccine. He states he hasn&#39;t had eczema then most of it, sometimes he&#39;ll scratch, it will build up like a scab and he&#39;ll scrape it off, put some of the ointment on there. but a band aid on top, leave it down for a couple of days, after a shower, a couple of showers, it comes off. He says it clears it up, says if it doesn&#39;t, just wash, wash it hard, it scrubs the scab off.  He states the worst thing he had was his toenails, he had to work on them, had fungus things push under the nail, under the side, and he cut it. He used cortisone 10 on it, says they always quit making something that works well, states you know how you get a yellow toenail. He says he&#39;s been putting Neosporin on it. Clarified corcetin is Cortizone 10, it is pretty strong stuff. He says he puts it on these places on his arm using Neosporin. Attempted to clarify that itching began after use of Cortizone 10, states nothing like that, says it did itch a few days after still a little bit, there were three little places under that Band-Aid where they put the shot. He ended up putting Neosporin right when he took that band aid off it was itching, says he washed it good, then put Neosporin on it, says it&#39;s cleared back up to its normal roughness.  For event itching, he states at first it was almost a scab, but it was not quite a scab, it was wet like a little bubble. After the scab, when he got ready to take, it was itchy after the band aid was on there a couple of days, he took a shower, washed it, and put more ointment on it. Each time he took the Band-Aid off, he washed it, washed his arm, and put the Band-Aid back on. He did the same again and it&#39;s gone away.  He states he is feeling a little bit bad, his stomach is a little bit bad. He hadn&#39;t checked it lately, when he gets a fever, says 98.6 is about a half point to a point high. He was really, really tired, says he slept and slept and slept. Says this is similar to the cycle that he goes through with his brain injury, says it&#39;s the same cycle he goes through. He also stated he lost so much weight laying in bed.
