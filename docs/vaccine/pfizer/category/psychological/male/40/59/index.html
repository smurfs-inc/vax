                                                Per reporter: &#34;I received the COVID vaccine on 12/29/2020 (first dose). The first couple days I had a really sore left arm, but didn?t feel any ?side effects? until about Wednesday, 1/6 (about a week later). I remember waking up to a sore left side of my upper body. The left side of my neck, chest, arm, and lymph node (under my left arm) felt weird. It was until about Saturday night, 1/9, that I felt my left under arm lymph node noticeably swollen. I had a bad headache and loss of energy, and overall feeling unwell. No fever or night sweats to report. I was absent from work on 1/11 and 1/12, as a result.  1/13 was my first day back and feel better. The swollen left lymph node is no longer present, but still slightly tired. I did not seek Medical Care for my symptoms.

Drove to a nearby store and stopped, felt a bit disoriented when trying to call my wife. Drank water and waited at a store for approximately 15 minutes until I felt better. This was about 40 minutes after the vaccine was administered. When driving home still some discomfort/numbing of the tongue and throat. Ate at 1:30 and symptoms had stopped.

                                                I had difficulty concentrating and focusing on Wednesday evening, a little over a day after getting my first shot. The focusing/concentration issues went away by the next morning when I woke up, however I have been feeling very tired physically since then. I&#39;m yawning all day and have very little energy or interest in doing things I need to be doing.  I&#39;m not certain that this is vaccine related, and I&#39;m not super concerned about it yet as I&#39;m on Spring break from school, but I start virtual classes again on Monday and will be concerned if I&#39;m still super tired. If it doesn&#39;t go away by next weekend, I will likely resubmit/add on to this report if that is an option.  It is not a serious concern yet so I haven&#39;t contacted medical professionals yet, but I thought it might be a good idea to at least report that this has been going on to VAERS

                                                Starting at 8pm on vaccination day I got loopy and disoriented, and had a hard time speaking intelligibly.  I also had trouble with balance and fine motor skills.  Had some personality changes too: became very moody with erratic mood swings. The next day I slept all day because of exhaustion and aches. When I woke up on Wednesday (36hrs later) I was literally screaming in pain because of how bad my arm and shoulder hurt. It hurt to move it, and hurt not to move it.  It was excruciating and ibuprofen didn&#39;t seem to help at all. Throughout Wednesday I could hardly move my left arm. Getting dressed or washing my hair was very difficult and very painful.  I was also still very uncoordinated. My left armpits lymph nodes were so swollen that (1) it filled in my entire armpit so there was no more pit, just a very soft bulge, and (2) the fluid extended all the way to my chest and it looked like I had one breast and one pec.

The symptoms were so bad I stayed home from work on 1/12/21.  Over the next few days the rash improved and the headache slowly went away

                                                After 1st Pfizer shot I experienced the worst headache of my life 4-6 hours after the shot with localized pulsation in my right temporal region prior to the headache.   The headache persisted through the night and I could not sleep and did not decrease with over the counter medication, my pain was rated 9/10 to 10/10 in the same area the pulsation happened.  This headache continued for 4-6 hours at a severe level than for another 6-8 hours at a moderate to severe level.  I ended up checking in at the Emergency department that I worked at after my shift and got labs and CT scan, this was after my symptoms resolved.    I thought that I might have had a head bleed and wish I would have gotten my CT earlier when experiencing the symptoms.    I was not provided a vaccine disclosure sheet or any information on what to do if experience severe symptoms or what symptoms to expect.  I am upset that I was not provided guidance about what to expect and how to manage post vaccine symptoms, I would have gone into ED sooner with this information and feel I may have missed possible diagnosis due to lack of disclosure and guidance.

The patient had a cough and runny nose on 29Jan2021 and fuzzy headed, scatter brained and not sleeping good in 2021. The patient considered the events as non-serious. Asked if these symptoms were from the vaccine and if getting the vaccine cause a false positive on the Covid test. Stated Friday had cough and runny nose. He stated that it felt like he had a pretty bad head cold and would not think about getting tested but since Covid was around.

Sometimes when one gets stressed that one gets sick and may have contributed to his condition. Later clarified that this was for the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. The patient stated that the cough and runny nose worsened over the weekend and was a little better now and took alpha lipoic acid;minerals nos;quercetrin;vitamins nos (EMERGEN-C). The outcome of the events cough and rhinorrhea was recovering while unknown for the remaining events.

                                                I felt fine at first for the 15 minutes they held me for observation. But as I walked out to my car I quickly got heavy and tired and started to ache and have a headache. I had to rest in my car for a while before driving home. Once home I crashed immediately for around 4 hours in the middle of the day which is not like me. I had an important dinner meeting i had to attend for my livelihood. I thought I was feeling better but half way through Dinner  I started feeling bad again. Got to the point that I stopped eating and excused myself to get home and rest. Symptoms progressed rapidly. Unfortunately I was pulled over for a minor traffic stop and  tried to explain that I was having a bad reaction to the vaccine and needed to get home. They wouldn?t believe me  and torturously treated me like an OVI. I?m hoping that I can get some kind of documentation and or assistance. I have court on the 1st and it will be devastating if I am convicted. I was not intoxicated  and was not warned about the dangers of driving after the vaccine. Please call me. I need help

Started my work day from home with a meeting at 0900 and knew by 0920 that I had to take the day off.   Spent the entire rest of the day and night in bed. Fever peaked at 101.1F , nausea, constant headache, shaking chills and then sweats, extreme fatigue and full body severe muscle soreness. Light headed and very weak.  I slept all day until almost 1500. When I woke up my fever was gone. I&#39;m left tonight feeling hungry again along with some residual sore muscles and aches.  The fever responded well to Ibuprofen. I hydrated with water and Gatorade.  It pretty much felt like influenza for just under 48 hours. I feel like I&#39;m past the worst of it now, but I&#39;m not fully recovered.

                                                On April 18 and 19, following my 2nd injection, I had very bad chills and could not get warm. I was nauseous although I did not vomit. On April 22, I began having severe sharp stabbing pains just to the right of my belly button. It felt like I was being stabbed with a very hot knife, and after about 15-90 seconds, it would go away. Anytime I reached for something, bent over, twisted, turned or tried to hug someone, I would get this same pain and it would double me over in pain.  On Monday April 26 at 7pm, I finally checked into the Emergency Room  at the direction of my Primary Doctor.  They did a bunch of blood work on me and sent me for a CT Scan of my abdomen.  All of the blood work came back in normal ranges, and the CT Scan showed my appendix was &#34;borderline&#34; according to the surgeon. They consulted with Dr and decided to admit me for a surgical consult and further examination.  They gave me fluids and morphine through an IV for the first 24 - 36 hrs, and then switched to Norco by mouth. I continued having pain throughout my stay.  On Thursday, April 29, they took me to surgery for &#34;exploratory surgery&#34; with the intention of removing my appendix and looking around to see if anything else stood out to them that would cause me this pain.  They stated my appendix had scar tissue on it and they removed it, but said they did not know if this would stop the pain I was having.  On Friday April 30, I was released from the hospital at approximately 6pm.  By 9pm on Friday, I began having those same sharp, stabbing, burning pains in my abdomen again, now to the right of my belly button again and further towards my right side.  I also had sharp burning pain in the inside of my upper right arm, between my bicep and tricep muscles.  This pain continued on through the weekend occurring more frequently and more severe.  On Monday morning at about 1:30am, I woke up with severe abdominal pains all over and went into the bathroom.  I had diarrhea and nausea and felt like I was going to vomit.  Between 1:30am and 7:30am, I went to the bathroom 6 times.  I went to work on Monday and continued having abdominal pains and diarrhea all day and night.  On Tuesday, I went to the bathroom a total of 17 times. On Wednesday, I saw my primary Dr.,  who examined my abdomen and pains.  He suggested I take immodium for the diarrhea and a supplement for muscle pain, as he felt this was the cause of my pain. On Wednesday, I went to the bathroom 21 times and was very nauseaus.  I started the Imodium and it had no effect on me whatsoever.  On Thursday, I had to call off work because I couldn&#39;t stop using the bathroom.  By 4pm, I had been to the bathroom 18 times.  I returned to the ER.  They took a stool sample and did an ultrasound in the ER.  They decided to admit me again for surgical consult and pain management.  On Friday, Dr ordered another ultrasound of my abdomen, specifically my gallbladder, kidney, and liver.  He also sent me for a CT Scan with contrast.  They completed a total lab workup of my blood.  All of these results came back normal, and nothing on the images showed anything wrong with my organs.   On Saturday May 8, Dr came to the hospital to examine me. He stated everything related to my GI was fine.  He asked if I have back pain, which I told him I do.  At this time, I was in extreme pain and I couldn&#39;t even touch my skin. Dr attempted to examine my abdomen, and just by placing his hand on my stomach, I screamed in pain.  He then put his hand behind my back and pushed a little, and it cause extreme pain in my abdomen.  At this time, Dr suggested that maybe the pain is caused by something going on in my back.  Maybe a pinched nerve or something.  He ordered an X-ray of my upper and lower spine.  Later that day, the results of the X-ray came back and showed there was nothing wrong with my spine.  With these results, Dr then ordered an MRI of my lumbar and thoracic spine.  On Sunday May 9 at 1030am, I was taken to radiology for an MRI.  The initial report shows that I do not have any pinched nerves and nothing notable that would cause this type of pain in my body.   As of now, no diagnosis or explanation for the pain I am experiencing. The pain is gradually getting worse and at times I am unable to move at all without extreme severe pain in my body.  At times, my right groin hurts and I am unable to stand on my feet, as it feels as if I have pulled a groin muscle.  The pain in my abdomen takes my breath away and feels like I am being set on fire in that area of my body.  The pain no longer goes away and is constant, but moves throughout my right side from my groin to my shoulder only.  I am not able to put my right arm behind my back because I get this pain in the back of my shoulder area.  This pain is only on my right side at this time.  So far, there is no explanation for this pain.  I never had anything like this until I got the vaccine.

                                                I was vaccinated on 1/2/2021 and developed oral parasthesias the day of the vaccination. On day 3 after the vaccine, I developed a severe headache with ?brain fog,? confusion, and hyperacusis. The headache has now persisted for 10 days and was severe enough that I missed several days of work this week as I was unable to carry out my clinical duties. I was seen in ED this past weekend and ultimately followed up with neurology after the headache had persisted for 7&#43; days. The working theory is that I may have developed aseptic meningitis as a side effect of the vaccine and I am currently on a steroid taper which has resulting in partial but significant improvement in my symptoms. I am back at work but still experiencing a mild headache and facial parasthesias. I did request a Covid test in ED 1 on 1/10/21 and tested negative.

                                                About 3 minutes after receiving the shot, I became dizzy.  After 15 minutes, I was still dizzy.  I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

Once i would start to feel better after sleeping 4-6 hours. I get out of bed thinking I was better, then another hour or so later the symptoms were back, so I would go back to bed shivering uncontrollably off and on again, sweating and uncomfortable until falling back to sleep.. This lasted for about 48 hours, which started 72 after receiving my vaccination.  No adverse symptoms the first 2 days following the vaccination. I got vaccinated on Tuesday, 1/19/21 - symptoms started Friday, 1/22/21 - Saturday, 1/23/21.  Sunday, 1/24/21 I finally felt normal again.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

                                                On Monday I had the COVID vaccination. I noticed no side effects on Tuesday other than tenderness at the injection site. On Wednesday, I noticed light bruising up and down my arms. Thursday morning around 10 AM, I started to have side effect - some so severe they must be documented. At 10 AM, I felt lightheaded and had brain fog. By noon my head was pounding with a headache followed by an upset stomach. At 2 PM things started getting bad and continued to worse. It was not the headache or stomach that need to be noted but a sudden and severe onset of depression and anxiety. - Depression like I have not felt in years when I was at my worst. Throughout the day the depression worsened and by 7 PM, I was unable to stop crying and was overwhelmed with anxiety and  PTSD panic attacks. While I have the training to understand  this is temporary, - I am very worried about what I?m feeling , because there was no warning or mention of this side effect. I have the resources needed for this but people that are more fragile need to prepare for the sudden o set of critical/ debilitating depression.

Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mentioned he was a patient facing drug addiction counselor in training, smoke cigarettes but he has cut down to a half a pack a day, at most. The patient previously received flu vaccine on an unspecified date for flu vaccination and experienced soreness at the point of administration of his left arm. Concomitant medications included amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken from an unspecified date for ADHD. The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccine this past Thursday, 28Jan2021. The next morning (29Jan2021), he woke up with real soreness at the point of administration of his left arm, well beyond what he remembered for a flu vaccine. The second night (30Jan2021), the soreness progressed. It was hard to sleep on his left arm. It was like he had been punched. He had to sleep on his right side versus his left side. On 29Jan2021, the muscle soreness at the point of injection spread to his whole body, it was like aches all over his body. The soreness has gotten a little bit better day by day. He confirmed he got a rapid nasal molecular COVID swab test because he was just covering his bases and he tested negative for COVID-19 on 02Feb2021. He also experienced fatigue. The fatigue really started to set in on Friday evening (29Jan2021), it was like he got hit by a truck.  He was typically a high energy person and its very out of the ordinary for him to feel this way. He normally has class on Saturday from 9-noon but he had to cancel going with the amount of fatigue he was experiencing. He also had some cognitive fuzziness on Jan2021. His fatigue was still there, but it has gotten a little better. He was normally very high energy, but he missed two classes and skipped his internship today. He doesn&#39;t feel like himself. He also has had frequent urination which he noticed probably Friday night (29Jan2021), all the way up until now. However, he has been drinking a lot of water. The patient received a test/report showing he has no chromosomal issues and no likelihood of issues on an unspecified date. The outcome of soreness at the point of administration of his left arm and Frequent urination was not recovered; Muscle soreness/muscle soreness at the point of injection spread to his whole body and fatigue was recovering; it was like aches all over his body and cognitive fuzziness was unknown.

I lost all energy and struggled to get out of bed and walk. Laid in bed all day, took Tylenol, slept off and on. Didn&#39;t subside until 6:00pm the next evening when I broke out in a sweat and got some energy back.

I am an otherwise healthy individual.The doctor conducted an emergency  Cardioversion to return the heart rhythm to normal.

He couldn&#39;t walk or stand, complained of being dizzy with slurred speech and was throwing up a lot. 911 was immediately called. The EMTs during their assessment said his BP was normal but when he was asked his name, he started saying the alphabet&#34;ABC... XYZ&#34;.  He was transported by ambulance to ER. Cat scan showed he had a bleed on the brain.  The doctors told us it was because he had very high blood pressure, however where the bleed was, they said he wouldn&#39;t need surgery and that the body would reabsorb it over time.  He was admitted to the ICU and has been there ever since.  Several days later, he started having difficulty breathing and they discovered several blood clots in his right leg that had broken off into his heart and lungs.  He had emergency surgery to remove the clots in his heart (approximately 10) and was given heparin in small doses over an 8 hour period so that it wouldn&#39;t cause the bleed in his brain to increase.  The doctor should fill in the rest.

A 42-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL1284, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm (at the age of 42 years old) on 08Jan2021 14:30 as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There were no medical history (reported as none) and no concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (brand as Pfizer) for Covid-19 immunisation on 18Dec2020 (at the age of 42 years old) at 03:30 PM administered on the right arm. The vaccine was administered on a hospital. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. On 08Jan2021 11:00 PM, the patient experienced personality changes, headaches, and extreme fatigue, and also was unaware on conversations that he had. The symptoms lasted about 24 hours acutely, but for the 3 weeks afterwards, patient had high blood pressure and insomnia (2021). It would seem that patient had cerebritis from the shot since an unspecified date in 2021. Adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. There were no treatments received in response to the events reported. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered with lasting effects.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is too limited to make a meaningful medical assessment. Based on the available clinical data, the event encephalitis most likely represented an intercurrent medical condition not related to vaccination with BNT162B2. This case will be re-assessed when relevant follow-up information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                myositis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 43-year-old male patient received  first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown) on an unspecified date in Dec2020 reported as around the end of December,  at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date after he received the vaccine he had right arm pain and swelling (states it was in his bicep brachial radialis in the muscle) which is the opposite arm of the injection site. He had an MRI done on an unknown date that showed myositis. He thinks could be due to the vaccine since it started two days after he received the vaccine. His pain peaked at about a week and a half and now the pain was improving and the swelling was down. He still had function in the right arm but when he strained it would hurt. His concern was that the reaction may be an autoimmune reaction and the first response was muted. He was worried the second dose may elicit a larger response. At the time of the reporting the patient was recovering from the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between the myositis and vaccination with BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. Additional information regarding onset latency, relevant medical history, concomitant medications and detailed clinical course around the event onset will aid in comprehensive assessment of the case. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The pain gradually increased, became more intense, and more constant.  Mild fever and chills started happening, and I took Ibuprofen.  By about 4 days after the vaccine, the abdominal pain was severe enough that I had some difficulty walking and I couldn?t sleep at night.  Pain was 6-8/10.  I went to the ER, and CT scan with IV contrast showed 18 mm appendicitis.  I underwent laparoscopic surgery and it was found to be perforated.  It was removed.  I am currently recovering in the hospital.  I received the vaccine as a health care provider at my hospital, specifically I am a practicing pediatrician physician for over 10 years.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

A 43-year-old male patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm left from 11Jan2021 to 11Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient states about 24 hours later he felt foggy, disoriented, and dizzy (all three occurred on 12Jan2021), states he then woke up at 3 am this morning and had a lot of numbness on right side of face and arm and had a hard time swallowing (both occurred on 13Jan2021), states a couple hours later he went to hospital, went to ER and had to do an MRI, states the MRI of brain and neck came back clear and checked out, states doctors concluded it was an adverse reaction to vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                I had some sort of reaction.  I was glad to get the shot and was not nervous about getting the shot. 5 minutes after the shot I felt something cold go down my left arm from my shoulder to my hand.  A minute or two after that both my hands went numb, then both my arms went numb.  I asked others around me if anyone felt anything and everyone else was fine.  A minute or two after that both my legs went numb. I started to black out but made it to a chair before this happened,  I drank some cold water and felt awake about 5 minutes later.  30 minutes after that i felt comfortable enough to walk.  For the rest of the day i felt like i was legally drunk and felt lots of pins and needles on the back of my hands and feet. I did not feel dizzy or nauseous at that time. i also felt a lot of pressure on the inside of my skin all over my body. I&#39;ve never felt anything like that and it was a bit uncomfortable.  The next day i was too dizzy to walk without becoming very nauseous.  I still had pins and needles on my feet. i had chills as well which i guess is a good sign.  my appetite was fine. i felt clear-headed as well.  Two days after the shot i felt slightly dizzy and by the third day i felt fine except for minor muscle cramps all over my body.  For the three days after the shot i also had some pretty strong forearm and calf muscle cramps and my arms (biceps and triceps) felt pumped up like i just had a great arm workout, but they weren&#39;t swollen at all.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

Follow ups with ENT, Neuro and PCP have continued with Vestibular Rehabilitation. While in ER, the MRI, MRA, CT, CT with Contrast was done, showed no signs of anything that could have caused this. Ironically tracking back, I received my 2nd Dose of the Pfyzer Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. and this occurred on February 13th at 2:15 a.m. I have not had any other issues before this nor any signs of damage to the nerve or ear that regularly affects Vertigo Patients per my Neuro and ENT. The incident took place 4 weeks and 2 days after the 2nd vaccine. 2 days after the 2nd dose, I experienced Low grade fever, chills, and body aches that lasted only 12 hours, but nothing with the 1st vaccine nor anything after the 2nd dose issue until the Vertigo.  I am unable to drive, conduct my job, which requires me to go to emergency calls and carry a Taser (CEW). I have been off work since this occurred and still not eligible to go back to work.

                                                Rapid onset of blurred vision and partial blindness, confusion, inability to form complete or coherent thoughts or sentences.  Started with blurred vision around 5:45pm. I immediately sat down on the couch, and tried to explain to my wife what was going on. However, I was unable to complete the thoughts I was trying to form. Eventually I began confusing words (such as saying &#34;king&#34; when I wanted to say &#34;kind&#34; or &#34;kite&#34;) and was unable to produce more than one word every 1-2 seconds with great difficulty. Then a headache came that was both extremely painful and somehow &#34;painless,&#34; as if I was observing myself having the pain as a bystander. All of this happened within one minute of onset.  I laid down and after about 10 minutes from onset the difficulty speaking subsided and I could make complete sentences, although with some difficulty. After around 20 minutes from onset my vision had fully returned.   I called 911 out of concern for stroke-like symptoms. The dispatcher sent an ambulance, and I was taken to the Hospital Emergency Department for treatment.  Around three hours after the onset of the incident I was diagnosed with a complex migraine and discharged.

No chest pain, no fevers, chills, cough. He saw his PCP for these symptoms who ordered EKG and CXR 1 day PTA which per patient were normal--plan was for referral to cardiologist. However on the morning on presentation around 6:45 AM after taking an elevator for work he began feeling lightheaded and lost consciousness, awakening on the floor. He went home as he was not feeling well however proceeded to have another 2-3 episodes of loss of consciousness at home witnessed by his girlfriend--the later 2 occurred while lying down and were not clearly associated with any presyncopal symptoms.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

About 4 or 5 days after the symptoms started, he had an outpatient repeat pcr test and nucleic acid rapid test (unspecified dates) and they both came back negative. He is on his way to get his second dose and he is asking if the symptoms could be side effects from the vaccine. Outcome the event fever was recovered on an unspecified date.

By 1600 I had extreme fatigue and severe mental fogginess.  This fogginess lasted approximately 24 hours.  Other reactions included chills, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, headache as expected.  I feel the mental effects could put patients in danger if healthcare practitioners are not aware of the possibility of this and receive the vaccine while on duty.  I did not experience this with the first dose.

                                                Starting from the first night after the vaccination and each and every night after that to date of this form completion, I have had extremely interrupted sleep.  I have woken up several times in the middle of the night (i.e., 2 am, 4 am, etc..). Each time I have woken up and felt wide awake and difficulty going back to sleep.  As a consequence each of the following days after this poor sleep I have been in extreme fatigue and not able to function properly.  I do not have any other notable side effects.  No fever or major headaches.  This disturbed sleep which coincidentally started right after the vaccination is highly concerning for me, especially since it has happened on 4 consecutive nights.  This has not happened to me before.  In the past even if I woke up in the middle of the night, I would fall back asleep relatively quickly.  Furthermore, it has not been the case of this type of lack of sleep for this many consecutive nights. Another observation is that my feeling of hunger seems to have increased for some reason.  Even in the middle of the night when I wake up I have felt great hunger and then starting in the morning that hunger continues.  This is more hunger than normal for me.  My diet and eating patterns have not changed compared to what it was before getting the first dose of the vaccination. Given that today is Martin Luther King Day and a Holiday my PCP is closed, so could not make an appointment or report this to her.  I will call my PCP again tomorrow, 01/19/21. If this disturbed sleep continues, then I am sure how I can properly function during a normal work day on the job. Given all the above I am also concerned about the second dose of the vaccination and what side effects that may result in.

Would sit up and move around and headache would dissipate with 30 minutes.  Am not able to lay on back or on side.  Received booster on 1/26/2021 and have had same  events.  OTC pain killers are not working.  Once I initially wake up I move to recliner and fall asleep.   We have a sleep number bed and have not had this issue in the past, although don&#39;t know if it is the vaccine or a unknown subtle change in day to day activities.

The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2.

Caller states he has an appointment with a neurologist and he&#39;s trying to get it moved up. Caller states his doctor wants to do a lumbar puncture to rule out MS or Parkinson&#39;s that sort of thing. Caller states but at this point they are trying to rule things out. Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

The second night after the vaccine the tinnitus was quite bad, then the next day it settled down to be two or three times as noticeable as my baseline tinnitus was prior to the vaccine, at least. At this point, normally don&#39;t hear it, but when I&#39;m going to sleep it&#39;s very noticeable. Ten weeks later, it&#39;s steady and hasn&#39;t gotten worse or better since  it steadied out on the third day.

Upon waking up up my body aches were only moderate so I went to work. 26 hrs after vaccine, I&#39;m still having mild/moderate body aches.

                                                Got First Pfizer Covid vaccine on 06JAN2021. About 4 days after that I started noticing allergy symptoms and mild intermittent wheezing. Then on about the 5th day after, my lower back pain increased, causing significant sciatic pain worse than ever before. On 22JAN21 I ended up going to urgent care for increased breathing problems, and also had to have pain management appointment within days as sciatic pain was debilitating and also significantly interfered with my sleep.  After steroid injection (In spine)on FEB 3rd for sciatica/back pain, and steroids/inhaler treatment for the breathing stuff, I would say I was pretty good to go . I didn&#39;t think too much of these unusual events for me both in timing and severity. On 12FEB2021, I got my second pfizer covid dose. I 14FEB I started noticing allergy symptoms again, and slight shortness of breath, used inhaler I had from before to help as breathing in seemed to not give me full breaths. Then, on 15FEB2021, in the evening out of nowhere while walking, my lower back/sciatica pain came back in full force, as if my leg were a lighting rod like before. So it almost seems as if the covid vaccine triggered an inflammatory reaction in my body. I am not certain, but because the series of events seem the same and in timing after my first covid vaccine, I figured I would at least report it.

My stomach has been in constant pain.  I?ve also had a slight fever and a very sore arm.  Tylenol and rest has worked for the fever and arm, and I&#39;ve had some addition body aches.  Not sure how much is due to being in bed for an extended period.  Also on Friday (about 24 hrs after getting the shot I was pretty fatigued.  I just woke up from 13 hours of sleeping.  But the stomach cramps/pains was severe and prompted me to try to find a way to report it, especially since it doesn&#39;t seem to be too common.  It&#39;s been really bad.

I&#39;m very disappointed and not sure if I should get the second shot or not given how I&#39;m feeling now.  Before the shot I was perfectly healthy.  I eat well, exercise and have never in my life experienced tinnitus or any type of hearing problem.  This shot was the ONLY thing that could have caused this.  I&#39;m not sure what to do next or if I should get the second shot which could make it worse.  I&#39;m very worried because the ringing and aches have been constant for 10 days..  some days worse than others.

                                                On March 25, 8 days after the vaccine shot in my left arm, I began experiencing intense pain on the left side of my neck and head. By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

Within two hours, I had a bad headache. I became slightly agitated that day. The headache lasted throughout the day - I took Ibuprofen but that didn&#39;t help much. Sunday, the headache was still there. It wasn&#39;t a migraine; but intense. I was agitated.  My agitation level grew and my irritability grew and the headache I had the whole day. Sunday evening about 7 pm the agitation and irritability got very intense - I was having impulse control issues with it. I don&#39;t have anger issues but I wanted to yell at TV or throw my phone. From 8- midnight, I was lethargic and fatigued - I didn&#39;t have the energy to roll over;: had extreme anxiety I was sweating and having weird thoughts like harming my animals and harming myself; my  mind was racing and then I would get really depressed. Until about midnight, I have had past struggles with anxiety and depression - there had been a past feeling like this - but it was really extreme - it was worse night of my life. Lasted four hours, and finally I slept for about one hour. I remember thinking, I finally can take a breath. My racing thoughts were gone and sweating was gone. The irritability had subsided enough that I could try to gain control of my thoughts again. I had really bad nightmares the rest of that night; I was confused _ I didn&#39;t know where I was - confused about that - occurred about three different times until I got up at 5:30 am for work. To summarize, for the next week, I had moments of anxiety and depression. I had mental fog. I played pro football - and I had post concussion syndrome. It was very identifiable to what I had had. So this was occurring in moments - forgetful; depressed; and random moments of anxiety - like I was going to go play football again. 7-10 days - it got a little better each day. Ten days it took to subside. I still exercised and taking extra fluids to get back to my normal.  Exercised help. No fever occurred. With COVID - I had had a sense of anxiety and depression and some mental fog when I had COVID I didn&#39;t have it to this extreme.  Did not get the second dose.

ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.  Completed 5 day course of high dose steroids, 6 days of IVIG and on ongoing PLEX. Neurological improvement noted 3/25

On Friday 23Apr2021, patient woke up with severe headache, per wife was confused. Then had a generalized convulsion. Presented to the ED, had a second seizure witnessed by medical staff. Workup with MRI, CTA and LP were notable for an elevated CSF protein to 79, CSF Glucose 73, otherwise no structural abnormality was identifed. Patient was clinically improving after being treated with seizure medications as of 26Apr2021. The adverse event result in Emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization. Covid 19 pcr nasal swab on 24Apr2021 was negative. Outcome of events was unknown.  Follow-up needed. Information about batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering a plausible temporal relationship , a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported event seizures, CSF glucose increased, CSF protein increased, headache, confusional state cannot be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                8 minutes after the vaccine i satrt to experience some tingling to my left earlobe. It then radiated to my left jaw line where i felt an onset of numbness. the numbness hten radited to my left shoulder all the way down to my left extrremity digits. atthat time i waived over a nurse who waived a physician who check my radial pulse, pulse was noted in the 70&#39;s. At that time the physician  asked a EMT perofrmed four evalautions of my BP and my BP was reading syttolically between was 140-150 and my datolics was reading 110-115. Throughout that time the numbness was still to my left side of my face and shoulder and arm and to myfingers. This was only localized to those two areas.  At that time it was requested for me to go to the hospital to seek medical attention. I deferrred to going home to check my BP and at that time i was running 150/100.  The numbness was still present and mu thought process my body was stressed out. I then took a nice cold shower with breathing techniques. I did orthastatics on myself. I then followed with my PCP the next day and she ordered bunch of labs, CRP, triponents, CBC, bubble study and chest x-ray and EKG. ALl the testes were deemed to be negative.  My systolics were 120/80 when i saw my PCP, however i was recommedned to take the whole week off and was recommended to go back to work after the new year.  After five days the numbness went away to my digits went away but not to my face.  My grips were equal. I had no Bal palsy nor stroke.  The numbness sill persisted up till day 9 and the umbness to the face went away.

So much that I was worried my muscles would begin to sieze up and cramp.  I had warm clothes and 5 blankets and could not get warm for over 2 hours.  Elevated heart rate and breathing.  Nothing warmed me.  Eventually (and with ibuprofen) the incident subsided.  I felt weak and just &#34;off&#34; with slight body aces and fatigue for the next day and a half.

Felt fine Monday morning. Monday about 11 am began to feel tightness in chest, thought it was bad heartburn. Pain kept me awake Monday night, and continued into Tuesday morning. Called the doctor, was sent to urgent care. Urgent care detected elevated tritonin and had me transported to the emergency room. Elevated heart rate and rising tritonin levels had me admitted to the hospital. Given heperin and a beta-blocker, given a CT scan, and monitored over night. On Wednesday had a echocardiogram and then a heart catherter and imaging, which showed a healthy heart, no plaque, no blockages. Tritonin levels and heart rate returned to normal. Released from hospital on evening of 3/10.

                                                In the past, I have had a very mild  and intermittent case of tinnitus.  However, immediately after receiving my first Pfizer dose -- within an hour -- I noticed that my tinnitus got much, much worse and louder -- it became a constant loud hissing in both ears.  More than a week later, the tinnitus is almost debilitating --  CONSTANT and never getting any lower.    A &#34;whooshing&#34; sound that just won&#39;t stop.  It&#39;s maddening.    I&#39;ve never had tinnitus this bad in my life and there is no reason for it to have gotten worse besides the vaccine.    It is high-pitched, and constant, and this is two weeks after receiving my dose.     It&#39;s only getting worse -- there has been no hint of quieting down.   I am very upset over this and it&#39;s obvious that my tinnitus got severe directly after I got the first Pfizer vaccine.   I&#39;ve been living at home alone for the last year so it&#39;s certainly not due to loud music or anything like that.

This is the first of two reports.  This physician which was a 49-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on the right deltoid 17Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated that he received the first dose of the COVID vaccine and he had a pretty bad rash that started 3 days after (noted on 20Dec2020). The rash has since improved since it started but it took forever to improve and mentioned that he was super itchy at night. He also used to be itchy in the day, but now it was just at nigh which was driving him insane. The physician also mentioned that it was a raised maculopapular rash. It started on his neck on the left side as well and increased of both elbows and behind his knees (it was diffuse). He mentioned that he was able to carry on during the day, but he cannot sleep great. He mentioned that it reminded him of poison ivy - the thought of it happening again makes him want to cringe especially with all the terrible stuff he has seen he was scared that his skin will slough off or its going to kill him or something. But overall, he was more concerned about the itching. The physician took over the counter antihistamines and hydrocortisone cream. He did take one dose of expired liquid prednisone (from 5 years ago that his daughter who had for an ear infection). He downed a sip of prednisone and it prevented his itchiness for a day and now was thinking of getting on steroids. The physician also stated that there was one guy he worked with had something similar (AER 2021010285). He received the same lot number and has been itching like crazy. They have both been trying to figure out what to do. It was clear as mud. Then, last week (Jan2021) they saw each other, and they were both having the same issue and suffering separately. They had no exposure to anything similar besides the vaccine. The physician stated that he was about due for 2nd shot. He has been researching and trying to figure out what to do, if he should get the second dose or not. He reported this to VAERs and talked to CDC, but nobody has any recommendations or information. He also tried to look up trial data to see if anyone had reported a similar rash, and he did not find anything. He was calling to see if he should get the second dose, and if Pfizer has any information on this rash being reported. Outcome of pruritic rash was not recovered; recovering from maculopapular rash and unknown for the remaining event. As per causality: He was unsure. It was most likely from the vaccine as he has done nothing differently.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

                                                Early Wednesday morning (2/24) around 5:00AM, I woke up to extreme pain in my left arm, primarily along the upper forearm, inside of my elbow, and lower bicep. There was no trauma or unusual behavior prior to onset of pain. It came on suddenly and worsened with extension of the arm. Symptoms worsened over the next few days, with pain intensifying and extending down into my hand and up into my armpit and shoulder. I tried ice, Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, and Vicodin for pain relief, but nothing really helped other than the ice. On Saturday morning (2/27), I visited Urgent Care and was diagnosed as brachial plexis neuritis, aka Parsonage-Turner Syndrome by Dr and prescribed Prednisone and rest. On Sunday evening (2/28), I went to the ER seeking pain relief and second opinion. On Monday (3/1) morning, I was seen by ED doctors, and then three different neurologists. After doing an ultrasound which ruled out vein/artery thrombosis, the neuro team diagnosed Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. They&#39;ve prescribed Gabapentin, Acetaminophen, and Ibuprofen for pain relief,  a follow-up neuro consult, an MRI for next Friday, and an EMG in a few weeks. Last night while sitting and reading, the same pain began in my right arm, similarly to how it presented in my left arm last week. The right arm pain is less than the left arm pain, but at this point seven days later, I am experiencing neuropathic pain in both arms.

I also felt like I had a bit of a lump in my throat. I called the Doctor&#39;s office and spoke with a nurse who suggested I take Benadryl.  I did so at around midnight and that seemed to take care of things.  Went to bed and woke up the next morning feeling ok (though groggy from the Benadryl).

It was as if I&#39;d burned my mouth with hot coffee. Pain was intense enough to wake me at night and make eating solid food difficult. I had to use topical benzocaine to get through meals.   The episode lasted a full week before subsiding.

Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL9269) on 02Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. On 24Mar2021, patient had some facial numbness and mild palsy in the left side of the face. He stated he had some previous nerve damage in his neck that had not been acting up in about a year, but it was acting up then. He stated it was the feeling like when you go to sleep on something, and it felt heavier. He asked what he should do, if he should seek medical attention and for information on this. After providing information from the Prescribing information, he asked if the Bell&#39;s Palsy went away in these individuals in the clinical trials? He stated his wife just said that the left side of his face was sagging. He stated he did not think it was a stroke though because he could move that side of his face and can articulate everything. He felt loopy but did not feel like it was a stroke. Patient reported that basically he felt numbness on the side of his face and cheek. There were reactions when he smiled, it seemed a little bit off. There was a weird feeling and numbness in his face. The numbness went from his cheek up on to the temple area and jaw area, the numbness was primarily on the left side of his face. Patient had nerve damage in his neck already. Patient wanted to know if he should go somewhere with it, was it ok, what was going on with the numbness in his face. Patient thought the numbness in his face and cheek had worsened. Felt like face was heavy on that side or drooping:  Caller reported that looking in mirror, the left side of his face did not react the same. Patient&#39;s face felt like it was heavy or drooping on the left side, but that it pulls up higher. Patient reported that his face looked ok. Mouth pulls weird: Patient reported that this could be from his prior nerve damage, it was like he had got some weird palsy going on in his face. Patient stated that he just wanted someone to tell him dude wait it out, go to the emergency room, go to the doctor. Patient inquired if the facial numbness was because he had prior nerve condition and if the Covid-19 vaccine had exacerbated his existing nerve condition. The outcome of the events were unknown.

                                                He felt very bad the night he received the 2nd shot of Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on April 27. He even joked he probably would die that night. He also complained that despite his protest, the person who administered the shot insisted to inject on his shoulder joint.  He developed a bigger-than-quarter-size bruise on his right inner arm the next day. He was feeling tired the following days. On May 4 around 3:30, I heard he was making loud noises. I came to his side immediately. At the time I thought he was making louder than usual snores. I nudged him gently but he didn&#39;t respond.  After about 15 seconds, the sound stopped, and he had no breath. I then called 911 within 10 seconds, tried to do CPR on him. It took EMS 6 minutes to arrive even though we live very close to a fire station in a well-accessed urban area. EMS worked on him for about 30 minutes before transported him to hospital. They continued to work on him for a while. He never regained breath.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I developed symptomatic palpitations that started on 12/23 in the early morning, awaking me from sleep.  Palpitations became so frequent that I went to my PCP&#39;s office, where I was found to have an abnormal rhythm on my EKG (non-sustained V-tach, runs of 4-5 beats at a time).  I then went to hospital where I was admitted to observation in the ED for monitoring.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

Unable to eat anything I started to vomit stomach acid. It is now 2 days later and I still have a degree of nausea and am unable to work today. I got the 2nd vaccine on Monday.  It is Wednesday and I still have no appetite for food and have lost about 7 lbs since the weekend. I feel that I am starting to round the corner to recovery though.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

Tried to re-arrange pillows but could not get arms to complete the process even though fully mobile. A minor amount of weakness in arms/legs and tingling across the lower face, particularly on the right side. Once up, had an inability to form words even though thoughts were coherent. Minor difficulty swallowing water. Speech slurred badly enough to be incomprehensible to my wife. By 7:30 we arrived at the hospital where symptoms were improving.

A 51-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: 28Dec2020 (as reported)), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at single dose, as a preventive measure for Covid. Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure). Concomitant medication included amlodipine besilate and amlodipine besilate (NORVASC 5 mg) both for blood pressure. The patient reported, &#34;I received my first dose of Covid19 vaccine on Monday (28Dec2020) and it is now Friday and I am still sick and I am wondering how long these symptoms typically take to get better from because it seems like it is day 5 now so&#34;. When probed for events the patient stated, &#34;Everything on the list, fever, chills, aches, my joints ache, some muscle pain, headache, tiredness, injection side swelled up. I was not nauseas or anything like that. I still have fever today. I did not get symptoms till like 2 days later and then my fever was up to 101.7. It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever.&#34; The patient mentioned, &#34;I kind of like started feeling poorly on the 29th (29Dec2020) late at night but on the 30th (30Dec2020) I had fever and everything.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: is always good on an unspecified date, body temperature: 101.7 on 30Dec2020, body temperature: 99 on 01Jan2021 (reported as &#34;I did not get symptoms till like 2 days later and then my fever was up to 101.7. It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever&#34;), and laboratory test: unknown results on Dec2020 (reported as &#34;I did go for full series of stuff, checkup but that was more than 2 weeks ago&#34;). The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

                                                I am a pediatric critical medicine physician and received my COVID-19 vaccine at my workplace.  1st Pfizer EH9899 (on Dec 18, 2020) and 2nd Pfiszer EL1283 (on Jan 9, 2021).  Both IM through my left arm. Directly for about less 48H post vaccination I had muscle pain that were self-resolved.  On Jan 18, 2021, I started having funny sensation (like having a foreign body) over my left eye medial /innercantus area. The next 2 days I started to have pain over my left external ear canal, then it progressed into pain over my left lower jaw, left vertex of my head, inner side of left eye. My SS progressed on 1/30/21 at around 3:30 PM to numbness over my left sided tongue and left sided lip. Then on 1/31/21 at around 5 AM, I started having left facial paralysis. I have left BELL&#39;s PALSY which was confirmed. following a negative non-contrast brain MRI to rule out stroke and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR test. I start taking Prednisone 60 mg daily and Acyclovir 1 g TID on Jan 31, 2021. To this date I still have left facial paralysis but not worsening.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest.

On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                I had to wait for 15 min and was released. I started getting a really bad headache about 5 min later above my ear. I then got nauseous. I went back to vaccination location and was given a cold compress. I was taken to the ER and given Benadryl and multiple nausea meds. I was there for about 5 hours. I was released and instructed to drink lots of water. I was told by the doctor that my body was doing what it was supposed to do, but to come back if I got worse. I took 2 days off and returned to work with no remaining complications.

                                                I was given the first shot and sent to an observation room. I felt slightly flushed, it went away. By the evening, I started to feel flushed again. I commented to my wife that I felt like my blood pressure was up. (I don&#39;t have high blood pressure). That is the best way I can describe it. I can&#39;t recall if the ringing in my ears was noticeable at that time. My the next day I could still feel the flushed feeling and the ringing  was clearly noticeable and increased over time, until it can overcome TV or someone speaking to me. I also had a feeling of persistent light headedness. About Feb 3 I had pain in my ear and went to a clinic. I was diagnosed with a minor ear infection (right). I was given and took a course of anti-biotics. The infection went away but the ringing never did, sometimes it would lessen, but always louder than prior to the shot. I went ahead and took the second shot on Feb 11, thinking my problem was probably and ear infection. I the ringing could get so loud it would wake me up and keep me awake. On Feb20 I woke up to very loud ringing, nausea, and general feeling of unease. I went to a clinic the next day. I was told there was probably some inflammation and was given a steroid shot. After about 4 hrs the ringing lessened and I felt better, the first relief I had from the start. On Feb 23, I saw my ENT Dr. He gave me a course of steroids and ordered a brain MRI. The MRI came back with negative results...no abnormal indications. The ringing is starting to increase again as of the last several days.

A 51-years-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 14Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 51 years as single dose. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. Historical v for covid-19 immunisation accine included the first dose of BNT162B2 administered on left arm on 24Mar2021 at age of 51 years for covid-19 immunisation and experienced no issues. Patient reported that after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, he had a fever for 8 days and was diagnosed with pneumonia on 21Apr2021. Patient reported that he was tested for both Covid-19, Influenza A, and Influenza B twice on 19Apr2021 and 21Apr2021 and tested negative for Covid-19 and influenza both times. Patient reported that he had no pre-conditions and that he was feeling great the night before he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, 13Apr2021. Patient reported that he was planning to go to work following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 14Apr2021. He began running a low-grade fever (102 degrees) on 14Apr2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and then his temperature flared up to 103.5 degrees on 15Apr2021. Fever: He received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at 10:45 on 14Apr2021 and about 2:00 in afternoon on 14Apr2021 was the first fever that was significant. The last fever he had on 21Apr2021, his temperature was 103.9. He was put on antibiotics for pneumonia. He contacted the on-call nurse for his company. The on-call nurse advised him to see a doctor on Saturday, 17Apr2021.He went to the doctor on Monday, 19Apr2021. The doctor only ran a Covid-19 swab for testing and a flu swab. His doctor did not do blood work and stated that the patientwas experiencing an ill effect of the Covid-19 vaccine and sent the patient home. He went back to the doctor on Wednesday, 21Apr2021. When he went back to the doctor, the staff performed a chest X-ray and ran 4 different blood works to see what the patient had. The second Covid-19 test that he received on 22Apr2021 was performed with both the rapid test and the test that was sent off. Both Covid-19 tests came back negative. SARS test on 22Apr2021 was negative. 508-3 High Sensitivity CRP: One of his numbers that was parts per liter, 3 is considered to be high risk and he had 300 (300&#43;) of whatever it was on 21Apr2021. He went back to the physician and was given another steroid shot an additional prescription. He had been back to the doctor 3 times since then. Fever: His fever was 103 consistently after 15Apr2021. 508-3 High sensitivity CRP: This value showed abnormal. The results said that relative risk was greater than 1 mg/liter and high was greater than 3. 1000 CBC with auto differential on 21Apr2021: The abnormal results were red blood cells measured at 4.38; hematocrit measured at 13.82; MCHC measured at 36.4; Neutrophils measured at 84; Lymphocytes measured at 12; and absolute Lymphocytes measured at 0.57. He wore a Garmin and that it recorded that he received no more than 2-3 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights. He didn&#39;t know anything about pneumonia previously and that he had specifically told his physician&#39;s office everything about what he was experiencing. He told his physician about the wheezing in his chest (on 17Apr2021), cough (on 16Apr2021), fever, and chills (on 14Apr2021). His physician told him it was a normal reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine and sent him home on 19Apr2021. He then consulted Google and started to realize that his side effect were very atypical. Wheezing: When he breathed really light, the crackling would continue. If he breathed shallow, the wheezing was audible but if he breathed deeply, it was not. The pneumonia was in the left side of his chest. He was still being treated for the pneumonia. He has his last dose of medication tomorrow, 27Apr2021, and that he was also being released to go back to work tomorrow. Cough: He had a little cough that would then go away. The cough began late Friday, 16Apr2021. It was interesting because it wasn&#39;t a main part of the illness. The cough was just kind of a hacking cough every once in awhile. The cough was not continuous like go and go and go and stop. The cough came, went away for awhile, then came again.The cough being worse was relative. He was coughing more than he did on Wednesday 21Apr2021, Thursday 22Apr2021, and Friday 23Apr2021. The cough was consistent more so at night when he laid down. He would probably say that it was a different feel towards the cough but it was still a cough. The cough was still the same volume but not the same effect. Headache (on 18Apr2021): He had been waking up with headaches in the morning and going to bed with them at night. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, the headache was due to dehydration from the fever and night sweats. Once he got away from the dehydration headaches, the headache got better but he had woken up with a headache the last few days and had a headache at bedtime a few nights in a row. The headache was usually a frontal headache and this morning, 26Apr2021, the headache was toward the back of his head. The headaches last a few hours until he started moving around. On Saturday, 17Apr2021 he experienced a migraine that would not go away. He didn&#39;t usually get migraines. The migraine lasted hours if not for a day and that the headache was something furious. Sunday 18Apr2021 was pretty much the same thing with the headache. Because of the massive fever, he couldn&#39;t eat anything at all (17Apr2021). The headache was mostly due to low blood sugar and dehydration. Appetite: His appetite improved after his second doctor&#39;s appointment on 21Apr2021. The second provider was a lot more straightforward and advised the patient that he needed to start taking care of himself and trying to force himself to eat. He forced himself to eat on 21Apr2021 and by Thursday 22Apr2021, he had a full appetite and was craving food again. Shortness of breath (Apr2021): Patient reported that the shortness of breath was just from being fatigued. Patient reported that he got out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He was unsure when the shortness of breath began because he was moving very little, but that he noticed the shortness of breath on Monday, 19Apr2021 when he got up to go to the doctor.On Friday 16Apr2021 and Saturday 17Apr2021, he had a really good break.On Friday 16Apr2021 from 9 AM to 1 PM, he had no fever and it was like the sun was coming out, then the fever hit really hard. The same thing happened on Saturday, 17Apr2021, but the fever free period lasted maybe a little longer. His fever returned and that the afternoon of Saturday 17Apr2021 was the worst he had been the entire time. On 13Apr2021 to get away from arm soreness, he did a few laps in the pool. On 13Apr2021 he had a new best time on the 100 in freestyle in the pool and that he felt really strong going into 14Apr2021 to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. There was nothing that would have indicated that he had anything going on before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Up until Saturday, 17Apr2021, he had only been taking Motrin and just taking 2 tablets. He had no break in between fevers and chills and was not able to get ahead of the fever with the Motrin. There was a long stretch where the Motrin wasn&#39;t working and his temperature didn&#39;t get below 100 for several days. He tried to cycle acetaminophen in beginning Saturday 17Apr2021 to try to get the acetaminophen in between the Motrin doses.  When he went back to the doctor on 21Apr2021, the provider told him that he could take 3 to 4 Motrin tablets at a time but not to exceed 4 doses per day. He never took more than 3 tablets. Motrin was generic ibuprofen. Night sweats (on 21Apr2021): The last couple of nights have been the same. He had a fan on to keep a little cooler and that it was 61 degrees outside and he felt the night sweats. He had a buckwheat mat that was cool that he put on the floor to stay cooler with the night sweats. Come Thursday, 22Apr2021, he said we&#39;re done with this and he couldn&#39;t sleep from it (Apr2021). Last night, 25Apr2021, he knew that he had night sweats because he was sweating at night and the temperature in the room was 64 degrees. AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room. AEs required a visit to Physician Office for fever, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chills. Outcome of events was unknown.

My fever was 102.8 when I first woke up. I was very nauseous and my fever felt worse. My thermometer would not read any more until my temp came down. I can only guess how high it got but at least 103 degrees. I took Advil Liquid Gells and then my fever broke. I was actually scare for my life. In March I actually caught coronavirus and developed  anti bodies for Covid. I can only guess my body was fighting for it&#39;s life.

A 52-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 12:00 PM  (at the age of 52-years-old) via an unspecified route of administration at an unspecified dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included hypertension, high blood cholesterol from unknown dates. Allergy information was not provided.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was administered the vaccine at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility.  Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN/HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), fenofibric acid (FENOFIBRIC ACID), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine on Monday 28Dec2020. A PCR test for COVID was done on Tuesday and a rapid test on Wednesday both of which were negative. The patient experienced some scratchy throat late Friday night on Saturday, 02Jan2021 the patient called out sick to work as a cough had started. A PCR test was done on 02Jan2021 and he received results Monday (4th) as positive. The patient continued to say that the cough had subsided, as he took Delsym.  He lost taste and smell on Monday. He reports running a fever that varies from 99-101.5. He took Tylenol and Motrin to control the fever. In addition he has experienced fatigue. It was also reported, in contradiction of the above reported chronology of events, that the onset date of events was 25Dec2020 (CONFIRMATION PENDING for onset date of events relative to vaccine administration). The patient experiences of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue resulted in a physician office visit (date not specified).  The patient underwent lab tests that includes a PCR test on 29Dec2020 which was negative, a rapid test on 30Dec2020 which was negative and a PCR test on 02Jan2021 which was positive. Treatment for the events was reported as Motrin and Tylenol for fever and Delsym. for cough. The clinical outcome of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue was reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 28Dec2020, and COVID-19 PCR test positive on 02Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: None, this was the first dose. No other vaccine administered on the same date. The patient had no events prior vaccination within 4 weeks. In all his life. He had vaccines that received and had no adverse event or side effect whatsoever. He had had the regular flu vaccine early November. The patient experienced feeling anxiousness in the brain, Heaviness in the head, feeling weak in Feb2021, Localized soreness and pain in Jan2021, Goosebumps tingly sensation in head, Blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat is getting higher and higher on 04Feb2021. The patient could not take Benadryl as he cannot tolerate Benadryl. With Zyterc he does not have secondary effects like he does with Benadryl. The first week after getting the vaccine he only had kind of had localized soreness and pain in the area. He later clarified it was in the area where got the injection, vaccine. He just had pain soreness in that area. Other than that he had no side effects at that time. The third week, initially stated as, about 5-7 days ago he started to have a feeling of anxiousness in the brain. He could feel anxiousness and sensation in his brain that he did not feel before. It was like he had the flu kind of thing, but he did not have a temperature. However, the feeling is in his head. It is like heaviness feeling from the flu in his head. He has been having the heaviness in the head feeling for 4-5 days. He later further clarified and initially clarified the localized pain and soreness was noticed the second day, the day after getting the vaccine. This only lasted a few days.

This 52-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number and expiration date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 09Mar2021 at 09:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.

Not too bad but a bit concerning. About 30 minutes after the second shot (09Mar2021 09:30) patient began to get very light headed. The feeling intensified further over the next 20 minutes until the feeling became almost a psychedelic experience. his pupils were tiny, the my perceptions were off any his &#34;way of thinking&#34; had changed. he had take psychedelics in my youth (but not in 30 years) and it were not for that previous experience and ability to stay calm he was very well may have ended up in the emergency room. The whole experience lasted till he went to bed but the &#34;peak high&#34; lasted about an hour. The next morning he again felt like someone who had done a psychedelic drug the night before. The only other effect was he would get an uncontrollable tired feeling once a day for about 10 days. No treatment received for the adverse event; Prior to vaccination, the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19; Since the vaccination, the patient not been tested for COVID-19; The outcome of all the events was recovered in 2021.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

The first day:  I took the covid-19 vaccine Pfizer shot on Thursday the 4th of March; there was pain at the injection site just as any other vaccine I have been administered during military service.  After the shot I felt tied, and my left arm did hurt from the shot, I started to feel irritable (angry or even aggressive), my chest became tight and my heart rhyme felt somewhat off causing me to start coughing and sometimes uncontrollable to the point I could not catch my breath I thought about seeking medical attention but did not..  The second day:  Pain in my left arm went away at the injection site, tiredness went away, and the feeling of irritable (angry or even aggressiveness) went away, tightness in my chest and coughing went away. I have been having a chronic pain in my left arm for about a year and after the shot the pain was gone I noticed that on the second day. I did notice my body temperature was up and down showing symptoms of histamine reaction but not out of control.

The took my vitals and found the my blood pressure had dropped to 85/45.  They called 911 and hit me with an EpiPen.  I never blacked out.  After another 10 minutes the fire department arrived and they took vital signs; all normal.  Another 10 minutes and ambulance arrived.  Vitals in the back of the ambulance were fine.  Got to the emergency room and vitals were fine including ekg.  Was released from the hospital about 4.5 hours after the initial shot.  I feel a little sluggish today but otherwise fine.

                                                Chronic tinnitus significantly increased in intensity/volume the day following the first injection--I estimate about double the volume. In both ears. After 12 days it has not subsided at all. The increase in severity is causing secondary headache, jaw clenching, sleeplessness, irritability, hearing issues.

The next day (3/7) the right side of my face was numb and showing symptoms of what doctors later decided was Bells Palsy. on 3/7 I had fatigue and general feeling bad like I had the flu. On Monday 3/8, I was feeling worse and I called the advice nurse who advised I go to the  Emergency room due to right face partial paralysis, numbness, and face drooping. They diagnosed Bells Palsy and prescribed Valtrex and prednosone. From 3/9-12 the right side of my face was numb, droopy and I had ear pain and a lot of fatigue. By Saturday 3/13 I was feeling better and have gradually gotten better through today 3/26. I still have numbness in my right cheek. and occasional tingling in my lips. My doctor has advised me to go ahead and get the second dose of vaccine tomorrow 3/27. Also, during the week of 3/7 - 3/12 I had some dizziness and a general foggy feeling in my head.

I held three fingers for him to identify, he correctly answered. He has a small gash on his forehead.  His heart rate came up to 70, 20 minutes after episode. Refused to go to urgent care.

I was diagnosed with colitis in the ER and was admitted for several days for treatment due to the severe blood coming out.  CT scan showed severe inflammation, and stool sample showed blood and lactoferrin marker high.  I was given many antibiotics and fluids and was released home on February 14th, 2021.  I am still receiving treatment with oral antibiotics, and appointments with my physician.  I had to be absent from work for over 7 days.

                                                Within approximately a couple of days from the first of two COVID19 Pfizer injections, I developed a progressive, systemic, neuro/neuro-muscular inflammatory pain response.  The inflammation and pain first manifested in my left wrist and hand, greatly worsening recent symptomology that may have been the start of a carpal tunnel syndrome.  The inflammation and pain then progressed to my right wrist and hand and right shoulder.  Then they progressed to my left shoulder, under my clavicles, my hips,  and my upper lumbar/lower thoracic region of my spine.  Muscle groups tightened and hurt, chief among them my hamstrings and upper back.  All within days.  The inflammation and pain were severe, especially from the early a.m. (3 or 4 in the a.m.) to waking hours.  And the conditions left me nearly debilitated and incapable of sleeping well or performing many ADLs.  Then, on Monday, March 29, 2021, I saw an orthopaedic for the pains in my wrists and hands, and he prescribed me a steroid for a preliminary diagnose of bilateral carpal tunnel.  The inflammation and pain throughout my body decreased considerably after only two doses of the steroids.  That led me to seek a consultation with the rheumatologist.

                                                Leukocytes in urine; urinating blood; Dark colored urine; couldn&#39;t sleep; anxiety; sweat; arm pain; lightheaded; Abdominal Discomfort; prostate infections; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for himself. A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 24Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 54 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cholesterol. The patient was diagnosed with BPH a few years back 2016 or 2017 and had a uralist in 2019 and that resolved his issues. The patient had been on no BPH meds and back to normal since that procedure. Co-suspect medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) from an unknown date to 01Apr2021 at 40 mg, 1x/day for blood cholesterol. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced prostate infections, and abdominal discomfort. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced arm pain, and was lightheaded. He described the arm pain as he had deltoid pain but he also had pain like he had been hit from his right pectoral down his arm to about 4-5 inches above his wrist. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, sweat, urinating blood, and dark colored urine. The patient was concerned with the dark urine so he stopped taking atorvastatin, and called his physician who said he didn&#39;t need it anyhow. The patient visited the urologist office and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) as treatment for dark colored urine, urinating blood and prostate infection. On 06Apr2021, the patient experienced leukocytes in urine. Relevant lab data on 06Apr2021 included a urinalysis which resulted in leukocytes and blood &#43;3. The action taken in response to the event dark urine with atorvastatin was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events prostate infection, and abdominal discomfort was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events arm pain, and lightheaded was recovered in 26Mar2021. The outcome of the events couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, and sweat was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of the events urinating blood and dark colored urine was recovered on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the event leukocytes in urine was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the serious events Prostate infection, Blood in urine, and Urine color abnormal are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drugs. Relevant medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may provide a plausible explanation for the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021450744 same patient/SD, different AE/dose

Was sleeping 12 plus hours a day without feeling rested in the least. No problems with sleep. Also had heaviness of chest - felt like rib cage made of iron- this dissipated by the 28-29th. No excessive cough or fever, did have dyspnea with any exertion and this continues but seems to be lessening. Was not able to work due to fatigue. Yesterday remained tired but felt noticeably different-felt lighter-and today seems promising.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense.

This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

The first dose of the vaccine, the pain started the second day and the injection site got swollen. But this second dose was within 2 hours of my vaccine even more and overwhelming fatigue.  - aches, chills, muscle cramps, coughing, sweating - those lasted three days; headache - ever present and felt like head was in a vice; breathing was an issue - asthma was triggered on Sunday  - I started prednisone  - informal dr consultation with a friend - on Tuesday because of the asthma and by Friday I was feeling halfway better again and by the following Sunday about 75% better. 9 days later I was back at work. It took that week back at work though to get back out of the funk and by the following weekend I was close to 90%. Pain in the shoulder lasted about two weeks - it was quite tender for that long.

It stopped in the evening but got constant low headaches afterwards. Around 5pm, felt like a change in taste (saltier taste) that was temporary. Has uncomfortable wrist pain like twisting a screwdriver too much. Started feeling itchy today after 9 am. Face was swollen after waking up today and has subsided greatly since. Had very low fever last night and now feels like no fever. Right now, feeling has a lot of saliva and then have to swallow and little uncomfortable in arms and knees, and weakness. Only took one Aleve pill last night. Around 4:30pm, felt a little blurry for 5 to 10 seconds.

A 55 year old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, age at vaccination 55 years old. Medical history included Diabetic from 2013 (Diabetes is fairly under control. He has no super high readings. His diet is better); blood pressure (blood pressure abnormal) from 2013; ongoing overweight (obviously he is overweight) from an unknown date; and heart (disorder) from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for an unspecified indication; lisinopril for blood pressure (abnormal); and lovastatin for heart (disorder), start and stop dates were not reported. Patient is taking an unspecified over the counter multivitamin. There were no other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient is due for the second dose on 9April2021, but he tested positive for COVID-19 on 01Apr2021 with a PCR test described as oral saliva test. Patient was negative on a rapid test on an unspecified date. Patient wanted to know if he could reschedule the shot and when is it recommended. The patient had a coworker who tested positive, he decided since his throat was scratchy that maybe he had got it, then two more employees had gotten COVID-19 so he got a rapid test that was negative. On Mar2021, he stated he stayed home because he was experiencing mild congested in his head/congested in his head, which it still actually was, and he lost sense of smell completely. He was really tired, sleeping a lot, had congestion in his ears, and he can&#39;t smell anything. Patient had no fever, and his lungs were clear (unspecified date), so he commented it was deceiving since he feels fine like he can do whatever he wants, then he gets exhausted and sleeps. He stated he can&#39;t work for a whole week. He stated he is assuming his first dose of the shot is helping with it. Patient stated he is doing well, he has it (COVID-19), but he feels pretty good. Outcome of congested in his head was not recovered, while unknown for the other events.

                                                Approx. 16 days after my Covid-19 shot, I began hearing loud ringing in both ears that doesn&#39;t go away. It has continued and doesn&#39;t stop. Volume fluctuates. Sounds like crickets or an electronic hum/buzz sound. Very disturbing and it&#39;s hard to concentrate and hard to sleep. The research I&#39;ve done indicates this is Tinnitus.  I don&#39;t know yet if this is permanent.

Two days later I started having diffuse sporadic and intermittent tingling on various parts of my body.  That lasted about 2 days in its greatest severity.  On day 6 post vaccine, I was walking in an airport and developed chest pain, tachycardia, and shortness of breath out of proportion to my level of exertion.  This chest pain, shortness of breath and tachycardia with minimal exertion (a flight of stairs.  A walk to the end of driveway.) has persisted since then.  A cardiac w/u with Echo and  treadmill stress ECHO were negative.  I also have intermittent fatigue, headaches, and a mild &#34;brain fog.&#34;

On Friday morning, at 6-7am, less than 24 hours from the time I received my vaccination, I was experiencing chills and could not get warm. I tried to go to work...well, I did go to work. When it became apparent that I was not going to get warm, I left work. When I got home, my wife made me breakfast between 8:30 &amp; 9:00am. After i eat, I slept under a sheet and two blankets...fully dressed for 5 hours. When I came to, it was the first time all day that I felt some warmth.

Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.

Today while at work in my office, the ringing became very loud, and has stated that way all day. I?ve never had this before in my life, other than if because of loud concert or such 20 years ago.

                                                I&#39;ve had both the first and second shot, with the second shot initial side effects occurring 10 minutes sooner and lasting  about 6 hours longer.  2nd wave effect occurred 3-4 days after shot;  it&#39;s only been 2 days since the  2nd shot, so that effect hasn&#39;t hit yet.   Note that  I had similar reactions to the flu vaccine&#39;s for 17 straight years , with the exception of the brain fog. Flu shot reactions stopped when I started taking Amway  Double X multivitamins and tripling up on Vitamin A, C, Zinc and echinacea 3 days before through after the vaccine.  Shot 1 - initial  side effects: 40 minutes after shot within a mile of returning to work from hospital, I suddenly got lightheaded and very tired with brain fog creeping in. Since that was closer than home, I continued  on to work hoping it would soon pass.  Brain fog,  dizziness and fatigue all  continued to worsen, and I was taken home. Effects lasted 9 hours. 3-4 days later the symptoms all came back and lasted 2-3  days, with the addition of temperatures in mid to high 96 range. My normal temperature is a degree low at 97.8.

                                                Pt reported he got the second COVID vaccine at 8:33 am at the  Center at an event run by Health Clinic. At 10 am he began to feel unwell describing &#34;disorientation&#34; which upon further explanation seems he is describing difficulty with his proprioception, ie not able to tell where his body is in space, and disequilibrium, ie having to stop and hold on to something while walking. This lasted most of the day and subsided by evening. He has continued to have ongoing shorter episodes 3-4 times per day lasting 5-10 minutes. In addition he has noted increasing weakness in his right thigh, particularly when going from sitting to standing and the through swing while walking. He describes these as &#34;paralytic attacks&#34; that occur once or twice per day and last hours. Both symptoms are similar to those he had post CVA in 2019 and greatly improved with PT and home exercises. In addition he has noted fecal urgency and fecal incontinence in the last couple of weeks, he is unsure if this is directly related to the vaccine.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

He said his lower body felt like he&#39;d been in a car accident. He couldn&#39;t keep anything down to take pain medicine all day long so was miserable all day until about 4pm when he was able to drink some water and take some Vicodin, which did not help. He was up and down all night long with the headache and body aches, and I gave him Excedrin about 6am and that finally started alleviating the headache. He took it again at 11am and was able to eat then, and is gradually been feeling better throughout the day. He was finally able to take his regular meds so now the body aches have subsided (48 hours after injection/36 hours after onset of symptoms).

                                                Right Foot started hurting the night after the vaccine. The next day, it hurt to  walk on it. Mainly around the base of my 2nd and 3rd toes. The next day it hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t walk on it and saw the doctor. A red area had developed on top of my foot at the base on my toes. Doctor though could be Gout but didn&#39;t really look like it and usually that is in the big toes. Plus the timing of this issue and my vaccine were suspect. Had X-ray on that Friday, two days after vaccine and everything looked fine they said. I was prescribed Celebrex  and over the weekend took two per day due to the pain. I stayed in bed all weekend and pain got worse before taking another dose of medicine which helped for a while.  Swelling continued to be about the same or a bit more and the redness moved over to my big toe and then up my foot around towards the right side. Today my right side of foot is really soar now as well and still can&#39;t walk on it and still swollen. Doctor at a urgent care sports medicine location prescribed me Prednisone steroid to see if that helps. But so far 5 days after vaccine and my foot is still swollen, red across the top and so painful it keeps me up at night and I can&#39;t walk on it. I&#39;m hoping the steroids work.

On 3-15 and 16, I felt like I generally like I  had a flue bug. I felt better days later and then around March 21-24th I&#39;ve had a pretty continuous headache and neck ache which I have not had before the  vaccine. Lack of energy and feeling crappy. Scheduled for second vaccine April 2nd.

The first night after receiving my first vaccine I got the chills about 16 hours after my shot went away after a few hours. Woke of the next day with my post acute syndrome symptoms  much worse than I had prior to shot,  my fatigue in my legs were to the point I could hardly walk, my brain fog and tremors  were much worse, that lasted about 1 day then the next two nights I woke up in the middle of night with severe sweating. I was then felling like I had before the shot. Then about 4 days after receiving the vaccine the post acute syndrome symptoms again were much worse than before. This last for about 2 weeks then gradual worked back the my original feeling of fatigue, brain fog and tremors  that I had prior to vaccine

It was a level of disorientation I have never experienced before in my lifetime.  I fainted one time and was having extreme difficulty getting my bearings and walking and was simply in total &#34;mental disarray&#34;.  I was having difficulty producing words, a prolonged stutter, you might say.  I was shaking.  The local paramedics came and I was taken to the local ER.  Because I was having difficulty speaking, the paramedics (and later the physicians) thought I might have had a TIA.  An MRI on 04/07/2021 at 5pm produced a negative result.  So i can only attribute my reaction to the vaccine.  It was very significant, and i thought it made sense to report it.

A 58-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8734) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:00 at age of 58-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It also stated the patient was one of the most vulnerable against virus so he took the Covid-19 Vaccine. Medical history included ongoing cardiac failure congestive diagnosed probably 10 years ago, ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed probably 20 years ago, ongoing dialysis for 3.5 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing unspecified blood thinner. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t take any blood pressure medications and that she knew the patient took a blood thinner. Caller unable to provide further detail for the patient&#39;s medications as she doesn&#39;t have the patient&#39;s list of medications with her. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EP7534) injected in left arm in Mar2021 at age of 58-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fatigue after the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that it was hard to determine the cause of the fatigue because the patient was on dialysis, but that the patient has been more fatigued since he received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was a compromised fellow with a host of pre-existing conditions as far as heart disease, diabetes, and dialysis. Caller was calling in regard to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she was calling to report a bad reaction that her husband, the patient, received on Sunday, 04Apr2021, following his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Approximately 3 hours after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient had a full blown seizure at 15:00 on Sunday, 04Apr2021. Caller reported that she had to call emergency responders following the patient&#39;s seizure. The patient was doing better but the experience with his seizure was quite traumatic. Caller stated that if it was going to happen, it was going to happen to us. About 3 hours after receiving his Covid-19 vaccine on 04Apr2021, the patient became real sluggish and his speech started getting slow before the seizure occurred. Caller reported that the patient made a gradual descent downwards. Caller reported that she swears the patient has not been the same as far as fatigue goes since the patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior. Caller reported that she thought the fatigue was maybe from dialysis. The patient started to get slow just before the seizure, about 2.5 hours after he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was laying down following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s breathing was off. The patient&#39;s breath was heavier. Caller reported that after she noticed the patient&#39;s breathing was off, she asked the patient if he was ok. Caller reported that this is when she noticed that the patient&#39;s speech was really slow and that he was experiencing confusion. The patient has had no more seizure activity. The patient was still being monitored in the hospital. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t remember any of it. It&#39;s hard to say if the patient&#39;s sluggishness and fatigue were ongoing. Caller reported that she couldn&#39;t go see the patient while he was in the hospital but that the patient&#39;s voice sounds much stronger. For Confusion and Speech: Caller reported that the patient seems to be back/ returned to normal. Caller reported that she knew that the patient&#39;s cardiologist went to see the patient. The patient&#39;s cardiologist said that there was nothing that happened to the patient&#39;s heart, that what the patient experienced was not a heart issue, and that the event had no effect on the patient&#39;s heart. The medical staff stated that the seizure the patient experienced was related to a blood pressure drop. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s blood pressure was very low on 04Apr2021. The patient required a visit to Emergency Room for event seizure, no visit of physician office. Admitted on Sunday, 04Apr2021 for seizure, and still hospitalized. For investigations: Caller reported that the medical staff at the hospital definitely did lab work but she was not sure if any imaging was performed. Caller reported that she has no results available for tests that were performed. The outcome of events confusion and &#34;speech started to get slow&#34; was recovered in Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021380129 same patient, different product(dose)/event

                                                Had my 2nd COVID vaccination shot at 2 pm on Monday, January 11, 2021.    Next morning - moderate pain in upper left arm/shoulder (place of injection). Working full shift.    Around 4 pm on Tuesday (after almost 3hrs OR case) - feeling very tired. Completed the working shift at 6 pm. Minor to moderate headache started to develop later in the evening. Two pills of Tylenol at 9 pm, another two around 2 am - while headache was getting worse.  @6:30 am Wednesday - informed managers that I&#39;ll have to stay off work because of bad headache (7 to 8 from 10), called EH as well.    During the day - mostly staying in the bed. Tylenol, water, tea with lemon, apples for hydration. Headache -- up and down (between 4 and 8), occasional fatigue and nausea (after staying upright more than 10-15 minutes), left upper arm pain, moderate pain in joints (knees, hips, low back). No fever.   Troubled night-time sleeping because of headache. 7 am - informed managers and EH about my condition, Got approval for another day off - with request to have a C-Test after that. Similar feeling and treatment.    Slow improvement during the day. Around 5 pm - feeling good enough to start moving more actively, headache and shoulder pain on low level, though getting tired quickly still.    Much better sleeping. No symptoms in the morning. Had a COVID test before returning to work.

                                                Approximately 60 seconds prior to emergency, patient felt a sense of panic (first time ever).  Stated to me (wife) &#34;I feel like I am having a panic attack&#34; as we walked on to a parking garage elevator at 12:30 pm on 1.22.21.  As I turned to push the button to go down, leaned against the wall of the elevator. His eyes fluttered and back, he was a little pale.  When I turned around, again, he fainted and fell face down on the elevator floor.  He never stopped breathing and had no convulsions.  He was out for less than 30 seconds. When he came to, he got up by himself with minimal assist from me (911 was already on their way).  He did not remember saying that he felt like he was having a panic attack; but he remember the fear/panic he felt just prior to.  He was oriented x3.  I had him smile, stick his tongue out and speak to make sure it was not a TIA or stroke and there were no symptoms of that.  His bladder did release.  He went by ambulance to the ER (we were on a mini vacation to celebrate his birthday). They did a CAT scan, checked his blood sugar twice, EKG twice, complete blood work panels and urinalysis  All tests were either normal or negative.  They found nothing.  His BP was normal for the first 30 minutes at the hospital, then increased.  But has been normal ever since (he checks it daily). Absolutely no other symptoms since that episode.  He met with our PCP on 1.29.21 as a follow-up and she directed us to complete this form. She has ordered a consult with a Neurologist and that is scheduled for 3.10.21.  His second shot for the vaccine is due on 2.9.21.

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 06Mar2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pain, high cholesterol, and testosterone low, joint pain, bone pain, muscle pain, any place in his body had pain, and doesn&#39;t have good memory, all ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydrocodone for pain, ongoing atorvastatin for high cholesterol, ongoing clomiphene citrate for testosterone medication because it was low because of his age, ongoing colecalciferol (Vitamin D), ongoing ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), ongoing oxycodone for pain, and unspecified eye medication. He had many different medications that he was taking. Historical vaccines included chicken pox vaccine for immunization and shingles vaccine in Jan2020 for immunization and experienced pain all over. The patient stated that he was a torture survivor and he has been taking pain medication because of him being tortured previously. He was taking medications for the pain, clarified to be hydrocodone and oxycodone. These medications kept his body stable. He was able to sleep and relax. One day after he received his Pfizer COVID vaccine (07Mar2021), he started feeling the pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse but the pain used to be stable with the way he was using his medicines. But now his body was not stable. Any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously because of the damage of torture but now it all came up after the COVID vaccine. Every piece of his body hurt even if he takes his medications. He still had the pain and his body was so weak for about 4 to 5 hours. He used to be able to do his business all day but now after about 3 to 4 hours on his feet he got so tired and he needed to sit. He didn&#39;t know why this happened. He has talked to others that have received COVID vaccines and none have had this kind of reaction like him. He has asked them about it. It was very frustrating to him on an unspecified date. Every month he sees a physician. He would like for Pfizer to contact him with further questions, he can&#39;t understand the pain. This was really killing him especially when the pain goes to his bones. He will keep him up until 3 in the morning and he stays awake on an unspecified date. He then took medicine and he had to wait for 30 minutes for it to start working and then he will be able to sleep. But other than that, the pain jumped. He has had the chicken pox and the shingles vaccines and none did like that. The pain was not going away in his muscles or joints. And now he was getting a headache on an unspecified date, it was really frustrating. He didn&#39;t have good memory from the torture. This morning, when he woke up, he had the pain in his joints and his bones. He didn&#39;t like to use too much medication. He liked to use it only as he needs it. Pain medications are strong. But this COVID vaccine somehow made him need to use more medication and then that caused him to have a headache. His pain should get better with his medications but today, he had pain all over him and he didn&#39;t have any energy to move. He didn&#39;t know how to explain it. The COVID vaccine had really kind of made him weak. Sometimes he drinks a lot of cranberry juice to try and take the vaccine out of his system and it was frustrating because he hasn&#39;t ever been like this. When he had pain like this it reminded him of his torturing and what had happened to him. When the pain came on strong was when it reminded him of that. The medications he was taking were supposed to kill the pain. That was the reason he got so pissed and was trying to ask what was going on. This COVID vaccine is not safe he believed because it has been almost 10 days and it was not helping him. He was still not good. After he got his COVID vaccine on 06Mar2021, he had a little bit of small itching, not much, just a little bit that made him feel not comfortable with it. That was why they kept him for 20 minutes after his vaccine. When he got back home, he was okay, it was nothing serious. But then the day after his COVID vaccine on 07Mar2021, his joints, his muscles and his bones had pain. On 06Mar2021 the itching lasted about 20 minutes. He felt like he was chewing his lip, he was a little uncomfortable and he felt his ribs moving quicker. Nothing happened but he could feel it. He tried to chew his lips a couple of times, but not that much. But after that, he had pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine, 07Mar2021. By the time this vaccine started getting into his body, it was really hurting and getting worse. He had the shingles vaccine and for 1 1/2 to 2 days, he had pain all over and then 2 days after it was all gone, he was back to normal life. The pain was gone. With this COVID vaccine he thought that maybe it was going to be the same but it was not the same and it was hurting. The shingles vaccine was last year in 2020, 3 months before people knew about the coronavirus that was when he got the vaccine for shingles, so maybe Jan2020 was when he had the shingles vaccine. He had no medical conditions or heart and chest problems. No other vaccine he has taken has ever had this type of side effect to him. He took his shingles vaccine in his right arm and the COVID vaccine was in his left. With both he had the same start of having the bad pain. This COVID vaccine goes deeply to the body. The vaccines job is to wake the body. The vaccine&#39;s job is to wake up the body for the virus. The body has to make some kind of soldiers to stand up on the virus and this COVID vaccine had actually made his body weak. After the vaccine is supposed to wake the body, little by little the side effects are supposed to go away. His body was not learning this vaccine. It kept fighting to learn whatever was in this COVID vaccine, his body can&#39;t learn it and fight it. That was the reason his body got weak and the pain has not gone away. His body is still in alert and that&#39;s why the pain was still there. His body was still fighting. Somehow it didn&#39;t match the inside of the body. Maybe for some people that this will happen to, they will be okay but for some they will not be okay. It is not because some people have nothing wrong with them. The patient recovered from itching and discomfort on 06Mar2021; not recovered from any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously/ pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse/ pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine; while outcome of other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 59-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, lot number: EM6208), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15Mar2021 11:00 (received at 59-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient just got his second Pfizer shot Monday 12Apr2021 10:45 am (lot number: EW0162) administered in Arm Right, and he got his first one on 15Mar2021. He wants to report what he thinks is a side effect. He does not know if it is related or not, but at the end of Mar2021/ beginning of Apr2021, he started having excess mucous. He has fits where he is trying to cough up mucous for 45 minutes. Ever since it started there has been a lot of mucous. He has been taking Benadryl and stuff like that. He headed to urgent care on 11Apr2021 but decided to go to the ER (emergency room) instead because he was having a mucous coughing spell. They checked for pneumonia, but it was negative. The chests x-ray was clear with no pneumonia. They are saying it is allergies, but he has never had a reaction like this with mucous.  He has been wearing his mask too. He knows the allergy season is supposed to be bad, but they said on the news the masks were actually helping with the allergies. That people were having less symptoms. They were contributing it to allergies, but he has never had them this way before. He wants to report because he is thinking maybe it was something from having the vaccine. He thinks the mucous first started the end of Mar2021 or the first day of Apr2021. He went to ER on 11Apr2021. He also went back and forth with the doctor. They gave him allergy medicine. The ER gave him codeine cough syrup and Allegra D. His GP has him on Sudafed now, Flonase, Allegra, and Benadryl. He has fits at night nothing seems to change. He is not sleeping because he is constantly choking and coughing every second. Last night, 13Apr2021, he finally fell asleep at 3 am and woke up at 9am. They do not want to give him prednisone yet. He would have to wait 2 weeks after his last shot for it. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: ER8727, Expiration Date: Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 at 14:30 (at 59-year-old) at single dose in upper left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides. Concomitant medication(s) included hydrochlorothiazide/ lisinopril (LISINOPRIL/HCTZ) hypertension; citalopram; trazodone for sleep disorder; zolpidem for sleep disorder; simvastatin for blood cholesterol; alprazolam for anxiety (doctors said high dose which he needed to be stable, at least 7 years ago); and fenofibrate for blood triglycerides increased. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. E-transmitting possible duplicate AE as caller stated they already reported AE to previous agent. He had near all the side effects listed as well as severe allergic reactions listed. He hasn&#39;t been able to get out of the house since, felt like he had the flu. He has had the symptoms since; tiredness, headache, pain, terrible chills every day, joint pain, nausea, he was a hearty eater and he did not have a good appetite/ no appetite; he felt unwell, completely unwell, a sick feeling and it&#39;s pronounced; and particularly swollen lymph nodes, difficulty breathing at times, definite swelling of face and throat, dizziness and weakness. Caller provided these all started 2 weeks after he got the shot. Started on Saturday, 03Apr2021, and same thing happened everyday (going on). He called the weekend and after a couple weeks he called, the on call doctor and after his second call he was ordered to get to a medical facility/ urgent care facility (went to the doctor and it wasn&#39;t his regular doctor) in the weekend of 11Apr2021 and he has one nearby and they ran a test for COVID and it was negative, also tested for strep throat positive. He was given amoxycillin 30 tablets, 500mg tablets to be taken 3 times a day for 10 days for the strep throat, although he has not had any symptoms of strep throat which for him it is pronounced and painful, he can swallow, has no pain, no cough, nothing, he has nothing. His soreness and everything here was exactly what was in the manual was what he has going on and nothing else, no mucous, nothing like that. Confined to his house, has no energy to do anything chills and hot flashes. He has been taking ibuprofen 800mg tablets with food, 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening and got some relief from the chills and symptoms but not totally and it was waning in it&#39;s effectiveness after the first 3-4 days. All his symptoms were persisting and they had worsened after he started getting then for he guesses 4-5 days and then they kind of leveled as bad as they are now and haven&#39;t tailed off. He was ordered not to take the 2nd dose until he finishes all the amoxicillin and was told quite sternly not to get the 2nd dose until he finishes it. He has 12 pills left so next week sometime Tuesday or Wednesday and his concern was he finished that medicine and feels he would still have these side effects and doesn&#39;t know if he would build up immunity and maybe the 2nd shot won&#39;t be as bad. The nurse practitioner who worked with him at the urgent medical care place said the 2nd shot is a doozy and not to mix it with Amoxicillin as it might have a bad effect on the effectiveness of the strep throat. States he has had strep before and doesn&#39;t feel like that at all and nothing is wrong with his voice, throat or upper respiratory at all. He is supposed to get the 2nd shot tomorrow (16Apr2021), he was scheduled. He was afraid to do it as he hears it&#39;s worse than the 1st one and he is already relegated to his house and has to order in and not risk driving that&#39;s how foggy his brain was with what&#39;s going on his thinking is not straight from the pain. The outcomes of the events were unknown.
