The first couple days I had a really sore left arm, but didn?t feel any ?side effects? until about Wednesday, 1/6 (about a week later). I remember waking up to a sore left side of my upper body. The left side of my neck, chest, arm, and lymph node (under my left arm) felt weird. It was until about Saturday night, 1/9, that I felt my left under arm lymph node noticeably swollen. I had a bad headache and loss of energy, and overall feeling unwell. No fever or night sweats to report. I was absent from work on 1/11 and 1/12, as a result.  1/13 was my first day back and feel better. The swollen left lymph node is no longer present, but still slightly tired. I did not seek Medical Care for my symptoms.

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot: WEN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 41years) at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included scratchy throat the day before the vaccine (27Jan2021). The patient had no concomitant medications and no investigation assessment. The patient got first dose of vaccine 28Jan2021 and was debating whether to get Covid test because of symptoms. The patient had a cough and runny nose on 29Jan2021 and fuzzy headed, scatter brained and not sleeping good in 2021. The patient considered the events as non-serious. Asked if these symptoms were from the vaccine and if getting the vaccine cause a false positive on the Covid test. Stated Friday had cough and runny nose. He stated that it felt like he had a pretty bad head cold and would not think about getting tested but since Covid was around. Wanted to know if these were common side effects of the vaccine or if he needed to get tested. The patient just moved houses and it was a stressful process. Sometimes when one gets stressed that one gets sick and may have contributed to his condition. Later clarified that this was for the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. The patient stated that the cough and runny nose worsened over the weekend and was a little better now and took alpha lipoic acid;minerals nos;quercetrin;vitamins nos (EMERGEN-C). The outcome of the events cough and rhinorrhea was recovering while unknown for the remaining events.

                                                I was vaccinated on 1/2/2021 and developed oral parasthesias the day of the vaccination. On day 3 after the vaccine, I developed a severe headache with ?brain fog,? confusion, and hyperacusis. The headache has now persisted for 10 days and was severe enough that I missed several days of work this week as I was unable to carry out my clinical duties. I was seen in ED this past weekend and ultimately followed up with neurology after the headache had persisted for 7&#43; days. The working theory is that I may have developed aseptic meningitis as a side effect of the vaccine and I am currently on a steroid taper which has resulting in partial but significant improvement in my symptoms. I am back at work but still experiencing a mild headache and facial parasthesias. I did request a Covid test in ED 1 on 1/10/21 and tested negative.

I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

Once i would start to feel better after sleeping 4-6 hours. I get out of bed thinking I was better, then another hour or so later the symptoms were back, so I would go back to bed shivering uncontrollably off and on again, sweating and uncomfortable until falling back to sleep.. This lasted for about 48 hours, which started 72 after receiving my vaccination.  No adverse symptoms the first 2 days following the vaccination. I got vaccinated on Tuesday, 1/19/21 - symptoms started Friday, 1/22/21 - Saturday, 1/23/21.  Sunday, 1/24/21 I finally felt normal again.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

Was rushed to hospital where I was admitted very quickly. I was blacking out on the drive there and blacked out while in their care. This was from one dose of Pfizer vaccine for Covid. I was put on a GI, Allergy, and steroid medications. I was hooked up to an IV and 3 drugs were injected. I passed out numerous times but was discharged at 5am.

Vital signs were assessed by a Registered Nurse and a Physician. Oxygen saturation was noted to be 88% on 2 liters of O2 by nasal cannula. Verbal order received at 10:03am from Physician and EpiPen administered to right thigh with improvement of symptoms. She was transferred to the Emergency Department (ED) via stretcher. In the ED, she was re-dosed with an EpiPen secondary to her airway type symptoms. She was reevaluated after 15 minutes and received Solu-Medrol, Pepcid, Benadryl IV, as well as IV fluids. She also received Ativan for her generalized jitteriness and anxiety. She improved and felt significantly better at approximately 11:43am. She was monitored for 3 hours in the ED and was discharged home at 3:34pm in good clinical condition and advised to continue to take Benadryl as needed. She carries and EpiPen on her person and was advised to return immediately if symptoms return.

                                                myositis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 43-year-old male patient received  first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown) on an unspecified date in Dec2020 reported as around the end of December,  at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date after he received the vaccine he had right arm pain and swelling (states it was in his bicep brachial radialis in the muscle) which is the opposite arm of the injection site. He had an MRI done on an unknown date that showed myositis. He thinks could be due to the vaccine since it started two days after he received the vaccine. His pain peaked at about a week and a half and now the pain was improving and the swelling was down. He still had function in the right arm but when he strained it would hurt. His concern was that the reaction may be an autoimmune reaction and the first response was muted. He was worried the second dose may elicit a larger response. At the time of the reporting the patient was recovering from the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between the myositis and vaccination with BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. Additional information regarding onset latency, relevant medical history, concomitant medications and detailed clinical course around the event onset will aid in comprehensive assessment of the case. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The pain gradually increased, became more intense, and more constant.  Mild fever and chills started happening, and I took Ibuprofen.  By about 4 days after the vaccine, the abdominal pain was severe enough that I had some difficulty walking and I couldn?t sleep at night.  Pain was 6-8/10.  I went to the ER, and CT scan with IV contrast showed 18 mm appendicitis.  I underwent laparoscopic surgery and it was found to be perforated.  It was removed.  I am currently recovering in the hospital.  I received the vaccine as a health care provider at my hospital, specifically I am a practicing pediatrician physician for over 10 years.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

                                                After the required wait period of 15 minutes I started to drive back home which is 77 miles from the hospital that administered the vaccination.  Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

Medical history included was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient states about 24 hours later he felt foggy, disoriented, and dizzy (all three occurred on 12Jan2021), states he then woke up at 3 am this morning and had a lot of numbness on right side of face and arm and had a hard time swallowing (both occurred on 13Jan2021), states a couple hours later he went to hospital, went to ER and had to do an MRI, states the MRI of brain and neck came back clear and checked out, states doctors concluded it was an adverse reaction to vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

Follow ups with ENT, Neuro and PCP have continued with Vestibular Rehabilitation. While in ER, the MRI, MRA, CT, CT with Contrast was done, showed no signs of anything that could have caused this. Ironically tracking back, I received my 2nd Dose of the Pfyzer Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. and this occurred on February 13th at 2:15 a.m. I have not had any other issues before this nor any signs of damage to the nerve or ear that regularly affects Vertigo Patients per my Neuro and ENT. The incident took place 4 weeks and 2 days after the 2nd vaccine. 2 days after the 2nd dose, I experienced Low grade fever, chills, and body aches that lasted only 12 hours, but nothing with the 1st vaccine nor anything after the 2nd dose issue until the Vertigo.  I am unable to drive, conduct my job, which requires me to go to emergency calls and carry a Taser (CEW). I have been off work since this occurred and still not eligible to go back to work.

By 1600 I had extreme fatigue and severe mental fogginess.  This fogginess lasted approximately 24 hours.  Other reactions included chills, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, headache as expected.  I feel the mental effects could put patients in danger if healthcare practitioners are not aware of the possibility of this and receive the vaccine while on duty.  I did not experience this with the first dose.

A 45-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140 and expiry date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization and tetanus vaccine (manufacturer unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on unspecified date at single dose for immunization. Medical history included COVID diagnosed in Mar2020. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and then 2 weeks later on 05Jan2021 got COVID again. He wanted guidance as to when he can get the second dose of the vaccine. His vaccination provider refused his second dose and the 21-day interval has passed. He was tested for COVID on 05Jan2021 and was positive. The patient said that his brain is still in a fog on unspecified date. He is normally not this cloudy. It was also reported that around the same time he got a Tetanus shot, and he can not remember which one was given in which side. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

                                                8 minutes after the vaccine i satrt to experience some tingling to my left earlobe. It then radiated to my left jaw line where i felt an onset of numbness. the numbness hten radited to my left shoulder all the way down to my left extrremity digits. atthat time i waived over a nurse who waived a physician who check my radial pulse, pulse was noted in the 70&#39;s. At that time the physician  asked a EMT perofrmed four evalautions of my BP and my BP was reading syttolically between was 140-150 and my datolics was reading 110-115. Throughout that time the numbness was still to my left side of my face and shoulder and arm and to myfingers. This was only localized to those two areas.  At that time it was requested for me to go to the hospital to seek medical attention. I deferrred to going home to check my BP and at that time i was running 150/100.  The numbness was still present and mu thought process my body was stressed out. I then took a nice cold shower with breathing techniques. I did orthastatics on myself. I then followed with my PCP the next day and she ordered bunch of labs, CRP, triponents, CBC, bubble study and chest x-ray and EKG. ALl the testes were deemed to be negative.  My systolics were 120/80 when i saw my PCP, however i was recommedned to take the whole week off and was recommended to go back to work after the new year.  After five days the numbness went away to my digits went away but not to my face.  My grips were equal. I had no Bal palsy nor stroke.  The numbness sill persisted up till day 9 and the umbness to the face went away.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

Felt fine Monday morning. Monday about 11 am began to feel tightness in chest, thought it was bad heartburn. Pain kept me awake Monday night, and continued into Tuesday morning. Called the doctor, was sent to urgent care. Urgent care detected elevated tritonin and had me transported to the emergency room. Elevated heart rate and rising tritonin levels had me admitted to the hospital. Given heperin and a beta-blocker, given a CT scan, and monitored over night. On Wednesday had a echocardiogram and then a heart catherter and imaging, which showed a healthy heart, no plaque, no blockages. Tritonin levels and heart rate returned to normal. Released from hospital on evening of 3/10.

                                                rash/ super itchy at night; maculopapular rash; he can not sleep great; This contactable physician reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  This physician which was a 49-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on the right deltoid 17Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated that he received the first dose of the COVID vaccine and he had a pretty bad rash that started 3 days after (noted on 20Dec2020). The rash has since improved since it started but it took forever to improve and mentioned that he was super itchy at night. He also used to be itchy in the day, but now it was just at nigh which was driving him insane. The physician also mentioned that it was a raised maculopapular rash. It started on his neck on the left side as well and increased of both elbows and behind his knees (it was diffuse). He mentioned that he was able to carry on during the day, but he cannot sleep great. He mentioned that it reminded him of poison ivy - the thought of it happening again makes him want to cringe especially with all the terrible stuff he has seen he was scared that his skin will slough off or its going to kill him or something. But overall, he was more concerned about the itching. The physician took over the counter antihistamines and hydrocortisone cream. He did take one dose of expired liquid prednisone (from 5 years ago that his daughter who had for an ear infection). He downed a sip of prednisone and it prevented his itchiness for a day and now was thinking of getting on steroids. The physician also stated that there was one guy he worked with had something similar (AER 2021010285). He received the same lot number and has been itching like crazy. They have both been trying to figure out what to do. It was clear as mud. Then, last week (Jan2021) they saw each other, and they were both having the same issue and suffering separately. They had no exposure to anything similar besides the vaccine. The physician stated that he was about due for 2nd shot. He has been researching and trying to figure out what to do, if he should get the second dose or not. He reported this to VAERs and talked to CDC, but nobody has any recommendations or information. He also tried to look up trial data to see if anyone had reported a similar rash, and he did not find anything. He was calling to see if he should get the second dose, and if Pfizer has any information on this rash being reported. Outcome of pruritic rash was not recovered; recovering from maculopapular rash and unknown for the remaining event. As per causality: He was unsure. It was most likely from the vaccine as he has done nothing differently.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021010285 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

                                                I developed symptomatic palpitations that started on 12/23 in the early morning, awaking me from sleep.  Palpitations became so frequent that I went to my PCP&#39;s office, where I was found to have an abnormal rhythm on my EKG (non-sustained V-tach, runs of 4-5 beats at a time).  I then went to hospital where I was admitted to observation in the ED for monitoring.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (reported as blood pressure). Concomitant medication included amlodipine besilate and amlodipine besilate (NORVASC 5 mg) both for blood pressure. The patient reported, &#34;I received my first dose of Covid19 vaccine on Monday (28Dec2020) and it is now Friday and I am still sick and I am wondering how long these symptoms typically take to get better from because it seems like it is day 5 now so&#34;. When probed for events the patient stated, &#34;Everything on the list, fever, chills, aches, my joints ache, some muscle pain, headache, tiredness, injection side swelled up. I was not nauseas or anything like that. I still have fever today. I did not get symptoms till like 2 days later and then my fever was up to 101.7. It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever.&#34; The patient mentioned, &#34;I kind of like started feeling poorly on the 29th (29Dec2020) late at night but on the 30th (30Dec2020) I had fever and everything.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: is always good on an unspecified date, body temperature: 101.7 on 30Dec2020, body temperature: 99 on 01Jan2021 (reported as &#34;I did not get symptoms till like 2 days later and then my fever was up to 101.7. It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever&#34;), and laboratory test: unknown results on Dec2020 (reported as &#34;I did go for full series of stuff, checkup but that was more than 2 weeks ago&#34;). The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization.

On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

My fever was 102.8 when I first woke up. I was very nauseous and my fever felt worse. My thermometer would not read any more until my temp came down. I can only guess how high it got but at least 103 degrees. I took Advil Liquid Gells and then my fever broke. I was actually scare for my life. In March I actually caught coronavirus and developed  anti bodies for Covid. I can only guess my body was fighting for it&#39;s life.

A 52-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 12:00 PM  (at the age of 52-years-old) via an unspecified route of administration at an unspecified dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included hypertension, high blood cholesterol from unknown dates. Allergy information was not provided.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was administered the vaccine at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility.  Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN/HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), fenofibric acid (FENOFIBRIC ACID), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine on Monday 28Dec2020. A PCR test for COVID was done on Tuesday and a rapid test on Wednesday both of which were negative. The patient experienced some scratchy throat late Friday night on Saturday, 02Jan2021 the patient called out sick to work as a cough had started. A PCR test was done on 02Jan2021 and he received results Monday (4th) as positive. The patient continued to say that the cough had subsided, as he took Delsym.  He lost taste and smell on Monday. He reports running a fever that varies from 99-101.5. He took Tylenol and Motrin to control the fever. In addition he has experienced fatigue. It was also reported, in contradiction of the above reported chronology of events, that the onset date of events was 25Dec2020 (CONFIRMATION PENDING for onset date of events relative to vaccine administration). The patient experiences of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue resulted in a physician office visit (date not specified).  The patient underwent lab tests that includes a PCR test on 29Dec2020 which was negative, a rapid test on 30Dec2020 which was negative and a PCR test on 02Jan2021 which was positive. Treatment for the events was reported as Motrin and Tylenol for fever and Delsym. for cough. The clinical outcome of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue was reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 28Dec2020, and COVID-19 PCR test positive on 02Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                Severe insomnia over the past 8 weeks, unrelenting. Start exactly at 24 to 48 hours after vaccine. Had no previous illnesses before that. No history of Covid infection. Has done all sorts of CBT modifications with no improvement. Was previously a super high functioning Interventional Cardiologist with no prior history of anxiety, depression or sleep problems. This was very acute and worsened after second dose. Labs are all normal.  Now unable to work as this insomnia is quite debilitating.

Lasted 90-120 minutes before going to sleep, then gone by morning.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 (at the age of 54-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included metformin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, glimepiride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, lisinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient experienced not feeling well, ate a bit but not much, kind of pale, vomiting, trouble in breathing, and agitated on 04Jan2021; body was hyper dried and restless on 05Jan2021; mind just seemed like it was racing on 06Jan2021; and not responsive and he passed away on 06Jan2021 at 10:15 (reported as: around 10:15 AM). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the vaccine on 04Jan2021, after which he started not feeling well. He went right home and went to bed. He woke up and ate a bit but not much and then was kind of pale. The patient then started to vomit, which continued throughout the night. He was having trouble in breathing. Emergency services were called, and they took his vitals and said that everything was okay, but he was very agitated; reported as not like this prior to the vaccine. The patient was taken to urgent care where they gave him an unspecified steroid shot and unspecified medication for vomiting. The patient was told he was probably having a reaction to the vaccine, but he was just dried up. The patient continued to vomit throughout the day and then he was very agitated again and would fall asleep for may be 15-20 minutes. When the patient woke up, he was very restless (reported as: his body was just amped up and could not calm down). The patient calmed down just a little bit in the evening. When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn&#39;t breathe, and his mind was racing. The patient&#39;s other brother went to him and he was not responsive, and he passed away on 06Jan2021 around 10:15 AM. It was reported that none of the symptoms occurred until the patient received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of all of the events was unknown; not responsive was not recovered, the patient died on 06Jan2021. The cause of death was unknown (reported as: not known by reporter). An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and has been requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: not responsive and he passed away

                                                38 hours after vaccination I woke in the middle of the night with extreme abdominal pain, dizziness, and severe diarrhea.  This continued for 2 hours.  I lost 6 pounds.  After continuing with some diarrhea all day on February 12th, I began having bloody mucous chunks as my stool.  I was advised by my doctor to go to the ER.  I was diagnosed with colitis in the ER and was admitted for several days for treatment due to the severe blood coming out.  CT scan showed severe inflammation, and stool sample showed blood and lactoferrin marker high.  I was given many antibiotics and fluids and was released home on February 14th, 2021.  I am still receiving treatment with oral antibiotics, and appointments with my physician.  I had to be absent from work for over 7 days.

No excessive cough or fever, did have dyspnea with any exertion and this continues but seems to be lessening. Was not able to work due to fatigue. Yesterday remained tired but felt noticeably different-felt lighter-and today seems promising.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

A 56-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 24Mar2021 at 10.30 (at the age of 56-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension diagnosed 20 years ago, blood cholesterol diagnosed about 7 years ago, Covid-19 in Dec2020 which hit him pretty hard, double pneumonia, he was wiped out, patient had a shingles vaccine a couple of years ago he had a fever and it felt like he had the flu, for about 48 hours he was wiped out. This happened with both doses of the shingles vaccine. Concomitant medication(s) included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). On 24Mar2021 (Wednesday), patient experienced double pneumonia, body aches/i started aching, my arm hurt, headache, tired/fatigue/exhausted, i got the chills, my skin felt like it was sunburned, cough, fog, no appetite, sweating, sore arm, he had a previous flu like symptoms after the shingles vaccine. It was reported that all the same symptoms the patient had with COVID, the caller had after the vaccine. The next morning was much worse and through that next day. Patient describes his side effects like a mini Covid 19 reaction. The symptoms were very similar to the symptoms he had 4 days into his Covid-19 diagnosis. It was reported that on Friday (26Mar2021) he felt normal and was able to workout on Saturday (27Mar2021) as usual. The patient believes his antibodies are strong following his virus and then the 1st Pfizer vaccine dose. The patient doesn&#39;t think he had a fever, but he didn&#39;t have that with covid along with no loss of taste and smell. The patient was very grateful for the vaccine. Patient had no other vaccinations within 4 weeks prior vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests which included blood cholesterol and blood pressure whose results are reported as high on an unknown date. The outcome of the event double pneumonia was unknown, and for all other events it was recovered.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Pt chronic schizophrenia with subsequent mild cognitive impairment over the past year who was brought to hospital after 4 days of food/medication refusal, withdrawal from care and more recently disorientation and tremor.   Pt was recently transitioned from haldol decanoate to clozapine.  Last dose haldol decanoate was on 2/16/21. First dose clozapine 12.5 mg was on 2/24/21. Increased to 12.5 BID the following day. Increased to 25 mg BID on March 2, without reported side effects or other issues.  Pt got his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on March 4, and that night was less engaged with staff, felt feverish. Did not spike a temp per bedside accompaniment who was with him that day. The following day, he barely ate any food and did not get out of bed all day. This continued for the entirety of the weekend - bed bound, turning to look at staff when called but did not engage/respond verbally. He was incontinent of urine over the weekend.  Treated for Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 2/2 clozapine  Uncertain if vaccine contributed to event, but recent case report published relating clozapine toxicity and Pfizer COVID vaccine, so submitting to VAERS for evaluation
