                                                Summary: Syncopal espisodes x 2   16 yo patient received his Covid-19 vaccine and as he was going to sit down in observation, he leaned on his mom and passed out. His mother gently lowered him to the ground (@ 1804). Patient&#39;s mother stated he just passed out and that this was his first injection ever in his life. Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient&#39;s legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling &#34;a star&#34; on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%. Immediately after the patient passed out the second time, his pulse was measured at 38 bpm and his lips displayed slight cyanosis. His pulse quickly rose to 52 bpm, within less than 10 seconds. One minute later his pulse was up to 68 bpm.

                                                Patient was nervous upon receipt of vaccine.  It was an unscheduled (expiring) dose.  Per parent, he had fallen asleep outside vaccine room and they had to wake him up to get vaccine.   I gave immunization and asked him to stay for 15 minutes afterwards.  His Mom ran to consult window to notify staff patient was passing out.  I was sanitizing vaccine room so I immediately ran to him and his Dad and I caught him as he was slumping over.  He was shaking really hard, weak, and clammy.  He was coherent b/c I asked him his name but did not have clear recollection of timing of vaccine.  He was very pale in color.  His Mom grabbed him a Gatorade and he seemed very thirsty as he was drinking.  He mentioned he felt dizzy and that both arms were hurting and the arm I gave vaccine in felt like he had sweat dripping off it.  (I felt his arm and it did not).  I grabbed an instant cold pack and placed on his neck to help cool him off.  His color returned over the 30 minutes.  I asked parents if they wanted me to call ambulance but they wanted to wait and see how he responded.  He looked at his iPhone data and his heart rate had spiked.  Unclear if right before vaccine or right after but I believe he mentioned it went up to 120 when Mom said his normal resting heart rate was 60.  He ate some gold fish and seemed to perk up and have a few funny conversations showing his personality.  I explained to him very important to let parents know if he experienced any other side effects after leaving.  He was able to stand up and walk out of RX with parents.

A 16-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 12:00 (at 16-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The caller is calling about her 16 year old son. She just left the doctor with her son who received his first Covid 19 vaccine. She would like to report an adverse event. Her son has had a fever of 105.2F (07Apr2021). The doctor just did blood tests, a rapid test for Covid that was negative, they tested him for strep throat that was negative and he doesn&#39;t have an ear infection. He&#39;s been running a fever over 105F for the past 2 days (07Apr2021). The caller wanted to rule out that nothing else is going on. They have called the Medical Director of (name)  and he didn&#39;t know what was going on with her son. If this fever continues she&#39;ll be calling Pfizer back. She is waiting on the results of his blood tests like his mononucleosis test pending and other viral and bacterial tests (unknown result). Her son started feeling bad about 4-5 days (unspecified date) after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. The last 2 days he&#39;s had a very high fever. He has a headache and body aches (unspecified date). He had a Covid 19 test not long before he received the Covid 19 vaccine and it was negative. She thought her son might have the Covid 19 virus but he had the rapid Covid 19 rapid test (09Apr2021) and it was negative. The caller does not know what is going on with her son. She took her son to a clinic because he was sick and because his fevers are too high. She also called the state but they told her that fevers are normal with the Covid 19 vaccine but if it persists after today, 09Apr2021, she needs to seek medical attention. It was further reported that earlier in the week her son told her he thought he was going to pass out at work (unspecified date). He told her he thought he had a fever but she checked it with a forehead thermometer and it didn&#39;t show a fever. Then on Wednesday, 07Apr2021, her son woke up around 4:30AM and had a fever of 105.2F with an oral thermometer. He woke Thursday, 08Apr2021 and this morning, Friday 09Apr2021 with a fever. His mother can control the fever during the day with Ibuprofen but he&#39;s spiking these fevers in the middle of the night. She knows fevers spike at night but she can&#39;t come with any other reason why this is happening. The patient lab tests and procedures also included CBC: pending, mononucleosis: pending, and rapid strep test: Negative; all from 09Apr2021. The outcome of events fever of 105.2f, headache, and body aches was not recovered; while for other events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 16-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 16Apr2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 16-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mental illness and autism from unspecified dates and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2, administered in right arm on Mar2021 (Lot number was unknown), at the age of 16 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no other vaccines in four weeks. Several hours after receiving the second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 16Apr2021 20:00, the individual developed a headache and took ibuprofen (ADVIL) and water. About an hour later, he was disoriented and the parent (who was a nurse practitioner) asked him questions and he was having a hard time answering. Patient&#39;s fever was over 103 in the ambulance. He was tested for everything at the hospital and all was negative. It was determined to be an adverse reaction to the vaccine and what likely happened is his temperature spiked so quickly that he had a seizure. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment for other adverse events was unknown. There was no COVID prior vaccination and patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about lot/batch has been requested.

Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation.

Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation.

                                                Patient was given Pfizer Vaccine on 5/16/21 at 11:00-11:10am.  I read through the patient medical history through the handheld and noticed there was &#34;yes&#34; on seizure history.  I ask the mother what happened and she told me it was from the first incident with the Pfizer vaccine.  At the time of the first incident the mother stated that patient fainted and convulsed upon regaining consciousness.  Patient has had no history of seizures prior to then or had any big injuries that could trigger it.  Patient&#39;s mother states physicians think it&#39;s triggered by anxiety and not a true seizure, so MRI or tests was not needed.  Doctor recommended patient to come back if it happens again.  With the information provided I used professional judgement and was on high alert with the patient.               After administrating the vaccine to the patient, I monitored patient&#39;s vitals carefully. Patient was stable and I walked with him to his seat near the wall and left him with his family.  About a few minutes later the mother told me to come to her aid.  Patient had a 1 time continuous seizure for about 30 seconds-1minute.  After regaining consciousness the patient said he did not remember getting the vaccine. Patient&#39;s mother was very concerned and under control and did not overreact to the situation.  Also, I promptly relayed to (pharmacist) to call 911 and he called a member of management.  While pharmacist was on the phone with 911 the patient regained consciousness.  I monitored patient&#39;s vitals while I waited for a member of store management.  Store management took a little bit longer to respond (5-10 minutes) but arrived to document the whole incident.               About 30 minutes after the incident patient&#39;s vitals were stable and the ambulance was not needed and the family took him to the hospital to get monitored. Patient rode the electric wheelchair was escorted out by store management to the car.

He denies illicit or recreational drug use. In the ED, he was well appearing with pain now 1 out of 10. POC troponin was 16.8 ng/mL. He had labs pertinent for ESR 10, CRP 3.0, BNP 24. RP2 PCR was negative. UDS was negative except for opiates (s/p morphine). IV was placed and patient was started on IV fluids. EKG was obtained and showed questionable left atrial enlargement per ED read. Cardiology was consulted and performed Echocardiogram in the ED at bedside and was within normal limits. Cardiology resident team contacted for admission. Past Medical History: No major medical diagnoses Past Surgical History: Orchiopexy, T&amp;A Family History: No cardiac family history Social History: Lives at home with mother. Has two healthy siblings not living at home Immunizations: Up to date Medications: None Allergies: NKDA Etiology of likely myocarditis remains unclear at this time. In his age group, this would most likely represent a viral myocarditis. He would likely benefit from cardiac MRI during this admission for further evaluation of myocarditis. His EKG findings with his age group are unlikely to be secondary to myocardial infarct. No arrhythmias or heart block noted on EKG at time of admission or telemetry in ED. There is no family history of autoimmune disease or cardiac disease to suggest an autoimmune component or genetic etiology.

                                                16 year old male with no PMH who presented with chest pain. Initially on 6/10-6/11 had expected myalgias and headaches post vaccination similar to dose #1, but later 6/11 developed chest pain that made it impossible for him to sleep. It was waxing and waning but continued through 6/12 which after discussion with PMD ultimately led to referral into our facility for further evaluation. Received a dose of ibuprofen with marked symptomatic relief. No further medications given during his time, his chest pain had resolved after that ibuprofen dose and was at clinical baseline until discharge on 6/15. Prolonged hospital course was to arrange for cardiac MRI to be done for comparison. Otherwise had serial labs (documented below) which had trended in the right direction.

                                                The day following the second Pfizer shot the patient developed a fever to 101.5 that improved with Tylenol and did not recur.  On that same day he felt tingling in the hands and feet and reported a floating sensation.  This too resolved with resolution of fever.  On the third day after the shot he developed chest pain, difficulty taking a deep breath.  He woke up the following morning with nausea which resolved but the chest pain and a feeling that it was hard to take a deep breath worsened.  The pain was significant enough that he went to the ER.  In the ER, he was found to have an ECG consistent with acute pericarditis and his troponin was elevated (2.75, upper limits of normal 0.03).  He was started on IV Toradol and admitted to the hospital.  His troponin kept climbing so he was also given IVIG (80 gm).  The following morning his Troponin started coming down and he no longer was reporting any symptoms.

                                                16yo previously healthy male presenting with chest pain. He received second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday at 3p. That evening, he developed fevers, chills and had trouble sleeping. On Thursday, he began feeling heart palpitations and again slept. Overnight, he developed midline chest pain, and decided to present to the emergency room. His EKG showed elevated ST segments. Labs were remarkable for elevated troponin, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP; echo showed normal function but subtle hypokinesis of the apex. He was given morphine, Tylenol, Ketorolac, 1L NS, and possibly aspirin before being transferred to the ED.   In our ED, he had a reassuring exam, was no longer reporting chest pain. He had labs drawn which showed a white count to 15.3, normal H/H, Plt 152, ESR 12, CRP 10, and Trop T 1.14.   Aside from the above symptoms, he has been in his usual well state without viral symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, joint pain, or other symptoms. He has no past medical or surgical history. Immunizations are up to date. His social history is benign.  Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. An echocardiogram was performed which showed mild LV systolic dysfunction. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV q12h. He remained asymptomatic with no chest pain throughout his admission. He was transitioned over to PO steroids on 6/13 which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were trending down. Cardiac MRI showed an area of late gadolinium enhancement in the LV, with no abnormal function.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake including tolerance of PO steroid. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology to be arranged. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  - Prednisone  - Famotidine Patient was admitted for management of myocarditis thought to be due to his SARS-CoV2 vaccination. He received IVIG and steroids. He had multiple EKGs, echocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI. He showed improvement during his hospitalization. He will be followed closely by Cardiology who will advise return to exercise and repeat imaging needs.  **Please note that we do not have access to the vaccination records (lot, etc)**

                                                The patient felt dizzy and had blurry vision about 5 minutes after the vaccine administration. I talked to the patient and mother who reported a history of anxiety that may be contributing. They asked if he could lay down in the vaccine room and upon entering he lost his balance and fell to his knees but did not get injured or lose consciousness. The patient said he was not hurt but I called 911. they arrived about 15 minutes later and evaluated the patient. The patient revealed he had ran 2 miles earlier that day and had nothing to eat or drink besides a Yoo-hoo all day. The EMTs said he was very dehydrated. The patient felt fine after another 10 minutes and the mother declined medical transport.

The discomfort only increased with his anxiety and having difficulty breathing.  He also experienced his heart racing.  I took him to the facility the following afternoon - approximately 31 hours after the 2nd dose and the facility completed blood work, x-ray and EKG; I was to follow-up with a cardiologist and that was also completed with Dr. and another EKG was performed, followed by an ultrasound of his heart. I have not received the result of the ultrasound as it was just performed on 06/30/2021.

The patient&#39;s eyes rolled back as he fell to the floor where it appears that he had a mini seizure. We called for a code white and immediately began emergency procedures. I held the patient while he was sitting upright and kept speaking to him until he regain consciousness approximately 1 minute after he had syncope.  The patient seemed very confused because he had asked the question &#34;where am I,&#34; as he opened his eyes. He slowly became more alert as time passed by and was aware of his surroundings within the next 2 minutes.  He then stated that he was hot and hungry and was given water (from me) and Gatorade from his mother at his request. It was not long after that that the patient fully recovered and was back to normal. I had them stay and observed him for at least 40 minutes just to make sure that he was ok. Statements were taken from a salaried member of management during this time.  There was no medication needed and none given during this incident. Plans were made with patient&#39;s mother for a follow up and our contact information was given incase they needed to contact us for anything at all. I will reach out to them in the next 1-2 days to see how the patient is progressing.

I took ibuprofen and ate healthily, when I could eat though I had no appetite. I went to the DR and got a flu test on the 29th or 30th of June.

                                                I had a 16 year old with his mother come in for a covid shot.  Got all the info then headed over the shot room where he was waiting.  Looked as nervous as any other kid.  His mother was close by watching.  I usually carry a conversation with the kids asking them questions as I get ready and give them the shot.  I was successful in giving him a shot.  Told them to wait 15 minutes before they leave.  Got a knock on the door from the mother only to find the kid sprawled out on the floor which alarmed me.  The mother said he was light headed.  I talked to him he said he felt  dizzy and his head was spinning.  I asked if he needed some water which he said yes.  I went back after fetching the water and suggested he stay there and that I would check on him in 5 minutes.  Went back and he was sitting on the chair with his mother next to him.  Mother said he has a phobia of needles.  Mother was thankful I was checking up on him.  He and his mother walked away 5 minutes later.

My son in a panic yelled for me to come into the bathroom and he showed me his urine and it was bright red with clots (Gross Hematuria).  I know the time because as soon as I saw it I took a picture (of which I still have on my phone).  I proceeded to access how he was feeling and after he said he felt okay just scared-no pain or anything, I called his Pediatrician whose office instructed me to take him to the ER and that is what I did.  He was not rough housing, there was no trauma  and again no pain.  This has never happened before.

                                                Within 1-2 minutes my son passed out and started violently shaking/convulsing. His chin was pinned to his chest, he struggled to breath and was making a sound as if he was loudly snoring but seemed to be struggling to breathe. I was unable to wake him. I&#39;m not sure how long it lasted but maybe 2 minutes or so. He woke up and asked what was going on as we had all been standing over him trying to unsuccessfully wake him.  He shared that he thought he&#39;d been asleep and had been dreaming. He also shared that his throat hurt very much. He had the shakes for about 30 minutes after and was extremely exhausted. He slept for 14 hours as soon as we arrived home.

Mother was able to catch and support patient&#39;s head as patient slowly fell to floor. After only seconds, patient alert again and speaking and answering questions correctly. Patient attempted and was able come to a complete unassisted standing position, but was immediately encouraged to stay lying down until EMT has arrived.  EMT arrived, assessed patient vitals, and encouraged patient and mother to go with them to hospital if they were concerned, but mother declined and signed affidavit.  Patient and mother left to go get late lunch, as it was revealed patient had not eaten breakfast or lunch yet and was nervous about getting the shot.

                                                Shot given around 1125 am.  Pt and pt&#39;s mother went to sit in front of pharmacy.  At around 1135, pt fell out of chair, sounded/looked like he may have hit his head on blood pressure machine that he was sitting near.  We thought he had fainted.  Pt woke within 10 or so seconds after fall and was confused.  Said his head didn&#39;t hurt.  His skin did lose it&#39;s color and he was looking &#34;white as a sheet&#34;.  We had pt lie on floor and elevated his feet.  After a few minutes he was feeling better and was able to sit in a chair.   Pt and his mom left the pharmacy area about 15-20 minutes after pt fainted.  Upon looking at video of the event,  it appears that before the patient fell out of his chair that his right arm raises up and his elbow is bent in a very stiff way.  A split second later his whole body appears to stiffen and bend to the left, then he falls out of the chair and is lying on the floor.  When on the floor, his legs appear to be fairly stiff as well.  This whole episode seems to last about 10 seconds or less.  The video makes it look more like a seizure than a case of syncope.

                                                Patient walked into the observation area around 5:16pm after his vaccination. He was with his stepfather. He was with normal mentation, walking on his own, and talking with his stepfather in the waiting room. Within 1-2 minutes in the waiting room, he leaned to the right in his chair, hit the glass (glass did not crack or shatter, no head injury), and was not responsive for about 5 seconds. His father called his name and grabbed his hand but no response. I rushed over and patient became responsive and endorses not remembering what happened.  He does not remember the event. No body shaking, tongue biting, or incontinence.  He was taken back to the vital room, and his first BP was 70/35, pulse in the 60s. He denied any symptoms, and physical exam including neurological exam were normal. He was speaking coherently and with good mentation.  He was given a water to drink. Repeat blood pressure 5 minutes later improved to 96/59 with no medication.  He was moved to a clinic room and was laid supine with his legs elevated.  Orthostatic blood pressures were within normal limits (111/63 supine, 110/72 sitting, 109/69 standing). Patient was able to walk out on his own and was in normal mentation.  No medications were given or interventions wee done.

He was disoriented, pale, groggy.  911 was called and arrived approximately 20 minutes after event.  After the paramedics examined patient, he regained his bearings and color.  The family decided to go home at approximately 10am.  I spoke with mother at 7pm tonight and patient has been fine all day.

A 17-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Apr2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EW1064) as SINGLE DOSE  (at age of 17 years old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included epilepsy (interactable epilepsy) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications.  Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1 on 25Mar2021 09:00, lot number as ER8733,  in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation(at age of 17 years old). On 17Apr2021, the patient experienced increased seizure activity, fatigue/tired, confusion and memory issues. After the 2nd shot, about 4-5 hours, he experienced increased seizure activity and it has progressed to today, today he is a little bit better but it has progressed to point he is having a lot of confusion and memory issues. He has several different types of seizures but he has what are called mini seizures, the blank stare, the confusion. Nothing has stopped completely, he isn&#39;t back to his baseline as far as his seizures. He always has seizures, daily so she is calling about the increased activity and when she says his baseline she means he has not returned back to his baseline activity, but he is doing better than yesterday.  Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were horrible. Today he started to get back to his normal self. The events did not require a visit to the Emergency Room or Physician Office. Outcome of the increased seizure activity/mini seizures, confusion and memory issues were recovering. Outcome of fatigue/tired were not recovered.

We were thinking pt was still having flu like symptoms.  On Saturday, April 24, 2021, pt was still complaining about chest pains.   He was tired and not acting normal.   We took his blood pressure twice and his heart rate was 105 bpm..  Can not exactly remember blood pressure (seemed very off).  Took pt to the hospital where they measured his heart rate at 107 bpm.

Patient sat down in the chair and rolled sleeve up. Chose L deltoid for injection site. He was talking with a friend and writer gave injection. Placed band aid. Patient was quiet and looked like he was going to get up but fell forward out of the chair. He hit his L forehead on side of wall. Writer caught patient and sat him up on the ground. Eye?s were dilated, he was diaphoretic, zoned out and not responding initially to voice, but eyes were open. Eventually got patient up to a wheelchair and taken to office area to lay down and monitor. Father was notified and sat with us after he arrived at the school. Patient drank 1 full 120cc orange juice and approximately 6oz of water. Throughout monitoring patient gradually felt better. Pupils corrected to normal, wasn?t diaphoretic anymore, and vitals improved. He stated this has happened before with lab draws and shots, but not this severe. Writer and colleagues informed him to notify people that are going to give him shots or lab draws about his history. Also informed him to notify his teachers if he feels anything out the ordinary for the rest of the day. Make sure he hydrates. Patient then sat up and walked in the room. He stated he felt fine like before getting the shot. Patient left stable and under his own power.

                                                Pt was seen at ED on5/8 for L sided weakness in the setting of a headache. Pt?s mother reports that these symptoms began 2 days after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in R deltoid. She says that on 5/6, pt complained of L arm weakness during cooking class at school, which was followed by a mild L sided headache later in the day. Symptoms resolved without intervention but recurred on 5/8 with associated L sided facial droop, slurred speech, L arm spasms, and L foot drag.  Pt was seen at  ED for this and had a HA (5/10 in severity) at that time -- workup was unremarkable with a normal head CT, laboratory workup, and resolution of symptoms. Pediatric Neurology evaluated the pt, deemed no further workup necessary, and advised outpatient follow up.   Pt presented again to the ED on 5/10 with concern for full tonic/clonic seizure, witnessed by pt?s mother. Mother reports that she heard pt fall and went upstairs to find pt seizing on his bed -- says that pt had shaking of bilateral upper extremities (in flexed position close to chest) and symmetric lower extremity shaking; eyes were closed without clear focality or eye deviation. Also some drooling, though no incontinence or tongue biting. Episode lasted for approximately 2 minutes; pt was confused and did not recall what happened immediately afterwards but improved within the next 8 minutes. He was taken to the ED by EMS.   By the time he arrived in the ED, he had left sided weakness again. He was given Keppra 1g, placed on EEG, and was admitted. EEG overnight was read &#34;normal&#34; and additional workup was unremarkable. Pt had MRI brain completed showing cortical abnormalities in the R parietal lobe, suspected to be related to recent seizure. MRA showed patent intracranial cerebral vasculature. MRV showed no evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis. Weakness resolved by the morning and pt was back to baseline on morning of 5/11/21. However, around 9 AM, L sided weakness (face, arm&gt;leg) with associated headache recurred. Mom says that this event was captured on EEG. He was then transferred to our facility. He was placed on pEEG and had repeat labs, imaging completed. Pt did have L sided facial droop, L arm weakness, and slurred speech on arrival, but this resolved within 24 hours. Pt had one additional episode of &#34;wave&#34; of L sided weakness including L sided facial droop and slurred speech at one other time during the hospitalization, but no additional seizure like activity. He was discharged on 5/14 with a normal neuro exam-- some labs (including labs of Rheum and Id workup were pending at time of discharge.) Primary and consulting teams elected to forgo steroids but reconsider should symptoms worsen or return. Pt was readmitted on 5/16-- had an episode of expressive aphasia &#43; headache while at a social gathering; states that he became overwhelmed by the noise. No additional seizure like activity.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine in the morning, then woke at about midnight. He went to get a drink of water, and was holding a glass of water in his hand. He started to feel as if the room was spinning, became very sweaty, had ringing in both ears, and lost consciousness, striking his head on the counter. The event was unwitnessed. He reports waking approximately 1 hour later with a bad headache. He had a headache and felt disoriented. He denies urinary/bowel incontinence or tongue biting. He was able to walk back to his room without difficulty, took ibuprofen, and went back to sleep. He woke the next morning with nausea and vomited, but this did not impact his headache. He has not had any notable neurologic symptoms since that time, but continues to have a minor headache. He has not had any further vomiting. Headache has not subsequently woken him from sleep and does not worsen with recumbent positioning. He denies visual changes, memory changes, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, ringing in his ears, or dizziness. He says his headache is located mostly around his forehead and at the top of his head that is now mild and feels like pressure ?like a tension type headache.? His mother is a nurse, and evaluated him the next day. The family did not feel that he needed to be seen in the emergency department, or prior to this visit. He has not had any previous episodes that were similar. Patient was evaluated in my clinic. Complete neurologic exam was within normal limits. He has been referred to neurology for further assessment.

I told him to drink more water and I gave him some Tylenol. I told him to keep me posted as to how he felt. The next morning, he said he hadn&#39;t slept all night - he had a dull pain that didn&#39;t go away when he moved. It traveled up his upper leg and up to his right hip. Moving and stretching didn&#39;t make it go away. Constant dull pain. I took him to ER. It took 36 -48 hours before it faded. He didn&#39;t wake up with it on Saturday.

                                                Reported by mother.  When he got his vaccine,  he went home and had no reaction.  The next morning he had a fever of 103, and gave her Tylenol chewable.  The following day he has no fever, in the early at 4:00 AM he woke up with pain on his chest.  He said that he felt weird, tightness on his chest and he could not actually describe it, said it was in the middle of his chest.  It was uncomfortable but uncomfortable and was worried.  They observed him, the pain didn&#39;t go away, just on the chest.  If he tried to sit up he felt better, but when he laid down the pain was always there.  Around 3:00 PM she brought him to the ER and had tests run, and all tests were okay.  His EKG showed ST-elevations and inflammation of the heart.  He had an US of the heart and was discharged home this morning.  He has to be seen by his PCP to be referred to a cardiologist.  He was given some medications and is sleeping right now.  He has an APT with his PCP on 6/9/21.   He was sent home to take Ibuprofen.

                                                On Monday, May 31, 2021 at 1:20am pt. woke up with intense chest pain and labored breathing.  He was able to fall back to sleep and woke up two hours later (3am) with the pain escalating.  He did fall back to sleep again and once again woke up at 9am only to learn the pain was even worse and was barely able to breathe.  He called me, his mother, and I raced him home and straight to our local Emergency Room.  The ER originally thought it was a collapsed lung.  After the x-ray came back negative for a pneumothorax, they continued testing.  The very last test they did showed extremely elevated Troponin numbers at 1.05 and C-reactive Protein (CRP) numbers at 5.42.  We were transferred by EMS/ambulance to the hospital 40 minutes away and checked into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Pt was admitted in the afternoon of May 31st and was released on June 3rd at 1:30pm.  June 1st his Troponin was 0.26 and CRP was 6.10.  June 2nd Troponin was .45 and CRP was 3.54.  The day he was released from the PICU (June 3rd ), his Troponin was .45, and the CRP was down to  1.83.  Pt received daily EKGs, 24-hour heart monitoring, constant blood pressure tests, as well as blood oxygen levels.  Once released from the hospital, Pt will be on light duty for at least a week, if not more.  First follow-up Cardiologist appointment was June 8th at 10:30am.  Echocardiogram, EKG, and blood work was ?normal.? Pt was put on a 72 hour heart monitor on June 8th and will be removed June 11th.  Will start weaning off Ibuprofen and acid reducer, Pantoprazole, the next three weeks.  Will continue to take Colchicine for three months, as well as light movement and exercise, nothing strenuous (swimming, running, etc.).  Follow-up with cardiologist in one month (beginning of July).

A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm, at age 17 years, on 12Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pressure in his eye from an injury, asthma (diagnosed when the patient was about 2) and has family members with asthma and heart conditions. Patient is in perfect health, he works out 6 days a week, and does football conditioning 5 days a week. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Concomitant medication included timolol taken for pressure in his eye from an injury from an unspecified start date to 20May2021. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. The patient historically received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number: EP7534) at the left arm at age 17 years on 22Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient got his second dose of the vaccine on 12Apr2021 and shorty after on 19Apr2021, he became very fatigued, very weak, his chest hurt, and he had shortness of breath. On Apr2021, patient had dizziness. The patient used to have bulky arms and now you can see his muscle mass depleting in Apr2021. The patient cannot focus on school online because of the headaches from 19Apr2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure goes up and down from 19Apr2021. For days from 19Apr2021, the patient&#39;s heart rate will be fine in the 60s and it goes up to 120 or 130 with chest pain, it fluctuates depending on the day.  The patient visited the emergency room on 05May2021, but was not admitted and no one knows what was going on with the vaccine. It was also reported that the patient lost 14 pounds on 25Apr2021 since the second dose of the vaccine. They knew the patient has already lost 10 pounds and then yesterday, 25May2021, the patient weighed himself and noticed he has lost another 4 pounds over the weekend. Patient had bloodwork on 20May2021 and it was all negative. The primary care provider was concerned about the weight loss so she ran a bunch of blood work. The patient is negative for COVID test and chest x-ray on 21May2021 and he has had multiple tests done. The patient went to his primary care provider on 25May2021 (yesterday from the time off reporting) and the reporter mentioned that maybe can they look at this as being a side effect from the vaccine. The patient&#39;s doctor laughed and said nothing has been proven yet about this. The reporter felt that this is a reaction to the vaccine. At the time of reporting on 26May2021, the patient was not able to function and sleeps all day. The patient also underwent lab tests and procedures that includes being tested negative for mono twice now (on unspecified dates). Clarified that they have not filed a safety report with Pfizer on the patient&#39;s events. The outcome of the events &#39;dizziness&#39;, &#39;lost 14 pounds since the second dose of the vaccine/lost another 4 pounds over the weekend&#39;, &#39;muscle mass depleting&#39;, &#39;cannot focus on school online&#39;, &#39;not able to function&#39; and &#39;sleeps all day&#39; was unknown; while for the other events, it was not recovered.

                                                My son got both his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 shot as well as a booster for Tdap. (Unsure of which Tdap or lot#) at 11:30 pm 6/18/2021 he was fine. About 30 mins later he was hit hard with side effects. Said he was very shaky and felt hot and cold at the same time. He did not let me know about this until this morning around 7:50 am 06/19/2021 about how he was feeling and he was still feeling very bad, advised him to take tylenol and he took that and went back to sleep. Around 12:00 PM 06/19/2021 I was finally able to check his temperature and other vitals. His temperature was normal, but his heart rate was 138 bpm. I made him sit down and relax for a bit and heart rate leveled out to normal.  He also reported he is afraid to eat that he feels nauseous. As of this afternoon 06/19/2021 he seems to be feeling better.

He complained of tingling in left arm, then he couldn?t hear anything and had blurred vision, and said he had an extreme headache. Within moments he began convulsions that became stronger and his whole body was shaking. This lasted for about 45 seconds. He stopped shaking and began to wake up. He was groggy and confused and said he didn?t remember anything, but the pain in his head subsided. 911 was called and they took him to the hospital to check his vitals. They could not be sure what brought on Seizure. Suggested Vagol Response. We went home. That evening he felt tingles and needles in body, we thought side affect of vaccine. Today, he was in extreme pain from pins and needles sensations throughout his body.

                                                My son received his first vaccine dose in his left arm on Friday April 9 at 8:45 am.  By Sunday when he woke up, he noticed a walnut sized lump on his left clavicle.  It felt unusual and moved on the bone every time he turned his head or moved his arm. There was no redness or fever and it felt hard.  It was still there on Monday morning (April 12) so we called his primary care doctor which is where he received the vaccine.  The doctor felt it could be a cyst or swollen lymph node and is sending him to a general surgeon next week for further evaluation. The doctor was uncertain if the lump was directly related to the vaccination. Other than acne, patient has no other preexisting conditions.  He did have COVID19 in November with only mild symptoms (positive test on 11-23-20; no fever or cough, just felt tired for a couple days).

                                                Vision problem. My son has been a homeschooled student for many years, using computer for his schooling without any problems. He had a minor injury to one eye shortly before the vaccination (scratched with hand), but after the shot, he complained of vision problems in both eyes. Redness, dryness, pressure, uncomfortable. Unable to concentrate and stay reading for more than a few minutes at a time. His primary doctor is now treating with antibiotic drops, but will take him to the eye doctor if he does not get better by Thursday as he will be done with the eye drops. We have also added allergy medicine, which seems to help a little. He is due for his second shot on 4/29. I still need him to get the shot to be protected from Covid, so hopefully, he will be better.

                                                Overnight, my (almost 19) son did not wake me, but reported to me in the morning that he had headaches, chills, numbness, thirst, and hallucinations. He was aware that they were not real during and after he had them, but it was a nonetheless disturbing experience.  He described to me having the need to hydrate all night and he drank a lot of water. This morning he was still having a headache and numbness as well as overall malaise, but has taken advil and eaten a light breakfast. He is dressed and up and around and seems to be improving. Should the symptoms return or worsen, we plan to take him for medical care.

Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 in left arm, on 02Apr2021, lot # EK5730. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Apr2021 at 21:00 the patient experienced extreme hallucinations, not feeling well, chills, aches and pains, headaches, slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, he did not get much sleep, fever. The clinical course of events was reported as follows: My son reported to me at bedtime last night, the night of his second Pfizer vaccine dose, that he was not feeling well. I told him to take some Advil and go to bed. He had a very bad night with chills and aches and pains but most distressing was his description of having had extreme hallucinations. He said that he was aware they were hallucinations and not real during and after the experience, but it was nonetheless concerning. It is also concerning that he didn&#39;t wake me for help. At any rate, he did not get much sleep and I have to assume his fever went pretty high before morning. He described to me the need to hydrate during the night. He also relayed to me this morning an experience of headaches and slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, but he is now feeling much better. He is dressed, has eaten, and is playing games on the computer. I am keeping a close eye on him today and should we return to that level of concern, we will take him to urgent care.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

He initially had chest pain the day prior to admission with pain in his back and down his left arm. This improved with Tylenol and resolved prior to bed. On the morning of 5/6 the chest pain returned and was so severe it woke him from sleep. He was difficult for him to characterize, but he said it was all over his chest, sometimes sharp and pressure-like, most severe in mid substernal region and was so substantial that he had difficulty speaking properly. He feels that the pain is most severe when lying flat and is best managed when he is resting at a 45 degree angle. Patient was at ED he was found to have an initial ECG with ST depressions in aVR and elevations in II, aVF, and V2 through V6 raising suspicion for pericarditis/myocarditis. Initial troponin was elevated at 4.35 as well. Cardiology Dr. was contacted by ED physician, case discussed, and EKGs reviewed and felt this was more likely pericarditis, but not STEMI. Of note, he reports a family history significant for his mother having a?hole in her heart.?He was given Toradol with improvement in his pain and upon arrival to hospital his chest pain was markedly improved.  He was noted to have troponins peaking at 39.415 that down trended and an elevated CRP of 4.8 on admission. D-dimer was 0.26. Covid PCR was negative.  He was evaluated by cardiology again here who upon review of his ECG and cardiac enzymes as well as presentation was consistent with pericarditis. Echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function with trace posterior pericardial effusion and telemetry was monitored without any arrhythmias. He was started on low-dose beta-blockers, aspirin 650 mg 3 times a day, and colchicine 0.6 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses followed by 0.6 mg daily. He is planned to continue this for approximately 3 months and will need to follow-up with cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks for repeat monitoring and management with plan to taper off aspirin once his CRP normalizes.  Later that night, he even had a similar episode of sudden onset chest pain for which she received IV Toradol with minimal relief and oral Tylenol with relief of symptoms after that. No telemetry abnormalities were recorded at that time.   ECG the following day showed improving ST changes and troponin of 26.328 with CRP 4.2. He had no further symptoms for over 24 hours and is responding well to treatment.   He is advised to take Tylenol as needed in addition to the above-mentioned medicines should he have any recurrent chest pain.

An 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EW0169) at single dose, on 22Apr2021 at 17:30, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. Patient&#39;s mother reported that her son fainted within 30 seconds of receiving the Pfizer vaccine 1st dose and since then he had experienced some intermittent light headedness and dizziness. He passed out completely after shot. Adverse events were described as following: &#34;patient is due to get his second dose of the shot later this evening but is having periods of lightheadedness and dizziness. Patient&#39;s mother states that her son also feels like he is going to pass out. She states that this started 30 seconds after the first shot. Her son only passed out once, completely right after the shot, it was a bad experience. She&#39;s glad he actually wants the other one today, but he is concerned because he is still lightheaded and dizzy after 3 weeks. Patient&#39;s mother states that he has been trying to function, work, and live his life but its irritating to him and scary. The doctor suggested that he should get his second dose but her son is a little fearful&#34;. Physician Office Visit required. The patient did not recover from intermittent light headedness and dizziness, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile and strong temporal relationship there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the reported events and the suspect drug.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

ALMOST 5 MINUTES AFTER THE VACCINATION, THE PATIENT WAS SLOUCHED IN HIS CHAIR, SWEATING, LOOKING PALE, AND COMPLAINING THAT HIS BODY WAS HURTING ALL OVER. I RAN OVER TO THE PATIENT AND ASKED IF HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING, TO WHICH HE DENIED. I BEGAN TO ASK HIM WHERE EXACTLY DOES IT HURT TO WHICH HE MENTIONED HIS LEGS AND BODY.  SINCE HIS BREATHING WAS FINE, I SUSPECTED IT WAS JUST A PANIC ATTACK BUT NONETHELESS I PROVIDED HIM AN ICE PACK AND WATER. WE ALSO MOVED HIM TO A MORE PRIVATE AREA TO ELEVATE HIS LEGS.

                                                Patient woke up very early -- couldn&#39;t fall back asleep -- because of chest pain. He has never had this occur.  I called our advice nurse, and she said we should call 911. EMS arrived a few minutes later, and took a LOT of tests -- blood oxygen, EKG, etc etc. And all of them looked fine. But he was clearly not himself. He described a great pressure on his chest, at a pain level of 7 (out of 10). They gave him some anti-inflammatory OTC and left. I stayed home with him that day. After about 5 hours he seemed to go back to normal and has been good since.

                                                The day of the second shot (07JUN2021@11AM), my son complained his arm was sore and was not feeling the best but was eating, drinking, and seemed fine.  The next day (08JUN2021 @10AM) my son came down from his room to eat breakfast and still was not feeling the best but seemed fine after eating.   Around 12PM my son came down the stairs to get some water in the kitchen and then shortly thereafter after passed out, fell against the wall and slid down to the floor.  I was in the location and found him unresponsive, very cold, and eyes looking straight ahead -not moving.       My older son and I then carried him to the couch where I laid him down and elevated his feet. He started coming around approx. two minutes later and broke out in a sweat but also had chills.  At that point, I did not call an ambulance and started to hydrate. After an hour or so, he started feeling better and then ate some food but was weak most of day and rested.  The next day he seemed fine.

                                                symptoms began as blurry vision, extreme light sensitivity (couldn&#39;t open eyes because of pain), and severe headache.  He also had what looked like a red rash or blood bruise on both eyelids.  The symptoms got increasingly worse and his vision became completely blurry and he was unable to focus his eyes and his photosensitivity so severe that he had to be in a dark room, even when his eyes were closed.  His headache increased.  We initially went to an urgent care clinic where they ran bloodwork, and then we were sent to an eye specialist for a thorough exam, which was excruciating for him to sit through on account of having to examine his eyes open and with light.  After a few hours at the eye specialist we went home and he went to bed, unable to sleep because of his extreme headache.  The symptoms lasted the following day, and the day after with loss of visual focus, extreme headache, and the rash on his eyelids appeared to had gotten a bit worse.  I would say that Saturday evening his eyesight began getting gradually better (vaccine on Wednesday evening).  His headache and aversion to sound continued.  Over the next week his vision began gradually getting better, different eyes at different rates, as well as his headache.   He still has the rash on his eyelids.

After approximately five minutes, while sitting in our chair in the waiting area, patient complained of dizziness.  He kept closing his eyes saying he was dizzy and vision was blurring.  He slumped over and passed out for approximately 3-5 seconds.  He came back to a little, was diaphoretic and breathing shallowly.  Mom was worried and we called the paramedics.  Mother said he hadn&#39;t been out of the house in about 3 years and had anxiety about the shot.  Paramedics asked if he wanted to go to the hospital with them and he refused.  Mother informed us he doesn&#39;t have a PCP.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

Around 10:30 PM, I experienced serious chills and generally felt like I had a fever. These symptoms worsened into the night, as did the fever (measured at 102 degrees F, possibly higher at the peak). I also experienced a headache, mild nausea, joint (knee) pain, although some symptoms may have been due to dehydration. Despite being very tired, I was unable to really fall asleep. At around 6 AM the fever finally dropped substantially, and as of 8:30 AM is currently only 99.4 degrees. I am still experiencing a bit of a headache as well, but the other symptoms are gone.

A 19-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s grandson) received BNT61B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number not reported), on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 19-year-old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetic (since 1 years old, he was diagnosed 1 week after getting the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine), dehydrated and rapid heartbeat (patient once before got dehydrated on the Hiking Trail with a rapid heartbeat). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included insulin for diabetic. The patient previously received measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine. The reporter (caller) mentioned that his grandson got the 1st dose of the vaccine on 04Mar2021. Several hours later (04Mar2021), he experienced severe dehydration and thirst and could not sleep at night. He was very very uncomfortable and usually did not complain regarding experiences. He was young and going to college and he was living on his own. He was also diabetic. She was worried about his safety regarding his intake of the 2nd dose, so she was wondering if this had been reported and for any recommendations before and after getting the 2nd dose. They were consulting with his endocrinologist and the nurse at the endocrinologist&#39;s clinic said that they recommend young diabetic people to drink tons of water when getting the vaccine. Caller mentioned that she herself got the Pfizer vaccine and had no problem with it. Caller mentioned that his Grandson was diabetic since 1 years old. He was diagnosed 1 week after getting the MMR vaccine. She also mentioned that his grandson just recently got in college and he was in the younger side of the spectrum. Caller is asking if there is any data that would include her grandson&#39;s conditions in the clinical trials. Caller stated she was calling about the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and stated her grandson who was the patient was the one who received his first dose of the vaccine on 04Mar2021 and that day he received the vaccine he told her that starting in the evening that same day (04Mar2021) she had never heard him so anxious or disturbed that he could not get relief and the adverse reaction he had was severe dehydration and thirst and it was giving him a fit. Caller stated she thinks he was probably 5&#39;10&#39;&#39; in height or so and thinks he weighed around and between 175-180 pounds when she last asked him. Caller stated she was not an HCP but was a medical technologist calling on behalf of the patient and because she was a medical technologist, she is medically trained. Caller stated she had not been able to get back in touch with the patient to get all the details for the report before she called around to get help but also stated the patient had his sleep interrupted after the vaccine was administered and he could not sleep but thinks this is all resolved and must have been resolved but she couldn&#39;t say for certain how long that he could not sleep or how long the severe dehydration or thirst lasted but she can find out. Caller stated the patient had not yet had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and had his patient card and stated she did not have the lot, expiry date or NDC for the first dose. Caller stated for the indication for which the patient was administered the COVID vaccine, she thought because the patient was diabetic and the HCP was very anxious for him to have defense against COVID and against all various types of virus or the school may have required it but she was not sure; states it was for the patient&#39;s own safety that his endocrinologist wanted him to have the vaccine. Caller stated that the patient did not have treatment for the reported event and he did not say to her that he had any treatment; caller stated she doubted the infirmary at his school is even open at the University and she did not know whether the patient would go to the infirmary or not. Caller stated she was calling to find out of there have been any reports or feedback on this reaction that the patient had or the adverse situation the patient had several hours after receiving the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; states specifically for the severe dehydration and thirst the patient experienced after being administered the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Caller stated the patient was due to get his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine three weeks from 04Mar2021 and she was most anxious to find out what recommendations were given or if Pfizer heard complaints about other adverse events like the ones she was reporting on the patient. Caller stated the patient once before got dehydrated on the Hiking Trail with a rapid heartbeat and he was with his father at that time; no further details provided by the caller. Caller stated the patient reported this to her in conversation a day or so after he had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and she is medically trained and it has been a long time since she used that medical training but the patient is diabetic since the age of 1 and he had good care and has been under the care of the hospital endocrinologist and his HCP since he was found to have diabetes and he uses his insulin pump very well. Caller stated the patient was off to college where very few were attending college and the patient had a very undesirable evening after the vaccine of lack of sleep and he was so thirsty and could not get hydrated and she knows dehydration is bad for anybody even if they aren&#39;t diabetic or if they have a life threatening type of illness but the patient was at school and did not have a family member to help take care of him and he was due for his 2nd shot three weeks from 04Mar2021. Caller stated she was trying to find out the best route for him to go report this and she told him to report the reaction to the HCP and to call the HCP who prescribed the vaccine; stated the patient&#39;s endocrinologist was not able to get in touch with the patient and he was not answering the phone; stated the patient is at college and he was on online courses. Caller stated she was very anxious to find out enough information about this and it is a concern to his treating physician and she was asking about recommendations about the patient not having his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; stated she spoke with the nurse that works with the endocrinologist for all of these 18 years they have cared for the patient. Caller states the HCP&#39;s nurse stated she had found that patients that receive the vaccine and have diabetes and are treated at the hospital they recommend that those patients drink tons and tons of water before having the vaccine because some types of people with diabetes have extreme thirst.  Caller stated she had no vaccine names, patient information or lot number or other information to provide on the patients that had the vaccine and have diabetes. Caller stated she spoke at the HCP office and stated there was no need for secrecy and HIPPA was not in Pfizer&#39;s domain; stated she cannot depend on the patient to look out for his own safety and she as a medical technologist used to give patients ordered glucose tolerance tests and she knew of the reactions that occurred with those patients and she did not want the patient to be stuck and wanted for him to do the smart thing of spending the night at home rather than drive back. Caller stated for those patients she administered glucose tests to she had no patient information or lot numbers or other information to provide and it was years ago before the Pfizer COVID vaccine came out. Caller stated she worked trying to get patient&#39;s diabetes under control at the University where she worked. Caller stated she already called and waited for organization but did not speak to anyone and left them a number to call her back a couple of days ago but she had not heard back; stated there were 18 people in the phone queue before her and she was hoping not to have to wait again. Caller stated her grandson probably does not had the time to wait on the phone being at college and he needed to do what he needed to do to be safe. Caller stated she had only spoken with the endocrinologist who treats the patient in his hometown and reported this information to the HCP&#39;s nurse and they are pretty good with follow up with patients. Caller stated she did not think the patient had other health issues and he actually had done extremely well on his insulin pump and had been on the insulin pump since about 3 years of age; stated she had no name of the insulin, had no lot numbers or further information. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Patient was seated in waiting area and around 6:10PM a loud noise was made due to metal chairs moving in the waiting area; upon turning around patient was face down on the floor with his head turned to one side. I ran to offer assistance and cushioned his head with my hands. EMS was dispatched immediately. Patient was already starting to come to after losing consciousness for approximately 10-15 seconds, looked confused for about 15 seconds and then seemed to return to a normal mental state immediately after. He was able to give his name and info and knew exactly where he was, etc. and he stated he felt much better. He was able to confirm he hit the side of his head on the floor, however it was not bleeding. I asked if he wanted me to call anyone for him but refused the offer. His blood pressure was taken at 6:15PM by us then again when EMS arrived at approximately 6:20PM and was 140/100. He was checked out by EMS, including a blood glucose reading of 81 and seemed to be okay. They offered to take him via ambulance to the hospital, especially given him hitting his head, but he refused the offer. He explained a similar incident occurred when he received IV contrast dye in the past. He was able to sit up and then stand up without any issues. He continued to wait in the waiting area for about 10 more minutes before leaving to ensure he felt back to normal. I followed up with him at 8:20PM via telephone and he stated he was feeling normal and had no questions/concerns. I assured him he could reach back out to me personally or the store here if he had any questions/concerns in the future.

That afternoon, he began to experience chills, body aches and back pain. Later that night, unable to sleep, he began to experience visual hallucinations, to include a demon to his immediate left, a candle in his far left periphery, shackles, the room going dark and feeling like he was stuck in a time loop. In addition he experienced auditory hallucinations, to include a demon yelling and people whispering.  He took ibuprofen that afternoon for his chills. No known psychiatric history or drug use. He denied suicidal ideation. Has a history of back pain for which he has been seeing physical therapy for several months. Enjoys his job with no identifiable unique stressors.  Work up in the Emergency Department included CBC, electrolytes, Urine drug screen, ETOH, procalcitonin and urinalysis. All were normal, with the exception of an elevated neutrophil count and low lymphocyte count. Head CT was normal as well.

He then stated he was going to faint and I assisted him to the floor.  He temporarily lost consciousness ( less than 20 seconds). He appeared diaphoretic.  He regained consciousness and appropriately responded to my inquiries.  I assisted him to a chair where he sat for 3 - 4 minutes then said he was feeling better and wanted to leave.  His mother was in the waiting room and took custody.  She confirmed she was present due to this happening before.

This returned over the course of 1-2 minutes.  EMS was called and responded.  They spoke with the patient but by this time he had consumed 8-16oz liquid, eaten a snack, and was fully aware and alert.

                                                pt had been give the immunization and asked to wait in the waiting area, about 5 minutes later his sister yelled that they needed help. he had said he felt faint and then passed out falling to the side and out of the chair, she states that she saw him &#34;seize&#34; when he hit the ground, but stated that he did not hit his head. When I came upon him his eyes were open and he was able to answer questions. he stated that he did not have any problems breathing, but felt dizzy. He was very clammy so we took his bp and it was 142/65 pulse 64, gave him an ice pack and had him stay laying down. He sat up after awhile and took a few sips of water but started to feel light headed again so we had him lay back down. His bp went down to 105/58 pulse 61, but then came back up to 136/81 pulse 75 as he was starting to feel better. He started to get more color in his face and feel less clammy so I stayed sitting up. We put him in a chair eventually and the EMTs arrived shortly later. They did and evaluation, but as they were talking about whether or not to take him to the hospital he passed out again. The EMTs said he was probably having some anxiety to needles. He then said that he had passed out giving blood once.  They took him to the hospital for further evaluation.

His head fell and also his upper limbs stiffened with twisted hands as if it were a convulsion, as if it were a tonic phase. His skin turned white and he didn&#39;t react. I put alcohol gel all over his face and body, then he began to react, little by little his body color returned but he does not remember anything that happened in those minutes.

                                                Overactive thyroid; Shortness of breath; Chest tightness; Fever; Fatigue; Anxiety; Panic; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 20-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0151), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 15Apr2021, as second dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and allergies to tree nuts and penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate (FLOVENT), salbutamol sulfate (ALBUTEROL), and an unspecified multivitamin. The patient previously took montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) and bacitracin/ neomycin sulfate/ polymyxin B sulfate (TRIPLE ANTIBIOTIC Ointment) and experienced allergies to both; and the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ER8727) on 19Mar2021 at the age of 20 years for COVID-19 immunization (right arm). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. On 15Apr2021, the patient experienced initial anxiety or panic after shot was given. On 16Apr2021 (next day), the patient had fever and fatigue. The second day after (17Apr2021), the patient had shortness of breath and chest tightness. After several trips to the emergency room, the primary care physician (PCP) did laboratory tests that diagnosed an overactive thyroid (17Apr2021). Symptoms still remain and are being treated by an endocrinologist. Treatments included methimazole, lorazepam (ATIVAN), and diltiazem. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office or clinic visit and emergency room or department or urgent care. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient had not recovered from the events.

After the immunization, the patient felt he needed to lay down on the floor. We had the patient lay on the floor and elevated his legs. I also took the patient&#39;s blood pressure which was 90/60, the patient stated his blood pressure always ran a bit low. We also gave the patient an ice pack. 10 minutes later the patient said he was feeling better and got back into his chair. We observed the patient an additional 15 minutes and then he left feeling fine.

He came to ED on 5/30 and had IVF, analgesics and a cardiac workup that was unremarkable and was discharged with diagnosis of possible pericarditis/myocarditis.  He then had ongoing worsening headaches and increasing fevers and was unable to get out of his bed, and so his wife called 911 and he came to ED on 6/3.  There he had vomiting and transaminitis and was diagnosed with gastroenteritis treated with flagyl. Headaches progressed and were associated with dizziness; he had HCT read as unremarkable but then while awaiting MRI had convulsion.  He was returned to his room and had two more and thus was intubated, placed on propofol/versed, Keppra, dilantin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir before transfer to UCSF. on 6/5/2021 found to have reduced urine output, and serum creatinine found to be 1.72 and climbed &gt;7 in days later normalized spontaneously with fluid support to 4.26 with continued improvement.  LFTs were also found to be elevated.  Was acutely encephalopathic. Seizures resolved on Keppra treatment though had acute agitation for several days. Slowly returning to neurologic baseline. with AKI and LFTs slowly normalizing.

                                                neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression; neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression; flu like symptoms; fevers; chills; diarrhea; chest pain; shakiness; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable The reporter. This The reporter reported for a 20-year-old male patient (Reporter&#39;s son) via medical information team.  A 20-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 (20-year-old at the time of vaccination) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included illness from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. He has been to the doctor for sick visits 20 times in 20 years. The reporter also stated that there are no mental health issues noted in their family history. The reporter also stated that the patient was overall healthy with no significant medical history in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter reported that patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on Saturday and by Monday was having flu like symptoms, fevers, chills, diarrhoea, chest pain, shakiness, as well as other neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. He has been to the doctor for sick visits 20 times in 20 years. After receiving the COVID 19 vaccines, the patient has been seen by the doctor 3 times in one week. The patient&#39;s side effects have lasted 3-4 weeks. The reporter would like to know commonly reported side effects of the vaccine and their duration. The reporter would like to know the efficacy of only one dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine as the patient was hesitant to get the 2nd dose due to the side effects noted from the 1st vaccine. The reporter was advised per &#34;attached&#34; dose for efficacy after one dose. The reporter was not satisfied with this data and wanted to know more about what she had been read about online. The reporter was advised caller agent as could do some more research and contact her back with possible additional data which caller agreed to doing. Upon call back on 14Jun2021, advised caller per (website &#34;PRIVACY&#34;) from 10Dec2020. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients began to diverge by 12 days after the first dose, and 52.4% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval: 29.5, 68.4) was observed between dose 1 and dose 2, indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization. Two doses of vaccine provide the maximum protection observed. Ten cases of severe COVID-19 were observed with onset after the first dose. Nine cases occurred among placebo recipients and one among BNT162b2 recipients. The reporter would like to know dosing interval between shot one and two. Patient had their 1st dose on 14May2021 and has not received the 2nd dose yet due to side effects from what they felt was caused by the 1st dose of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. The reporter received response as &#34;you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine if you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if you had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision&#34;. The reporter wanted to know should the patient get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine after the reported side effects of flu like symptoms, fevers, chills, diarrhoea, chest pain, shakiness, as well as other neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. The reporter received response as do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of the events was resolved in 2021  Follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number has been requested

                                                Patient asked to stay seated immediately following vaccination, as he has a needle phobia. Shortly after (roughly 5 minutes), patient said he felt extremely lightheaded and shaky. He accepted a glass of water, but after taking a few sips said his vision was starting to black in and out. 911 was called immediately. EMTs checked that patient&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate, and eventually concluded the patient was okay after giving him more water and a banana to eat.

                                                When reviewing forms with patient the patient disclosed a shellfish allergy. He described the symptoms of his skin turning red, shaking, and swelling in his throat as swelling in the past. He indicated that he had needed to use an epi pen in the past for his allergy.  He still wanted the vaccination and knew we had an epi pen handy.  He was given the vaccination in his left arm and was set up next to the staff development employee who was timing and monitoring patient&#39;s for symptoms. An epi pen was given to the monitor so it would be handy.  The patient&#39;s right hand started shaking within a minute and it was hard to tell if it was from being anxious.  Patient continued to communicate verbally and stated he wanted to use the epi pen.  911 was called by the staff and the staff member with the epi pen took it and the patient out of the main area. Paramedics transported him to the hospital with slight tachycardia and never did administer epi pen while in facility. Patient was always conscious and able to verbally communicate.

                                                Felt anxious about the shot and got it at 10:48, started feeling dizzy at around 10:55 during the 10 minute waiting period, then started to black out and I immediately told the nurse who&#39;s quick actions prevented me from fully fainting (laying me down and giving me food/water and elevating my legs). Blood pressure was fine she said along with O2 levels. Left around 11:25 after I felt able to.   We both think this was likely related to the anxiety about getting the shot itself (I have anxiety in general so it was not paired with a mistrust or anything about the vaccine) and began fainting 7 minutes after getting the vaccine. I was anxious about any possible symptoms and needles/shots/blood draws make me feel uneasy. However, this issue was not present with the first shot.

He felt throat tightness made it hard to breath, he had associated lightheadedness, felt anxious, almost like a wheezing sound when breathed in and out in his upper neck. When he stood up, he did feel like he needed to hold onto something to steady himself, had some tunnel vision, improved with sitting down and closing his yes and taking deep breaths. He felt warm at the time, not cold or clammy. His friend said he looked ghostly white, no flushing, no hives, no angioedema. No sense of impending doom. He did take Zyrtec the day that he received the vaccine.   He waited the 15 minutes after vaccine without symptoms, and had walked back to class by the time it started. Between the vaccine and symptoms onset, he denies eating anything, being stung by anything.   He told a friend about his symptoms, and he returned to the hospital via base taxi arrived at ER. Symptoms were still occurring about 60 minutes after vaccination when he arrived at the ER. In the ER, he underwent exam, was given oral Benadryl.  His symptoms of scratchy throat lasted for 2 days afterwards with some associated fatigue, post-nasal drip.  He denies other symptoms. No fevers or chills. Small amount of pain and a ?knot? at the injection site the next day, but minimal according to the paitent.   Denies hives, angioedema, SOB, wheezing, nausea/vomiting, no diarrhea, abdominal pain, nasal pruritus/congestion, ocuarl itching/redness, no syncope.   No h/o vaccine reactions before. No h/o passing out before at all, specifically not to needles, blood draws, or vaccines before.   No h/o venom or drug allergy. He does report a history of apple allergic reaction 1 year previous when eating a raw apple, felt his throat close within 15-30 minutes, no hives or other systemic symptoms. He took oral Benadryl and went to ER. He was given oral Benadryl, no Epipen. He followed up with his PCM regarding possible apple allergy and was told to avoid apples, but was never tested for apple allergy. Since then, when he drinks apple juice, his throat will start hurting, but otherwise, he has avoided raw and cooked allergies. He does report seasonal rhinitis symptoms that are worse in the fall. He takes allegra as needed to treat these symptoms. He is not carrying an Epipen currently

He began to slump left into the chair and the immunizer and the patient&#39;s female friend held onto him so he would not fall from chair. After roughly 15 seconds patient sat up and after another 15 seconds asked what happened. Within a minute he was fully responsive and aware of his surroundings. Patient appeared to understand where he was and what happened. He was given orange juice and remained sitting for another 15-30 minutes. Afterwards patient ambulated to pharmacy counter, received his vaccine card and was able to leave on their own.

                                                Pericarditis diagnosis:  This is a 21 year old male who presented to the emergency department on 4/27/21 with a two-day history of chest pain.  He was seen in a  emergency department on 4/26 and reported a normal EKG, blood work, and x-ray.  He was discharged home.  His was worsened so he reported to an urgent care in .  That team had a concern for pericarditis, so referred the patient to the  emergency room.  He had a reproducible pain over the costal margin but did describe a positional component.  Provider felt they still had to consider pericarditis as well as costochondritis.  The suspicion for pulmonary embolism or acute coronary syndrome or very low.  The suspicion also for myocarditis was low.  His EKG did show some J-point elevation versus ST elevation in the anterior and lateral leads.  There was no evidence of reciprocal depression.  His troponin test was normal.  His CBC and metabolic panel were normal.  He had had CRP which was mildly elevated at 4.6. A bedside point-of-care ultrasound showed no evidence of a pericardial effusion.  Provider felt it was reasonable to treat him for pericarditis although his EKG is not classic for this.  It was recommended he use his scheduled ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times a day.  He was also given a 1 month course of daily colchicine 0.6 mg. It was recommend he follow closely with his PCP to see if he needs to have this colchicine course extended.  He will follow-up with his primary doctor in 1 week for repeat check.

I have no stamina at all, just slight exertion causes my heart to start racing and pounding, I can&#39;t climb stairs and I haven&#39;t been able to work in weeks, now I&#39;m probably going to lose my job I fear and then will have no health insurance. I have more tests this week to try and find out if I have endocarditis, so I am racking up all kinds of bills. So far no one believes me or will help me! ALL of this started within a few days of the second Pfizer dose of COVID vaccine. Biggest mistake of my life. I feel like I&#39;m dying and no one will help. You are literally killing me.

I felt like I had a fever but did not have a thermometer to check it. When I woke up this morning, I noticed I had a knot on my clavicle which I believe it to be a swollen supraclavicular lymph node. I was unable to go to my internship today due to feeling ill but I am feeling better now after sleep and medication.

I tried to lay down and warm up but by chills were extreme by the time I got in bed. They were so bad that I couldn&#39;t even hold my phone or drink water without extra effort. Then as I tried to sleep I started to feel really hot. I eventually went to sleep but woke up about two hours later feeling like I had a fever. I was hot and sweaty. During the night I woke up every two hours feeling this way, hot, and tired. Then at 6 am I woke up still feeling bad, but better. Now I had a headache that wasn&#39;t there before. I drank a lot of water and took advil. After a cold shower I started to feel a lot better.

The  father wasn&#39;t surprised and said that it has occurred before with other injections/ blood draws. pt recovered within a minute or two and was lucid and reported that he was fine. I monitored the patient for 30 minutes and recommended to the father that the patient be seen regarding the event, and that subsequent vaccinations be given at the doctors office.

                                                Felt fine day of vaccine, Sunday, just minor arm pain. Woke up the next morning with pretty severe fatigue and more arm pain. Around 11am I had pretty bad chills that lasted about an hour, along with minor nausea. Additionally,  throughout most of the day my heart rate was usually between 90-100 bpm, even while lying down and doing nothing.  Going to sleep on Monday night I woke around 3 times during the night with cold sweats. Waking up on Tuesday morning, my heart rate is still elevated, arm is still sore, but the fatigue isn&#39;t as bad. However, at around 9am on Tuesday morning I started to develop itchy hives and a rash on the back of my legs.  After the first dose I only had a sore arm, no symptoms like these, and I do not have any known allergies.

My body was not warm like a fever so I did not take my temperature. However, I had a lot of difficulty sleeping that night because it felt like my body and immune system was revved up. It was impossible for me to get comfortable.

                                                About 6 hours post injection, with only a small amount of muscle soreness in the injected arm, I was suddenly very very dizzy. I ran from my living room to my bedroom and got under the sheets, I was very very cold. My whole body was twitching violently, and I had extreme muscle pain. Joints popped like knuckles cracking that I wouldn&#39;t normally be able to pop. This lasted for about 10 minutes very violently and then calmed down over another 10, and I just felt very very feverish. I felt numb all over but I was shivering a little. Moving was very hard and my whole back was very sore, with the injection arm in a little extra pain. Fell asleep until about 7:30 am, woke up still a little feverish. I have had waves of extreme dizziness and muscle aches continuing even to today a couple days later. I am also experiencing a rather persistent headache in the very center of my head, making it hard to think. I lose track of my thoughts and it feels like I can&#39;t focus, this seems to be improving gradually over time. treatment only included extra fluid intake and over the counter pain killers

I left early and felt a little nauseated by the time I got home. I went to sleep within 2 hours(around 12am). I woke up about 5 hours later with extreme fever symptoms(chills, nausea, fatigue, soreness) and a very intense headache. I contracted Covid-19 in October 2020 and this was much like how I felt when I was sick with the virus, minus the cough. Everything was mostly cleared up by the evening however.

A 23-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 27Mar2021 (between 11:55AM and 12:00PM) (Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: Jul2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 via Intramuscular, at the age of 23-year-old, administered in right arm on 06Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6206, Expiry: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. He felt really terrible yesterday (07Apr2021). On Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well, and he could barely sleep last night (07Apr2021). His head felt heavy on Tuesday night (06Apr2021), and his head felt super heavy last night (07Apr2021). On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced fatigue, on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow/throat pain, really bad headache, sensation of pressure in ear, sensation of pressure in eye, dizzy on standing, a little bit of nausea with the dizziness, really weak, he didn&#39;t eat yesterday because he had no appetite, chills/teeth chattering, shaking, hot feeling generalized, sweating, feeling hot and cold. The patient experienced not feeling well on an unspecified date. Patient started developing symptoms that were very bad, he thought he had COVID. Patient had a PCR test that was negative. Patient would like to know if a delayed response after second dose is normal. Reported he had received his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose about 2 weeks ago (27Mar2021). He said he felt really terrible yesterday. He said he felt so bad that he thought he had the COVID-19 Virus, and went to get tested. He clarified he had a real time COVID-19 Virus PCR test yesterday (07Apr2021), and received a negative result today (08Apr2021), less than 24 hours after having the test performed. He said it could be something else that was making him feel terrible. He said he had a (telehealth) appointment with a doctor tomorrow (09Apr2021). Caller asked if Pfizer had any data with the second COVID-19 Vaccine for people that had a really delayed immune response with their immune system. He said he had no symptoms after his second COVID-19 Vaccine, and was wondering if what he was experiencing now was a delayed immune response. Reported last night was the worst for his symptoms, saying it was awful. He said he felt better this morning. He clarified that on Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well. He said his head felt heavy, but when he woke up, he did not feel too bad. He said he had fatigue, and on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow. He said last night (07Apr2021), he had a really bad headache, and his head felt super heavy. He said he had ear and eye pressure. He said he got dizzy on standing, and at one point, had a little bit of nausea with the dizziness. He said he wasn&#39;t sure if the nausea was caused by the dizziness. He said he was really weak, and didn&#39;t eat yesterday because he had no appetite. He said he took his temperature at around 8:00PM-9:00PM last night, and had no fever. He said he still had his sense of taste and smell. He said he had chills, he was shaking, and his teeth were chattering. He said he was also hot and sweating at times, like he was alternating between hot and cold. He said he tried to drink water yesterday, and would take a few sips of water when he turned over in bed. He said he could barely sleep. Treatment: Reported he took Ibuprofen 200mg tablets, off and on, to treat his headache because his headache was preventing him from sleeping. He said he would take 2 Ibuprofen 200mg tablets at a time. He said he took his first Ibuprofen dose in the middle of the night on Tuesday, and then took 2 more doses of 2 Ibuprofen 200mg tablets last night.

                                                Patient had what was suspected as a syncopal episode after receiving their vaccine. The patient syncopized in our observation area at 0835 after receiving the vaccine at 0830. The patient was witnessed sliding off their chair and onto the floor while they were reading the fact sheet on pfizer. It was suspected that the patient had anxiety while reading and had a vaso-vagal reaction, causing the subsequent syncopal episode. Patient vital signs post-syncope: BP 130/75, heart rate 73, 97% on room air. Patient was alert and oriented x4.  The patient was sat on a couch and had what was initially presented as another syncopal episode at 0847. Upon assessing the patient, I suspected that the patient had an atonic generalized seizure. The patient had slight decorticate posturing, with both arms abnormally suppinated towards his midline. The patient was slow to arouse. A 3 lead EKG was attached to the patient, with lead II showing normal sinus rhythm, no ectopy. Emergency medical services was called and arrived on-scene at 0904. The patient was assessed by Paramedics and decided to AMA with them. The patient stated that they will see their doctor.  The patient was advised to not operate any motor vehicles before being evaluated by their doctor.

After a couple, I felt super winded, like I was gonna pass out. This was concerning since I run at least 30 miles a week.   Early the next morning, I woke up with my heart racing and shortness of breath. This persisted for a couple of hours. I woke up with a stiff chest, pain and aches around my body, and struggling to breathe. I went to urgent care and they did an EKG on me that came out abnormal. They referred me to a cardiologist where I got an appointment the next day.   The cardiologist runs another ekg this time it?s worse. She sends me straight to the ER. They run a bunch of tests but nothing is conclusive. I?m released the next evening.   The following Monday I had a checkup with my cardiologist and she referred me to someone she knows at a HCF.

But from that day until now I still get a weird feeling in my left chest. I feel like my heart is twitching sometimes. Sometimes I felt that my heart was pounding. Sometimes it feels like it&#39;s going to hurt my heart. It happened continuously about 5-6 times a day. Sometimes I was paranoid about it.

                                                My first dose of the pfizer vaccine was relatively asymptomatic. Received at local hospital. Sore arm that lasted a few hours, nothing too concerning.  This adverse event describes my second dose however, received Jan 23, 2020, approximately 3 weeks after the first. Again, this was received at local hospital. The next day, I felt the expected side effects of terrible chills, whole-body myalgia, and a slight fever. Again, I was not too worried as this was expected. I could not sleep that night, but otherwise, I felt significantly better in the morning.   Unfortunately, on Jan 25, 2 days after the second dose, I began to feel a strange tingling sensation in my forearms, and a pain in my lower back. This paresthesia felt as if the insides of my arms were vibrating, and rather than a &#34;pins and needles&#34; sensation, I felt electric shocks through my forearms and extremely discomforting tingles. I could not bend forward without terrible shocks through my arms, and my back pain can only be described as aching. I immediately scheduled an appointment with my doctor for Monday afternoon, That entire Sunday, it felt as if the tingling sensation, rated at 7/10 discomfort, grew to 10/10. I physically was wincing and turning, unable to find any position where my arms were not experiencing electric vibrations. My back pain, which was tender to touch, and if I pressed hard enough on it or laid on my back, caused the same electric sensation not just in the forearms but the entirety of my upper torso and my arm. Taking deep breaths was painful, as it elicited the same discomforting paresthesia. At the time, I was one of the first groups taking the pfizer shots, and it was still unclear if taking NSAIDs was a good idea to alleviate pains and the suppress the immune response. I agonized that entire Sunday and through Monday morning, the shocking expanding from just the forearms to the shoulders around the deltoid, and the back pain soon covered my entire upper torso. For whatever reason, waist-down I was completely fine. Even bending forward only elicited the pain upwards, nothing ever went down my legs. I had slight neck stiffness, a throbbing headache, intense back aches, bilateral upper extremity paresthesia, and pain on deep inspiration at the height of my pain on Monday morning. By this point, the pain had kept me awake for almost 30 hours.  When I finally could see my doctor via telehealth appointment, he prescribed me 800 mg ibuprofen to be taken every 6-8 hours I believe. After taking the ibuprofen, the pain lessened significantly, going from 10/10 to 2/10. I was finally able to go to sleep sitting up straight on a sofa chair. The paresthesia was gone, the pain on deep inspiration was gone, but the tenderness and dull ache in the lower back seemed to stay even on the ibuprofen. I noticed that if I laid down on my back to try and sleep, even with the medicine in full effect, the electric shooting and paresthesia would immediately return. If I quickly removed pressure from that area, it went away.  The ibuprofen&#39;s effect lasted only about 5 hours. I would take another as it slowly crawled back up to 4/10 pain or if the paresthesia was returning. Over the course of an entire week, I constantly needed to be on ibuprofen. By Friday, so almost 6 days after the shot, the paresthesia and back pain could be completely suppressed by the ibuprofen and I was able to lay on my back with no problems. Without medicine, I was sitting at a dull 3-10 back pain, but the paresthesia was gone. The back pain finally vanished on Sunday, 8 days after the shot, and I no longer needed ibuprofen. No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, radiation of electrical pain down the leg, vision change, or loss of bowel/urinary control throughout the course of these symptoms.  My experience reported to my primary care doctor, via our health messages. I did not return any contact to hospital or my vaccination site.

                                                I am healthy 23 year old male. I have never suffered from any sort of illness or conditions. After massive push by the goverment and incentivization to take the New Covid-19 Vaccines deemed safe , I went ahead and received the Pfizer shot on 05/24/2021. A day after I felt headache and dizziness. This stopped on the third day. Later I would have episodes of blurred vision. That stopped. But what has really affected me and continues to affect me , is that a week after I have developed major difficulty breathing.  I never , ever not even once in my life have suffered from breathing problems. It all started on an afternoon a week after the shot randomly with really fast heart palpitations and after those palpitations stopped I was choking, I could not breathe at all. After this , I am having trouble breathing normally or getting enough air in along with tightness in the chest area. For instance, I struggle with two breaths and then the third I will likely get more air in. I have felt incredible tightness in my chest. There has been nights where I cannot sleep because I am unable to breathe , and feel like I am choking. So , I need to get up and walk around the house to catch my breath.  I am having shortness of breath  and my breathing is not like it used to be. I do not have any fever or any other symptoms , the persisting problem is the tightness and difficulty breathing. I already went to the Pulmonary doctor a couple days ago and underwent testing that are pending.  I do not understand why this happened to me , I am not sure if it is a coincidence or if there is a relation between  me having taken that Pfizer shot . But prior to taking that vaccine I never  once had trouble with  my breathing  and never felt tightness around my chest. This is new to me and it scares me to think this might stay with me forever, whatever it is. I pray it goes away. I am still having trouble . and the fact that in the past I never thought about my breathing because it was normal, and now it is a constant issue throughout  the day,  moments when I can get air and others when it is very difficult. I  am reporting this  to leave a record of this incident because prior to me taking this vaccine , I was in fact a fully healthy person free of any sort of health issues.

                                                A little over two days after my first COVID vaccine, I started experiencing racing thoughts and feelings of heightened anxiety, franticness, panic, agitation and overwhelm. The severity of these symptoms would fluctuate, but they have been present most of the time since then. They made it very difficult to complete my semester at school. A week prior my long-term girlfriend effectively broke up with me, and I had been taking two herbs, Wort and rhodiola, the former for a month and the latter for two weeks at the beginning of symptoms, which I later found out can significantly influence brain chemistry and even induce mania in some individuals. Thus, it seems likely that a combination of these and other factors could have caused the symptoms I am now experiencing, and this is the opinion of the psychiatrist I am currently seeing (listed under doctor to contact). However, given the close timing of my vaccination and subsequent onset of symptoms, I have been worried about whether it could have played a role and wanted to report it. In the past couple weeks the psychiatrist has prescribed me with hydroxizine to help me sleep and GABA to help calm my mind, and they have helped a bit, but I still do not feel like myself.

My large joints (e.g., hips, knees, elbows, shoulders) started to develops aches/discomfort. A hot shower helped relieve the initial discomfort, and I took 1g of APAP ~45 minutes after waking up. I then reported to work, which is an ambulatory care clinic that is working a drive-up clinic. As such, I had to work outside in ~20F weather. I had 4 layers on my upper body and 2 layers on lower body with wool socks. The cold did not bother me for the first two hours as I was able to return to a warm area between patients; however, as work became busy, I spent more time outside. The aches/discomfort in my joints progressively worsened as well as the general bodily fatigue. I took another 500mg of APAP, but it did not help much more. Eventually, the cold and body fatigue made breathing uncomfortable, and my breathing became slightly labored. Returning to the warm environment helped the symptoms not get worse, but focusing on tasks became slightly difficult. I returned home at approximately 1630, took another 1g of APAP, and proceeded to sleep from ~1730 until 0530 the next morning. I woke up feeling much better.

I normally sleep through the night with no issues whatsoever (I&#39;m a healthy 6&#39;1&#34; 170lb 24-year-old guy with no co-morbidities) but had a restless night where my fever eventually rose to 101 degrees Fahrenheit.  This continued throughout the next 48 hours with my fever fluctuating between 99.5 and 101.  I woke up 5-6 times both nights completely drenched in sweat.

                                                Significant fogginess of brain which has only worsened and is still lingering to now (4/18/21). Simultaneously this is mixed with fatigue regardless of how much sleep I get or water that I drink. Less frequently I have symptoms like eyes burning (similar to bad allergies), slight dizziness, minor headaches, and minor body aches. The fatigue and brain fog are by far the worst and still persist, the others listed are minor but still come and go in small amounts. On Wednesday (4/14) I took Zyrtec (10mg tablet) to help focus throughout the day then one ibuprofen tablet (200mg) at night, and on Friday (4/16) I only took the Zyrtec. Since then I have not taken any medications. The symptoms were alleviated by the medication but without them all symptoms come and go to varying degrees throughout the day and worsen by night time.

Woke up for the day at 6:05AM. Had a headache, very bad body aches, brain fog, dizzy, fever, no energy. Spent the whole day feeling like this. Woke up the next morning at 6:05AM, still had a lot of body aches and a low fever. Also now had chest pains. It is now 11:30 PM and I do not have a fever but still have body aches and chest pains.

                                                Normal reaction the following day, strong fatigue, headache, nausea, arm soreness. Disappeared 36 hours later. 3 days later experienced heavy nausea, anxiety, gastrointestinal discomfort. Heavy bloating, inability to pass gas, loose stool/diarrhea all week. 7 days post vaccination symptoms came back, feeling of wanting to vomit, strong nausea, loss of appetite. 7-14 days later lost majority of appetite, eating aversion, heavy bloating, nausea and continuing diarrhea. Weakness, fatigue and shaking. Received Stool sample and blood test April 13. Elevated levels of albumin and red blood cell count. Doctor said it was most likely from dehydration. Zofran prescribed April 13 and only taken 2 days. Nausea subsided and ability to eat came back slowly. Since April 15th have been eating more food, but still have to force myself to eat. Hunger pangs rarely felt, only know when hungry when stomach churns and fatigue sets in. Today, April 28, still experiencing slight anxiety, loose stools once every other day, brain fog and depression. Lack of emotion, irritability and  periodic upset stomach still persist, along with appetite loss. Am able to eat filling meals again, but no appetite makes food less appealing. Failure to thrive still evident and feeling like I won&#39;t get better evident. Treatment during illness was minimal, urgent care did nothing other than prescribe zofran. Gastroenterologist and GP cannot see me for another 2 weeks.

Had to stay awake from 3am-5am because on the verge of vomiting, but never did.  Kept sipping water and took 2 ibuprofen.

                                                24-year-old male with no prior medical problems presents for evaluation of chest pain.  Patient complains of midsternal chest pain that started approximately an hour ago.  He states that it woke him up from sleep.  Pain is sharp without any radiation or other associated symptoms including diaphoresis presyncopal symptoms or palpitations.  He denies any significant air hunger or shortness of breath.  He otherwise had been feeling better after what he tall was post COVID vaccine symptoms.  Patient received a 2nd dose of pfizer vaccine 3 days ago.  He states that within 24 hours he had symptoms of myalgia fever and feeling unwell.  That has been resolving patient has been feeling better until the chest pain today. Patient otherwise denies any other medical problems in.  He denies any history of drug use including any recent cocaine or other drug abuse.   Elevated cardiac enzymes and chest discomfort are likely secondary to myocarditis and secondary to vaccination/ inflammatory reaction.  Although there is low likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease as well.  I recommended cardiac catheterization for clarification.  He does not want to have the procedure done, understands the risk of undiagnosed coronary artery disease and risk of MI.  He would like to be discharged home.    I reviewed the images of echocardiogram and it seems that he has a small area of hypokinesis in infero basal segment.   Recommended to take aspirin and be seen in Cardiology office in 2 weeks.  Advised to abstain from exercise and significant physical activity till that time and return to the hospital if any symptoms.       Subjective:   I saw patient in consultation for evaluation of chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes.   Patient is a 24-year-old healthy male who had COVID-19 vaccination with his second Pfizer shot 4/14/21. He developed fever, chills, nausea and vomiting 1 day after vaccination.  He did not have any reaction to the 1st dose.   He presented to the hospital with substernal chest discomfort which woke him up from sleep, radiated to throat and had a throbbing feeling.  This lasted for 1 to 2 hours and subsided completely in the hospital.   He smokes 5 cigarettes a day, is physically very active and exercises regularly.  He is not on any medication at home.

After another day, all cold symptoms were gone.   Tinnitus in the right ear started 3 days after 2nd Pfizer COVID shot. Initially was only audible at night, when sleeping in a quiet room, but after 2 days became audible during day.  Tinnitus presented as a high pitched steady ringing in the ear. Triggered intense anxiety and perception of the tinnitus increased to almost debilitating levels. Mental health counseling and prescription of daily amitriptyline to help with sleep and lorazepam to take as needed for anxiety has helped cope with tinnitus and associated mental aspects. Ringing still persists after almost four weeks after it started, but is perceived to be less loud now.

I am now having dizzy spells that can last 10 minutes to 6 hours up to twice a day, confusion/brain fog and heart flutters/elevated heart rate usually accompanied with fatigue.  My previous doctor treated me by increasing the metoprolol and adding hydrochlorothiazide for fluid retention.  I saw a new healthcare provider who is sending me to a cardiologist, neurologist, lipidologist and endocrinologist to figure out what is going  on.  I can not function in daily life. I cannot stand when dizzy and cannot drive.  Symptoms appear to be worsening.  In the meantime, he prescribed Ubrelvy to rule out migraines.  None of this appeared until after dose 2 of Pfizer.

I just want to be healthy again please just help me figure out what the cause is I hope it has no relation to the vaccine I think its just chance I keep getting sick.

                                                Chest pain issues have resolved mostly. The most debilitating thing to come after the vaccine was the onset of ringing, buzzing persistently in left ear, comes and goes in right ear. Started 2 weeks and 2 days after second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and after flying multiple times and started when I got back on the 13th of April 2021. It has remained constant but has improved slightly from where it was in the beginning, have been doing Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (five 1 hour sessions, spaced about a week-week and a half apart over the last 2 months to see if things improve). Things I would say have improved but I am running out of patience and financial means to keep going to a doctor. I feel helpless, depressional, work performance is awful, and lastly very suicidal than I have ever been. Just want to die.

I was off of work for the remainder of the day and driving to an appointment at a different town. Between towns, during the drive fatigue settled in and I started to get drowsy. I switched seats and fell asleep for some time in the vehicle. I had fatigue for about 3-4 weeks following the 1st dose. On December 23rd, my symptoms started to get worse. Headaches increased, muscle pain/aches, chills, fatigue and this was the first day I had a temp of 100.4. I took some Tylenol and it made it bearable for me to continue to work throughout the day. From 12/20-26/2020, I kept feeling like I had a cold or the flu. Through the Holiday, I remained in bed and didn&#39;t have energy to do anything. I still had all the symptoms and decided on December 28th to call into work and get seen for a Telehealth. Some lab work were done and test results came back. I&#39;m still working with my provider on figuring out what&#39;s going on with me.

                                                Severe apneic episodes with sleep. I have no history of sleep apnea, BMI of 24, exercise regularly, no known snoring. The night after my first dose at around 23:00 while falling asleep I shortly after having been asleep would wake up gasping for air.  Attempting to fall back asleep I felt the need to consciously make myself breathe, and when I would fall asleep no more than 5-10 after I would wake up gasping for air. This continued on until around close to 03:00 on 1/7/21. When I finally fell asleep around 03:00 woke up gasping for air around 04:45 and never fell back asleep. The next two nights, 1/7/21 and 1/8/21 I would have trouble falling asleep because these same apneic episodes were happening until around 03:00. The night of 1/9/21 I had no issues sleeping, and have had no apnea since those three nights.  These apneic episodes were followed by extreme anxiety from being unable to sleep fully (I worried moreso about not falling asleep than the apnea). Heart rate when counted ranged for 70s-80s and my normal HR while sleeping is around low 50s.

The fatigue gradually increased throughout the day. I attempted to go to bed around 11:00pm and I was so cold my entire body was shivering to a point where my whole body was shaking. I also began noticing muscle cramps throughout my body as well, primarily located in my calves. Eventually fell asleep around 2:00am (symptoms were preventing me from falling asleep), when waking up noticed the symptoms had resolved.

                                                Subjective: 25 yrs old presents with fever, chills, and malaise x 24 hours after receiving a first dose of COVID vaccine yesterday and an MMR booster on the day before. He states he has not had a COVID infection to his knowledge, despite working on the COVID unit at the clinic. Member admits to nausea, fever, chills, hallucination,  and malaise. Denies HA, cp, sob, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, or LE swelling.   A/P: 1. Adverse effect of other viral vaccines, initial encounter Plan/Comment(s):  - 25 yo presents with what is likely a normal adverse reaction in a patient that has been exposed or infected by Coronavirus 19 in the past. He likely contracted the virus while working 2 months on the COVID ward at Clinic, which would be considered an asymptomatic infection. He denies having symptoms of COVID. While he did have an MMR booster the day before receiving the COVID vaccine dose #1, it was my opinion that because of his age and health status at the time of the screening, he was clear to receive the first dose of the COVID vaccine. I did consider possibility of cytokine storm, having been given two vaccines in such close intervals, but again he is young, healthy, and denied having COVID infection in the past,  and he did not exhibit any adverse reactions to the MMR booster.  I anticipate his condition will be self-limiting and the SM will return to full duty in 48 hours.   Reference:   11) Have you received any vaccine in the past 14 days or plan to receive any vaccine in the next 14 days? Currently there is no data on safety or efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine administered with other vaccines, however, the agency recommends that COVID-19 vaccines be administered alone with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration with any other vaccines. Vaccines required for post-exposure prophylaxis (e.g., rabies vaccine) may be administered within the 14-day period.   ***************Additionally, providers and patients can consider other vaccines, including the influenza vaccine, within the 14-day window on a case-by-case basis with shared clinical decision-making for Health Protection and other important co-administration vaccination needs.************  - will Rx Zofran - will Rx Tylenol - will Rx Motrin - SIQ  48 hours - Patient counseled on dx, tx, and plan; pt understands and concurs

                                                Around 6 pm the same day of first pfizer vaccine (3/18/21), i woke up from a nap and my back hurt so bad that i couldn&#39;t leave the bed without falling out. My parents came and helped me out and gave me painkillers but really nothing helped. Next day, it started down my right arm (the arm NOT injected with the shot) and it started to hurt in my muscles everywhere and hasn&#39;t stopped to this day (3/25/21). Numbness and pins and needles feeling have occurred in my pinky and ring finger of right arm. Pain has now started in my knees as well after a few days from the shot. No pain killers work and I&#39;m unable to write or type properly, or even work at my job frankly. I can&#39;t hold an object without it falling out of my hand, and when i am able to hold something, after about 2 seconds pain fills my arm. Nothing helps the pain. I saw my primary care physician on 3/25/21 and the PA said there wasn&#39;t anything to do for the intense pain i was having except take tylenol arthritis, melatonin (to help me sleep through the pain), exercise (even though it may cause me even worse pain), and a stress ball for my arm. I don&#39;t know what else to do with this pain and this was only the first round of shots.

                                                Adverse event started the morning of 3/10/21 around 08:00 am. Symptoms included headache, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, feeling feverish, and itching on torso, arms, and legs . Symptoms seemed to improve over the next week or two before worsening again on 3/27/21 around 10:00 am. On the day of 3/27 /21 I experienced headaches, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, muscle aches, diarrhea, and vision problems. Currently on 3/30/21 symptoms have improved but I am still experiencing dull headaches and brain fog, as well as itching on torso, arms and legs and some vision problems.   I have not seen a provider  for these issues but have an appointment scheduled for 3/31/21. Treatment includes ibuprofen as needed.

                                                9 hours after the shot I started to feel really groggy and sore with my left arm hurting. 12 hours in I started to feel like I had a fever so i checked it and it was 102 degree F, I was also unable to pick my left arm up due to the pain and my whole body hurt a lot. 13 hours in at about 10 pm that night I started full-body shaking violently and needed help from my parents into my room because I could not walk because my legs were wobbling so much. I felt lightheaded and the shaking continued for about 20 minutes. During this time I checked my temp again and it was 105 degrees F. Once the shaking stopped the fever and intense pain continued until 2 am when it dropped down to 102 degrees F and I was able to fall asleep. The next morning I woke at 8am with a temp of 100 degree F with the same all-over-body pain that lasted all day but the fever dropped until that night. That night it came back at 100 degrees F.  This cycle lasted from when I got my shot on the 1st until 4th when the fever stopped. The pain has subsided around the 6th. But I am currently still having pain in my left shoulder where I got my shot today on the 8th.

                                                He became very confused about time, went into the bathroom to brush his teeth 2 days after his 1st Pfizer shot and would not stop brushing his teeth for 30 hours. His parents tried to get him to stop several times. He only stopped because his parents finally called 911 to have someone help remove him from the bathroom. His gums were bleeding and he was limping a bit from standing at the sink brushing his teeth for so long. He was taken to the ER, his vitals looked good overall but he was dehydrated. Hospital could not explain why he did that, what was happening inside his brain. He could also not explain why he did that when asked. Very upsetting for his parents and siblings who felt they had no control over stopping him. It was mentioned he might need a neurological specialist. He improved once home. Seems he got very confused about time, did not understand how long he had been brushing his teeth and could not be reasoned with. He mentioned in the car on the way home from the ER with his dad that he still needed to brush his teeth once home. This scared his dad and his dad took him to go eat a meal outside of the home and that seemed to break up the time loop in patient&#39;s head. When they returned home patient no longer tried to brush his teeth for a long period of time.

I hope you stop misleading the public and communicate that myocarditis and severe inflammation IS 100% A SIDE EFFECT THAT IS CAUSED BY THE VACCINE RESPONSE. I know because I am experiencing it, and you&#39;ve ruined the last 24 days of my life. Thank you.

A 25-year-old male patient received the first dose for BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot No. EWO187) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 19May2021 at 12:00 or 13:00. Relevant history included Diabetes, obesity, endocrine abnormalities, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, respiratory illness, compromised immune status and Allergies. The patient had Allergies to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can induce anaphylactic shock, severe reaction, swelling of face and throat. Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Additional Vaccines were Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect If applicable. No Vaccines were Administered prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Family Medical History was none. About 3-5 minutes after being administered the Vaccine, the patient immediately developed anaphylactic shock. He was transported via ambulance to the Emergency Room on 19May2021 where he verified he was admitted to the hospital Emergency room for about 5-6 hours and discharged from the hospital the same day, 19May2021. He was told not to get any additional doses.  He was still having swelling of the throat and went back to the ER today and was given a steroid prednisone 40mg a day for 5 days.  He was advised to take benadryl also.  He said he didn&#39;t get any IVs or anything.  He had a past medical history of anaphylactic reaction to NSAIDS.  He has been advised not to get the second dose. The patient stated the anaphylactic shock occurred with trouble breathing, throat was swelling and itchy throat. He did go into ER, they told him to just keep drinking fluids, that there was nothing else they could really do. When he was seen in the emergency room they gave him Benadryl and a steroid: Prednisone for now which he is on for the next couple of days. He was told that after 2 days or something, that after getting injected that he wouldn&#39;t have any symptoms-but he is still having those pretty severe symptoms of anaphylactic shock. Initial onset of anaphylactic shock was about 3-5 minutes after Pfizer Covid Vaccine shot was administered. Within 10-15 minutes he had swelling of tongue and throat and difficulty breathing. They called an ambulance, the ambulance took him to the Hospital emergency room where he was admitted and discharged that same date on 19May2021 after about 5-6 hours; he reported discharge time was around 16:40. They told him to come back if he had any issues that occurred over next couple of days or worsening or causing problems; to call back the nurses line. He was on a lot of Benadryl, a lot of antihistamines. When he gets off the antihistamines almost all the allergic reactions of the anaphylactic shock reoccur. This morning, 21May2021, he didn&#39;t take any Bendaryl before bed, and this morning when he woke up he was alright. After being at work like 30 minutes he felt the itchiness; scratchy throat; swelling of tongue; a little swelling of the throat; difficulty breathing. He took Benadryl and called the hotline who told him to call the Emergency room, he called the emergency room and went there. He talked to them this morning because he went to work and had issues breathing. He called and they told him to come in asap, so he went in to the emergency room; they gave him Benadryl and told him there was nothing else they could do other than him taking the steroid: Prednisone. The patient was in the hospital 3 days and will be day 4 tomorrow. He was trying to figure out how long this will last. They told him to talk to his doctor. They basically told him they were not responsible. The patient&#39;s mother reported that her son received the shot Wed 19May2021. Does not know if the Walgreen&#39;s reported this. He left there in an ambulance within 10 minutes of getting the shot. They took him to the emergency room and he got mixed information. He went back again today. They blew him off and told him maybe it was something he ate. She assumed that an allergic reaction would be about 24 hours but this is day 3. She is scared he may be taking too much Benadryl. He said he felt like he needed something to drink. Said that his throat felt really thirsty. He went back inside since his throat fell really tight. They told him was throat was closing up. They saw that his throat was swollen and they called the paramedics. Within 15 minutes they came and brought him to the emergency room.  Nobody had given him Epi. They were going to give it to him an Epi pen  but he wanted to wait for the paramedics. He was freaking out. The paramedics showed up and they were unable to give him Epi, stating he didn&#39;t have hives. He only received Benadryl. They he had to have to give him extra Benadryl because whatever they gave him in the IV because the first didn&#39;t work and his throat was still closing up. It made him feel like a drug addict asking for Benadryl.  She was not sure if they gave him Benadryl in the ambulance, knows that it was given in the emergency room. The Benadryl may have been started in the ambulance but she is not sure. They did give him oxygen in the ambulance. Clarified he was in the ER over 4 hours, but was not admitted to the hospital. They gave him steroids but forgot to send him home with steroids. He had to call to find out about getting them and they told him they forgot to send the prescription in. He was late starting the next dose of steroids. He went back to the ER today, day 3. He didn&#39;t feel too bad today and went to work. After exerting a little energy and moving around, his throat started to do it again. He didn&#39;t have Benadryl on him. He left work because he thought it was going to close up again the day he got the shot. Once he calmed down, he took Benadryl. He called the hospital to ask if this was  normal. He was told that it is not normal and was told that if he still felt bad, to come to the hospital. They said maybe it was something he ate or maybe sinuses. He spoke to one of the doctors. They had never shown him how to use an ePi pen. He does not know how long this will last. He gets scared. Treatment: Has only been taking Benadryl. He started the steroids yesterday and today. They had given him Benadryl today in the ER and he is home now. The patient visited to the Emergency room twice, first time by ambulance, confirmed he was not admitted. He was pretty devastated. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Woke up in the middle of the night with sharp chest pain. Went to the ER and was diagnosed with costochondritis. I recovered within a few days just medicating with advil and tylenol. I am reporting this incident because I have seen reports from the CDC about cases of myocondritis occuring after vaccination, and symptoms very similar to what I experienced.   https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html

After about a week, COVID fog/fatigue symptoms began.  It is currently 6 weeks later and I have fatigue, shortness of breath, head pressure, double vision, cannot concentrate for any length of time and dizziness/unsteadiness.  I have not been able to go to work since the vaccination and have people helping take care of me.  I cannot take a shower without being short of breath after.  I have been put on 2 different rounds of steroids ? the 2nd more aggressive, which did not make a difference.  I have been to my general doctor several times, an allergist and a neurologist.  I have had extensive bloodwork, an MRI, and an EKG ? all were normal.  My symptoms have not improved at all in the past 3-4 weeks.

                                                Over a month after receiving my second dose of Pfizer, I had an episode of lightheadedness, dizziness, shakiness, and fatigue. I attributed it to dehydration and laid down and ate a snack, I began to feel better after 1-2 hours. A week later I had another lightheadedness incident that sent me back to bed (this one being slightly worse). I experience slight chest pain in my upper right chest muscle. It took me a day to recover from this spell. I constantly felt weak and as if I was about to faint. I went to the doctor two days later and got blood work done and measured my blood pressure. Everything came back normal. On Saturday June 19th, I had another near-fainting experience in a public setting. My hearing changed, I couldn&#39;t think straight, I was very shaky and weak, and I tried to drink a lot of water. Nothing helped so I went home and once I got in bed I was aggressively shaking. Since then I have been bed-ridden for the week, and unable to do normal activities such as go for walks, exercise, or go to work. I am going to visit a cardiologist tomorrow.
