                                                First dose (12/30/20): Vivid dreams and frequent nocturnal awakenings upon receiving the first dose. Experienced tiredness the next day, unsure of whether it was the vaccine or lack of sleep. Second dose (1/19/21): Awakened every hour to1.5 hours that night with markedly vivid dreams in between awakenings. Upon trying to take a nap, the same situation occurred, with a vivid dream and awakening within 1.5 hours.  I have had vivid dreams in the past, but not with that frequency before. The dreams and difficulty sleeping improved the next night and had resolved within 24 hours.

The first dose was on 12/21/20. These symptoms resolved around 12/26/20. I received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/11/21. I began experiencing symptoms on 01/12/21. The symptoms I was experiencing were lightheadedness, dizziness, and brain fog/confusion. These symptoms got significantly worse from 01/13/21 - 01/24/21 and I began developing profound confusion/brain fog, diplopia, blurry vision, headaches, feeling like I&#39;m swaying on a boat,  and the &#34;feeling of being drunk&#34;. As of 01/25/21, the symptoms have seemed to get better and I am starting to feel more like myself. The drunk feeling and mild blurry vision are still present as of today 01/28/21.

Before bed time, had cold sweats and shakes. 1/29 - woke up feeling perfectly fine.  2/17 - Second dose of vaccine. Arm felt sore and was sore two days after. From 2/18-2/20, I noticed the effects of the Cymbalta were gradually decreasing and was experiencing side effects (shocks from toe to head every step). Turns out that even with taking my regular dose of the Cymbalta, my body after 2 hours feels like I had never taken it.   2/20 - After experiencing heavy shocks, shaking, and heart racing, I went home after coming into work 3 hours later.  2/21 - Woke up today feeling dizzy, fatigued, and weak. I know that operating a motor vehicle will not be possible for me.

                                                I took notes during my wait time: -6 minutes in my throat felt weird, but different than normal allergic reactions to foods. I prepared my Epi-Pen so I have easier access at this time. -9 minutes in the sides of my tongue were slightly itchy. -11 minutes in and I felt as though the saliva in the back of my throat was thicker and I needed to clear my throat a bit more often, similar to allergic reactions. -15 minutes in, I felt my heart pound once out of beat, but my heart rhythm returned to normal immediately. Tongue itchiness also became intermittent rather than constant. -18 minutes in, overall condition improved and I felt better. -22 minutes in, my throat felt scratchy like I would if I consumed legumes (chickpeas, green peas, soy beans, etc.) but also oddly warm, which was out of the norm.  No treatments needed given mild reactions. I went to work, but notified my co-workers of my reaction, so if my condition worsens they can help administer my Epi-Pen. I am reporting this at 9:21 am on 03/05/2021, roughly an hour after my first dose.

                                                On 2/13/2021, I began to experience both enhanced and new musculoskeletal and neurological symptoms that have not completely resolved still, today, 3/16/2021. While I had experienced some slight discomfort and pain of the b/l thumbs 2-3 weeks prior to 2/13, I began to experience increased pain up to the forearm in both arms on that day. In addition to pain, I had large muscular knots in the superior forearms, especially the right arm. The lower right arm felt extremely tight, and I was having difficulty raising the arm and gripping things. This continued for 2-3 weeks on the right arm. During that time, symptoms worsened on the left arm, while improving on the right arm. A week after the initial symptoms my left arm became worse, and I was struggling to lift objects as light as a sheet of paper. I was also having trouble typing at work, dialing the phone, and opening or closing my hand. Just over a week after symptoms began, I left work to determine a cause and solution for my issues. I also began to have tremors, extreme muscle spasms, and involuntary movements around this time for about 2-3 weeks. While the neurological symptoms have mostly subsided, still, today, 3/16/2021, I continue to deal with various inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms affecting mostly my left arm, but also my right arm. Since yesterday, my left shoulder has begun to have pain as well, making raising my arm and reaching to the opposite side difficult due to pain. I have also had persistent popping of various joints in both arms since the initial symptoms began.

This might be unrelated, but I want to bring it up. About 18 hours after the vaccine, I started to get chills, become clammy, both hot and cold at the same time, and slight fatigue. 24 hours after my vaccine, I noticed that my headache got worse, i felt much more fatigued, and my head felt warmer.

A 26-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9266) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 21Feb2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 26-years-old) as a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, weakened immune system, and allergy to loratadine (CLARITIN). Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) as needed and fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR 500/50). On 21Feb2021 at 14:15, the patient experienced headache, tiredness and was feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine. The next day, on 22Feb2021, the patient experienced significant soreness at injection site. The patient was not treated for headache, tiredness, feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine, and significant soreness at injection site. The clinical outcome of headache, tiredness, feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine, and significant soreness at injection site was recovering.

Woke up with low grade fever (~99-100) with fatigue, haziness and mild muscle aches (similar to a cold without the respiratory symptoms).  All symptoms subsided a couple hours later (~10pm) and felt completely fine the next day.

Following that I woke up in the night experiencing auditory hallucinations and delusions.  The following day I was exhausted, had a low grade fever, and that night I continued to experience night terrors and delusions.  A few days after getting the vaccine I began experiencing unusual digestive problems, going from extremes of eating large quanities of food (3000-4000 calories a day) to not feeling hungry and barley eating anything at all.  I have still experienced night terrors, nightmares as well as delusions and hallucinations almost every night since getting the vaccine.  The symptoms are starting to occur during the daytime as well when I am fully awake.

Normally if I get heartburn it?s after a meal, but this was constant throughout the day and night. I am still feeling the heartburn, although it seems it?s not as bad as before. I also developed the worst depression and anxiety of my life. It hit me Friday, April 9 like a bag of bricks. I started crying out of nowhere. I have had intense depression since. The anxiety has been worse than the depression. Pretty much unbearable worry and panic. I have been waking up in the middle of the night around 4 am every night worried. Also when I wake up in the morning I wake up in a panic. The feeling has been terrible and also consistently present.

It&#39;s hard to breathe without coughing and pain. And the nausea came I had body aches too. But everything else went away except for the nausea which has been haunting me and the difficulty breathing which has limited the amount of work i do at work and has had an impact on my sleeping as well.

A 26-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11May2021 at 11:00 (Lot Number: EW0176, expiration date: Aug2021, at the age of 26-year-old) as 0.3 ml, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Apr2021 about 5:00pm (lot number: ER8731, expiration date: Jul2021, at the age of 26-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. When he got the first one, he was fine. The day after he received the second shot, he fainted while using the restroom and woke on the bathroom floor on 12May2021 at 07:30, he was on the floor for a few minutes, 2 to 3 minutes. After that there was no other fainting. Patient had been having heart palpitations since the second dose on 13May2021. Did not particularly remember the time, just that it was in the middle of the day. The palpitations were going away and were less prevalent. He went to the Emergency room (ER) this past Sunday night because it was really working up and he couldn&#39;t wait to go to the doctor. Physician office was no. Electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood work were done in the emergency room on unspecified date in May2021 and came back normal. He was supposed to meet with a cardiologist next week. On unspecified date in May2021, he still felt kind of like he senses his heart beating but he didn&#39;t usually think about. It felt more strange, than soreness. This was all just so new. Thought it was a sign that he was going to recover and it was going to go away. The palpitations were coming on less and less. Was not so much of an irregular heart beat than last week. On unspecified date in May2021, felt like his heart was getting strong. Felt like his heart was making it&#39;s way back and was more like a sore or a strain. It had been going down and he was not feeling his heart in his chest. Treatment was no, not this far. There was not prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The outcome of the event &#34;fainted while using the restroom and woke on the bathroom floor&#34; was unknown, for other events was recovering.

Took 50mg of benadryl shortly after and symptoms improved over the following hour.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899/expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 27Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that he got the vaccination on the 27th and then that same night he started to feel a little sick. He was assuming that it has just to be the side effect of the vaccine (unspecified vaccine). On 28Dec2020, he was feeling pretty sick; he did not go to the work. He had COVID-19 test (Dec2020) and results came back positive. He added that he didn&#39;t know if it was the COVID because he was reading up on the vaccines and it said that one could not get COVID from the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported positive with COVID-19 test after COVID-19 immunization is considered ineffective of BNT162B2, and the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported event and BNT162B2 administration.

                                                Around 7 pm I started feeling really anxious. I checked my HR on my smart watch and it said that around 12pm my HR was 157bpm which was right after getting the vaccine when I started walking home. My  resting HR is usually 47-52bpm. I am a very active person. I have been waking up in the middle of the night multiple times in night sweats and it feels like my heart is contracting very hard. I notice that my HR jumps up right when I start to be more active, but more than normal. On the 11th my average walking HR was 140. Today at work my HR was 134 at the highest around 9am and the lowest was 56bpm around 7am when I was getting ready for work. Additionally to the increased HR I have SOB when I walk and talk. I did have a sore arm as well the first day, but nothing more than any other injection I have had before.

I took two 325mg tablets of Tylenol around 9:30pm and went to bed. I couldn&#39;t sleep until around 1am when I vomited about 7 times in a row. When I woke up the next day, I still had a lower grade fever that fluctuated and felt sore all over with a headache. I barely had any appetite and all I ate all day was some crackers with peanut butter and a lot of apple juice and water. I took one additional 325mg Tylenol. I slept for about four hours in the middle of the day being exhausted. I took two additional 325mg Tylenol before going to bed at 9:30pm. As of this morning, two days after the shot, I am feeling mostly back to normal. Slight headache and a bit sore but I have an appetite back and am still relaxing.

I am unable to think. My speech is completely off. I try to say something, but what I say is not what I was thinking. Don&#39;t you dare say I have something wrong with me, in regards to unable to articulate what I want to say, and what Is actually being said. I understand what is happening to me with this reality. Which is why this vaccine is terroristic. Im going to make it my life endeavored goal to resolve this in legal entities. For that. This is not helping anyone. Causing more pain. And. Allowing the government to lie even more. I hate this Country!

Nothing serious until I fell asleep, which is when I developed a fever, uncontrollable chills, and aches all over my body, so much that I could not sleep until I took some ibuprofen. In the morning, the chills were gone, but a slight fever and body aches remained all day. They were gone by the next day.

                                                27 year old male with Down&#39;s Syndrome and no other past medical history received second COVID-19 vaccine on 4/27/2021. On 4/30/2021 began &#34;feeling poorly&#34; with nausea/vomiting and possible chest discomfort. Originally presented to ED on morning of 4/30 - EKG completed demonstrated diffused ST elevation. Patient was transferred to Medical Center for heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries and LVEDP of 25. Stat ECHO demonstrated pericardial effusion and concern raised for myopericarditis. Patient subsequently transferred to a different Medical Center for higher level of care. Upon arrival to Medical Center plan was to intubate and take to cath lab for heart biopsy and PA catheter placement. However, upon intubation patient began to decompensate and subsequently developed cardiac arrest. During ACLS, VA ECMO was placed and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. Following VA ECMO placement patient received IVIG, high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg), anakinra 100 mg, and broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn). Despite these efforts the patient continued to have hemodynamic instability and was on high dose vasopressors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, angiotensin II, vasopressin). Patient subsequently suffered another cardiac arrest, briefly regained pulse with high dose vasopressors, but subsequently lost pulse despite best efforts and died on 5/1/2021 at approximately 13:00.

                                                After about an hour following my second COVID-19 Injection I began feeling warm.  My forehead felt warmer so I figure I may have had a slight fever at that point.  I received a metallic (Note I say metallic but I know it wasn&#39;t actually metal but that&#39;s simply the best way I can describe the taste I experienced) following the injection about 5 minutes after.  My arm remained sore following and still remains sore as of this report.  I experienced a decline in mental acuity following about an hour after injection.  I began to feel lightheaded and exhausted to the point I was experiencing severe disorientation and confusion.  I was having trouble putting sentences together and experienced a ringing sensation in the ears.  I felt like I wasn&#39;t even present anymore.  I couldn&#39;t comprehend things around me and apparently had conversations I don&#39;t even remember having.  Note that at that point I had gotten home but don&#39;t even remember getting home.  I just know that this did not begin to wear off until around 8:45pm  when it was like someone flipped a switch and I suddenly was coherent again.  It was an odd sensation to experience.  The arm remained sore and the metallic taste returned briefly after this experience.  I experienced a similar feeling from the HPV injection years ago, but just like this it was a temporary thing that resulted in no long term issues.  However, I cannot tell you fully what we did the rest of the day until around 845-9 pm.  I also remember becoming partly agitated after the injection like my body just all of a sudden took notice of something and shot into action.  I had received my allergy injections this same day about two hours earlier as well and none of these reactions ever occur with those for me.  I continued to drink liquid as far as I know as there were a few empty bottles of water next to me.  I have no recollection of getting them.  It&#39;s odd.  There&#39;s just this brief moment in time that is just missing from my memory with a few short bits and pieces that are there like a puzzle with some missing pieces.  I feel I became so fatigued I could not function.  My emotions I remember were off and hard to control during this period too.  I felt like I was having some random mood swings.  I feel ok now though aside from the upset stomach occasionally and the fatigue and arm pain (but even the arm pain has partly decreased now).  It all ceased.  I have a number of health issues outside of this but have not experienced this long of a period of almost intermittent amnesia and incoherency following an injection before.  I believe it made me that much more tired or reacted with one of my many conditions or genetic variants that perhaps may have been part of this.  I&#39;m happy to provide anything I can to help with this.  I am greatly appreciative of all the CDC has done to get us this vaccine and continues to do to ensure our safety both before and after injection.  It is commendable.    I did fill out my survey through the V-Safe portal as well and will continue to follow up there should I have any changes.  I have not sought medical care following this event as the coherency and such have seemed to resolve in regards to the vaccine injection.  Only thing left are known side effects at this point besides an occasional increase in numbness and tingling that I already experience in my legs and feet.  My absolute best guess for the cause is my immune system which already has some issues regulating (doesn&#39;t always like to learn everything it should and we are currently searching for an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder currently going on as well in me) on top of allergy shots today.  it was perhaps just a bit too much demand on it all at once.  But it seems to be balancing out again now.

Whole body chills, severe body and head aches, slight on and off &#34;brain fog&#34;, slight cough, heavy fatigue, and a fever that was recorded every few hours ranging from 101.2 to 103.5. It lasted all day long that I was awake (0600-2000). Treated with Dayquil and Nyquil Severe Cold and Flu. Woke up the next day, and all that was left was slight body and head aches and slight cough; temp back to normal, ranging 98.9 to 99.2.

I had 3 fans in my room for white noise and it was still so bad I could not fall asleep again.  This lasted for about 4 hours and and slowly went away. As i&#39;m writing this it has been ~27 hours since my 2nd dose. Hopefully it does not come back again.   I&#39;ve selected permanent damage below since I read online there is no cure for tinnitus. But there&#39;s not been enough time that has passed to determine if this is a one off occasion or I may experience this effect for life.

Progressively became more frequent (20&#43; / day), longer lasting (up to 20 seconds) and more severe (like stabbing or electric shock). Gradually resolved after course of dexamethasone beginning 3 weeks after vaccination.   Sharp inner ear pain -- (both ears) began ~1 week after Pfizer second dose. Rare events (~5x / day), very transient (1-2 seconds) but extremely painful. Continues up to present,  (4 weeks after Pfizer second dose). Also constant popping of both ears beginning week 2 to present, feels like fluid inside.   Adenopathy -- On 4/28/21 noticed massive swelling on left pectoral muscle (contralateral to vaccine injection site), diagnosed as lymphadenopathy, moderately painful. Continued to get worse for 1 week, began dexamethasone on 5/7/21. Dramatically improved, however swelling returned after discontinuing steroid and spread to all lymph nodes, including neck and others. Became extremely painful on 5/14/21, unable to walk due to swelling in inguinal lymph nodes.  Again dramatically improved after steroid injection on 5/16/21.

On 5/15 in the hospital he was having a hard time breathing and they were trying to give him meds to make him better, they gave him antibiotics because his blood work showed infection, and Precedex to help him rest, and he passed away the same day, he was in good health before. They also said his heart rate was 201/123 and the doctors said pulmonary anema.  It escalated so quickly.

                                                Heart pain; Fever; Headache; Stomach ache; Difficulty to sleep; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 28-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 28-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 03May2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 28-years-old), administered in Arm Left on Apr2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced the normal symptoms like fever but it was just a mild fever, headache, stomach ache, and difficulty to sleep but the reason he is calling is because he was experiencing heart pain. He received the vaccine for protection on 03May2021 and for all the symptoms he had all started the same day he got the vaccine which all the symptoms started that night. The heart pain was only 10 minutes to 15 minutes that the pain lasted and it was painful but he relaxed himself and the pain went away by itself and he was not scared. He just laid down until the pain relieved and he took no medication. The outcome of the event heart pain was recovered on 03May2021, while for the rest of the events was recovered on 04May2021. The events were considered as non-serious by reporter. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional administered vaccines. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I laid him to the ground while supporting his head.  He regained consciousness quickly, but was disoriented.   NP assisted by taking vitals/911 called.  Paramedics arrived and then took over evaluation.  Pt was taken to ambulance for further evaluation, as he still could not walk to diziness.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I felt palpitations around 10-12 minutes after the 1st Pfizer dose was given, and asked the Doctor to take my vital signs. I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

                                                After leaving the vaccination clinic following the 15 minute waiting period, I felt normal and ran a quick errand before returning to work. After completing the errand (roughly 15 minutes), I began driving back to my office (roughly 10 minute drive). As I was roughly 1/2 mile from the office, I started to feel slightly lightheaded/woozy. I continued to drive toward the office, and within a matter of a couple minutes or less, I was overcome with extreme disorientation and faintness. Before I could manage to return to the office or pull over to collect myself, I completely lost consciousness and crashed into another vehicle. Even after the crash, I was unconscious for roughly a minute or so until I finally came to and realized what had happened. It then took me another couple of minutes to collect myself and exit the vehicle to assess the situation and ensure all parties were alright. Police/Emergency services were contacted and a police report was filed. After the event, I remained slightly nauseated for approximately 3 hours and had intermittent chill episodes, but the adverse events have since subsided.

Pharmacy staff put his legs up and gave him water, he continued to be a little disoriented and when he tried to get up , started to look like he would pass out again so we kept him down.

                                                At around 11 pm the night of getting the vaccine in the morning, I began to feel fatigued, achy, and chills. I went to bed soon after, and started to have a headache. Had trouble sleeping the whole night because of the pain, when I woke up at 6 am all symptoms were worse.  These symptoms continued throughout the morning, after a couple hours a new symptom started: a pain in my left armpit and the left pectoral (just part of it closest to the armpit). I was vaccinated in the left arm. This pain grew in intensity. By 11 pm  on 4/16 (when I?m filling this out), the armpit pain is sharp. The other symptoms have subsided a bit (headache, chills, aches and fatigue).

                                                The first day I got the vaccine, my arm became very sore about 4 hours afterward. It kept getting more sore until I fell asleep. I stretched and massaged it.  The next day (Sunday), I woke up to a small canker sore in the left side of my mouth behind my top lip. It is right by where my canine and lateral incisor intersect. I thought nothing of it since I do occasionally get canker sores. As the day went on, the pain increased. I also noticed that two more sores had appeared. One on my lower lip right below where the original one is, and on my gums near my throat, like right where the gums end and throat begins. All on the left side. I got the shot in the left arm.  They&#39;re all more painful than usual, but the first one is the worst and is the biggest one I&#39;ve ever had. Normally if I get one (like once every other month) the canker sore is small, white, and hurts if I touch it. The one behind my top lip is causing my lip to be noticeably swollen when I open my mouth, and it&#39;s definitely left a crater. I can&#39;t brush my teeth near where it is because it feels like I&#39;m ripping out my flesh.  In addition, a submandibular node feels weird. It&#39;s not quite painful, but it&#39;s definitely a weird sensation that is noticeable at all times. I started feeling it one day after the vaccine, and today (two days after) the feeling is much more pronounced.  I have not seen a doctor since it seems like others have had these side effects, and they went away after a couple days. I just wanted to provide more data since it&#39;s definitely not the most comfortable thing right now.

                                                After a few hours of receiving the vaccine, I could start to feel soreness in my left armpit (lymphnode). This moved to all of left arm even all left side of body. Began feeling very tired. Less than 12 hrs after receiving 2nd dose I had to leave work early. 3:30 am the next morning I had uncontrollable shivers/tremors. To the point where I couldn&#39;t stand on my own. I had a fever of 101 degrees. As a result of the tremors I had entire body soreness. Hot flashes; alternating from sweat to freezing. Side effects began to dissipate after a full 24 hours.

Patient was clearing his throat periodically. Patient states he has anxiety, so he also believes that is adding to his symptoms. After checking vitals  administered epi and dial 911. Patient had started to clear his throat more often.  Continued to monitor patients symptoms and did not have any worsening of symptoms and after approximately 5 minutes, he stated he felt better. EMS arrived and discussed with patient and he elected to refuse transport to the hospital. He has a buddy in the parking lot who drove him here.

                                                The vaccination was administered on Saturday evening, December 19th, 2020. The next morning around 10 am I began to feel nauseous and light-headed. That feeling waxed and waned all day and improved in the evening. The next morning on Monday, December 21st I was 10/10 nauseous and near vomiting. I went to work but had to leave because of nausea. Ultimately I vomited upon returning home and was nauseous with abdominal pain and achy all day. The next morning on Tuesday, December 22 nausea continued but with a rating of around 6/10. Then came the intense headache, body aches, and fatigue. This continued into the next day  (Wednesday, December 23) prompting me to get COVID tested and take off of work on Thursday, December 24th. Nausea improved (5/10)  on December 24th but fatigue, abdominal pain,  and body aches did not. December 25-27 were slow improvements with nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue but were limiting activities of daily living. By Monday, December 28th most symptoms had cleared.

All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

                                                In the evening after getting the shot, I started getting chills and became more sensitive to cold temperatures.  Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

This side affect lasted for about 5-10 minutes. After which I left and haven&#39;t felt right since and it&#39;s been about 8 hours since receiving the vaccine and at the time of writing it is now 1630 time.

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

After patient was released from vaccine site, he developed shortness of breath, and went to the ER, where he was given diphenhydramine, which patient says helped. Patient then had 10 days of symptoms neurological and cardiovascular symptoms (slowed cognition, mood changes, somnolence/hypersomnia, palpitations) and went to ER four times and was diagnosed with a concussion/post concussive syndrome. He was referred to neurology and had an EEG conducted. He was given prednisone during this time.

                                                After getting the vaccine in my left arm, I walked to observation area and sat down in chair. Within a minute or so, I noticed my heart rate was slightly elevated and had a strange feeling of unease. Roughly 3-5 minutes later symptoms appeared and I noticed my palms were sweating and I had slightly blurred vision. At this point, I called for a paramedic and told them I wasn?t feeling well. They arrived nearly 15 seconds later (paramedics were stationed all throughout observation area). Symptom severity dramatically increased (very blurred vision, feeling of something clearly being wrong) and was added by a ringing sound in both ears. I was helped into a wheel chair and rolled into an enclosed area with a curtain around for privacy. Gatorade was offered to me and I took a few sips and felt very mildly better. Paramedics reported that my blood pressure was extremely low (63/28). They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. Symptoms were the same and starting to very slightly get better from the Gatorade so I said let?s wait a few minutes to see how I feel. At this point they took my blood sugar measurement and found that it was also very low (53mg). They gave me some intravenous fluids and a glucose substance that was in a tube (sort of like toothpaste) and within another five minutes I felt considerably better. I received the IV treatment for roughly 20 minutes and symptoms progressively got better over the course of the treatment. My blood pressure went back up to 117/80 and my blood sugar went up to a more normal level as well (I believe they said somewhere in the 90s or low 100?s). After they removed the IV and blood pressure monitor, I rested for roughly 20 minutes before walking to my car and driving home.

                                                As a person who has never had any kind of allergies--including seasonal allergies--as of the week I received the vaccine, I appear to have developed a new allergy to dust mites. When resting my head against a pillow (especially near the open end of the pillow case), I develop sneezing, complete sinus congestion (to the point I am not able to breathe from either nostril), runny eyes, and similar histamine responses. The symptoms have responded well to diphenhydramine and loratadine, as well as use of allergen-resistant pillowcases, but they have reduced my sleep quality in the weeks since they developed, and I feel this new allergy has negatively impacted my quality of life.

It became hard to discern my thoughts. I also, began to experience a difficult time with my vision not being able to control what my vision was focusing on, as well as seeing a blue tint in my vision. I am also experiencing mild pressure and aches on the right side of my back and left side of my chest. These effects have been continuous for the last 4 days. To treat these symptoms I have been using natural remedies, and have maintained a stable condition due to that.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced suicidal ideation, extreme fatigue, depressed mood, brain fog, irritability, tinnitus, body temperature fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. No treatment was received for the events. The reporter considered the events as non-serious. The event outcome was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering close temporal association, a possible contributory role of bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be completely excluded. However the clinical course, relevant medical history and concomitant medications are pending for a medically meaningful assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I&#39;m really hoping to get some guidance as I seem to be having a very strange reaction to the vaccine. Approximately 2 weeks from my 1st vaccine on 3/16/2021; I had sudden panic attacks. I never had a panic attack or anxiety before. Following the panic attacks, I have been struggling with several major symptoms: no appetite/ loss of appetite, chronic headache(almost daily), GI problems, and most noteworthy, daily inexplicable waves of anxiety and worry.  As mentioned, I have no history of anxiety or panic attacks. I also am experiencing chills, sweating, shaking, and a lot of brain fog/ inability to concentrate. The symptoms did start to subside to some degree, but as of today (4/24/21) I had more sudden and inexplicable rushes of anxiety and panic. Some other symptoms are an elevated resting heart rate and higher than usual blood pressure. I have also been waking from sleep suddenly with a feeling of jitteriness in my chest and palpitations. I have had trouble sleeping and almost feel like a rush of adrenaline hits me right before I start to fall asleep. I received my 2nd vaccine on 4/6/2021 because I didn&#39;t think these could be related to the vaccine. I&#39;m seeing many people online mentioning similar reactions after getting their Pfizer vaccine.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 22Mar2021 at 12:30 at the age of 30 years-old, (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included dyspepsia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Severe Heartburn , blood pressure measurement from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Blood pressure , migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for blood pressure for 3 years and ongoing; pantoprazole (PANTOPRAZOLE) taken for stomach medication and heartburn for about a year. Patient states he got the first round 3 weeks ago and he is supposed to get the second dose next Monday but was advised by his doctor not to do that.      Patient states he got the shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and Tuesday 23Mar2021 he was tired and sluggish. On Wednesday 24Mar2021, mid afternoon, he had purple splotches all over his body, in arms and legs, like discoloration, his head felt like it had been dipped in cement and he couldn&#39;t think. States he felt cloudy, dizzy and woozy, nauseous, had a headache and feeling awful. States this occurred like 48 hours after the shot. He contacted a life long friend who is a doctor and works in a covid ward and he told him he was having a reaction and to take some Benadryl and Advil or Tylenol, and the friend told the patient to lay down and rest. He still didn&#39;t feel great but splotches went away and head felt a little bit clearer and he didn&#39;t feel like he was in slow motion or dizzy anymore by Wednesday evening, so he went to bed. On Thursday, the patient went into work but didn&#39;t feel great, not feeling 100%, and about noon on Thursday 25Mar2021, the symptoms started coming back, the purple splotches, his head felt just as bad, he had a headache, slow motion and not himself. The patient called his doctor and his friend and they said he needed to go in and get looked at. The patient tried to go into an urgent care and he states they said nope head to the ER. Patient states he was admitted into the ER and the ER staff said he was having more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave him steroids and an IV but he is not sure what it is and he was given, he thinks, Prednisone over the next couple days to help with side effects, he believes it was Prednisone, he knows it was a steroid. States he is not a fan of it and he doesn&#39;t like it at all. Patient states that he thought it was a pretty standard reaction and was not worried about it. Patient states he still gets headaches and maybe it&#39;s something else that is unrelated. States he stopped feeling tired and sluggish maybe the 29Mar2021, a week afterwards. Patient states that he has recovered with lasting effects as he&#39;s been getting migraines since then, states maybe it&#39;s unrelated but didn&#39;t happen a whole lot before. He has severe headaches and nothing he takes seems to help, has to turn lights off and works from home and patient reports that he had one yesterday. Patient states the purple splotches went away after he went to the ER and got on the medicine, the steroids.  P atient states the nausea was pretty constant when a headache comes on, he doesn&#39;t have a headache every day but when he gets a headache he is definitely nauseous.  The outcome of the events was for fatigue and sluggish, recovered with sequela, Purple splotches, dizzy and woozy slow motion, recovered, nausea and headache not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Adverse event 4/17/2021: severe chills, high fever (max = 102.7 F) that persisted on and off until 4/22/2021. Worst fevers were at night. Required support from spouse to do every day tasks. Stayed in seated or prone positions the majority of the time from 4/17/2021 to 4/19/2021. Treated with Tylenol. I would take 500 mg every 4 hours or 1000 mg every 6 hours and as I got further into the week I tried not to take Tylenol to avoid masking symptoms, but I would take it if temperature spiked which would happen randomly. Adverse event 4/19/2021: Hives developed on scalp and forehead following approximately 30 minutes of exposure to sunlight. These hives began to spread through 4/20/2021 and into 4/21/2021 to eventually cover entire upper torso including stomach, back, chest, neck, face and head. Treated with Singulair and Zyzol starting 04/21/2021 and stopped treatment once hives were gone on 4/23/2021.

Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

                                                Within 2-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy.  I signaled for help while in my car  and help arrived. Within the next few minutes the severity seemed to go from ?0-100? and I began to feel a deep impending sense of doom and panic/fear. I also felt extremely tense in my muscles and felt itchy in the chest area. That continued for 15 minutes or so before subsiding slowly. Staff surrounded my car and were very supportive and great about the situation.   It was one of the most frightening experiences to date I have had. No EpiPen type intervention was done. Once the event was on the downswing I was kept for additional observation and release on my own accord.  Everyone there was great. I am reporting for my own records in case further testing reveals I have an allergy to this vaccine for employment purposes should the vaccine become mandated prior to me having alternative means of vaccination or allergy testing competed to determine if it was an true reaction or not so I can get vaccinated safely.

                                                Upon receiving the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I immediately felt tingling or chills in the arm where the shot was administered.  This developed into muscle soreness as I sat through the waiting period before leaving the facility.  (For this reason, I had taken acetaminophen at about 8:30 that morning.)  I experienced both of these symptoms after my first shot of this COVID-19 vaccine, so these did not concern me.  After taking a nap back at my house, I woke up about 3:30 p.m. experiencing some partial numbness in my left arm, which received the injection.  It was not inhibitive, but I can somewhat relate it to the neuropathy my mother experienced before being diagnosed with diabetes in 2005.  It was a bit like the tingling I first experienced after the injection, but throughout the injected arm.  As I continued through that afternoon and evening, my arm kept getting stiffer and stiffer.  This prompted me to take my temperature at about 8 p.m. and then again at 10 p.m. Both of these tests resulted in a normal temperature of 98.3 or 98.4 degrees.  By the time I was about to climb into bed at midnight, the stiffness had spread to my shoulder joint -- such that almost any movement of that arm elicited some mild discomfort, especially if I leaned against the wall with that shoulder or raised my arm above my head.  I took a third dose of acetaminophen.  My normal prone sleeping position was not comfortable with this stiffness, so I did my best to sleep on my back.  Next, I woke up too hot about 3:30 a.m. (Wednesday, May 26) and could not get back to sleep.  Full-body chills set in soon after, prompting me to turn off my ceiling fan.  I faced some mild nausea as I attempted to get comfortable in bed again.  I suspected I was feverish by at least 4 a.m., but I did not get up to check my temperature until 5 a.m. The thermometer gave a reading of 100.3 degrees, so I took another dose of acetaminophen (my fourth in 24 hours) and tried to go back to sleep.

                                                This is reported by his mother.    Around 10:00 AM he got his vaccine.  Mother met him at 12:30 and went to lunch, said he felt OK.  She stayed with him a couple of hours, went home and apparently he went to sleep.  The next day he texted his mother and said that he felt yucky.  She told him to give it a couple of days, and he went to work all week, but said that after he ate he felt &#34;funny&#34;.  Then on Sunday, Mother&#39;s day on 5/9/21 and they face timed and was supposed to meet him at 5:30.  At 12:45 he had finished eating, ate some enchilladas and said that he felt weird.  He said that he was going to be ok to meet him at 5:30.  At 4:37 PM she texted him to say that she was on her way to meet him.  She got at the meeting place at 5:30 and he was usually there before her, this is a normal weekend ritual to exchange his dog.  She waited 9 minutes and she tried to facetime him thinking he was in traffic, and he didn&#39;t answer.  She thought he was just not answering.  She then waited 9 more minutes and then called his phone and local Hospital answered the phone and asked who she was, and she answered the questions, and she told her to get to the hospital.  She went to the hospital and the doctor came in and told her that he had the car running and he went to the gas pump to get gas and he stepped out of the car and collapsed.  The person who saw him told the attended that he had collapsed and they called 9-1-1 and he was pronounced dead.  He worked in a warehouse and was doing well and about to be certified to be a forklift driving.  They said that they worked on him and that they could not get his heart started again.   They had to do an autopsy which is against her religion and she will not find out those results for 3-6 months.  She said that he was healthy and looking forward to get tested at work.  They told her that he had an enlarged heart and an enlarged spleen, and had never had any heart issues in the past.    He walked 20,000 steps a day in the warehouse.    He was living in a sober man&#39;s facility, he has been clean for 18 months.  He had an addiction to pain pills and Xanax.    She feels that there was something in the vaccine that had something to do with it as he was perfectly healthy before the vaccine.

A 31-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17May2021 13:50 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0178) (at the age of 31 years old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no family history and no relevant tests. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient took the first dose of the COVID vaccine. About 25 minutes after, all of a sudden, his heartbeat increased really fast. He could not figure out what was going on. He had slight chest pain as well. It started out with him feeling uncomfortable in his chest. He told his wife that something was wrong. He was driving and had to pull over on the side of the road. The total episode lasted two to three minutes. He felt like he was going into cardiac arrest. His wife called 911. Within five minutes, they were there. They checked him out, and everything was normal. He thinks that normally his heart beats 70 to 80 beats per minute. His heart felt like it was beating 200 beats per minute. He felt his heart beating up to his neck. He felt like he could collapse. He clarifies that his heart was beating very fast for about 30 seconds. After that, his heart was still beating fast, but it started going down. Then after two minutes, it started going back to normal. His heart was still beating fast because he was still very anxious. He thinks the anxiety after ward was making his heart pump very fast. He was going to talk with his doctor next week to get checked out and find out if he has any underlying heart problems. He has never had any heart issues in the past. The outcome of events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Dose 2 - I had very severe body wide nerve pain, vertigo, terrible migraines, vision issues, confusion, short term memory loss and grasping for words and increased muscle weakness. It kind of mirrored a stroke. The pain was a 10/10. It was basically like all of my symptoms were getting progressively worse over the weeks. It&#39;s gotten better, but the symptoms are definitely still there. My neurologist increased the dosage of a few of my meds. At this time, they&#39;re basically managing my symptoms, but we do not have a definite source for the issue. However, the vaccine definitely caused the flare up because nothing else in my life has changed.

                                                I was sitting down at work when out of the blue I experienced heart palpitations, lightheadedness, weakness and shortness of breath that lasted for about an hour. I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

                                                Pfizer Dose #1: I felt pain in my arm, which was expected immediately. In ten hours, I had 103F fever, chills and tiredness. I can&#39;t even sleep all night. It was sore, tired and headache. I lost all of my smell &amp; appetite. It took me four days to recover my body.  Pfizer Dose #2: REPEAT it again

                                                Experienced bouts of mild vertigo lasting around 5 seconds a few times a day starting after the second or third day of vaccine.  By the weekend it hadn?t gotten worse to the point where I couldn?t leave the bedroom due to the walls literally spinning. That?s as the worst day then it progressively lessened until it went away by the second week.  Thought it was worth a mention.  My gf that I live with has also had ringing in her ear non stop since the second vaccine, so I?m a little concerned about the second shot.

                                                First day was just soreness at and around the injection site. The next day on the other hand. I woke up from what felt like hitting the exhaustion wall. Along the lines of being so worn out you can&#39;t even sleep. Along with heavy lethargy, soreness, a mental fuzziness, and a general feeling of unwell. To the point of forgoing water and food while famished as it meant having to move and stand in front of the stove. By about 1700ish I started to notice chill&#39;s/fever (I think, I did not grab a thermometer and check)  As of the time of writing this some of the lethargy has subsided. Though the rest has stuck around. Given that the second dose is more known to cause adverse effects. I am not looking forward to it. Which is to no way state that i won&#39;t go back and get my second dose. Just that at least for me are pretty rough.

I continued to feel like I was unable to perform at peak athletic performance. The second shot caused whole-body inflammation and another week of malaise and a cloudy mind. After one month I am still &#39;off&#39; and have had several episodes of nearly passing out with prolonged dizziness and fatigue, and am concerned about a heart complication from vaccination.

                                                In the morning of May 2nd I was driving and I felt my heart rate increasing lasted about 30 minutes to an hour. I ended up going to the ER and I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia, I stayed overnight. After that event I developed a cognitive fog and a sensation of numbness on the left side of my head like someone is pulling the skin on my face ever so slightly. I also developed a sense of imbalance like I am in a boat for an extended period of time. These feelings remained constant and I noticed that they were getting better by May 19th. At 6 am on May 19th I walk up to the feeling of my heart pounding and my heart rate increasing, I measured my pulse on my watch and it was around 150 bpm average. This event lasted about 5 minutes and went away. On May 19th around 10 pm I was in the shower and my heart rate increase again and I felt a tickling sensation on the left side of my chest when I was breathing in. I ended up going to the ER gain and stayed overnight. May 26th I felt the sensations of fogginess and just feeling off cognitively. May 27th I woke up rested without fogginess and after a morning walk with my dog I felt my heart increasing. This episode lasted about 10-20 minutes and my heart rate was ranging between 120-150 bpm. My stools from April 20th till May 26th have been lighter in color yellowish and soft, when I consumed vegetables I could see specs of them in my stools like they were not fully processed. May 27th was the first day where my stool color was brown but still soft.

                                                I received the COVID-19 vaccine at 9:30 am from vaccination clinic. I had just recovered from COVID-19 about two and a half weeks prior. I had no immediate reaction. I worked the entire day with no adverse effects other than a sore arm, which I expected. Later in the day at about 7:45 pm I went for a 6 mile run and got home at approximately 8:49 pm. Within half an hour of getting home, I quickly became feverish. The fever continued to rise until I was extremely hot, and hotter than I can ever remember as an adult or child. I did not have access to a thermometer so I cannot reliably report what the temperature was but I am estimating 103. It felt like every part of my body, including my legs, was hot to the touch. By 1 am I had serious chills and was shivering under winter blankets despite an outdoor temperature of 70-80. In addition, I had an extremely elevated heart rate and chest pain. I also had generalized muscle aches all over my body.  I did not sleep at all that night. The fever began to slowly dissipate early in the morning but the elevated heart rate continued for approximately 24 hours. The discomfort resulting from my elevated heart rate was substantial and alarming enough that I sought advice from my primary care physician after a nurse at my Occupational Health clinic suggested potentially getting an ECG. Ultimately, by Thursday morning, the symptoms had decreased and I declined any follow up. However, this was the single worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to any vaccine and the single worst fever I&#39;ve ever experienced as an adult or in my memory as a child. Although I am aware that people who have already had COVID-19 tend to have worse reactions to the first COVID vaccine, I am filing this report primarily because of my concern that exercise may trigger an especially severe reaction.

I was feeling feverish by the end of the day, a slight head ache,  clammy, mental fog, exhausted. The following day I had waves of nausea, and each of the previously reported symptoms were stronger. The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

An adult male patient with age at vaccination of 33-years-old received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration, on 30Dec2020, at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated he got the shot on 30Dec2020. There was no allergic reaction however, the site was sore, sore for a couple of days from an unspecified date. The patient added that from an unspecified date, he did have kind of brain fog, fatigue, and headache for 3 days. Those symptoms subsided after 3 days. Additionally, 2 or 3 days ago in Jan2021, he started getting a rash on his hand and have also now been suffering from extreme anxiety, fatigue and brain fog. He informed that he went to the emergency room yesterday and he was prescribed some Xanax for the anxiety and a steroid for the rash. The patient was currently taking those now. He also did some basic lab testing yesterday, 13Jan2021, and all his labs were pretty much okay. The outcome of the events site was sore, and headache was recovered on an unspecified date; the outcome of event rash on his hand was unknown; while the outcome of the other remaining events was not recovered.

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I had him lie down on the floor with his feet up for about 10 minutes until he felt confident to sit in the chair for another 10 minutes or so.  As he was lying on the floor, We brought him a bottle of water.  His color came back shortly after lying down on the floor.  He stated that he has previously had panic attacks after shots, blood draws, etc.  He stated he was no longer dizzy when he stood up to leave.

                                                Began to develop a slight brain fog one hour upon dose administration. Otherwise mild. Went to bed at 11:00 pm and woke up at 2 am with heart thumping with pulse beating around 70 beats per minute. Became highly attuned to it and experienced tacychardia at 118 (generally resting heart rate is extremely low). Seemed to return to 70 with some breathing exercises and returned to sleep. Woke up the next morning with flu symptoms and the works - felt worse than original Covid in October. Flu like symptoms seemed to pass by Monday. However, pulse remained elevated through the week by about ten points and noticed hypertension. BP 150/95 Wednesday and 160/100 on Friday. Went to ER Friday night with BP 188/117 and tachycardia. Vitals and blood work all normal however confusion as to why BP remains elevated despite Thursday before vaccine being 132/82. Left hospital with BP 154/95. Palpatations and thumping chest have continued throughout the week. As well as general fatigue and fog behind the eyes.

                                                I received my first dose of the pfizer vaccine at 11am at the safeway pharmacy. I had consumed several glasses of water in the morning before the event, a cup of yerba mate tea, and a piece of toast. I smoke, and had smoked one cigarette in the morning before my appointment. Just after receiving the vaccine I ate a few pieces of jerky and maybe 15 Jojo potatoes from the safeway deli.  I was advised to wait 15 minutes before leaving. I set an alarm. I bought some food to eat (jojo potatoes and jerky) and waited to leave the site until 11:22am. I felt strange/weird, but this isn&#39;t an unusual feeling after receiving any kind of shot/vaccine for me.   I was driving to work and I started to feel just a little bit strange after smoking another cigarette. I got a little nauseous but nothing too bad. Thirty seconds later I started to get dizzy, my ears rang, I felt my blood pressure drop, and I passed out on the interstate going freeway speeds. I woke up around a minute and half later according to my brother who was on the phone. I was treated for injuries at emergency room.

                                                3 days after the vaccine I started feeling extremely jittery with numbness in my arms and legs. My heart rate increased and I was finding it very difficult to stay calm or focused. This has been persistent since. Body seems warmer than usual and numbness/tingling sensation is still an issue.

He experienced mild to moderate trembling and became unresponive for about a minute. I contacted 911 and they sent emergency response. Patient came to but was still lethargic and confused. First responders gave patient oxygen for several minutes, took vitals. Patient felt better after oxygen and declined to be taken to hospital. I monitored him for an additional 15 minutes after first responders left. He felt safe to drive home.

Upon falling, his face and jaw line were the first part of his body to make contact with the ground. Immdiate examiation post-fall was completed to ensure his spinal column was un-harmed prior to lifting him to a sitting position. He became nauseated, along with amnesia and EMS was immediately called to the scene for further evaluation and to take him to a hospital for routine testing.

                                                I began experiencing severe neck pain the morning after I received my first vaccine. The first morning, the pain was so intense that I was unable to lift my head out of bed and consequently had to lift the back of my neck with one hand to sit up in bed. I?d never experienced this kind of neck pain before.  The pain level was equally intense over the next several days until I started taking ibuprofen . I even went to the chiropractor to receive an adjustment to help reduce the pain. However, as of today,  I am still experiencing significant neck pain that is effecting my activities of daily living.

A 33-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Mar2021 at 11:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received the vaccination in the pharmacy. There was no medical history or concomitant medications. There were no other vaccines administered in the last four weeks. On 25Mar2021 at 23:30, the patient experienced passed out, felt strange/weird, nauseous, dizzy, ears rang, and blood pressure drop. The clinical course was as follows: the patient was advised to wait 15 minutes before leaving. He set an alarm. He bought some food to eat (potatoes and jerky) and waited to leave the site until 11:22. He felt strange/weird, but this was not an unusual feeling after receiving any kind of shot/vaccine for the patient. He was driving to work and started to get a little nauseous but nothing too bad. Thirty seconds later, he started to get dizzy, ears rang, felt blood pressure drop, and passed out going freeway speeds. He was treated in the emergency department and released the same day. There was no treatment given in response to the events. There was no covid prior to or post vaccination. The clinical outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

It evolved into a fairly intense headache for which he took some ibuprofen.  He had chills and fevers and felt very poorly.  At 7 AM on Saturday, April 24 he suffered excruciating substernal chest pain.  It was a burning sensation and it was so severe he wanted to die to relieve the pain. The pain was only minimally positional and it was nonpleuritic. He drove himself to the nearest hospital and even drove through some red lights to get there more quickly.  When he arrived he had ST elevation in the same leads with his early repolarization which was perhaps a millimeter or so higher than the EKG we did in February.  He had both an elevation of his troponin levels which were 5.07, 6.06, 5.72 and 5.73.  A CK was 195 with an MB of 41.2.  He was taken to the cath lab emergently.  no coronary disease.

I rushed to him, requesting aid from his colleagues to help lay him on the ground and elevate his feet. He was unresponsive and disoriented, with shallow breathing and weak pulse, so I activated EMS @ 10:26a.  He appeared to seize again so I instructed two men to help roll him onto his side, at which time, an RN managing the vaccines, took over monitoring while I talked to 911.  EMS was on scene @ 10:29a. RN reports he&#39;d had a vagal response, most likely due to witnessed severe anxiety during IM injection (name /right deltoid @ 10:23a). RN gave him Gatorade and he quickly became AOx3.  When EMS arrived, he was able to stand up, with assist, and be placed on the gurney.  EMS monitored him for ~ 20min onsite, at which time he became hypotensive, resulting in transport to the nearest ER with O2 and IV management.  Per HR representative for a business patient was discharged @ ~2p the same day, with diagnosis of severe dehydration and hypokalemia, his reaction most likely a vagal event.  Unknown if medications were given outpatient.

Now over a month later (May 27, 2021), still experiencing brain fog symptoms as follow: cognitive impairment, short and long term memory loss, difficulty finding/saying certain words. Symptoms are akin to a geriatric dementia patient, but in an otherwise healthy 33 y/o male with no underlying conditions. Onset of symptoms was acute following vaccination.

EMT checked his blood glucose and was found to be hypoglycemic. He was later transported to the ER by the EMT.

I would rate this as on par with worst sicknesses I have ever had in my life. For next approx. 30 hours - soreness all over body, head aches, not as bad as previous day.  Next 24 hours - Soreness on right side, akin to being hit by a baseball fastball in 4 spots on my right side (arm, leg, 2 spots on body) about every 5 minutes. Next 24 hours leg every muscle from knee to hip was sore and hardly moveable like I had participated in an all day sporting event the day before.  For the next week or so I had aftershock headaches, occassional mild headaches that would last for less then a minute. Gradually went down in duration and frequency over time.  Also that next week, felt very fatigued and low energy.

He was not falling over but had to be very careful with his steps.; burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back; he felt off. It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux. He experienced some unusual side effects that were not listed on the web. His boss advised him to call. Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.   Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received my shot at 3:30 PM on 01/09/21.  I felt very tired on 01/12/21 before that went away that evening.  I began feeling dizzy and nauseus around 8:00 PM Monday, 01/11/21, and again periodically on 01/12/21.  The dizzy and nausea feeling continued consistently throughout 01/12/21 and 01/13/21.  I went to my primary care provider on 01/12/21 who gave me medication to help with nausea and dizziness.  She chalked it up to anxiety.  I became more worried on the evening of 01/13/21 and went to the ER.  The ER doctor stated it could be a reaction to the vaccine, inflammation in the ear/calcium buildup in the ear, or just my anxiety.  I do want to note I was nervous about getting this shot and have a history of having trouble distinguishing between true issues I am having and issues caused by my anxiety.  As of today, 01/15/21, I took Methazine which seems to have helped the dizziness, but not completely.  I am not currently nauseus.

Not sure I want to take second dose since colleagues that didn&#39;t have covid before had these symptoms after the second dose not the first. I had covid before and I have these symptoms now.

                                                Tendonitis, debilitating neuralgias leading to 2.5 weeks of missed work  No issues immediately after injection.  About 12 hours later had severe arm pain limiting motion in L arm.  Slowly improved but never resolved.  Started to get worse again on day 7/8 with pain in deltoid, tricep, bicep, forearm.   Should pain on day 10 while in bed reaching for covers - limited ability to do normal task (lift arm to turn on turn signal).  No improvement with ibuprofen.  Right shoulder pain started the following day.  Was given medrol dose pack with some improvement for 2 days but bilateral shoulder pain worsened by day 2 of steroids.  Heard pop in Right groin while sliding in bed on day 3 of steroids.  Painful causing limping while walking for several days.  On 1/13/21, severe pain in groin when standing leading to ER visit (Xray negative).  MD described as tendonitis of adductor muscle.  Pain radiated down leg to knee and to hip.  The following day similar pains occurred in the left leg.  Pain &#34;bounced&#34; between bilateral upper and lower proximal muscles and tendons.  Had stiffening of R arm on 1/15/21 and 1/16/21 associated with numbness in hand.  Went to ED again.  inflammatory markers were negative.  ANA was positive for RNP antibodies but the titer was low.  rheumatoid factor low.  TSH normal.  ED MD said she would call it polymyalgia rheumatica but I was 40 years too young.  Bouncing severe neuralgia type pain lasted about 2 weeks.  It started to resolve with scheduled naproxen and daily physical therapy multiple times per day.  It&#39;s 2/13/21 and I am still taking NSAIDs and doing PT and have residual shoulder impingement with upward arm movements, have limited ability to lift objects that I previously could and also have difficulty standing for rounds (critical care clinical pharmacist).

                                                He was doing well for a couple of days after he received the vaccine, then he started noticing a decline in his mental health.  He became agitated, irate, nothing did anything to provoke his reaction.  The voices that he normally hears became louder, and nothing changed except the vaccine.  This increased his mental health issues and psychiatrist wanted to admit him to a mental institute and then changed his mind when he realized he had the vaccine.  His agitation became 10X worse than his baseline.   His psychiatrist believes that the vaccination cancelled out his medications.  His doctor is adjusting his medications and advised against taking the 2nd vaccine.

                                                Left arm was incapacitated for nearly a week after the initial injection. Arm could not be lifted more than a few inches away from torso, and pain felt like severe deep cramping constantly. No bruising or mark at the site of the injection just severe muscle pain that affected all movement and sleep.  After one week I regained more mobility but still had severe pain in the shoulder muscles around injection site. At the 3 week mark I have more mobility but still struggle with a full range of motion and lifting anything more than a few pounds.

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

                                                April 7, woke up with a headache, took ibuprofen. A few hours later, started feeling hazy, lightheaded and had trouble concentrating while working from home. Felt like I was going to pass out. Took a break from computer screen, symptoms appeared to subside.  An hour later, same haziness feeling came back. Thought I was going to pass out again. Called 911. ER diagnosed  me with near syncope. Told me to keep an eye on symptoms and come back if things worsen. I informed them I had received one dose of vaccine, they didn?t seem to think it was related.  Symptoms have slightly improved since, but still have bouts of dizziness four days later.

                                                I think the nurse practitioner put the injection too high in my shoulder. Within a couple hours of getting the shot, my upper right arm began to hurt. As the day went on it got worse. By evening it was the worst arm pain I have ever felt in my arm. I could not lift my right arm at all. ( I could lift my hand by bending my elbow but could not use my deltoid muscle). I could not sleep that night due to the pain. I took Tylenol every 4 hours which only slightly helped.  The next day it hurt the same amount - very, very bad. Felt like a truck hit my arm. Had to have my husband help me put my shoes on. I could not drive.  That second night I took more medication. The third day the pain finally subsided for the most part. On day four I was all better.

                                                Within 15 minutes of receiving my first dose of the Phizer vaccine a portion of my arm went numb as if I received Novocain from the Dentist. This only impacted the portion of my arm between my elbow and shoulder. My hand was not numb. My entire head also felt as if I was coming off Novacain. I would also get hot and cold flashes. My upper body was itchy. I also felt like I was having circulation issues (like if you sleep in a weird position). The tips of my fingers and toes would be cold. I believe the Novacain issue was attributable to the shot but some of my other issues might have been the result of a panic attack as a result of my face going numb. I went to the ER but by the time I saw the doctor around 12:00pm most of these symptoms were going away. I went to bed and woke up much better. I can feel my arm now. It just feels sore but what I expected it to feel like after the shot. The Novacain feeling in my head went away now I just have a mild headache. The key symptom I was concerned about was the Novacain feeling given my wife also received the shot and did not have this experience.

                                                Main symptom: Around 10 hours after receiving the vaccine, my right ankle felt slightly numb. I also had a sharp, painful shooting pain in the middle of the sole of my foot that lasted less than a second. As the night progressed, the numb area spread slowly to other parts of my foot.  When I woke up the following day (today), I was surprised to discover I was not only still numb, but the numbness had spread across the entire outside of my right foot (from my ankle to 3/4 of the distance to my pinky toe).   Now, several hours later at 8:30pm, the numbness reaches all the way from near my pinky toe on my right foot up to the bottom of my calf. All of the numbness is isolated to the right side of my right lower extremities and has not crossed over to the middle of any of my extremities yet.   I can also feel a slight numb sensation in my left index finger stretching to the base of my left thumb, but it isn&#39;t nearly as bad as my right foot. I haven&#39;t felt any addition sharp shooting pains.  Numbness aside, I had a pretty bad headache from about 4pm to 10pm yesterday, and when I closed my eyes saw what appeared to be mild hallucinations (green and red streaks that disappeared pretty quickly, and were only visible when my eyes were closed). I&#39;m no longer having the visual symptoms, but the numbness is getting worse by the hour.  I have NEVER had any of these symptoms before in my life, and did nothing out of the ordinary yesterday or today in terms of food or physical activities. I take no medications.

                                                First dose of vaccine received on April 6. Soreness in arm for remainder of day, slight fever to 100.5 that night. No symptoms for remainder of week. Slight cough began in the morning on April 12, no other symptoms at that point. Woke up on April 13 with 101.4 F temperature, and throat soreness that made swallowing incredibly painful. Sore throat has made continuous sleep nearly impossible for the next two days (so far), as whenever I swallow I wake myself up, which happens every 10-15 minutes. This has resulted in general fatigue throughout the day. Fever, sore throat, coughing all get worse at night time. Average temperature during the day has been 99.5 F, while temperature readings after 10 PM have been in the 101-102 F range. Appears to be semi-breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. after first dose of vaccine, but before second dose), based on timing of symptoms and subsequent positive PCR test.

                                                Within an hour of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel &#34;odd&#34; (i.e heart racing, spine tingling, strange sensations in my hands, and dizziness).  At the hour mark, while trying to &#34;walk it off&#34; inside my backyard, things escalated quickly.  As I came back inside, I suddenly collapsed and and lost consciousness.  Luckily my best friend was with me and she described my behavior as a full on seizure (which I am not predisposed to).  According to her, I was flopping around, spitting wildly and drooling all over my face, my eyes wide and glazed staring into nothing, lips turning blue.  She immediately called 911 and within 5-10 minutes, two EMT&#39;s arrived and began to speak to me and take my vitals.  For a good 15 minutes I couldn&#39;t sit up and had to lay on the ground, still extremely out of it - unable to think, merely in extreme discomfort similar to the most intense flu I&#39;ve ever experienced.  After a half hour or so, I sat up and was able to thank them for helping me and answer some of their questions.  Over another 15 or so minutes they said all my vitals were perfect and they were not worried about me - sure I&#39;d make a full recovery, which I hope I did.  I am feeling MUCH better today.  The reason I felt it so important to submit this report is because I had never heard of anyone experiencing side-effects that severe.  Of course I had heard it could wipe you out, give you chills, aches, and exhaustion - but I had never heard that it could lead to a seizure so scary that my best friend thought I might be dying.  I truly don&#39;t know what might have happened without her.  People should know to have someone at home with them after the second dose.  I am not over-exaggerating about my symptoms whatsoever.  My body still hurts all over and I feel as if I went through some type of gauntlet yesterday.  I absolutely do NOT want to discourage anyone from getting the vaccine, but I wish I had some notion that something so severe could happen to me.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after I received the shot, I got body aches, followed by severe fatigue, then a few hours later I developed a fever- which got to 101.6 at its highest. I had a headache while I had the fever too. I took acetaminophen for the symptoms, which did help. These symptoms lasted almost exactly 24 hours, with the exception of the fatigue and body aches.   Today is one week since getting the second Pfizer shot, and the fatigue is still severe and the body aches are still present. Both are disrupting my ability to function at my job.

Per immunization technician, patient had appeared nervous and was breathing heavy when receiving the vaccine. As the patient left the hallway, patient had dropped to the ground but did not lose consciousness. Patient stayed on the ground because he was feeling dizzy. Pharmacist had measured his blood pressure and heart rate while patient was laying down. Patient moved to a chair once feeling less dizzy. Paramedics had arrived and measured his blood pressure. Paramedics were not worried about patient&#39;s vital signs and did not recommend patient to go to the ER. Patient was advised to be driven home by wife and left the pharmacy after 15 minutes.

                                                I had a nasty zit on the back of my neck, popped it, and my immune response was extreme. Initial: Itching and burning through my neck and shoulders, and swollen lymph nodes in neck and collarbone. I began sweating at night profusely and losing weight. I have had a lot of trouble sleeping. These symptoms continued in 24-48 hour cycles of flare ups until 04/19/2021 but finally seem to be abating. Progression: secondary symptoms appeared over the course of the month such as full body joint soreness, weakness, stiffness, stabbing pains (in the neck, arms, chest, and abdomen), blood pressure spikes, dry/sore throat, dry eyes, difficulty swallowing. Symptoms are similar to arthritis or other autoimmune diseases. Night sweats continue but are lighter. Weight loss continues but slower. Sleeping remains irregular.

                                                As a clinical monitor, I was called over to assess a driver slumped over in his seat. He had just received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine approximately 10 minutes earlier. The passenger (his fiance) said he was acting normal until she heard him grunt and then realized that he was passed out.   While attempting to lay flat, I performed a jaw thrust that yielded a stridulous inspiration but was still unresponsive. He did not have a palpable carotid pulse. Paramedics was summoned emergently. Within 30-45 seconds, he awoke but was confused and amnestic to the event. He had no physical complaints and no significant medical or allergy history.   I auscultated his larynx (no stridor) and his lungs (CTA). His initial vitals: BP 90/51  HR 61  VR 16  SaO2 100% An electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm without ischemic changes or evidence of conduction delay. His glucose was 119.   Over the next 30 minutes, he was able to drink two bottles of water and some orange juice. That said, he still said he &#34;felt off.&#34; Repeat vital signs:  BP 118/62  HR 69  SaO2 100%.    The medics advised him to follow up with his doctor, preferably today. His fiance agreed to drive him to an ED near their home for a more thorough evaluation. I provided her my phone number to provide to the ED for any questions.   His clinical syndrome was consistent with a syncopal episode associated with orthostatic hypotension. Low suspicion for anaphylaxis.

The pharmacy team kept monitoring him for another 15 minutes, he reported that his numbing condition was getting worse. We asked if we could call 911 and he agreed.

                                                16 hours after my second shot, I woke up with some nausea.  I went to the bathroom, did not vomit, however in the middle of urinating I collapsed on the floor, couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t form full sentences, started sweating profusely, had to crawl back to my bed, and my pulse was through the roof.  I almost went to the ER, but the episode subsided within 15 minutes.   When I tried to fall back asleep, it felt like I was blacking out and not drifting asleep.  The next day, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms.  Followed by 4 days of normalcy.  On the 4th day, while working, I experienced a sharp 3 second &#34;electric shock&#34; feeling in my left side of my chest.   On the 5th day, I already had previously scheduled an appointment with my primary for a physical.  I told her about my episode; she took an EKG which yielded normal results.  Lab work also looked ok.  On the 6th day, I started feeling some more nausea and fatigue.  On the 7th day, the vertigo intensified tenfold, and the room was spinning.  That&#39;s when I started experiencing the following symptoms:  ? More nausea. ? Dizzy spells that come and go, especially after eating. ? Persistent periodic electric shock feeling in my left chest.  It?s dull but annoying.  And just when I think it?s gone for good, another 1 second shock happens. ? Left arm is  weak - the entire arm. ? When I try to sleep, the left side of my head feels as though I?m blacking out when I start drifting.  It almost feels like I?m getting anesthesia or something like that.  But just the left side. ? Basically the left side of my body (I got the jab in my left arm) from the waist up just feels off. ? One of my arms is numb when I wake up until I shake it out.  It?s not one particular arm. ? Energy levels are low.  Especially when I wake up and start moving around.  On the 8th day, I went to the ER thinking  perhaps it was a heart attack.  Nothing - EKG was again normal and lab work was normal.  The doctor told me it&#39;s all in my head - anxiety.  However, I&#39;m not anxious and I&#39;m a very level headed individual.    It&#39;s now day 12 and I feel overall awful.  I can&#39;t concentrate on anything.  I&#39;m not thinking clearly and forgetting simple things.  The dull feeling and electric shocks on my left side continue.  I&#39;ve never felt this bad before.  I&#39;m a healthy 34 year old that exercises regularly, has never smoked or done drugs, rarely drinks alcohol, and eats generally very healthy.  If given a second chance I would not take the covid shot.  I am praying this goes away.

A 34-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscular in Arm Left on 17May2021 (at the age of 34-years-old) (Lot Number: EW0187) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included higher than normal blood pressure, about 2-3 weeks ago, his blood pressure was very high due to really crazy stress in his life and eating terrible; headaches, smoked marijuana, drunk vodka, sometimes he had a sensitivity to needles, sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, Sometimes he got a little queasy with the sight of needles and just had a ton of dental work done. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (Generic Brand Zyrtec); caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN) taken for headaches. He explained he took Generic Brand Zyrtec which he had been on for years now and he took Excedrin for headaches when he got them. Those were basically the only medications he took really. He hadn&#39;t had any type of vaccine. He previously had a tetanus shot about 10 years ago for Immunization. There was no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine on Monday, 17May2021. Within 3-5 minutes of getting the vaccine, he had a really crazy reaction. He remembered looking at his wife and she told him he was having mild convulsions as he was sitting in the chair in May2021. He was kind of shaking in May2021. He turned ghostly white and he began sweating profusely in May2021. He mentioned that her wife said that he was not conscious for around 5 minutes and was &#34;snoring with eyes open&#34; in May2021. He added that he was &#34;fighting to stay awake&#34; for around 15-20 minutes after that. He blacked out. All he remembers was that he was trying to fight off tunnel vision for a very brief time in May2021. The pharmacist continuously checked on him. The lightheadedness and feeling like he was going to black out lasted 15-20 minutes in May2021. They put him in a chair and told him to elevate his feet, but the caller explains he could not elevate his feet. He had his feet in another chair in front of him. He couldn&#39;t get comfortable, he was sitting down. He was restless, lightheaded. He kept feeling like he was going to pass out. So, then he tried to stand up and walk a little bit. He only made it 5 steps. So, he sat on the ground and laid down. He laid on the ground, flat on his back, and put his feet in a chair, which was about 2.5 feet above him for about 15-20 minutes. He started to feel better. He still felt very tired and weak in May2021 but he was able to stand up and walk and go home. He hadn&#39;t had a reaction since. He had had no other symptoms besides just a sore arm in May2021. He confirmed he recovered completely from his experience when he was administered the vaccine. He came home from the vaccine facility, laid on the couch and watched TV for a couple of hours and then fell asleep for 3-4 hours. He was tired, but he felt completely fine. He had no lightheadedness, no dizziness. He also wanted to add sometimes he has a sensitivity to needles, but he didn&#39;t when he received the COVID vaccine. Sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, but he was actually excited to get the COVID shot. He was even comforting his wife and was telling her everything is going to be okay. He wasn&#39;t worried about the needle with the COVID shot. Sometimes, he gets a little queasy with the sight of needles, but he saw the needle and he didn&#39;t feel faint or angst when getting the shot. He just had a ton of dental work done, where he had huge needles shoved in his mouth and he didn&#39;t feel faint or anything. He really wanted to get the second shot to finish the vaccination series. He did kind of believe he had a reaction, he was not trying to play it off and say &#34;oh I got the vaccine and passed out&#34;. He knew himself and knew what it&#39;s like to faint and this experience just felt different. He believed he had a reaction. He never felt tunnel vision that strong in his entire life, it felt like being punched in the face. Since those 2-3 weeks, his stress load had gone down and he had had a drastic change in his diet, so his blood pressure was reading much better now. This past Monday, 17May2021, when he received his vaccine, his blood pressure shouldn&#39;t have been that high.  The EMT&#39;s did come before he left and because he passed out his blood pressure was low at 100/60. When providing the Lot number off of his vaccine record card, the patient explained the last digit was either a 7 or a 2, he can&#39;t read this person&#39;s handwriting&#34;, however, he eventually confirmed the number was a 7.  The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The outcome of event tired was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovered in May2021.

                                                After receiving my second COVID-19 vaccine, I began feeling feverish and achy about 20 hours after the shot. I left work early to come home and rest. About 34 hours after the shot, I woke up around 2:00 am with intense abdominal and back pain, a fever, and vomiting. I took Tylenol and tried to rest, but my discomfort continued throughout the day. By the afternoon of March 30, I began to worry that I was having more than a typical vaccine reaction. The PA who saw me assessed my symptoms, performed an abdominal exam, and then dismissed my issues as a bad vaccine reaction. He gave me an injection of toradol and sent me home. My symptoms subsided after the toradol injection, but I still felt unwell.   On March 31, I had a previously scheduled visit with my primary care doctor. During the visit, I described my symptoms after receiving the vaccine, but I was told again that I was just having a really bad reaction to the vaccine. Throughout that day, my condition continued to worsen, and by the evening of the 31st I developed a fever and my abdominal pain returned. I scheduled an emergency telemedicine visit. I described my symptoms and described the pain I was feeling, but again, I was told I was having a bad vaccine reaction.   On the morning of April 1, I woke up with a fever and debilitating abdominal pain. I drove myself to the ER where I was diagnosed appendicitis. My appendix was about to rupture, so I was rushed into surgery. I was released after several days but had to return.

Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

At 1 am I was awoken in pain and I took hydrocodone leftover from a previous surgery in hopes of making it to the morning for urgent care.  (ER Bills)  At 4 am I was re-awoken in even worse pain, decided I was about to die, and went to the ER.  Cold sweat on way to ER.  Throat dry.  Made it to ER, received Morphine, the first dose calmed the pain down, did not make it go away.  A lot of tests and several hours later, a second dose was given when the pain returned to its terrible state.  Approx 15 min into the second dose pain was finally subsiding (roughly 1 or 2 pm).  Went home and took Tylonal as requested by Docs and filled an Oxy prescription in anticipation of the return of the pain.  This has not happened.  Slept great last night.  Dry Mouth Persists.  Also slight arm tenderness.

The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

                                                One hour after the injection, my brain began to feel hazy. My short-term memory was terrible. Remembering simple tasks was very difficult. The best way I can describe it is that it felt like I had consumed marijuana. I do not use marijuana or any other drugs. I had not consumed alcohol. The effects were similar to that of marijuana in that there was a ?peak? and a ?come-down.?  The peak lasted a little more than one hour, and began about one hour after the injection. The effects slowly faded until I didn?t feel completely normal until I woke up this morning. Today, I have no symptoms other than a sore arm.

RPh ran outside to attend to patient. Pt&#39;s eyes were rolled back and looked very pale. RPh asked staff to call 911 while attending to patient.

Advised patient to have 2nd dose ok&#39;d by MD and if yes, get it at a clinical setting.

The next day was even more of the same if not worse. Stayed in bed and even with multiple blankets was still shivering, but sweating like crazy. Towards the evening there was a slight break in the cold and aching. Woke up and there were still aches and cold chills, but way less painful. Third day was just  dull aches that went away in the evening. No more noticeable effects since then.

Common side effects such as chills, headache and severe drowsiness lasted 2 maybe 3 days but the anxious feeling in my chest is still there. Heart palpitations is what I am having and it?s constant. There have been times at work that I can feel my heart beat in my pant legs, temples, wrists and forehead from ordinary stress that I?ve have no issues handling in the past 4 years. Every 30-60 seconds I have to take a deep breath to catch my breath regardless of what I am doing. Suddenly severe drowsiness. I?m sure there?s more that I?m forgetting.

                                                started as severe dizziness and weakness, chest pain was hospitalized once I got to the ER because my heart was not working properly, after many test the found my heart was in heart failure with an output of 35% only, was in hospital for 5 days. Doctors couldn&#39;t see what caused such a sudden weakness of the heart, they did cardio path and arteries have zero blockage, they did ECO, and a EP Study. My heart now suffers from PVCs or arrhythmia and they are very irregular and frequent. Was given medicine to help the heart and control the PVCs, and discharged with wearing a safety vest, to follow up with the cardio doctors. Followed up with doctors and they have done an MRI which shows scarring of the heart. The doctor has determined that the diagnosis is myocardiatis. There is no proof this direct relation with the vaccine,  however symptoms started soon after the vaccine in a healthy young man. Now I still have to go to another electrophysiologist to see what he can do to help alleviate the PVCs and continue to take the medication to see of the heart can improve. I could not work for a month, and still cannot resume normal activities because my heart is to weak to sustain it.

A 35-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 21Jan2021 12:00 (at 35 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL9263) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing food allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  After receiving the Covid Vaccine on 21Jan2021, the caller has experienced a lot of adverse side effects that he&#39;s dealing with now almost 3 and a half months later. He has seen numerous doctors as well as specialists. He has a long list of symptoms that occurred at onset. What he is dealing with now is a swollen neck (onset date 21Jan2021), a sore throat (onset date 21Jan2021), tongue discoloration, and just general fatigue (onset date 21Jan2021) and malaise (onset date 21Jan2021). Prior to the shot he was physically healthy. He was running about 20 miles a week. Then he got the shot and his health declined significantly and he is still recovering. When this occurred, caller weighed 165 pounds, and now he weighs 145 pounds. He lost 20 pounds. These events happened after the first dose of the vaccine. He got his vaccine at around noon on 21Jan2021, and by that evening at around 2000 he had a tightness in his throat, felt like his right ear was plugged up, then had pain on the right side of his neck. It all coincided with the same side as the vaccine, which he had in his right arm. He also experienced some pretty severe chills. His throat still feels swollen, probably because of his swollen lymph nodes. Some days it is better and some days it is worse. It is causing constant pressure on his neck. He is not sure if he noticed the swollen lymph nodes the same day as the shot or shortly after.Patient does not currently have neck pain. He should probably mention it started probably a few weeks after the onset of his symptoms. He does not know when it went away. He was getting swollen lymph nodes on his left side as well, and his throat became sore on the left side as well. It went away maybe a few weeks ago. He is not sure when the swollen lymph nodes or the sore throat started. His right ear was plugged and then it affected his left ear and it got plugged up as well. It was to the point where he could barely hear. It was almost like an ear infection when it is completely plugged and there is pressure behind the ear drum. 2 weeks after his right side it started on the left side. It has subsided by this time, but it has not completely gone away, but it is not as bad. Patietnt had the chills for 3 weeks, but they weren&#39;t as severe as the first night. He was just freezing cold and could not get warm. After that night he was still having issues feeling warm and had to keep his bedroom at like 80 degrees constantly. It probably continued for about a month. He doesn&#39;t have chills now, however it evolved into more of a heat intolerance. Whenever he feels to warm he feels more tired and not well overall. It is really odd. It is more heat intolerance he feels is going on. After the first few months it started then he had the opposite. He had a problem getting warm, then after the first month he didn&#39;t tolerate heat too well. He is not sure when the tongue discoloration first started, but he noticed it about a month and a half ago. The general fatigue and malaise started at the beginning with everything else. He did not have the second dose of the vaccine. Caller believes the doctors ran a CBC. He had a complete panel done a few times and nothing concerning presented or stood out to the doctors. They did an ultrasound on the left side of his abdomen to make sure he had no spleen enlargement, and that came back normal. They ran thyroid panels and those came back normal. One thing that came back abnormal that explains more of this but the timing is odd with the vaccine is he came back positive for Mono. He started seeing an ENT specialist, and he believes that getting the vaccine could have caused his immune system to freak out considering his history with allergies. It could have caused the Epstein Mono virus already present to become reactivated. That was kind of his theory on why this could have occurred. All the events caused a visit to Emergency Room. He went to the ER about a week, exactly a week after he had the vaccine that day. He was having trouble swallowing (onset date 28Jan2021) as well as his breathing was becoming a concern (onset date 28Jan2021) for him. He also was just having what felt like anxiety-like symptoms (onset date 28Jan2021), and he has no history of anxiety. If he got the vaccine on 21Jan2021 then this happened around 28Jan2021. He did have another ER visit about a week after that one as well. He started to have severe symptoms similar to the first time he went. He is still having a little bit of an issue swallowing. He attributes that to the swelling in his lymph nodes and neck possibly affecting that. His breathing he does not have problems with so much now. He has more of a constant discomfort in his neck, though it is not affecting his breathing at this point. As far as general anxiety he still has that and it does cause issues. It is causing him to not sleep as a result. His swallowing is better. His breathing was the most severe of the symptoms. Maybe after the first month it began to become less of an issue. He couldn&#39;t say exactly when it went away. It probably went away as a result of the swelling subsiding. To be honest he is not sure. Doctors put the caller on numerous medications as well as a medicine that he continued with. He doesn&#39;t know if his anxiety is better as a result of the medicine helping or if it would be the same if he went off of it. He is not sure. He has had trouble sleeping since this all began. It has been a little better. It could be a result of the medicine that helped. He is really unsure if he was not on the medicine how it would be. Patient visited a Physician Office for all events.No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the events Throat tightness,Sensation of block in ear,Swallowing difficult,Anxiety, Sleep difficult,Hearing reduced was recovering; chills,Swollen lymph nodes,Neck pain,Sore throat was recovered; Tongue discoloration, heat intolerance,Fatigue,Malaise was not recovered; other events was unknown.

                                                My first COVID19 Pfizer vaccine shot was on 4/05/21. My second was 3 weeks later on 4/26/21.  About 30 hours after my second vaccine on 4/27/21 I started to notice tightness around my lungs/rib cage in the intercostal muscle area. For the next few days the pain increased and I had shortness of breath as well. After a few nights I couldn&#39;t lie down to sleep because of this pain so I had to sit upright to sleep.   On 5/3/21 I went to the doctor at hospital where I was examined and had a lung X-ray as well as a COVID PCR test (it was negative). The PA diagnosed me with &#34;Pneumonia&#34; and I was given antibiotics (cefuroxime and azithromycin) to take for 6-7 days.  I started feeling a little better by 5/6/21 and actually reported here on VAERS with my diagnosis of suspected Pneumonia. On 5/17/21 I had another lung x-ray at hospital and was told my lungs were looking more clear. However, for the next 2 weeks I felt more tired and my poor breathing, a cough with bloody mucus, and more chest/rib cage area pain developed. Despite being a professional runner it became hard to walk up a flight of stairs without breathing really hard and feeling light-headed.   On  5/30/21 I woke up with fairly intense chest pain just under my heart. I was taken to the ER at second Hospital and got a CT scan with contrast that showed a bilateral Pulmonary Embolism with infract. An ultra sound of my heart (normal) and blood panels were performed as well as multiple EKGs. I was given a stomach injection of Lovenox also. That afternoon I was transferred to third Hospital. for overnight monitoring with more EKGs and Lovenox injections. Prescribed blood thinner Pradaxa for 3 months with no known cause of clots that caused this Pulmonary Embolism. Kidney test and Heart appeared normal. Still waiting on genetic testing. Lung infract has caused lasting chest pain and my breathing has yet to return back to normal.

                                                Pt received the covid vaccine around 12:50 pm.  Then as he was walking to schedule his second appointment soon after the vaccine, he fell to his knees (no CHI).  I was notified and ran over to see pt was disoriented, pale, diaphoretic.  While measuring his left arm BP (80/30), he began to convulse with both elbows flexed.  The convulsions lasted about 10 secs, pt did not recall the event, we held him in a seated position on the floor.  He felt much better after the convulsion &#43; water/snacks, however we did call EMS during the event.  Per EMS, BP was 128/80, and pt was AAOx3.  Pt refused to go to the hospital and agreed to f/up with PCP.

                                                Onset began with a flushing/warmth feeling in the right side of face about 35 minutes after injection, with itching on the roof of the mouth accompanied by feeling of swelling in the area. This was followed by a spread of the flush/warm feeling across the face, chest and arms followed immediately by a 2-3 minute panic feeling, chest tightness and extremely heightened anxiety with a general feeling of being unable to focus/concentrate. After this couple of minutes the flushing stopped in all areas except the cheeks and the itching sensation dissipated quickly over the next 30 minutes but the feeling of swelling on the roof of the mouth continued for a total of one hour. There were no visible signs of swelling in the mouth, tongue or throat, nor redness in the face. The flushing feeling settled in both cheeks of the face and was accompanied by heightened anxiety, along with an overall feeling of being warm. However, there were no visible signs of redness or rash, the sensations and anxiety persisted for mildly for 10 hours, all of which gradually dissipating over time. That night physical symptoms had cleared up, soreness in the right arm began and lasted into the morning. Anxiety levels mostly returned to normal in the morning.

EMS was called and he had another seizure for them before they could transport him to the hospital.  He also had a fever38.6.  The individual was admitted and overnight became increasingly agitated and confused.  Family reports that that after discharge from the hospital he has not returned to his normal functioning.  Prior to this episode he was living alone and working.   Now he cannot be left alone as his neurological status has quite deteriorated . He has had a ?substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions? Family have had to take time off of work and make arrangements to care for him.

The next day I felt a little rough, but I have read that the second dose has much higher side effects, and since I have a blood issue, it&#39;s concerning.

                                                I was unable to sleep and began to feel significantly overheated by 10 or 11pm the night of my vaccination. To give a sense of the extent of the disturbance, I ended up standing outside for 10 minutes without shoes or socks in the cold night air (~45°F) to cool off, but remained shiftless the rest of the night and was unable to remain asleep for a full sleep cycle until early morning (4 or 5am). I did not take my temperature at any point but did not appear to have a significantly warm forehead. The next morning I woke up with a very sore left shoulder and arm (i.e. the site of my vaccination) and general muscular stiffness in my back. Raising my arm increases the soreness significantly. I have no concerns about my reactions, but they were significant for a first Pfizer COVID shot so I am reporting to provide information to VAERS.

                                                Within 12 hours of vaccine I had sharp stomach pains. It got worse thru the night. The next day it felt slightly better but overnight to Saturday morning it came back horribly and radiated to lower right side to where I could not even sleep on my side. I went to the ER, they did a cat scan and immed told to have emergency surgery to get appedix out. While in surgery they ended up having to do a hemi colectomy due to how bad the appendicitis was.

Slept on the other side and went ok. Next night same pain around 5am, this time I couldn?t sleep after.  Then 3/4 days after the shot, pain in my groins and intestines. It feels really irritated and pain varies from 1 to 4.5 on a scale of 10 throughout the days. It?s been now 10 days since the shot and this pain is not getting away or improving. Sometimes I also experience pain in the left side of my  stomach as well but it?s much less frequent than groins and intestines.

First night, it was very difficult to sleep - I did not get much. Dizziness was like being very drunk. Now every night laying down in bed looking up is dizzying, some nights worse than others but not as bad as first night of symptoms. This has been persistent for about a week. Some temporary dizziness when reorienting head quickly during the day, particularly looking up or down, but mainly worse at night in the dark, not debilitating. Sleeping with some low lights on helps reduce spinning feeling. Mild headache and tight neck/shoulders starting 9 days after injection but may be unrelated.

                                                Around 2 weeks after receiving the first vaccine dose, I woke in the middle of the night gasping for air. My heart was racing and I was so weak that I could barely sit up. The following day I could not get out of bed. I also had an intense headache, which is unusual for me since I never get headaches. On the 3rd day I developed dizziness/vertigo. Since those events occurred, I&#39;ve been dizzy 24/7 and had about 25-50% of my normal energy. I cannot drive, I cannot work, I cannot many of my normal daily activities. This has been devastating. It has been over 3 weeks now with these symptoms, and I will probably lose my job this week. I don&#39;t know where to turn. There should have been a safety net for these things.

                                                On  04/26/2021 felt short breathlessness and dizziness. also Blood pressure is elevated and in between 150-160. Heart rate was also high. Immediately went to ER to check. Was treated for palpitation and dehydration. Felt normal after couple of days.  I took second dose on 05/06/2021. I felt normal for about a week. After that i started feeling heavy or pressure in my head and also dizziness. For past one week I&#39;m feeling acid reflux and heartburn. Considering i had history of acid reflux I never had this issue for past few years. I&#39;m not sure if my GERD issues are induced by vaccine. I&#39;m having controlled diet with fruits and veggies but i still have  heartburn and frequent burps. Also my Blood Pressure is still elevated around 130-140 and feeling tired and pressure in my head even now after  18 days of taking 2nd dose. I had consulted my physician on 05/20/2021, and she prescribed a medicine to take only when my blood pressure is above 140.   Just to summarize, I still have dizziness and occasionally elevated BP and acid reflux, heartburn/burps. This is impacting my day to day home and office works

I had heart pains, and took a shower and had a heart rate of 130. I took Ativan and felt some better. I thought about going to the ER, but I emailed my doctor instead. He told me to rest. Dr. suggested I go to the ER if I felt worse. I did feel some better after hearing from him. He said he was not to concerned about it, he didn&#39;t think it was my heart. He said after I had Covid and the vaccine he wasn&#39;t surprised.

He was visibly anxious while waiting for the shot and receiving it, as he verbalized he was afraid of needles. After giving the shot and sitting for about 5 minutes, he stated he was feeling a little bit light headed and nauseous. At this time, I pulled up next to him and talked about symptoms. There was slight nausea and felt a little &#34;out of sorts.&#34; Due to the nausea, gave a dose of benadryl in order to help with the nausea, sweats, and nervousness. 9-1-1 was called during benadryl administration. Within 5 minutes, the patient began to talk about his throat being itchy, and when about to administer epinephrine the paramedics arrived and took over, and left in an ambulance. Ultimately after discharge from the hospital, the patient did not receive Epinephrine either from our clinic or from the hospital.

First couple of days were fine, but starting  26-FEB-2021, I&#39;ve been exhibiting all of the following: Fever - Friday 98, Saturday (3 measures over 5 hours) 99.1, 99.3, 99.4, Sunday 98.5, Monday 99.4 (at night, work up in body aches), Tuesday(97.5), Wednesday 98.5 Chills - mild, 1-3 times. comes and goes through past week.  Occurs more at night.  Feeling cold - wearing sweat pants, two shirts, long sleeve shirt, sweater, during sleep.  Constantly add/remove clothes to regulate temperature. During day, have sweat pants &#43; sweater on 78&#43; degree weather. Muscle pain - in back, moving daily. First started in right chest and back right shoulder, has now disappeared.  Now in middle of back, around spin area, hard and uncomfortable to sleep, taking IB profin helps alleviate pain, 2 to 3 tables over counter.  pain in throat around vocal box, could be due to sneezing, slight soreness to touch/aches. Feeling unwell - comes and goes, day starts fine, then around noon/1pm i get super tired and sleep.  Sleeping schedule is generally 10PM to 6AM &#43; naps through day Lose stools - from 25-FEB to 27-FEB, cleared up on 29-FEB Coughing - started on 03-MAR-2021, slight about 1 to 3 times an hour. Headache - comes and goes, use IB profin only when trying to sleep, all other times i let it be.  Good news: No swelling at injection site No redness at injection site  No Swelling at injection site  Final notes: Just feeling up an down, not taking anything besides IB profin for pain management. I was going to work everyday pre-shot with out issue. Post-shot, not feeling well enough to report to work out of fear of spreading anything that i got. Weekend immune system. Slightly grumpy demeanure since sick and interrupted sleep patterns.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

He appeared to be unconscious for 5-10 seconds and then came to. While he was confused for a few minutes, he was able to orient himself to place, time, and date. No treatment was administered. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was monitored throughout recovery time.

                                                I received my second shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, March 20th at noon.  Saturday at midnight, I woke up in full body sweats and aches.  I took two ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep, but I would toss and turn in full body sweats and aches for the next 8 hours.  I took another 2 ibuprofen around 400am.  Sunday morning I woke up feeling OK, not great, but OK.  Sunday night ? it was very strange ? the full body chills and aches came back.  Not as bad as Saturday night, but they returned nevertheless.  I had another restless night of sleep, and I took another two rounds of ibuprofen to try and help me sleep.  Monday I woke up feeling OK again.  Monday evening, around 8:00pm, I could feel the full body chills and aches coming back again, creeping up slightly.  This time, I also felt a mild burning in my upper chest and throat.  I went to bed around 8:00pm, then woke up at 9:00pm, this time in a lot of pain.  It felt like burning and a stabbing sensation in my throat and upper chest.  I took some ibuprofen, and tried to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned in agony for the next few hours, apparently falling asleep at some point around 1:00am.  At 2:00am I woke up in severe pain again.  It was very bad, like an 8 out of a 10.  It felt like a burning and stabbing sensation in my lower throat and upper chest.  I had my wife call 911, and I was brought to hospital in an ambulance.  I would stay in the hospital for the next 3 days, getting discharged Thursday at around 5:00pm.  I had peak troponin levels of 5, so I basically had a moderate heart attack.  I had a cardiac catherization procedure done, as well as a cardiac MRI.  The cardiac catherization procedure showed I had no blockages at all in my arteries.  The cardiologists diagnosed me with myocarditis.  The cardiologists told me they believe the vaccine triggered a heavy response from my auto immune system.  The response from my auto immune system in turn caused my heart to become inflamed, giving me myocarditis.  It was a horrible experience, and my doctors are convinced that it was brought on by the second coronavirus vaccine shot that I received.

I took the shot on Monday, felt horrible all of Tuesday, and on Wednesday I had a very slight headache, but felt much better than Tuesday. I drank a lot of water on Tuesday, but it seemed to help very little. A hot shower made me feel better on Wednesday night.

A couple hours after falling as sleep the second night after vaccination shot (Sunday night), I woke up very cold / severe shivering. After several hours I managed to fall asleep for approximately another 1-2 hours. The next day I experienced fever, shivers, general body weakness/fatigue, and muscle aches/discomfort especially in both legs. These symptoms lasted throughout the day.  That night (Monday night), when I got into bed, I was strongly shivering. I managed to fall asleep for 1-2 hours, but woke up uncomfortably warm. I was unable to fall back asleep until 4-5 hours later. I woke up 1-2 hours later, with most of my body dripping with sweat, and the sheets rather damp.  Tuesday and Wednesday: Symptoms came and went, mostly feelings of fever, chills, general fatigue, lost appetite, and mild light headedness. Sleeping remained difficult, able to stay asleep for &lt;4 hours each night.    As of today (Thursday), fever has subsided. Still generally feel fatigued, occasionally lightheaded.

Had to diarrhea over 30 times in one day, throw up several times. Went to emergency room for treatment. IV treatment plus anti naseau and anti cramping   Medication. Cramping was severe in upper intestine. Symptoms have decreased, but still linger after 2 weeks of 2nd shot.  Concern if side effects are permeant. I still very tired/fatigued,  have cramping, dirahaha, throwing up, aches muscles and joints- not feeling like myself and regret taking the vaccine if it results in lifelong side effects.

A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

                                                migraines; dizziness off and on; Severe chronic headaches; fatigue; little lethargic/feeling lethargic; sensitivity to light; balance is off/was going left and right trying to stay in balance; hypersomnia; not been able to work or drive since being vaccinated; vision impairment; This is a spontaneous report from contactable other HCP. A 37-years-old (current age of 37-38 when the reported events began) male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0I58; expiration: not reported), intramuscular, administered in arm right on 12Apr2021 16:00 as single for Covid-19 immunisation/covid precautions, not wanting to get covid at pharmacy or drug store. The patient medical history was none. Concomitant medication(s) included vortioxetine hydrobromide (TRINTELLIX; received within 2 weeks of vaccination). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no other prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine), no relevant family medical history. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and since the vaccination. No other products and no investigation assessment. On 13Apr2021, the patient had headache, sensitivity to light, was feeling lethargic, balance was off, fatigue, and hypersomnia. The headache and vision impairment (start date: 13Apr2021) were ongoing and began the very next day after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and at first the headache was very severe and now was just different and his headache kind of moved around and was always constant and persistent and got better and then boom it came back. The patient had been a little lethargic (start date: 13Apr2021) and that began the same day as the headache and vision impairment which was the very next day after the 1st dose of the vaccine. Dizziness (start date: 13Apr2021) began the very next day after the vaccine and was almost like an imbalance of whenever he was walking, he noticed he was kind of not walking a straight line almost and was going left and right trying to stay in balance (start date: 13Apr2021) and this was a little bit better. After the 1st dose the patient was getting a little concerned right now because he got the vaccine about three weeks ago and ever since he had been having severe chronic headaches and vision impairment that was ongoing and began the very next day after the 1st dose of the vaccine; the patient was a little lethargic, kind of had dizziness off and on and went to his PCP, had an MRI, and was sent to a neurologist. The patient was taking Advil, Motrin and Tylenol that were not helping his migraines (start date: unspecified) and nothing from the bunch of medications the neurologist gave him were working to help and stated Nurtec ODT (lot 3990840, expiry date Oct2022 and NDC 72618-3001-1) 75mg once daily and Nortriptyline 10mg (orange pharmacy bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC) supposed to be one capsule the 1st week and then two capsules after that by mouth. Motrin, Advil and Tylenol (no lot numbers, expiry dates or UPC numbers to provide because he ran out of those and threw the bottles away when he was done and has been meaning to get more but has not). Unspecified medicines, Toradol IV were given as therapeutic measure. The patient was not sure about the dates regarding his MRI (MRI was maybe a week and a half after this all started and then maybe a week after that he saw the neurologist). Headaches kept him up to night also and the patient had been to neurology, ophthalmology consultation, and received an MRI. The adverse events resulted in disability or permanent. The patient had not been able to work or drive since being vaccinated. The patient had no further treatment and had not gone to the ER but was under advisement that he was to go to the ER, but he could not afford to go to the ER. The patient had not had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine yet and his PCP and neurologist both agree that he would not be getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine due to the reactions he has had. The patient was calling to see if Pfizer offered help as he was without insurance and his PCP said he might need to send the patient to the hospital which might be out of the question and he was calling to see if Pfizer could help him with anything as he has not been at work for three weeks and the headache was not going away. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging with no results on unspecified date and nasal swab (sars-cov-2 test) was negative on 15Apr2021. The outcome for little lethargic/feeling lethargic was not recovered, severe chronic headaches was not recovered, sensitivity to light was not recovered, balance is off was not recovered, fatigue was not recovered, hypersomnia was not recovered, not been able to work or drive since being vaccinated was not recovered, vision impairment was not recovered, kind of has dizziness off and on was recovering and for migraine was not recovered.     Information on Lot/Batch number was available.

                                                After leaving site (while driving), my tongue became very heavy and almost difficult to swallow. After approximately 20 minutes, it passed. At the same time my right arm (opposite the injection arm) began to have muscle spasms which too passed. A wave of cold spread throughout my body and immediately my anxiety began to skyrocket (untriggered). None of these symptoms occurred after 1st dose.  Insomnia the night of both the 1st and 2nd doses.   Nearly 2.5 weeks after 2nd dose, dizziness is a daily occurrence followed by symptoms of vertigo (at times wakes me up at night). Fatigue has intensified.

Weekend of 5/8 - vomiting, likely fever (felt like true vaccine side effects) - no vomiting/fever since  Since then, lots of tests/dr visits.  Current symptoms: tingliness/numbness - left leg - midshin to foot/toes. Left arm - elbow to hand/fingers. Face started to tingle ~2 weeks post vaccine - left side. Extremely fatigued. Some brain fog/forgetfullness. Lack of motivation. Irritability some days. Headaches - some days really bad, other days none. Chest pains come/go throughout day. Was getting winded walking up 3 stairs but that has been slightly better. Some days - extensive muscle pain. Especially in lower back &amp; left hip area. Some days - whole body aches. Chills - feels like body temp is off. Things come in waves - numbness/tingliness is pretty much all the time though. Also, insomnia. Did start to take 1.25mg of melatonin as needed but still very fatigued.  5/19 - Stared acupuncture (plan is 2x a week) Around 5/21 - developed rash. Face (R&amp;L side), neck/jaw area (L), inner thigh (L). Doesn&#39;t itch all the time but when it does, it really itches. Has continued 5/22 &amp; 5/23 - headaches worsened 5/22 &amp; 5/23 - developed diarrhea 5/23 - more tingliness developed midshin to right foot and more in right arm.  5/25 - joints began to hurt more - especially in elbow area  Lung dr.

                                                After receiving 2nd vaccine shot in early AM, felt great throughout the day.  Around 9:30pm, I started experiencing shivers that turned into the worst shivers that I&#39;ve ever experienced throughout my entire body.  I could barely function, hands/arms/feet/fingers were shaking - even my jaw was uncontrollable clacking up and down.  At the peak, this transpired into an intense headache in the upper back part of my head that scared me to death, it was severely intense to the point I thought I was having a stroke or something.  My head pounded all night and also my body felt like needles were poking me in every joint in my entire body.  Sleeping was miserable and minimal and symptoms are continuing the next day but not as severe.  Lots of body pains and a constant headache.  Resting and drinking water to try and remedy.

He        was supposed to get his 2nd vaccine on 5/21/21 and had to go out of town and was going to get it when he got back.  The next day 5/23/21 at 12:00 AM his throat began to swell up and gradually it moved from his throat to his chest area.  He went to the ER on 5/23/21 in Hospital and they looked at his throat, gave him a steroid shot and some antibiotics and sent him home.  The next morning he drove back to home and continued taking the antibiotics that they prescribed and his throat kept swelling more and more.  On Tuesday 5/25 at 1:00 PM he went to the ER and sat there 8 hours without being seen and decided to leave.  The next morning 5/26/21 he went to an UC and they sent him to an ER at Hospital and from there he was sent to another ER by ambulance to have emergency throat surgery.  He had surgery on  5/27/21 at the Hospital where he had an abscess on the inside of his throat that caused his throat to swell.  He had swollen lymph nodes and to release the pressure and fluid in his throat as his neck and chest were swelled up.   He was discharged on 5/31/21.

Took Tylenol in the evening and took another dose at 2am. It was about 78 degrees in our house that evening, and I had a comforter and another blanket on in bed.  The chills subsided by 7am, but then my body felt like it got hit by a truck and was hard to move or get out of bed. I had to stay home and attempt to work from home, although the body weakness and headache lasted until 8pm on 4/28.  Overall, it felt like flu condensed into a 24 hour period.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

It was loud enough to keep me awake and the ringing has not stopped, even up until this point. I can still hear out of the right ear, but I cannot hear over the ringing. High pitch noises I can hear amplified, while it is difficult to hear anything else. I can also feel the vibrations in my inner ear during those high noises. I did take 800mg of Ibuprofen before bed and I know that NSAIDS can be associated with Tinnitus but this seems very out of the ordinary for me with no medical history and remarkable health screen.

I was nearly calling 911 that night - My wife ended up taking me to urgent care to be seen for headache. CAT SCAN and blood work to rule out aneurisms. I was given: Injection of Toradol -a steroidal anti-inflammatory. Viral inflammation in the brain caused by the vaccine - their diagnosis. Out of work for a week. I experienced symptoms on and off for three weeks - headaches; somedays I feel good and some days I don&#39;t feel good - with low energy and weakness and body aches. I have been taking (alternating) ibuprofen and Tylenol - the first week nothing could help but after that the alternating doses did start helping. I haven&#39;t had a headache for about a week now.  The body aches and low energy is still not resolved - comes and goes.

                                                Per the patient&#39;s mother, after receiving the 2nd vaccine dose on 2/19/21, patient &#34;became different&#34;.  He reported to her that he has &#34;non-stop ringing in the ear&#34;, &#34;wanted to kill himself because of ringing&#34;; couldn&#39;t sleep all night&#34;, had fever. On 2/23, patient&#39;s symptoms got worse. He vomited twice, ringing in the ear continued, had headache, fever, and poor appetite. He also couldn&#39;t sleep. The mother of the patient was advised by the case management team that it&#39;s not uncommon for 2nd shot to cause slight flu-like symptoms for a short while, but she probably needs to call 911 if patient exhibits suicidal tendencies and take him to ED.  She said she already tried over the weekend, called Hatzola. 6 people came to and spoke with patient, including psych. Hatzola left, the patient was not deemed at risk, refused to go anywhere.  She was concerned that he refused to follow up with outside PMD. She was given further instructions to take the patient to the ER and call with any other questions and concerns. She was not heard from since. Attempts were made to contact the patient to follow up, but to no avail. Patient&#39;s phone appears to be off.

Very big and itchy. I took some Claritin. Those welts continued to grow and spread;  Upper inner arms, flanks, inner thighs.  Continued throughout the night  *took pictures of welts Took some Benadryl at night. Woke up; symptoms still there and extended even more to include hands. I went to work. I wasn&#39;t feeling ill but uncomfortable. Took some more antihistamines. It got worse thru the day. No SOB.  1/12 noon Different kind of rash, petechia in appearance.; shins. My knees, ankles, feet were starting to swell.  Hives had gone from the thighs and up, But below, shins to feet, were swelling.  1/13 I woke up to a lacy rash over all extremities. Bruising on shins. Knees, hands and feet still swollen.  Started Oral steroid. By noon that day, pretty much everything had cleared up. Six day course treatment, no symptoms came back. No fever. No SOB. I did miss work the 1/13 as it was at its worse.

Then as I was about to tell him to lie down on the floor, it appeared to me as if he fainted in the chair. We were able to lie the patient flat on the floor and raise legs on a chair. He stated he immediately felt better. He also stated he never lost consciousness and that he had bad anxiety and that this has happened before due to his anxiety in the past. They checked out the patient and the patient walked out on his own accord and did not leave with the paramedics.

Later that night after going to bed he woke up w/ his muscles and nerves twitching and tingling.  He says you can sometimes see the muscles spasms and then other times he feels it tingling under the skin. Pt is still having these symptoms. He had a sore arm for about 48 hours. For about 3 to 4 days he had a faster heart rate and higher blood pressure than normal.   He developed a headache that lasted about 2 days.  Currently he is having some brain fog  and his shoulder and biceps still have a heavy feeling like they are detached from his body along with the muscle twitching and tingling.  He does not feel like these symptoms are improving and will see his PCP on 3/29/2021.

It made it really hard to sleep.  I woke up the next day on 3/28  feeling extremely fatigued with a bit of body ache.  I then took two more Advils that day.  By the 3rd day on 3/29  I was back to normal, with the exception of a tingly sensation on my left-hand (note i received the shot on my left arm/shoulder area).

                                                After the first dose, I experienced only mild fatigue and a mild headache within a couple hours of the injection. Later within 10 hours, I developed strong injection site direness that affected my sleep but abated within 12 hours. Therefore, I was expecting more or less similar symptoms with the second dose. Instead, I felt absolutely nothing for nearly twelve hours until I fondly felt mild injection site soreness. I went to bed around 1 am. At around 2 am I awoke with such strong chills that they were almost like convulsions. I was sweating and had a headache.  More concerning though was the tachypnea and wheezing. I was wheezing as if I had asthma to the point that my lunch?s were whistling and I found it difficult to take sufficient breaths. This lasted 30 minutes to one hour before a sting enough that I fell asleep again, still with mild left arm soreness, sweating, mild fever, headache and wheezing. When I awoke a few hours later at around 8 am, I was so fatigued that I could not move. I had a mild headache still but the breathing was better without wheezing and now only hampered by frequent belching (passing off the CO2 buildup from the tachypnea most likely). However, I was so exhausted that I lay in bed for another four hours. When I forced myself up to shower and move, I had a sudden severe depressive attack of uncontrollable crying in the shower. I also had body aches throughout the morning. These symptoms are the same or similar to those felt when I had COVID, so I knew them and that they should pass, yet I did not expect them to be so strong  and the tachypnea with wheezing was initially very disconcerting until it began to ease.  By approximately 11 hours later,  all symptoms had passed.

Concomitant medications included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) from Sep2020 to Apr2021 for depression; bupropion from Aug2020 to 20Apr2021 for depression; amfetamine sulfate (AMPHETAMINE SALTS) from 2018 and ongoing for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Around 14Apr2021, he had cold and flu like symptoms. He said he had headache, and sinus pressure, drainage and congestion. He said he felt dizzy, and he compared his dizziness to a feeling one gets before one passes out. He said it is associated with head or eye movement, and that there was a nerve shoot through his head down to his arm. This was accompanied by a tingling sensation that would usually last for less than a second. He said this reaction lasted for 2 and a half weeks. Patient mentioned that he consulted his physician, and was prescribed with doxycycline, which helped with the relief of his cold and flu like symptoms, as well as the congestion. He said it has been cleared for 5 days now. On 17Apr2021, patient said he had fever with a temperature of 100 F. He was concerned because the fever had not subsided ever since. On 17Apr2021 he had onset of fever which was ongoing. He was struggling to narrow down the choices here. He was grasping at straws trying to figure out if this ongoing fever fits in the realm of rare side effects of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine and asked for further information regarding the fever. He later mentioned he also had cold-like symptoms and an other weird symptom. Fever was typically in morning temperature was 100.2 to 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit then got to about 101 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon. Cold-like symptoms was for the first 2.5 weeks had headaches, sinus-related symptoms like runny nose, congestion, sinus pressure. He thought the sinus pressure in particular could be associated with the other weird symptom he had. One of patient&#39;s sons daycare had a cold going around his class on 14Apr2021; some of the kids went home with colds and fever so he initially chalked this up to that. Otherwise he did not think so. As a kind of cover her but his doctor did prescribe doxycycline which he just finished the last dose so been on that for 10 days at 100mg twice daily. He thought due to that any of the sinus symptoms he had have dropped. He felt cured of those other than fever; only fully recovered completely about 5 days ago (06May2021). Patient had COVID PCR test: First test in Apr2021, probably on 19Apr2021 or 20Apr2021. Not admitted to hospital, no ER visit, but went to hospital that his physician was associated with to have chest x-ray (Nothing notable found) and blood panel (Nothing notable found, didnt lead to anything. Standard blood work nothing notable found. White blood cell-nothing notable found.) done on 24Apr2021. COVID antibody test on May2021 was positive (IgG positive for COVID antibodies, IgM negative, no active COVID). COVID PCR test in Apr2021 and 26Apr2021 was Negative for COVID. AE (virtual visits for the fever) required a visit to physician office. Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine delayed twice now; was supposed to get second dose on 03May2021 but since had a fever been told he can&#39;t. Outcome of event fever was not recovered and the other events was recovered on 06May2021.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

A 39-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 at single dose for prevention.  Medical history included none. There were no concomitant medications. Caller states, he received the covid vaccine 19Dec2020 and on 25Dec2020 he was experiencing left facial numbness, b/l foot numbness, b/l hand numbness on 26Dec2020, right side burning on 28Dec2020, Today (29Dec2020) he has had left thigh burning, and Left b/l gluteal burning and paresthesia. No motor issues and no tendon issues, all intact. Also had mid back burning on 28Dec2020 that comes and goes. He has heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus and/or with the vaccine and wants more information on that. Curious if anyone has anything similar? and makes mention of possible Gillian Barre Syndrome. States that he has had a potential reaction. He had his dose on 19Dec2020. On 25Dec2020 he developed left facial numbness, then later that day he developed bilateral foot numbness. On 26Dec2020, he developed bilateral hand numbness, on 28Dec2020 he developed right thigh burning, and today (29Dec2020) he has developed left thigh burning, and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia. States that he has been kind of freaking out about it. He doesn&#39;t have any motor issues. States that he heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus, but not with the vaccine, is that true? The left facial numbness resolved on either 26Dec2020 or 27Dec2020. States that the symptoms were concerning because it could have been a stroke. States his symptoms were moderate. States that due to the bilateral foot and hand numbness, he had a LP, brain and spine MRI, and blood work done on 26Dec2020. All came back completely normal. When asked about causality, caller states that it makes the most sense for his symptoms to be caused by the vaccine due to his age and the fact that all his testing was completely normal. Reporter seriousness for left facial numbness, bilateral foot numbness, bilateral hand numbness, right thigh burning, left thigh burning and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia: Medically significant. The outcome of the event left facial numbness was recovered in Dec2020. The outcome of the events guillain barre syndrome, stroke and mid back burning was unknown. The outcome of the other events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship the association between the reported serious adverse events with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I felt myself get very flushed and slightly lightheaded.  This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

                                                presenting to the emergency department via car for evaluation of Herpes Zoster to the left side of the patient&#39;s face. The patient was evaluated at Urgent Care yesterday and sent by the NP. Patient reports three days of rash to the left side of his face with redness and swelling. The patient initially thought the rash was acne due to his face mask. There is intermittent pain to the area which is rated 10/10 severity at its worst. The patient has been unable to sleep the past two days due to the pain. Pain is worse with cold weather and at night with increased clenching of his jaw and grinding of his teeth. He was prescribed Valtrex at Urgent Care and took one dose just PTA to the ED. There is concern given a bump just lateral to the patient&#39;s left eye. The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccination on 01/18/2021 and explains that the Urgent Care provider believes this may be an adverse reaction.

                                                Around 5:30am I woke up feeling as though I had not slept well. I had chills, then I would sweat, then I would have chills again. I had severe fatigue, and muscle aches centering in my lower back. I took my temperature and it was 100 degrees. I took Aleve and laid back down. My fever subsided, but I continued to intermittently feel chills throughout the day. I took a warm bath and shower. I felt exhausted and the ache in my back continued. I laid back down from 5-11pm and continued to feel chills, though not as severe as they had been. In the evening, beginning around 7, when I would get up I felt a chill and a wave of paranoia, affecting my mental stability. These would subside when I laid back down. I retired to bed at 11 and woke up at 5am completely drenched in sweat. I changed clothes and returned to bed. When I woke up at 7:30am for work, I felt much better and have felt fairly normal, except for being dehydrated, since.

By midnight I had a fever over 102* and bad chills throughout the night with very little sleep.  the next day (Friday) I had a fever of 100* all day while on Tylenol and ibeprophin alternately.  I stayed home from work to try to rest, but was fatigued all day.  By Friday evening  I started regaining strength, aches subsided and temperature was back to normal.

It hurts to straighten my arm out. It hurts to bring my fist to my shoulder. It hurts to clench my fist tight. It&#39;s affecting my capabilites at work. I delayed reporting it because I thought it was just from getting a shot and would pass.

                                                Approx 4 minutes after the patient, received his Covid-19 Vaccine, he went to take a seat in his chair in the observation area. It was then witnessed by another patient, that Client had turned his head to the left looking &#34;dazed&#34; or &#34;out of it&#34; then fell to the floor. It was observed by other surrounding patients that he hit the left side of his head when he fell to the floor. I, RN, ran to his aide to find him turning to his right side and incoherent. Approx. 5 seconds went by until the patient came to and was able to talk to me and answer questions assessing his alertness. Another patient nearby was prompted by this nurse to call ED.The patients vitals were taken by the nurse and diaphoresis was observed from the patient. The patient stated he had &#34;just felt sleepy and had not eaten prior to receiving his vaccine&#34;. His mother, was brought inside the buiding and stated that the patient had no prior health issues. This patient reported no pain to the head, neck or back but reported some dizziness prior to falling down. Patient stated that he remembers the entire event and did admit to losing consciousness for a short period of time. Fire dept and Paramedics arrived on scene at approx 5:56pm and assessed the patient. Vitals were taken and the patient refused to go to the hospital to be checked out. A juice box on site was given to the patient and the patient waited another approx 10 minutes before leaving with his mother to go home. Both the patient and the mother felt comfortable leaving the site.

Within a few minutes of receiving the shot, I started to have muscle cramps in my calves and arms, joint pain, general feeling of anxiousness and jitteriness. My right hand started to shake and it was difficult to completely control the use of my fingers on my right hand. It was difficult to hold onto a water bottle cap or pick up my iPhone to call my wife. It was like I temporarily lost some fine motor skills in the fingers of my right hand. Overall, this lasted for more than 30 minutes. I drove to get the vaccine by myself, however my wife had to drive me home. We got home about an hour after the shot. When I got home I changed into looser fitting clothing and felt much better. I did not need medical attention.  On 4/6 I had similar symptoms but not as strong so I contacted my dr. They advised to get a Covid 19 test today.

                                                Normally had mild, manageable tinnitus in both ears 24/7. However, after this shot, the volume has exploded to 2-3 times what it used to sound like. It first became loud about 30 minutes after the shot, then became better the next day, then became loud again, and has persisted for the past 2 weeks. I am trying to deal with it mentally but sometimes I am just barely holding down anxiety attacks.

                                                Same as the first shot, however, the adverse effects started shortly after the 2nd shot (within 2 hours after 2nd shot, vs 12 hours after the 1st shot). The symptoms are as follows: Severe headache, severe fatigue and muscle ache, shortness of breath and mild dizziness.  Muscle pain is more noticeable at joints (knees, shoulder cuffs, ankles).  I probably couldn&#39;t walk more than 2 blocks before having to sit down and catch my breath. I probably can&#39;t stand for more than 5 minutes,  and most definitely not in a shape to be able to work (office /engineering). It is hard to pin point, but I would probably say my mind is foggy and not as sharp. However I can quantify this.  The above symptoms lasted 5 days after the first shot, however,  it took up to 14 days before I recovered from general fatigue.   As for second dose, I am filling this form 5 hours post injection.  Considering the severity and early onset of symptoms (compared to 1st dose) I can predict uneasy days to follow.  Note, I am 178cm, and 76Kgs and do not have health issues. My pain tolerance is much higher than an average person.

Not really a dizzy or lightheaded feeling, but an odd feeling. The next thing I know, I came to on the floor. My security camera in the living room caught part of it from down a hall. I fell strait forward, onto my stomach with a large crash. The rest of the day, I did feel fatigue, joint pain in my knees and then chills/hot flashes later in the day/evening. The next morning (Friday) I woke up with a scratchy throat but felt fine the rest of the day.  I  have never fainted in the past. I don&#39;t know what would bring that on.  I also have not had that feeling or any fainting spells since that incident. My wife came home about 8am out of concern.

I after a week I went to an ENT and then an audiologist. I have been put on a high dose of prednisone steroids (90 mg with a body weight of 200 lbs) now for three days. No improvement. The ringing is terrible, it is hard to sleep and concentrate. I now have to turn the volume up on tv and music to hear things that I could hear before.

A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 25Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s prior vaccinations included tetanus shot on 09Feb2021. On 28Mar2021, 2 days after taking the first dose, the patient experienced reactions from the vaccine which included Itchiness on the abdomen area, knees, and toes and disorientation and went to emergency room for treatment. The patient wanted to know whether these are normal side effects of the vaccine. Upon follow-up on 28Mar2021, the patient reported that he felt weird after receiving the vaccine and lightheadedness. He told the nurse that he didn&#39;t eat before getting the vaccine. And wasn&#39;t sure if getting the vaccine was like having blood drawn so he hadn&#39;t eaten anything. The nurse told him he might be feeling lightheaded because he didn&#39;t eat and she gave him some lollipops and the patient felt much better. The patient also stated that on 28Mar2021, he was feeling overwhelmed and cannot describe the feeling. It was like itchy or pins and needles all over his body. The patient felt like he was going to pass out, as he as disoriented. The patient stated that he went to the Emergency Department. They kept him overnight, checked his heart, did some blood work, checked his blood sugar, gave him a Covid 19 test. The patient stated that everything came back normal. The Emergency Department concluded that the events could be due to the Covid 19 vaccine and described that his system was fighting the Covid 19 vaccine or something. The patient was asking if this is normal. He was also asking for a copy of this safety report for work purposes. The patient went to the Emergency Department on 28Mar2021 (around 7pm) and was in observation overnight. He was discharged from the Emergency Department this morning, 29Mar2021 at around 11:00AM. The patient confirmed that he was not hospitalized. The patient stated that he may be overthinking about the events and really paying attention to his body. He thinks he needs to rest as he was in the Emergency Department for a long time. The patient lab test included Blood sugar test. The outcome of the events was resolved for dizziness, unknown for feeling abnormal and overwhelmed and not resolved for other events.  Information on lot/batch number obtained. Additional information has been requested.

                                                I had pain at the injection site the evening of receiving the injection, which still continues, though not too bad. Walking up today at around 7 am, I felt headache, achy all over, weakness, and some fever. I decided to stay home. I lay in bed most of the day, sometimes sleeping, sometimes watching YouTube videos on my phone. I was feeling kind of cold, so I snuggled completely under the covers, head and all. I got sweaty and had to uncover my head. I changed clothes. I got up a couple of times to urinate. Once, I felt some weakness, and had to support myself with my hand on the edge of the bathroom counter. Then, this afternoon, my headache was a bit worse. I got up to hop top the bathroom. I was urinating standing up, when I started feeling weak, so I supported myself with my hand, but almost immediately, I started feeling like I was going to fall, to faint, and to vomit. I hurriedly sat down on the toilet. I was still feeling nauseated and weak, so I learned back to take pressure off my abdomen, which was feeling slightly bloated. The bathroom fan was on, so it felt rather cold, but I started getting hotter and hotter, sweating profusely. At the same time, I just sat there trying to recover, and started feeling pins and needles in my forearms, but not like they had fallen asleep, just like someone were pressing down on my arms with blunt needles. I thought I was going to have to crawl back to bed.  After a while, I started cooling off and feeling a little better. I went back to my room and changed clothes. I&#39;m feeling warm and a bit weak and achy again, but nothing like that. I had only drunk 3 cups of water today, though I drank about 7 yesterday.

At the same time, if you are anxious and scared your heart beat can be high but not that high, his heart beat was 164 the other day, not the same, day, but after 24 hours. 25th was when he had the shot, 26Apr2021, at 1PM he was talking to someone on the phone, felt chills and right away his heart beat went from 120-140, he took water and sat down, walked a couple steps and picked up his oximeter and checked his oxygen and his heart rate was 120 to 130 to 140 then 160, and he sat down, took water and relaxed, it dropped down to 120, was 120-130 some time for 15-20 minutes then 911 guys came, took him to the hospital, and by the time he was at the hospital he was in the 100s. Feeling cold and chilling outcome: He was feeling cold chills, is now pretty much normal, sometimes he feels chills because he is in a T-shirt, he was fine going into the room taking the vaccine, when he came out, the first symptoms he started feeling was dizziness and feeling like falling down.
