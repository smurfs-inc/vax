                                                First dose (12/30/20): Vivid dreams and frequent nocturnal awakenings upon receiving the first dose. Experienced tiredness the next day, unsure of whether it was the vaccine or lack of sleep. Second dose (1/19/21): Awakened every hour to1.5 hours that night with markedly vivid dreams in between awakenings. Upon trying to take a nap, the same situation occurred, with a vivid dream and awakening within 1.5 hours.  I have had vivid dreams in the past, but not with that frequency before. The dreams and difficulty sleeping improved the next night and had resolved within 24 hours.

The first dose was on 12/21/20. These symptoms resolved around 12/26/20. I received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/11/21. I began experiencing symptoms on 01/12/21. The symptoms I was experiencing were lightheadedness, dizziness, and brain fog/confusion. These symptoms got significantly worse from 01/13/21 - 01/24/21 and I began developing profound confusion/brain fog, diplopia, blurry vision, headaches, feeling like I&#39;m swaying on a boat,  and the &#34;feeling of being drunk&#34;. As of 01/25/21, the symptoms have seemed to get better and I am starting to feel more like myself. The drunk feeling and mild blurry vision are still present as of today 01/28/21.

                                                I took notes during my wait time: -6 minutes in my throat felt weird, but different than normal allergic reactions to foods. I prepared my Epi-Pen so I have easier access at this time. -9 minutes in the sides of my tongue were slightly itchy. -11 minutes in and I felt as though the saliva in the back of my throat was thicker and I needed to clear my throat a bit more often, similar to allergic reactions. -15 minutes in, I felt my heart pound once out of beat, but my heart rhythm returned to normal immediately. Tongue itchiness also became intermittent rather than constant. -18 minutes in, overall condition improved and I felt better. -22 minutes in, my throat felt scratchy like I would if I consumed legumes (chickpeas, green peas, soy beans, etc.) but also oddly warm, which was out of the norm.  No treatments needed given mild reactions. I went to work, but notified my co-workers of my reaction, so if my condition worsens they can help administer my Epi-Pen. I am reporting this at 9:21 am on 03/05/2021, roughly an hour after my first dose.

                                                On 2/13/2021, I began to experience both enhanced and new musculoskeletal and neurological symptoms that have not completely resolved still, today, 3/16/2021. While I had experienced some slight discomfort and pain of the b/l thumbs 2-3 weeks prior to 2/13, I began to experience increased pain up to the forearm in both arms on that day. In addition to pain, I had large muscular knots in the superior forearms, especially the right arm. The lower right arm felt extremely tight, and I was having difficulty raising the arm and gripping things. This continued for 2-3 weeks on the right arm. During that time, symptoms worsened on the left arm, while improving on the right arm. A week after the initial symptoms my left arm became worse, and I was struggling to lift objects as light as a sheet of paper. I was also having trouble typing at work, dialing the phone, and opening or closing my hand. Just over a week after symptoms began, I left work to determine a cause and solution for my issues. I also began to have tremors, extreme muscle spasms, and involuntary movements around this time for about 2-3 weeks. While the neurological symptoms have mostly subsided, still, today, 3/16/2021, I continue to deal with various inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms affecting mostly my left arm, but also my right arm. Since yesterday, my left shoulder has begun to have pain as well, making raising my arm and reaching to the opposite side difficult due to pain. I have also had persistent popping of various joints in both arms since the initial symptoms began.

This might be unrelated, but I want to bring it up. About 18 hours after the vaccine, I started to get chills, become clammy, both hot and cold at the same time, and slight fatigue. 24 hours after my vaccine, I noticed that my headache got worse, i felt much more fatigued, and my head felt warmer.

A 26-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9266) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 21Feb2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 26-years-old) as a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, weakened immune system, and allergy to loratadine (CLARITIN). Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) as needed and fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR 500/50). On 21Feb2021 at 14:15, the patient experienced headache, tiredness and was feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine. The next day, on 22Feb2021, the patient experienced significant soreness at injection site. The patient was not treated for headache, tiredness, feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine, and significant soreness at injection site. The clinical outcome of headache, tiredness, feeling as if in a bubble the day of vaccine, and significant soreness at injection site was recovering.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899/expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 27Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that he got the vaccination on the 27th and then that same night he started to feel a little sick. He was assuming that it has just to be the side effect of the vaccine (unspecified vaccine). On 28Dec2020, he was feeling pretty sick; he did not go to the work. He had COVID-19 test (Dec2020) and results came back positive. He added that he didn&#39;t know if it was the COVID because he was reading up on the vaccines and it said that one could not get COVID from the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported positive with COVID-19 test after COVID-19 immunization is considered ineffective of BNT162B2, and the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported event and BNT162B2 administration.

I checked my HR on my smart watch and it said that around 12pm my HR was 157bpm which was right after getting the vaccine when I started walking home. My  resting HR is usually 47-52bpm. I am a very active person. I have been waking up in the middle of the night multiple times in night sweats and it feels like my heart is contracting very hard. I notice that my HR jumps up right when I start to be more active, but more than normal. On the 11th my average walking HR was 140. Today at work my HR was 134 at the highest around 9am and the lowest was 56bpm around 7am when I was getting ready for work. Additionally to the increased HR I have SOB when I walk and talk. I did have a sore arm as well the first day, but nothing more than any other injection I have had before.

I am unable to think. My speech is completely off. I try to say something, but what I say is not what I was thinking. Don&#39;t you dare say I have something wrong with me, in regards to unable to articulate what I want to say, and what Is actually being said. I understand what is happening to me with this reality. Which is why this vaccine is terroristic. Im going to make it my life endeavored goal to resolve this in legal entities. For that. This is not helping anyone. Causing more pain. And. Allowing the government to lie even more. I hate this Country!

Nothing serious until I fell asleep, which is when I developed a fever, uncontrollable chills, and aches all over my body, so much that I could not sleep until I took some ibuprofen. In the morning, the chills were gone, but a slight fever and body aches remained all day. They were gone by the next day.

                                                27 year old male with Down&#39;s Syndrome and no other past medical history received second COVID-19 vaccine on 4/27/2021. On 4/30/2021 began &#34;feeling poorly&#34; with nausea/vomiting and possible chest discomfort. Originally presented to ED on morning of 4/30 - EKG completed demonstrated diffused ST elevation. Patient was transferred to Medical Center for heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries and LVEDP of 25. Stat ECHO demonstrated pericardial effusion and concern raised for myopericarditis. Patient subsequently transferred to a different Medical Center for higher level of care. Upon arrival to Medical Center plan was to intubate and take to cath lab for heart biopsy and PA catheter placement. However, upon intubation patient began to decompensate and subsequently developed cardiac arrest. During ACLS, VA ECMO was placed and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. Following VA ECMO placement patient received IVIG, high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg), anakinra 100 mg, and broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn). Despite these efforts the patient continued to have hemodynamic instability and was on high dose vasopressors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, angiotensin II, vasopressin). Patient subsequently suffered another cardiac arrest, briefly regained pulse with high dose vasopressors, but subsequently lost pulse despite best efforts and died on 5/1/2021 at approximately 13:00.

Whole body chills, severe body and head aches, slight on and off &#34;brain fog&#34;, slight cough, heavy fatigue, and a fever that was recorded every few hours ranging from 101.2 to 103.5. It lasted all day long that I was awake (0600-2000). Treated with Dayquil and Nyquil Severe Cold and Flu. Woke up the next day, and all that was left was slight body and head aches and slight cough; temp back to normal, ranging 98.9 to 99.2.

The patient mother suffers from slight anxiety at times; dad currently has high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included albuterol sulfate taken for asthma (in inhalation (90mcg per actuation 200 metered inhalations: 2 puffs as needed) and liquid form (0.083% 2.5 mg out of 3ml as needed) for nebulizer since he was born). Patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. Patient did not want to contract COVID-19 because he has asthma. On 28Mar2021 at 17:00 (within 5 minutes of vaccination), patient experienced Tunnel Vision, chills, weakness, insane rush from the bottom of his feet to the top of head, felt like he was going to pass out (which was recovered same day with lasting effects), weakness, hasn&#39;t felt the same; feels like something is off every day; not himself, very weird like an out of body experience this was almost like an anxiety attack/anxiety attacks for every 30 minutes or so, tension headaches, dizziness and felt immediate rush to the head and feeling of fainting, at 8PM or 9PM, he felt pain at the injection and body aches. The patient visited physician room as a result of Insane tension headaches, and anxiety. On 29Mar2021, he didn&#39;t really feel too anxious, but he felt out of place, kind of off and uneasy.

On 31Mar2021, brain fog and slight dizziness does not like he was going to fall over but cant stand still without lean a little/felt immediate rush to the head and feeling of fainting. On 02Apr2021, injection site pain was gradually faded away. The patient states that these events started after the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events included Tylenol. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test (Nasal swab): Pending on 06Apr2021. The patient did not take any other vaccinations four weeks prior to vaccination. The patient was afraid to take second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine due to the events. Patient felt very hard to work with these symptoms and to get through everyday life, it is very tough. Patient knows plenty of people that died from COVID-19 and he does not want to have to make changes and fix things in his life that he did not cause and worries this will stick around for the rest of his life all because he took a vaccine. The patient had physician office and Emergency room visit.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information.

I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

                                                After leaving the vaccination clinic following the 15 minute waiting period, I felt normal and ran a quick errand before returning to work. After completing the errand (roughly 15 minutes), I began driving back to my office (roughly 10 minute drive). As I was roughly 1/2 mile from the office, I started to feel slightly lightheaded/woozy. I continued to drive toward the office, and within a matter of a couple minutes or less, I was overcome with extreme disorientation and faintness. Before I could manage to return to the office or pull over to collect myself, I completely lost consciousness and crashed into another vehicle. Even after the crash, I was unconscious for roughly a minute or so until I finally came to and realized what had happened. It then took me another couple of minutes to collect myself and exit the vehicle to assess the situation and ensure all parties were alright. Police/Emergency services were contacted and a police report was filed. After the event, I remained slightly nauseated for approximately 3 hours and had intermittent chill episodes, but the adverse events have since subsided.

                                                The vaccination was administered on Saturday evening, December 19th, 2020. The next morning around 10 am I began to feel nauseous and light-headed. That feeling waxed and waned all day and improved in the evening. The next morning on Monday, December 21st I was 10/10 nauseous and near vomiting. I went to work but had to leave because of nausea. Ultimately I vomited upon returning home and was nauseous with abdominal pain and achy all day. The next morning on Tuesday, December 22 nausea continued but with a rating of around 6/10. Then came the intense headache, body aches, and fatigue. This continued into the next day  (Wednesday, December 23) prompting me to get COVID tested and take off of work on Thursday, December 24th. Nausea improved (5/10)  on December 24th but fatigue, abdominal pain,  and body aches did not. December 25-27 were slow improvements with nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue but were limiting activities of daily living. By Monday, December 28th most symptoms had cleared.

All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

                                                In the evening after getting the shot, I started getting chills and became more sensitive to cold temperatures.  Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

After patient was released from vaccine site, he developed shortness of breath, and went to the ER, where he was given diphenhydramine, which patient says helped. Patient then had 10 days of symptoms neurological and cardiovascular symptoms (slowed cognition, mood changes, somnolence/hypersomnia, palpitations) and went to ER four times and was diagnosed with a concussion/post concussive syndrome. He was referred to neurology and had an EEG conducted. He was given prednisone during this time.

                                                After getting the vaccine in my left arm, I walked to observation area and sat down in chair. Within a minute or so, I noticed my heart rate was slightly elevated and had a strange feeling of unease. Roughly 3-5 minutes later symptoms appeared and I noticed my palms were sweating and I had slightly blurred vision. At this point, I called for a paramedic and told them I wasn?t feeling well. They arrived nearly 15 seconds later (paramedics were stationed all throughout observation area). Symptom severity dramatically increased (very blurred vision, feeling of something clearly being wrong) and was added by a ringing sound in both ears. I was helped into a wheel chair and rolled into an enclosed area with a curtain around for privacy. Gatorade was offered to me and I took a few sips and felt very mildly better. Paramedics reported that my blood pressure was extremely low (63/28). They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. Symptoms were the same and starting to very slightly get better from the Gatorade so I said let?s wait a few minutes to see how I feel. At this point they took my blood sugar measurement and found that it was also very low (53mg). They gave me some intravenous fluids and a glucose substance that was in a tube (sort of like toothpaste) and within another five minutes I felt considerably better. I received the IV treatment for roughly 20 minutes and symptoms progressively got better over the course of the treatment. My blood pressure went back up to 117/80 and my blood sugar went up to a more normal level as well (I believe they said somewhere in the 90s or low 100?s). After they removed the IV and blood pressure monitor, I rested for roughly 20 minutes before walking to my car and driving home.

                                                As a person who has never had any kind of allergies--including seasonal allergies--as of the week I received the vaccine, I appear to have developed a new allergy to dust mites. When resting my head against a pillow (especially near the open end of the pillow case), I develop sneezing, complete sinus congestion (to the point I am not able to breathe from either nostril), runny eyes, and similar histamine responses. The symptoms have responded well to diphenhydramine and loratadine, as well as use of allergen-resistant pillowcases, but they have reduced my sleep quality in the weeks since they developed, and I feel this new allergy has negatively impacted my quality of life.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced suicidal ideation, extreme fatigue, depressed mood, brain fog, irritability, tinnitus, body temperature fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. No treatment was received for the events. The reporter considered the events as non-serious. The event outcome was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering close temporal association, a possible contributory role of bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be completely excluded. However the clinical course, relevant medical history and concomitant medications are pending for a medically meaningful assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 22Mar2021 at 12:30 at the age of 30 years-old, (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included dyspepsia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Severe Heartburn , blood pressure measurement from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Blood pressure , migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for blood pressure for 3 years and ongoing; pantoprazole (PANTOPRAZOLE) taken for stomach medication and heartburn for about a year. Patient states he got the first round 3 weeks ago and he is supposed to get the second dose next Monday but was advised by his doctor not to do that.      Patient states he got the shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and Tuesday 23Mar2021 he was tired and sluggish. On Wednesday 24Mar2021, mid afternoon, he had purple splotches all over his body, in arms and legs, like discoloration, his head felt like it had been dipped in cement and he couldn&#39;t think. States he felt cloudy, dizzy and woozy, nauseous, had a headache and feeling awful. States this occurred like 48 hours after the shot. He contacted a life long friend who is a doctor and works in a covid ward and he told him he was having a reaction and to take some Benadryl and Advil or Tylenol, and the friend told the patient to lay down and rest. He still didn&#39;t feel great but splotches went away and head felt a little bit clearer and he didn&#39;t feel like he was in slow motion or dizzy anymore by Wednesday evening, so he went to bed. On Thursday, the patient went into work but didn&#39;t feel great, not feeling 100%, and about noon on Thursday 25Mar2021, the symptoms started coming back, the purple splotches, his head felt just as bad, he had a headache, slow motion and not himself. The patient called his doctor and his friend and they said he needed to go in and get looked at. The patient tried to go into an urgent care and he states they said nope head to the ER. Patient states he was admitted into the ER and the ER staff said he was having more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave him steroids and an IV but he is not sure what it is and he was given, he thinks, Prednisone over the next couple days to help with side effects, he believes it was Prednisone, he knows it was a steroid. States he is not a fan of it and he doesn&#39;t like it at all. Patient states that he thought it was a pretty standard reaction and was not worried about it. Patient states he still gets headaches and maybe it&#39;s something else that is unrelated. States he stopped feeling tired and sluggish maybe the 29Mar2021, a week afterwards. Patient states that he has recovered with lasting effects as he&#39;s been getting migraines since then, states maybe it&#39;s unrelated but didn&#39;t happen a whole lot before. He has severe headaches and nothing he takes seems to help, has to turn lights off and works from home and patient reports that he had one yesterday. Patient states the purple splotches went away after he went to the ER and got on the medicine, the steroids.  P atient states the nausea was pretty constant when a headache comes on, he doesn&#39;t have a headache every day but when he gets a headache he is definitely nauseous.  The outcome of the events was for fatigue and sluggish, recovered with sequela, Purple splotches, dizzy and woozy slow motion, recovered, nausea and headache not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

                                                Within 2-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy.  I signaled for help while in my car  and help arrived. Within the next few minutes the severity seemed to go from ?0-100? and I began to feel a deep impending sense of doom and panic/fear. I also felt extremely tense in my muscles and felt itchy in the chest area. That continued for 15 minutes or so before subsiding slowly. Staff surrounded my car and were very supportive and great about the situation.   It was one of the most frightening experiences to date I have had. No EpiPen type intervention was done. Once the event was on the downswing I was kept for additional observation and release on my own accord.  Everyone there was great. I am reporting for my own records in case further testing reveals I have an allergy to this vaccine for employment purposes should the vaccine become mandated prior to me having alternative means of vaccination or allergy testing competed to determine if it was an true reaction or not so I can get vaccinated safely.

I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

                                                Experienced bouts of mild vertigo lasting around 5 seconds a few times a day starting after the second or third day of vaccine.  By the weekend it hadn?t gotten worse to the point where I couldn?t leave the bedroom due to the walls literally spinning. That?s as the worst day then it progressively lessened until it went away by the second week.  Thought it was worth a mention.  My gf that I live with has also had ringing in her ear non stop since the second vaccine, so I?m a little concerned about the second shot.

I was feeling feverish by the end of the day, a slight head ache,  clammy, mental fog, exhausted. The following day I had waves of nausea, and each of the previously reported symptoms were stronger. The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient stated he got the shot on 30Dec2020. There was no allergic reaction however, the site was sore, sore for a couple of days from an unspecified date. The patient added that from an unspecified date, he did have kind of brain fog, fatigue, and headache for 3 days. Those symptoms subsided after 3 days. Additionally, 2 or 3 days ago in Jan2021, he started getting a rash on his hand and have also now been suffering from extreme anxiety, fatigue and brain fog. He informed that he went to the emergency room yesterday and he was prescribed some Xanax for the anxiety and a steroid for the rash. The patient was currently taking those now. He also did some basic lab testing yesterday, 13Jan2021, and all his labs were pretty much okay. The outcome of the events site was sore, and headache was recovered on an unspecified date; the outcome of event rash on his hand was unknown; while the outcome of the other remaining events was not recovered.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The evening of the vaccination, I experienced severe fatigue and tiredness.  I slept 14 hours that night and after waking up, I&#39;m tired and lethargic and my arm still hurts.  I missed work today (Wednesday 3/24/21) due to the pain and fatigue.

                                                I began experiencing severe neck pain the morning after I received my first vaccine. The first morning, the pain was so intense that I was unable to lift my head out of bed and consequently had to lift the back of my neck with one hand to sit up in bed. I?d never experienced this kind of neck pain before.  The pain level was equally intense over the next several days until I started taking ibuprofen . I even went to the chiropractor to receive an adjustment to help reduce the pain. However, as of today,  I am still experiencing significant neck pain that is effecting my activities of daily living.

He was not falling over but had to be very careful with his steps.; burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back; he felt off. It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux. He experienced some unusual side effects that were not listed on the web. His boss advised him to call. Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.   Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received my shot at 3:30 PM on 01/09/21.  I felt very tired on 01/12/21 before that went away that evening.  I began feeling dizzy and nauseus around 8:00 PM Monday, 01/11/21, and again periodically on 01/12/21.  The dizzy and nausea feeling continued consistently throughout 01/12/21 and 01/13/21.  I went to my primary care provider on 01/12/21 who gave me medication to help with nausea and dizziness.  She chalked it up to anxiety.  I became more worried on the evening of 01/13/21 and went to the ER.  The ER doctor stated it could be a reaction to the vaccine, inflammation in the ear/calcium buildup in the ear, or just my anxiety.  I do want to note I was nervous about getting this shot and have a history of having trouble distinguishing between true issues I am having and issues caused by my anxiety.  As of today, 01/15/21, I took Methazine which seems to have helped the dizziness, but not completely.  I am not currently nauseus.

Not sure I want to take second dose since colleagues that didn&#39;t have covid before had these symptoms after the second dose not the first. I had covid before and I have these symptoms now.

                                                He was doing well for a couple of days after he received the vaccine, then he started noticing a decline in his mental health.  He became agitated, irate, nothing did anything to provoke his reaction.  The voices that he normally hears became louder, and nothing changed except the vaccine.  This increased his mental health issues and psychiatrist wanted to admit him to a mental institute and then changed his mind when he realized he had the vaccine.  His agitation became 10X worse than his baseline.   His psychiatrist believes that the vaccination cancelled out his medications.  His doctor is adjusting his medications and advised against taking the 2nd vaccine.

                                                Left arm was incapacitated for nearly a week after the initial injection. Arm could not be lifted more than a few inches away from torso, and pain felt like severe deep cramping constantly. No bruising or mark at the site of the injection just severe muscle pain that affected all movement and sleep.  After one week I regained more mobility but still had severe pain in the shoulder muscles around injection site. At the 3 week mark I have more mobility but still struggle with a full range of motion and lifting anything more than a few pounds.

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

                                                Severe abdominal pain.  The shot was given at approx 11 am.  Abdominal pain started around 6 pm, gradually got worse.  At 1 am I was awoken in pain and I took hydrocodone leftover from a previous surgery in hopes of making it to the morning for urgent care.  (ER Bills)  At 4 am I was re-awoken in even worse pain, decided I was about to die, and went to the ER.  Cold sweat on way to ER.  Throat dry.  Made it to ER, received Morphine, the first dose calmed the pain down, did not make it go away.  A lot of tests and several hours later, a second dose was given when the pain returned to its terrible state.  Approx 15 min into the second dose pain was finally subsiding (roughly 1 or 2 pm).  Went home and took Tylonal as requested by Docs and filled an Oxy prescription in anticipation of the return of the pain.  This has not happened.  Slept great last night.  Dry Mouth Persists.  Also slight arm tenderness.

                                                I had the normal symptoms of pain at injection site, headache, fatigue, chills, muscle aches.  I did get a fever for a short duration.  The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

The best way I can describe it is that it felt like I had consumed marijuana. I do not use marijuana or any other drugs. I had not consumed alcohol. The effects were similar to that of marijuana in that there was a ?peak? and a ?come-down.?  The peak lasted a little more than one hour, and began about one hour after the injection. The effects slowly faded until I didn?t feel completely normal until I woke up this morning. Today, I have no symptoms other than a sore arm.

Common side effects such as chills, headache and severe drowsiness lasted 2 maybe 3 days but the anxious feeling in my chest is still there. Heart palpitations is what I am having and it?s constant. There have been times at work that I can feel my heart beat in my pant legs, temples, wrists and forehead from ordinary stress that I?ve have no issues handling in the past 4 years. Every 30-60 seconds I have to take a deep breath to catch my breath regardless of what I am doing. Suddenly severe drowsiness. I?m sure there?s more that I?m forgetting.

Began to feel flu like symptoms approx 1800 on the evening of 1/19/21. Symptoms worsened through the night rapidly, beginning with uncontrollable chills/shivering, body aches, restless, slight vertigo, weakness/fatigue. At approx 0100 the morning of 1/20/21, blacked out while in the bathroom of which awoken and found myself disoriented, weak, and on the ground (no injuries noted as i must have eased myself down).  I was able to hydrate afterwards and tolerate eating some dry cereal to help with the weakness. Symptoms began to dissipate while an intense headache continued throughout the night and even through the daytime. The time is now 1020 on the day of 1/20/21 and i still have quite the headache but all other symptoms seem to be relieved at this time.

Then as he was walking to schedule his second appointment soon after the vaccine, he fell to his knees (no CHI).  I was notified and ran over to see pt was disoriented, pale, diaphoretic.  While measuring his left arm BP (80/30), he began to convulse with both elbows flexed.  The convulsions lasted about 10 secs, pt did not recall the event, we held him in a seated position on the floor.  He felt much better after the convulsion &#43; water/snacks, however we did call EMS during the event.  Per EMS, BP was 128/80, and pt was AAOx3.  Pt refused to go to the hospital and agreed to f/up with PCP.

This was followed by a spread of the flush/warm feeling across the face, chest and arms followed immediately by a 2-3 minute panic feeling, chest tightness and extremely heightened anxiety with a general feeling of being unable to focus/concentrate. After this couple of minutes the flushing stopped in all areas except the cheeks and the itching sensation dissipated quickly over the next 30 minutes but the feeling of swelling on the roof of the mouth continued for a total of one hour. There were no visible signs of swelling in the mouth, tongue or throat, nor redness in the face. The flushing feeling settled in both cheeks of the face and was accompanied by heightened anxiety, along with an overall feeling of being warm. However, there were no visible signs of redness or rash, the sensations and anxiety persisted for mildly for 10 hours, all of which gradually dissipating over time. That night physical symptoms had cleared up, soreness in the right arm began and lasted into the morning. Anxiety levels mostly returned to normal in the morning.

First night, it was very difficult to sleep - I did not get much. Dizziness was like being very drunk. Now every night laying down in bed looking up is dizzying, some nights worse than others but not as bad as first night of symptoms. This has been persistent for about a week. Some temporary dizziness when reorienting head quickly during the day, particularly looking up or down, but mainly worse at night in the dark, not debilitating. Sleeping with some low lights on helps reduce spinning feeling. Mild headache and tight neck/shoulders starting 9 days after injection but may be unrelated.

                                                It has now been more than 1 week since vaccination.  First couple of days were fine, but starting  26-FEB-2021, I&#39;ve been exhibiting all of the following: Fever - Friday 98, Saturday (3 measures over 5 hours) 99.1, 99.3, 99.4, Sunday 98.5, Monday 99.4 (at night, work up in body aches), Tuesday(97.5), Wednesday 98.5 Chills - mild, 1-3 times. comes and goes through past week.  Occurs more at night.  Feeling cold - wearing sweat pants, two shirts, long sleeve shirt, sweater, during sleep.  Constantly add/remove clothes to regulate temperature. During day, have sweat pants &#43; sweater on 78&#43; degree weather. Muscle pain - in back, moving daily. First started in right chest and back right shoulder, has now disappeared.  Now in middle of back, around spin area, hard and uncomfortable to sleep, taking IB profin helps alleviate pain, 2 to 3 tables over counter.  pain in throat around vocal box, could be due to sneezing, slight soreness to touch/aches. Feeling unwell - comes and goes, day starts fine, then around noon/1pm i get super tired and sleep.  Sleeping schedule is generally 10PM to 6AM &#43; naps through day Lose stools - from 25-FEB to 27-FEB, cleared up on 29-FEB Coughing - started on 03-MAR-2021, slight about 1 to 3 times an hour. Headache - comes and goes, use IB profin only when trying to sleep, all other times i let it be.  Good news: No swelling at injection site No redness at injection site  No Swelling at injection site  Final notes: Just feeling up an down, not taking anything besides IB profin for pain management. I was going to work everyday pre-shot with out issue. Post-shot, not feeling well enough to report to work out of fear of spreading anything that i got. Weekend immune system. Slightly grumpy demeanure since sick and interrupted sleep patterns.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EL9267) on 26Feb2021 and the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EN6202) on 12Mar2021, via an unspecified route of administration on Left Arm at single  dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The administration of first dose of BNT162B2 resulted in Palpitations, dizziness, hyperhidrosis and Syncope the same day of administration. Relevant medical history included allergy to penicillin.  Relevant concomitant medications included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE). During second dose of vaccine the patient stated that he feels the medicine in his body, almost to his toes. The patient was fine for a minute or two but then he reported a big rush of the room spinning, struggling to catch my breath, racing heart. EMS personnel was called over and they monitored my heart rate. It was swinging from 120&#43; BPM to 50 BPM in an instant and during the low BPM was when he passed out.   The patient was treated with Epinephrine due a potential reaction and transported to hospital.  The reported events were feeling abnormal, vertigo, dyspnoea, palpitations, heart rate irregular and loss of consciousness. All events were serious as hospitalization and Life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).

This 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Feb2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 37-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. The patient had no allergies to medications, food or other products, and was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 24Feb2021 at 04:00, 14.5 hours post injection, the patient was awoken from sleep and experienced mast cell degranulation on back and armpits, with urticaria present and pruritis present. Cetirizine 10 mg was taken orally. On 24Feb2021 at 04:25 the urticaria and pruritis subsided. On 24Feb2021 at 05:00, the patient went back to sleep. On 24Feb2021 at 11:00 the pruritis presented again with less intensity. The events were reported as non-serious and did not require hospitalization. The events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The clinical outcomes of mast cell degranulation on back and armpits, urticaria present, pruritis present, and awoken from sleep were recovering. It was also reported that since vaccination the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                I received my second shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, March 20th at noon.  Saturday at midnight, I woke up in full body sweats and aches.  I took two ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep, but I would toss and turn in full body sweats and aches for the next 8 hours.  I took another 2 ibuprofen around 400am.  Sunday morning I woke up feeling OK, not great, but OK.  Sunday night ? it was very strange ? the full body chills and aches came back.  Not as bad as Saturday night, but they returned nevertheless.  I had another restless night of sleep, and I took another two rounds of ibuprofen to try and help me sleep.  Monday I woke up feeling OK again.  Monday evening, around 8:00pm, I could feel the full body chills and aches coming back again, creeping up slightly.  This time, I also felt a mild burning in my upper chest and throat.  I went to bed around 8:00pm, then woke up at 9:00pm, this time in a lot of pain.  It felt like burning and a stabbing sensation in my throat and upper chest.  I took some ibuprofen, and tried to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned in agony for the next few hours, apparently falling asleep at some point around 1:00am.  At 2:00am I woke up in severe pain again.  It was very bad, like an 8 out of a 10.  It felt like a burning and stabbing sensation in my lower throat and upper chest.  I had my wife call 911, and I was brought to hospital in an ambulance.  I would stay in the hospital for the next 3 days, getting discharged Thursday at around 5:00pm.  I had peak troponin levels of 5, so I basically had a moderate heart attack.  I had a cardiac catherization procedure done, as well as a cardiac MRI.  The cardiac catherization procedure showed I had no blockages at all in my arteries.  The cardiologists diagnosed me with myocarditis.  The cardiologists told me they believe the vaccine triggered a heavy response from my auto immune system.  The response from my auto immune system in turn caused my heart to become inflamed, giving me myocarditis.  It was a horrible experience, and my doctors are convinced that it was brought on by the second coronavirus vaccine shot that I received.

A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

It was loud enough to keep me awake and the ringing has not stopped, even up until this point. I can still hear out of the right ear, but I cannot hear over the ringing. High pitch noises I can hear amplified, while it is difficult to hear anything else. I can also feel the vibrations in my inner ear during those high noises. I did take 800mg of Ibuprofen before bed and I know that NSAIDS can be associated with Tinnitus but this seems very out of the ordinary for me with no medical history and remarkable health screen.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

I was nearly calling 911 that night - My wife ended up taking me to urgent care to be seen for headache. CAT SCAN and blood work to rule out aneurisms. I was given: Injection of Toradol -a steroidal anti-inflammatory. Viral inflammation in the brain caused by the vaccine - their diagnosis. Out of work for a week. I experienced symptoms on and off for three weeks - headaches; somedays I feel good and some days I don&#39;t feel good - with low energy and weakness and body aches. I have been taking (alternating) ibuprofen and Tylenol - the first week nothing could help but after that the alternating doses did start helping. I haven&#39;t had a headache for about a week now.  The body aches and low energy is still not resolved - comes and goes.

                                                Per the patient&#39;s mother, after receiving the 2nd vaccine dose on 2/19/21, patient &#34;became different&#34;.  He reported to her that he has &#34;non-stop ringing in the ear&#34;, &#34;wanted to kill himself because of ringing&#34;; couldn&#39;t sleep all night&#34;, had fever. On 2/23, patient&#39;s symptoms got worse. He vomited twice, ringing in the ear continued, had headache, fever, and poor appetite. He also couldn&#39;t sleep. The mother of the patient was advised by the case management team that it&#39;s not uncommon for 2nd shot to cause slight flu-like symptoms for a short while, but she probably needs to call 911 if patient exhibits suicidal tendencies and take him to ED.  She said she already tried over the weekend, called Hatzola. 6 people came to and spoke with patient, including psych. Hatzola left, the patient was not deemed at risk, refused to go anywhere.  She was concerned that he refused to follow up with outside PMD. She was given further instructions to take the patient to the ER and call with any other questions and concerns. She was not heard from since. Attempts were made to contact the patient to follow up, but to no avail. Patient&#39;s phone appears to be off.

Continued throughout the night  *took pictures of welts Took some Benadryl at night. Woke up; symptoms still there and extended even more to include hands. I went to work.

My knees, ankles, feet were starting to swell.  Hives had gone from the thighs and up, But below, shins to feet, were swelling.  1/13 I woke up to a lacy rash over all extremities. Bruising on shins.

He stated he immediately felt better. He also stated he never lost consciousness and that he had bad anxiety and that this has happened before due to his anxiety in the past. They checked out the patient and the patient walked out on his own accord and did not leave with the paramedics.

This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

A 39-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 at single dose for prevention.  Medical history included none. There were no concomitant medications. Caller states, he received the covid vaccine 19Dec2020 and on 25Dec2020 he was experiencing left facial numbness, b/l foot numbness, b/l hand numbness on 26Dec2020, right side burning on 28Dec2020, Today (29Dec2020) he has had left thigh burning, and Left b/l gluteal burning and paresthesia. No motor issues and no tendon issues, all intact. Also had mid back burning on 28Dec2020 that comes and goes. He has heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus and/or with the vaccine and wants more information on that. Curious if anyone has anything similar? and makes mention of possible Gillian Barre Syndrome. States that he has had a potential reaction. He had his dose on 19Dec2020. On 25Dec2020 he developed left facial numbness, then later that day he developed bilateral foot numbness.

States that he has been kind of freaking out about it. He doesn&#39;t have any motor issues. States that he heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus, but not with the vaccine, is that true? The left facial numbness resolved on either 26Dec2020 or 27Dec2020. States that the symptoms were concerning because it could have been a stroke. States his symptoms were moderate. States that due to the bilateral foot and hand numbness, he had a LP, brain and spine MRI, and blood work done on 26Dec2020. All came back completely normal. When asked about causality, caller states that it makes the most sense for his symptoms to be caused by the vaccine due to his age and the fact that all his testing was completely normal. Reporter seriousness for left facial numbness, bilateral foot numbness, bilateral hand numbness, right thigh burning, left thigh burning and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia: Medically significant. The outcome of the event left facial numbness was recovered in Dec2020. The outcome of the events guillain barre syndrome, stroke and mid back burning was unknown.

The patient was evaluated at Urgent Care yesterday and sent by the NP. Patient reports three days of rash to the left side of his face with redness and swelling. The patient initially thought the rash was acne due to his face mask. There is intermittent pain to the area which is rated 10/10 severity at its worst. The patient has been unable to sleep the past two days due to the pain. Pain is worse with cold weather and at night with increased clenching of his jaw and grinding of his teeth. He was prescribed Valtrex at Urgent Care and took one dose just PTA to the ED. There is concern given a bump just lateral to the patient&#39;s left eye. The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccination on 01/18/2021 and explains that the Urgent Care provider believes this may be an adverse reaction.

                                                Around 5:30am I woke up feeling as though I had not slept well. I had chills, then I would sweat, then I would have chills again. I had severe fatigue, and muscle aches centering in my lower back. I took my temperature and it was 100 degrees. I took Aleve and laid back down. My fever subsided, but I continued to intermittently feel chills throughout the day. I took a warm bath and shower. I felt exhausted and the ache in my back continued. I laid back down from 5-11pm and continued to feel chills, though not as severe as they had been. In the evening, beginning around 7, when I would get up I felt a chill and a wave of paranoia, affecting my mental stability. These would subside when I laid back down. I retired to bed at 11 and woke up at 5am completely drenched in sweat. I changed clothes and returned to bed. When I woke up at 7:30am for work, I felt much better and have felt fairly normal, except for being dehydrated, since.

A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 25Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s prior vaccinations included tetanus shot on 09Feb2021. On 28Mar2021, 2 days after taking the first dose, the patient experienced reactions from the vaccine which included Itchiness on the abdomen area, knees, and toes and disorientation and went to emergency room for treatment. The patient wanted to know whether these are normal side effects of the vaccine. Upon follow-up on 28Mar2021, the patient reported that he felt weird after receiving the vaccine and lightheadedness. He told the nurse that he didn&#39;t eat before getting the vaccine. And wasn&#39;t sure if getting the vaccine was like having blood drawn so he hadn&#39;t eaten anything. The nurse told him he might be feeling lightheaded because he didn&#39;t eat and she gave him some lollipops and the patient felt much better. The patient also stated that on 28Mar2021, he was feeling overwhelmed and cannot describe the feeling. It was like itchy or pins and needles all over his body. The patient felt like he was going to pass out, as he as disoriented. The patient stated that he went to the Emergency Department. They kept him overnight, checked his heart, did some blood work, checked his blood sugar, gave him a Covid 19 test. The patient stated that everything came back normal. The Emergency Department concluded that the events could be due to the Covid 19 vaccine and described that his system was fighting the Covid 19 vaccine or something. The patient was asking if this is normal. He was also asking for a copy of this safety report for work purposes. The patient went to the Emergency Department on 28Mar2021 (around 7pm) and was in observation overnight. He was discharged from the Emergency Department this morning, 29Mar2021 at around 11:00AM. The patient confirmed that he was not hospitalized. The patient stated that he may be overthinking about the events and really paying attention to his body. He thinks he needs to rest as he was in the Emergency Department for a long time. The patient lab test included Blood sugar test. The outcome of the events was resolved for dizziness, unknown for feeling abnormal and overwhelmed and not resolved for other events.  Information on lot/batch number obtained. Additional information has been requested.
