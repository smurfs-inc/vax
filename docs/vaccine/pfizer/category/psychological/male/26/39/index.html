                                                First dose (12/30/20): Vivid dreams and frequent nocturnal awakenings upon receiving the first dose. Experienced tiredness the next day, unsure of whether it was the vaccine or lack of sleep. Second dose (1/19/21): Awakened every hour to1.5 hours that night with markedly vivid dreams in between awakenings. Upon trying to take a nap, the same situation occurred, with a vivid dream and awakening within 1.5 hours.  I have had vivid dreams in the past, but not with that frequency before. The dreams and difficulty sleeping improved the next night and had resolved within 24 hours.

Took 50mg of benadryl shortly after and symptoms improved over the following hour.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899/expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 27Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that he got the vaccination on the 27th and then that same night he started to feel a little sick. He was assuming that it has just to be the side effect of the vaccine (unspecified vaccine). On 28Dec2020, he was feeling pretty sick; he did not go to the work. He had COVID-19 test (Dec2020) and results came back positive. He added that he didn&#39;t know if it was the COVID because he was reading up on the vaccines and it said that one could not get COVID from the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported positive with COVID-19 test after COVID-19 immunization is considered ineffective of BNT162B2, and the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported event and BNT162B2 administration.

I checked my HR on my smart watch and it said that around 12pm my HR was 157bpm which was right after getting the vaccine when I started walking home. My  resting HR is usually 47-52bpm. I am a very active person. I have been waking up in the middle of the night multiple times in night sweats and it feels like my heart is contracting very hard. I notice that my HR jumps up right when I start to be more active, but more than normal. On the 11th my average walking HR was 140. Today at work my HR was 134 at the highest around 9am and the lowest was 56bpm around 7am when I was getting ready for work. Additionally to the increased HR I have SOB when I walk and talk. I did have a sore arm as well the first day, but nothing more than any other injection I have had before.

A 28-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included vertigo from Aug2019. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine through the facility where he works (not a military facility). Patient received his first dose on 17Dec2020 (lot number: EL0140). Patient said that the symptoms started Monday, he was super sick Friday after first dose. Patient clarified to super sick on 08Jan2021 after his second dose. On 08Jan2021 after his second dose, patient had a fever of unknown temperature which he slept through it. He was tired the whole day on Monday (11Jan2021) and really dizzy and had chills from then to now, which is not stopping, he means the dizziness is not better, the chills come and go. He clarifies that he did take Tylenol to treat the fever and the next day he had no fever. He says that the dizzy, he still has it. Patient took 500mg once by mouth of the Tylenol. Patient stated that he also has a history of vertigo, so he thought he was having a vertigo attack, but he took his medicine and it did not help him.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

Starting last night, after sweating an obscene amount, I started feeling dizziness. Not a normal dizziness, but a severe one with brain zaps. The type of brain zaps someone has when coming on or off affexor/venlafaxine (which I?m currently on). The dizziness only happens when I stand and the brain zaps happen more frequently than when the dose changes or is forgotten with the snri. Before someone asks... yes... I?m taking my affexor properly and haven?t changed how I?m taking it since my covid shot.

Patient was clearing his throat periodically. Patient states he has anxiety, so he also believes that is adding to his symptoms. After checking vitals  administered epi and dial 911. Patient had started to clear his throat more often.  Continued to monitor patients symptoms and did not have any worsening of symptoms and after approximately 5 minutes, he stated he felt better. EMS arrived and discussed with patient and he elected to refuse transport to the hospital. He has a buddy in the parking lot who drove him here.

                                                The vaccination was administered on Saturday evening, December 19th, 2020. The next morning around 10 am I began to feel nauseous and light-headed. That feeling waxed and waned all day and improved in the evening. The next morning on Monday, December 21st I was 10/10 nauseous and near vomiting. I went to work but had to leave because of nausea. Ultimately I vomited upon returning home and was nauseous with abdominal pain and achy all day. The next morning on Tuesday, December 22 nausea continued but with a rating of around 6/10. Then came the intense headache, body aches, and fatigue. This continued into the next day  (Wednesday, December 23) prompting me to get COVID tested and take off of work on Thursday, December 24th. Nausea improved (5/10)  on December 24th but fatigue, abdominal pain,  and body aches did not. December 25-27 were slow improvements with nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue but were limiting activities of daily living. By Monday, December 28th most symptoms had cleared.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

                                                In the evening after getting the shot, I started getting chills and became more sensitive to cold temperatures.  Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

                                                Within 2-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy.  I signaled for help while in my car  and help arrived. Within the next few minutes the severity seemed to go from ?0-100? and I began to feel a deep impending sense of doom and panic/fear. I also felt extremely tense in my muscles and felt itchy in the chest area. That continued for 15 minutes or so before subsiding slowly. Staff surrounded my car and were very supportive and great about the situation.   It was one of the most frightening experiences to date I have had. No EpiPen type intervention was done. Once the event was on the downswing I was kept for additional observation and release on my own accord.  Everyone there was great. I am reporting for my own records in case further testing reveals I have an allergy to this vaccine for employment purposes should the vaccine become mandated prior to me having alternative means of vaccination or allergy testing competed to determine if it was an true reaction or not so I can get vaccinated safely.

I was feeling feverish by the end of the day, a slight head ache,  clammy, mental fog, exhausted. The following day I had waves of nausea, and each of the previously reported symptoms were stronger. The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux.

Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.   Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

I began feeling dizzy and nauseus around 8:00 PM Monday, 01/11/21, and again periodically on 01/12/21.  The dizzy and nausea feeling continued consistently throughout 01/12/21 and 01/13/21.  I went to my primary care provider on 01/12/21 who gave me medication to help with nausea and dizziness.  She chalked it up to anxiety.  I became more worried on the evening of 01/13/21 and went to the ER.  The ER doctor stated it could be a reaction to the vaccine, inflammation in the ear/calcium buildup in the ear, or just my anxiety.  I do want to note I was nervous about getting this shot and have a history of having trouble distinguishing between true issues I am having and issues caused by my anxiety.  As of today, 01/15/21, I took Methazine which seems to have helped the dizziness, but not completely.  I am not currently nauseus.

Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0900 on 1/7/21. At around 0300 on 1/8/21, I woke up in the night due to a loud ringing inside my right ear. It was loud enough to keep me awake and the ringing has not stopped, even up until this point. I can still hear out of the right ear, but I cannot hear over the ringing. High pitch noises I can hear amplified, while it is difficult to hear anything else. I can also feel the vibrations in my inner ear during those high noises. I did take 800mg of Ibuprofen before bed and I know that NSAIDS can be associated with Tinnitus but this seems very out of the ordinary for me with no medical history and remarkable health screen.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

Pain is a 9/10 when holding, grabbing, or using the thumb in any way.  When not using the thumb there is no pain at all.   I work out everyday and I am no longer to lift weights using my right hand because of the excruciating pain when I try to.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I felt myself get very flushed and slightly lightheaded.  This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

A 39-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 at single dose for prevention.  Medical history included none. There were no concomitant medications. Caller states, he received the covid vaccine 19Dec2020 and on 25Dec2020 he was experiencing left facial numbness, b/l foot numbness, b/l hand numbness on 26Dec2020, right side burning on 28Dec2020, Today (29Dec2020) he has had left thigh burning, and Left b/l gluteal burning and paresthesia. No motor issues and no tendon issues, all intact. Also had mid back burning on 28Dec2020 that comes and goes. He has heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus and/or with the vaccine and wants more information on that. Curious if anyone has anything similar? and makes mention of possible Gillian Barre Syndrome. States that he has had a potential reaction. He had his dose on 19Dec2020. On 25Dec2020 he developed left facial numbness, then later that day he developed bilateral foot numbness. On 26Dec2020, he developed bilateral hand numbness, on 28Dec2020 he developed right thigh burning, and today (29Dec2020) he has developed left thigh burning, and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia. States that he has been kind of freaking out about it. He doesn&#39;t have any motor issues. States that he heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus, but not with the vaccine, is that true? The left facial numbness resolved on either 26Dec2020 or 27Dec2020. States that the symptoms were concerning because it could have been a stroke. States his symptoms were moderate. States that due to the bilateral foot and hand numbness, he had a LP, brain and spine MRI, and blood work done on 26Dec2020. All came back completely normal. When asked about causality, caller states that it makes the most sense for his symptoms to be caused by the vaccine due to his age and the fact that all his testing was completely normal. Reporter seriousness for left facial numbness, bilateral foot numbness, bilateral hand numbness, right thigh burning, left thigh burning and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia: Medically significant. The outcome of the event left facial numbness was recovered in Dec2020. The outcome of the events guillain barre syndrome, stroke and mid back burning was unknown. The outcome of the other events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship the association between the reported serious adverse events with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient was evaluated at Urgent Care yesterday and sent by the NP. Patient reports three days of rash to the left side of his face with redness and swelling. The patient initially thought the rash was acne due to his face mask. There is intermittent pain to the area which is rated 10/10 severity at its worst. The patient has been unable to sleep the past two days due to the pain. Pain is worse with cold weather and at night with increased clenching of his jaw and grinding of his teeth. He was prescribed Valtrex at Urgent Care and took one dose just PTA to the ED. There is concern given a bump just lateral to the patient&#39;s left eye. The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccination on 01/18/2021 and explains that the Urgent Care provider believes this may be an adverse reaction.
