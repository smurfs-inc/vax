A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient woke up and had  severe acid reflux, trouble breathing for about 15 minutes, couldn&#39;t catch his breath, was wheezing and sounded like an asthma attack.  He felt like something was stuck in his throat. It cleared in 10 seconds and he could breathe and swallow fine.  He took a Benadryl as treatment and drank water.  He also felt tired. The patient further reported that he had the covid vaccine shot. He did not know if he was having a reaction, but he was taking a nap, and he guessed he regurgitated. He had a difficult time catching his breath, it was like it was stuck in the throat. He vomited lying down. He felt the stomach acid come up into mouth after he was able to breath better. But before he was not breathing at all. This never happened before. He was lying flat, he guessed he threw up. He had a large lunch, maybe too large. It was like he was getting something caught in in throat. The patient also reported that his throat was burning and mentioned that he slept on a triangular pillow. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 78-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 (around 11:00 or 11:30 AM) on left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered at a military facility. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. He did not receive other vaccines 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient had his 1st dose on 12Jan2021. He was fine that day, but on the 13Jan2021, he woke up and was dizzy. He stated that he had no problem after having the shot, 15 minutes later, he had no problems; but, the next day he began having vertigo and dizziness. Vertigo and dizziness began 13Jan2021 at about 8:00 AM. This has continued the past 3 days. It is getting better, but he is wondering if that is a big problem. At the time of report, it&#39;s getting better but still have it. He asked if he should be concerned. It is quite a bit improved but it&#39;s still there. If he had to drive a car for an emergency, he thinks he could do it, but he wouldn&#39;t volunteer for that right now. He looked up all that stuff and it says that 20% of the people who take it have that. But when they list the side effects, they don&#39;t list dizziness until they list severe that is the only thing that has concerned him. He was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 09Feb2021, longer than the 3weeks. Outcome of the events was recovering.

On the third day his care giver had woken him up and found that he had wet himself (this has never happened before). He had altered mental status and was not able to recognize any of his family members. He was taken to the emergency room on 2/6/2021 where he had a seizure and found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He is still hospitalized.

(His 2nd is scheduled for 3/3) He started with sx ~13 hrs later - He started drifting out of consciousness, then had labored breathing through night rendering him unable to sleep. After getting up in the morning, his breathing was better but he felt lightheaded/weak through the day. By the next morning (Friday 2/12), he was so bad next morning that wife called 911 - He reports that he was there and then not there and was losing track of train of thought. He was taken to ER via EMS, where his HR was initially 15 - He was admitted to hospital - initially a temporary pacer was placed, then a permanent one on Monday, 2/22. He has had other episodes like this in past 13 mos. PCP referred him to neurologist and EENT. Neurology work-up, including MRI and 72 hr EEG were unremarkable, although he learned retrospectively that there was a time during EEG where HR was only 35. EENT found no auditory or other issues . *MD in ER told him that if issues were not neuro in nature, they were probably cardiac.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report. Outcome of events were reported as unknown.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports, reporting for self. This 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) via unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID virus in Aug2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM and got a reaction around 9 PM. The patient stated a lot of the same symptoms from the COVID virus came back after the vaccine. The first thing was chills, patient took a couple of paracetamol (TYLENOL), and they went away after about a half hour. The patient had a low grade fever 101.9 at 29Jan2021 night to 30Jan2021, and took paracetamol then as well. The patient reported the biggest thing was everything hurt including muscles and head. Patient felt weak, more or less tired with no energy following the vaccination. The symptoms were from 29Jan2021 night until probably 31Jan2021 morning noon, then he started to feel little bit better. The patient hardly miss work, but missed work on 30Jan2021. The patient stated feeling pretty good and pretty much back to normal on 01Feb2021, it did not affect breathing or cough, just fever and feeling lousy. The patient commented that he can relate to COVID because he had had the COVID and for 2 weeks he was like that. He also had the breathing problem with the virus in Aug2020, and he think he had every symptom but did not lose taste or smell. The patient asked if he should take his second dose of vaccine. The outcome of event chills was resolved on 29Jan2021. The outcome of event fever was resolved on 30Jan2021. The outcome of other events was resolving.

                                                heart attack; chest pressure; hardly slept; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife).  An 80-year-old male patient (reported also as 81-years-old, to be clarified) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot # EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 80-years-old. Medical history included ongoing emphysema and ongoing diabetes (caller has been diagnosed for 35 years for both conditions), heart was damaged because of the diabetes, and a history of bypass 4 years ago however he hasn&#39;t had any issues with chest pressure since before the bypass. Concomitant medications were none. On 15Jan2021 at 1:am he developed pressure in the chest which ultimately resolved. This trouble last night, lasted over 1 hour. He couldn&#39;t get back to bed. He had to sleep sitting up on the sofa. That was the only way he was comfortable. Her husband has hardly slept. She was seeing how he was doing. He said he was okay sitting. The pressure on his chest would go away while he was sitting, but laying down it would come back. This morning (15Jan2021) she made him check when he woke up at 8 o&#39;clock. She made him lay down, and he said it was gone after sitting the whole night. He is well now. He is feeling fine. He didn&#39;t even ask for help getting on his clothes. He got the vaccine because of his age and because of underlying conditions. Her husband has done very well this year. He even has underlying conditions. He has had Emphysema for 35 years, but it hasn&#39;t been bothering him. He has also had diabetes for 35 years. The reporter spoke to her husband&#39;s hcp (nurse) who said it could have a heart attack and for him to go to hospital if it reoccurs. She did speak with a nurse with his primary doctor, and she said the pressure in his chest for 1 hour could have been a heart attack. That if it occurs again to give him the nitroglycerin. She told the nurse it wasn&#39;t pain. The reporter stated chest pressure could have been a heart attack. He is scheduled to get the 2nd dose on 21Jan2021. The reporter was wondering if her husband can have the second dose given it has potassium in it (given he has bypass history). The reporter is afraid the vaccine is not safe, and they may not go for the second vaccine. She wants more information if it is safe.  The events recovered on 15Jan2021.

                                                Fever (up to 102 F); headache;  mental confusion; lack of responsive speech or delay in responding to questions.   Symptoms began around 11:30 a.m. on Feb. 21.  Administered one Tylenol at 2:30 p.m. on Feb. 21.  By  6 p.m. on Feb. 21, the fever and headache abated.  But confusion and lack of speech continues to Feb. 22 (10:30 a.m.) as I prepare this report.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

An 81-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246, expiry: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 11:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included retired, he became allergic to penicillin when he was 17 year old and hasn&#39;t taken it since, lost his taste and smell, potassium is high sometimes - the doctor recommend he cut down on banana and potatoes, extra heart beat, stomach acid, and thyroid disorder. Ongoing concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium - has been taking it for a year and a half to two years for thyroid, metoprolol succinate - has been on it about a year and half because an EKG showed he had an extra heart beat, and omeprazole capsule - been on it two or three years for stomach acid. The patient previously took trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy. After having a Pfizer shot on Saturday, he had a reaction - dizziness. His wife also received the COVID vaccine but did not have any reaction. He sat in the office for 15 minutes like he was supposed to. He drove home and was fine. Two hours later he was so dizzy he couldn&#39;t stand up. He was holding onto things to walk through the house. That was two hours after he took the vaccine. After that he thought it would go away in a day. All day yesterday, which was the second day, he was still dizzy. If he laid down the bed would float. It was an awful experience. He received the vaccine at 11:45am on 09Jan2021. Two hours later is when it started. He had to hold onto the rail to get up there. If he gets up quick it is still there. He just had blood work and was due back in Apr for check up. He hasn&#39;t had taste and smell for four years or better. He lost his taste and smell and never got it back. He doesn&#39;t know what caused that. He hasn&#39;t been sick. Outcome of the event dizziness was recovering, for the other events was unknown.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) first dose on 30Dec2020 10:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that I had the vaccine back a week and half ago on 30Dec2020 and was due to get the booster this month and wanted to report severe pain arm for two days. The patient stated that he had many vaccine (Unspecified Vaccine) over the years and have never had anything that hurts so bad after about six hours. The patient just wanted to know that was that normal. Consumer further stated, &#34;I took the vaccine about 10:30 in the morning and about four hours later, it started getting sore but that thing was normal you know some vaccines (Unspecified Vaccine) do that but along with that it started hurting about four hours after the vaccine and it continued to get worse and that night I went to bed and I cannot sleep, it hurts so bad. The patient even have thoughts about getting up and go in to the emergency room. It was the worst pain I have ever had and I could not move my arm. I could not sleep on the right side or on a left side and all I did was take Tylenol as prescribed and that helped a little bit but not much but I did not go to the emergency room, I am not going to do that but I felt like it because it hurts so bad but I made it through the night and next day it continued to hurt really bad. I just keep taking Tylenol every four hours and that continued for two days and then finally I was able to raise my arm up above my head without little pain, it was discomfort, but it was not hurting so bad.&#34; The patient stated that the event started about two hours later it started, it started hurting and then it continued to get worse and worse and it was severe, that is the reason why I am calling that it was severe. I wanted a shot or morphine to relieve myself that how bad it was.&#34; (no clarified further). The patient stated that the vaccine was given in my left arm only about one inch below the top of my shoulder which I think that might have been the problem, I don&#39;t know if you can answer that or not but I have never received the vaccine or shot anywhere near that area, it is always three or four inches down in my muscle, on my arm either on left or right, this was given in my left arm but this was given almost in my joint I am wondering if that would cause pain.&#34; The patient stated it was given only one inch below the tip above shoulder may be that is causing so much pain.&#34; The patient just wanted to report the severe pain, that was for two whole days and then it was subsided and it lasted for four days and I still have uncomfortable feeling in my arm. I was finally able to raise it above my head, my left arm, after two days but it was not comfortable to do it, it was painful.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

But right now, my feet are numb and cold.&#34; For the laboratory test the patient stated that, &#34;Yes they did a lab test on me yesterday (02Mar2021) as I went to the emergency room with some heart problems.

Now (Feb2021), when he gets up, his back is giving him trouble, and he can&#39;t stand up long because of the weakness. His body also seemed to want to walk backward on his heels when he stands up and he is wanting to fall (Feb2021). The patient has been taking his dog out every morning, but it is hard to do that now because he can&#39;t stand up that well (Feb2021). Therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the event congestion in his chest. Outcome of the event real deep coughing was not recovered while outcome of all the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                No adverse effects for the first two weeks.  The morning of 2/7/21 he claimed he was not able to sleep the night before.  He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

He was changing his ostomy pad again on 04Feb2021 and it started bleeding so much that he went to the hospital. He was discharged within a few hours because &#34;they couldn&#39;t find anything wrong.&#34; He has had colitis for years and has an ileostomy, where they take out a bunch of his colon.  This week he has had some funny bleeding in his ileostomy.  It was spurting out blood.  He had to go to the ER on 4Feb2021 night because it was bleeding and then it stops. People in ER did not know what the bleeding was from.  He was bleeding in the ileostomy on 04Feb2021 and 05Feb2021.

Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.  He had another episode of lethargy/unresponsiveness on 2/26/2021 and was once again sent to the hospital where they did not show any new findings.  He spent a few days in the hospital before returning to his facility where he continued to have periodic episodes of increased lethargy/confusion and decreased eating.  He was placed on Hospice and passed away on March 29th.
