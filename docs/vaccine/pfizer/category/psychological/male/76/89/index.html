                                                I felt great after my vaccine until midnight that same day.  My legs from the knees down including my feet were painfully cold as if they were on dry ice.  I didn&#39;t get much sleep that night, but the next morning at 2:00 a.m. the pain was gone.  I was just extremely fatigued which was a symptom I expected.  I don&#39;t know what to think of the first symptom but wanted you to know.  Thank you.

Next morning 3/25, woke up and tried to get out of bed.  Legs were so weak they gave out and I fell out of bed on the floor.   I had no strength to get back up to get on the bed.  My wife could not lift me, so she called 911 for a &#34;lift assist&#34;.  Paramedics were told I received the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine the day before, so they picked me up off of the floor and put me back in bed.  They took my vitals - blood pressure was 116/73 and temperature was still 102.6.  Paramedics offered to take me to the hospital but I refused.  Paramedics told my wife that if my breathing became labored, she should get me to the ER or call 911 again.    I was not able to get out of bed the whole day on Thursday 3/25, because I was so weak I could not stand up, and I also had body aches and had to use a urinal because I could not walk to the bathroom.  My wife gave me Tylenol and the fever finally broke late evening of Thursday 3/25 and I started to feel a little bit better.  I had not eaten all day, but my wife made sure I stayed hydrated with water.  On Friday morning 3/26 I was able to sit up on the side of the bed, and I was able to walk with the assistance of a cane to the bathroom.  Extreme fatigue affected me all day Friday, but I did feel better.  Fever did not come back after it broke.  Saturday 3/27 - still experiencing extreme fatigue, but feel better overall.

After that had 1 hour of uncontolled severe shaking and shivering . Next day felt fine.  Afew days started noticing LOW FREQUENCY INTERMITTANT TINNITUS THAT IS A HUM, BUT ONLY IF I AM AROUND HIGH VOLTAGE POWER TRANSMISSION LINES AND POWER TRANSFORMERS .  HEAR IT IN MY HOME  WHICH IS 1000 FEET FROM HIGH VOLTAGE LINES 24/7 SINCE DAY 2-4 OF DOSE #1.  Can hear it in other enclosed areas, but doesn&#39;t seem to happen AS MUCH outdoors, although if I am within 1000 feet of high voltage lines I will hear it UNLESS  there are many trees to block the EMF&#39;s or HUM between me and the source.  SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT IS TRUE  FOR PAST 3 MONTHS 24/7 AND HAS RUINED MY LIFE BECAUSE I CANNOT SLEEP AND SLEEPING PILLS DON&#39;T WORK.   HAS DISRUPTED MY SLEEP CENTER SOMEHOW.  ALL OF THIS IS SINCE FIRST COIVD19 SHOT !  HAVE HAD #2 SHOT AND WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER !

I woke up around 3am violently panting and trying to get his breath.  After what could have been a minute or many minutes, I started breathing normally.  My Friday night sleep was terrible.  I woke with a temperature around 101.  After taking Acetaminophen, my temperature went back to normal. Towards evening my temperature went up to about 101 and I was achy all day.  Saturday evening was a good evening and I woke up feeling fine on Sunday.

He went to the hospital with his wife on 3/1/2021.  He stated &#34;I think I&#39;m going to die&#34;.  Patient had been off Cymbalta  for 3 days completely- treating neuropathy (previous daily medication that his primary physician advised him with weaning down the dose).  The patient was manic and had tangential thoughts- from crying/angry to laughter.  It is believed that the agitation could be due to medication withdraw.

A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient woke up and had  severe acid reflux, trouble breathing for about 15 minutes, couldn&#39;t catch his breath, was wheezing and sounded like an asthma attack.  He felt like something was stuck in his throat. It cleared in 10 seconds and he could breathe and swallow fine.  He took a Benadryl as treatment and drank water.  He also felt tired. The patient further reported that he had the covid vaccine shot. He did not know if he was having a reaction, but he was taking a nap, and he guessed he regurgitated. He had a difficult time catching his breath, it was like it was stuck in the throat. He vomited lying down. He felt the stomach acid come up into mouth after he was able to breath better. But before he was not breathing at all. This never happened before. He was lying flat, he guessed he threw up. He had a large lunch, maybe too large. It was like he was getting something caught in in throat. The patient also reported that his throat was burning and mentioned that he slept on a triangular pillow. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

By mid-afternoon had to go to bed and slept for hours. Got up at 9PM and went back to bed at 11PM. Sunday was better, but this AM (Monday) awakened with itchy skin, pins and needles on hands and feet (gone now) and total exhaustion. Had difficulty breathing (better now), can barely lift arms and had to miss work and went back to bed. I am reporting this because I am scheduled for a 2nd shot on the 26th and not certain it&#39;s a good idea.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 19Feb2021 08:40 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications including blood thinner and Afib medications. The patient takes 6 medications: some of those medications for 40 years, some for a bit less. There were a couple more added for his heart because 10 years ago he had a case of Afib and the doctor who has now retired took him from 3 meds to 6; and has had no issues for the last 10 years. The patient had his first dose on 19Feb2021 at a clinic and was due/scheduled for his second on 12Mar2021. The patient had severe reactions to the first one so he wanted to know if he should accelerate second shot or stay within three weeks. His reaction was for the first two weeks, he had severe nausea, etcetera, which was getting better that week. He gives 20-minute presentations each morning and the participants in the presentation were nice about it but they say that the patient has fog and thought he should see if he should go in sooner as they were worried about him. His only symptoms remaining after two weeks of severe reactions was that he was very sleepy. All that was left was being tired and mentally in a bit of fog (also reported as mental fog). The patient only had pain to the injection site for a day and was not an issue, then it didn&#39;t take long for him to start getting extremely tired and have nausea. He says all he knows was that from the sheet listing severe reactions, he had every one during the first couple weeks (unspecified), though he never had a fever. He says this week he felt better and he was starting to eat, this was not normal for him to be tired all the time, but at least he was not sick. He says he didn&#39;t treat the pain or nausea, because he was healthy as a horse, and has no problems with a vaccine, shots don&#39;t bother him other than having soreness the first day. The patient was just foggy and tired. The patient was recovering from nausea. The patient recovered from injection site pain on 20Feb2021. The patient has not recovered from mental fog/bit of fog and tired. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report. Outcome of events were reported as unknown.

That afternoon began complaining of abdominal pain with subsequent vomiting (x2) and possible diarrhea. Patient could not sleep that evening . Awoke next morning with continued abdominal pain throughout the day and ultimately was found unresponsive in bed. Transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Subsequently autopsy was performed which revealed significant pre-existing hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with evidence of acute myocardial infarction. There is no clear evidence that this is related to the vaccination, however it is being reported due to potential public health interest and temporal proximity to vaccination.

                                                On March 2, he woke up feeling bad and had a fever of 102.7. He took tylenol and liquids all day and the fever came down to around 100. The next morning he woke up complaining of excruciating pain in his left arm (site of the injection). He couldn&#39;t stand to have anything touch it, couldn&#39;t move it and couldn&#39;t sleep because of the pain. The next morning he woke up very weak, wasn&#39;t able to speak clearly, wasn&#39;t making sense. He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn&#39;t do it at that hospital.  He was transferred to another hospital.  The doctors at that hospital determined the pacemaker was not the source.  It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.  He lived another 2 weeks but never was able to recover. Until the day he was put on paliative care, he expressed pain in the arm where he had received the vaccination. He died at 5:30 a.m. on April 1, 2021.

                                                After duing light work on Saturday morning. I sat down for a few minutes and felt a little light headed.  My stomach became quisy and I had to go into the bathroom, became nauseated and had to vomit. I had a quisy stomach most of the balance of the day.  I experiecnced a restless night. However, by mid-morning  Sunday I began to feel better and have had no additonal inegative effect.  The only other  unexplained  item was that on Sunday I checked my blood presure and it was 154/ 85. This is very unusual,  as due to the nifedipine I take for my DES, my average for years is around 125/80.  Today, Tuesday, I checked it again and it still  at 158/87.  I have an appointment with my cardiologist  in 2 weeks and will discuss this with him.

                                                Initially mild pain and tenderness Left arm shoulder muscle. On third day after second vaccination,  should symptoms gone but I started to develop diffuse myalgias.  By 4th day, began having problems with my memory. I could not figure out some instructions on a computer program. I had some trouble recognizing a common object in my hand.  Then mild ataxia.  Excessive sleepiness in 2-3 hour intervals.  On 8th day, developed  abdominal pain similar to diverticulitis. And became very constipated. I had forgotten to take the Parnate and missed two doses. I had forgotten to take Metamucil and Miralax. these led to the constipation and abdominal pain.  On advice of psychopharmacologist, I resumed Parnate  and started to feel better.  I resumed laxatives and good effect. Abdominal symptoms abated in two additional days.  I had gone to ER  but seen only informally by my medical friends. After 3 hour, and getting better, I left.   Blood tests were normal.  No exam.   Since 02/27/2021, I have felt perfectly normal.   Recovered.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports, reporting for self. This 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) via unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID virus in Aug2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM and got a reaction around 9 PM. The patient stated a lot of the same symptoms from the COVID virus came back after the vaccine. The first thing was chills, patient took a couple of paracetamol (TYLENOL), and they went away after about a half hour. The patient had a low grade fever 101.9 at 29Jan2021 night to 30Jan2021, and took paracetamol then as well. The patient reported the biggest thing was everything hurt including muscles and head. Patient felt weak, more or less tired with no energy following the vaccination. The symptoms were from 29Jan2021 night until probably 31Jan2021 morning noon, then he started to feel little bit better. The patient hardly miss work, but missed work on 30Jan2021. The patient stated feeling pretty good and pretty much back to normal on 01Feb2021, it did not affect breathing or cough, just fever and feeling lousy. The patient commented that he can relate to COVID because he had had the COVID and for 2 weeks he was like that. He also had the breathing problem with the virus in Aug2020, and he think he had every symptom but did not lose taste or smell. The patient asked if he should take his second dose of vaccine. The outcome of event chills was resolved on 29Jan2021. The outcome of event fever was resolved on 30Jan2021. The outcome of other events was resolving.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. ; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021148753 same reporter/drug/events, different patients

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, dose 2, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostate cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and major radial prostatectomy from 04Feb2021 to an unknown date. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced chills, low grade fever and fatigue. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of BNT162B2. The patient was fine, had no problems until 15Mar20201 (4 days afterwards), the patient stated, &#34;I started getting chills, shaking uncontrollably , nausea, fatigue, a little bit of everything. I wouldn&#39;t be calling you but this has not subsided. It&#39;s been 3 weeks now and I&#39;m not feeling well. It ebbs and tides. I&#39;ve been taking a diary. I went to the ER last Monday because I was wheezing in the morning and had shortness of breathe in between all the other symptoms. They did all kind of blood tests, covid test which was negative, chest x-ray showed bronchitis. Blood work and ultrasound of my bladder with unknown results. They sent me home with a inhaler, steroid and an antibiotic and every day since then it seems like at night 9, or 10 o&#39;clock I start feeling better and sleep through the night. My fever is 97.7 degrees fahrenheit but about 2, 3 or 4 o&#39;clock my fever ticks up a little and I start to feel lousy, my stomach feels. I feel like I have hot flashes; a feeling of warmth with achiness and lack of appetite. So I take my Tylenol 7 or 8 o&#39;clock at night my temperature is 97.7F. I haven&#39;t had 1 good day since. I&#39;ve been to my doctor, ER, I&#39;ve talked with the CDC. What information do you have for people who have had long term symptoms/side effects? What am I supposed to do? Someone from Pfizer needs to give me advice. If not I&#39;ll go to  the news network. I don&#39;t feel well. It&#39;s directly related. No one has given me relief or help. It&#39;s impacting my life. I&#39;ve been sick every day.  Is there someone above you who can tell me what to do? I took their (Pfizer&#39;s) vaccine that was recommended. It was your vaccine. Not mine. Someone has to have an answer for me. Unless you want to go and have lawsuit and the news. Just think about it, if you had to go through the symptoms of having the flu everyday. Please relay this to someone. If I don&#39;t heard back within a week, then I&#39;m going ballistic. It&#39;s not going to be pretty. Someone has to get back to me to help. I want someone to tell me that I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m not the only experiencing this. There has to be an answer. I took your vaccine. You are responsible. I want to know. I can&#39;t be the only one in the whole world who is feeling like this. I&#39;ve been to the ER and the doctors. I&#39;ve had every side effects but theirs go away in a few days, but mine hasn&#39;t. I need advice, that I&#39;m not nuts, something that will help me get better. I want to feel better. It&#39;s effecting my family my life. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd? I can&#39;t be the only one? Someone has to know something. They (drug companies) like to hide the facts. I am sick because I took BNT162B2 vaccine. I need someone to get back to me.&#34; After the second dose of BNT162B2, the patient has been experiencing an achy feeling, heat throughout the body, shivering, shaking, trouble walking, and some fever. He reports taking Tylenol, and that helps, but he is still having symptoms that come and go and it has been 3 weeks since the second injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. He reports going to the ER for treatment after the second injection, and a COVID-19 test was negative and they did not find anything else other than the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine that would be causing his symptoms.

The events were described, &#34;Fever: It is not as steady, when it ticks up, it is never going past 100F, it&#39;s been like 98 and 99, that&#39;s when he starts to feeling so  bad.

                                                heart attack; chest pressure; hardly slept; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife).  An 80-year-old male patient (reported also as 81-years-old, to be clarified) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot # EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 80-years-old. Medical history included ongoing emphysema and ongoing diabetes (caller has been diagnosed for 35 years for both conditions), heart was damaged because of the diabetes, and a history of bypass 4 years ago however he hasn&#39;t had any issues with chest pressure since before the bypass. Concomitant medications were none. On 15Jan2021 at 1:am he developed pressure in the chest which ultimately resolved. This trouble last night, lasted over 1 hour. He couldn&#39;t get back to bed. He had to sleep sitting up on the sofa. That was the only way he was comfortable. Her husband has hardly slept. She was seeing how he was doing. He said he was okay sitting. The pressure on his chest would go away while he was sitting, but laying down it would come back. This morning (15Jan2021) she made him check when he woke up at 8 o&#39;clock. She made him lay down, and he said it was gone after sitting the whole night. He is well now. He is feeling fine. He didn&#39;t even ask for help getting on his clothes. He got the vaccine because of his age and because of underlying conditions. Her husband has done very well this year. He even has underlying conditions. He has had Emphysema for 35 years, but it hasn&#39;t been bothering him. He has also had diabetes for 35 years. The reporter spoke to her husband&#39;s hcp (nurse) who said it could have a heart attack and for him to go to hospital if it reoccurs. She did speak with a nurse with his primary doctor, and she said the pressure in his chest for 1 hour could have been a heart attack. That if it occurs again to give him the nitroglycerin. She told the nurse it wasn&#39;t pain. The reporter stated chest pressure could have been a heart attack. He is scheduled to get the 2nd dose on 21Jan2021. The reporter was wondering if her husband can have the second dose given it has potassium in it (given he has bypass history). The reporter is afraid the vaccine is not safe, and they may not go for the second vaccine. She wants more information if it is safe.  The events recovered on 15Jan2021.

                                                Fever (up to 102 F); headache;  mental confusion; lack of responsive speech or delay in responding to questions.   Symptoms began around 11:30 a.m. on Feb. 21.  Administered one Tylenol at 2:30 p.m. on Feb. 21.  By  6 p.m. on Feb. 21, the fever and headache abated.  But confusion and lack of speech continues to Feb. 22 (10:30 a.m.) as I prepare this report.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

By 3/1, I also had thigh and buttock ache with effort and left TMJ pain. On 3/2, I saw Dr. My sed rate was 24. She made a diagnosis of probable PMR and prescribed prednisone. After I single dose, my symptoms almost magically abated and I was almost normal. On 3/11, the only residual symptom with soreness with with extreme neck rotation. On clinical grounds, this confirms the diagnosis of PMR. I assume treatment will continue for several weeks.

An 81-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246, expiry: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 11:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included retired, he became allergic to penicillin when he was 17 year old and hasn&#39;t taken it since, lost his taste and smell, potassium is high sometimes - the doctor recommend he cut down on banana and potatoes, extra heart beat, stomach acid, and thyroid disorder. Ongoing concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium - has been taking it for a year and a half to two years for thyroid, metoprolol succinate - has been on it about a year and half because an EKG showed he had an extra heart beat, and omeprazole capsule - been on it two or three years for stomach acid. The patient previously took trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy. After having a Pfizer shot on Saturday, he had a reaction - dizziness. His wife also received the COVID vaccine but did not have any reaction. He sat in the office for 15 minutes like he was supposed to. He drove home and was fine. Two hours later he was so dizzy he couldn&#39;t stand up. He was holding onto things to walk through the house. That was two hours after he took the vaccine. After that he thought it would go away in a day. All day yesterday, which was the second day, he was still dizzy. If he laid down the bed would float. It was an awful experience. He received the vaccine at 11:45am on 09Jan2021. Two hours later is when it started. He had to hold onto the rail to get up there. If he gets up quick it is still there. He just had blood work and was due back in Apr for check up. He hasn&#39;t had taste and smell for four years or better. He lost his taste and smell and never got it back. He doesn&#39;t know what caused that. He hasn&#39;t been sick. Outcome of the event dizziness was recovering, for the other events was unknown.

                                                I have had tinnitus for a very long time, but it became extremely loud the second day after vaccination.  I believe it has to do with the vaccine since I have never experienced tinnitus this severe before.  In addition, I started experiencing anxiety all during the day and had a severe panic attack before bedtime.  If it doesn&#39;t subside, I will need to find a doctor for this condition.  It is no better today, Jan. 31, 2021.

I was not able to go back to sleep.  I realized it was Tendinitis, as I have had systems of Tendinitis, over the years, but it just came and went, and was not loud enough or lasted long enough to be anything but a minor annoyance .   In this case while it is not loud, it is loud enough to be annoying, and it still did not go away. (time is now -01:13 PM 2/16, I am hoping it is just the vaccine working its way through my system.   I notified my primary care doctor at the VA, as well as audio dept.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) first dose on 30Dec2020 10:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that I had the vaccine back a week and half ago on 30Dec2020 and was due to get the booster this month and wanted to report severe pain arm for two days. The patient stated that he had many vaccine (Unspecified Vaccine) over the years and have never had anything that hurts so bad after about six hours. The patient just wanted to know that was that normal. Consumer further stated, &#34;I took the vaccine about 10:30 in the morning and about four hours later, it started getting sore but that thing was normal you know some vaccines (Unspecified Vaccine) do that but along with that it started hurting about four hours after the vaccine and it continued to get worse and that night I went to bed and I cannot sleep, it hurts so bad. The patient even have thoughts about getting up and go in to the emergency room. It was the worst pain I have ever had and I could not move my arm. I could not sleep on the right side or on a left side and all I did was take Tylenol as prescribed and that helped a little bit but not much but I did not go to the emergency room, I am not going to do that but I felt like it because it hurts so bad but I made it through the night and next day it continued to hurt really bad. I just keep taking Tylenol every four hours and that continued for two days and then finally I was able to raise my arm up above my head without little pain, it was discomfort, but it was not hurting so bad.&#34; The patient stated that the event started about two hours later it started, it started hurting and then it continued to get worse and worse and it was severe, that is the reason why I am calling that it was severe. I wanted a shot or morphine to relieve myself that how bad it was.&#34; (no clarified further). The patient stated that the vaccine was given in my left arm only about one inch below the top of my shoulder which I think that might have been the problem, I don&#39;t know if you can answer that or not but I have never received the vaccine or shot anywhere near that area, it is always three or four inches down in my muscle, on my arm either on left or right, this was given in my left arm but this was given almost in my joint I am wondering if that would cause pain.&#34; The patient stated it was given only one inch below the tip above shoulder may be that is causing so much pain.&#34; The patient just wanted to report the severe pain, that was for two whole days and then it was subsided and it lasted for four days and I still have uncomfortable feeling in my arm. I was finally able to raise it above my head, my left arm, after two days but it was not comfortable to do it, it was painful.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 82-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient also started to receive mirtazapine (MIRTAZAPINE, 50 mg, Capsule, soft), via an unspecified route of administration, from an unspecified date at 50 mg, once a day for sleep. Medical history included sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], calcium, escitalopram, finasteride, lamotrigine, simvastatin, tamsulosin. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported receiving the Pfizer vaccine in his right arm on 06Feb2021. That evening he took his nightly medication and went to bed at 11:30 pm. He stated he wasn&#39;t able to sleep because he felt like he was in a refrigerator and he was shaking. He had lower back pain, right arm/shoulder pain, and went to the bathroom 5 times (all on an unspecified date in Feb2021), which was not normal for him. The patient added that it was the second dosage of the Pfizer (Covid-19 Vaccine) her received on 06Feb2021. And he had some negative response: a little pain in his shoulder but the worst thing that happened, he went to bed 11:30 did not sleep at all. At 11:30 night, he took his medication (Mirtazapine) and went to bed. He was shaking and he had to put another blanket on himself. Eventually, it was okay, but the problem is he was not able to sleep all night, from 11:30 to 9&#39; O clock this morning (07Feb2021). Consumer stated, &#34;Yesterday my wife and I had the second dose of the Pfizer and I had really strange reaction and I will tell you what it was. Last night at about 11:30 I took my night medicine (later clarified as Mirtazapine), I went to bedroom, I started shaking all over. And the worst part is from 11:30 to 10 o&#39; clock this morning, I was not able to sleep. There is slight pain in my shoulder&#34;. When confirmed if the consumer wanted to report the same or have any questions, consumer stated, &#34;No, we have no problem with temperature is fine, the oxygen is fine. Just I don&#39;t understand why in fact the medication (mirtazapine) is to induce sleeping, use to for sleep within half hour but it didn&#39;t help. I wanted to know what happened. So, this will eventually go away?&#34; The action taken in response to the events for mirtazapine was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on batch number has been requested.

Saying and seeing things that was not there; This is a spontaneous report a contactable consumer (wife).  An 82 years old male patient (Height: 170 cm and Weight: 66.68 kg) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot Number: EN6201) intramuscularly, in the right arm, at single dose, on 13Feb2021 at 10:20, for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included high cholesterol, high triglycerides and high blood pressure, all from an unspecified date, all diagnosed at least 10 or 15 years and acid reflux (esophageal), from an unspecified date. The patient previously, on 19Jan2021, received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot Number: EL3249) at single dose, in the left arm, for COVID-19 immunization. After the first dose, the patient experienced shaking (&#34;the patient was a little shaky following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021, but it was nothing major&#34;) and was nervous (&#34;the wife reported that when it was time to get the second dose on 13Feb2021, the patient was so nervous to get the shot that he was too nervous to drive&#34;). Concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, once daily, in the morning, from an unspecified date to Apr2021, for high blood pressure; eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (VASCEPA) 1 mg, twice daily, from an unspecified date to Apr2021, for blood triglycerides; atorvastatin 40 mg, once daily, from an unspecified date to Apr2021, for blood cholesterol; omeprazole from an unspecified date, for an unknown indication; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D (colecalciferol)) from an unspecified date, for an unknown indication and an unspecified multi vitamins. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced altered mental status, illusion (&#34;patient meant he saw things, he talked to people and he was terrible. He was saying people called to him. He wanted to go outside; vision illusions like people were calling him to come outside&#34;), depression, shaking and he was feeling abnormal (&#34;he went berserk. He was just crazy. Said and saw things that was not there. Patient was hearing people calling him to go outside&#34;). The patient might have Alzheimer&#39;s. Patient&#39;s wife reported that the physician stated that the Covid-19 vaccine might have jump started Alzheimer&#39;s. Treatment was received. Patient was prescribed donepezil, ondansetron, quetiapine, escitalopram, trazodone, and sertraline after he went berserk to help with altered mental status. None of the medications worked. Patient also received risperidone. Patient&#39;s wife reported that even with the risperidone, the patient was not his complete self like he was before he received the Covid-19 vaccine. Risperidone helped some. Relevant laboratory tests, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included: computerised tomogram head (CT brain scan) normal, lumbar puncture (Spinal tap) normal, and magnetic resonance imaging head (MRI brain) normal. Clinical outcome of the events was unknown at time of this report.

So, I presume this is all connected to the second shot I got.&#34; It was added by the patient, &#34;I am asking question. About an hour or less than an hour ago I woke up, and my whole body felt like it was itching. I mean my whole body was just feeling funny. I was itching all over, that went away, I took a pill a while ago for that. &#39;Lorazepam&#39; (not confirmed over the call), it&#39;s a nerve, anxiety pill and it kind of helped. But right now, my feet are numb and cold.&#34; For the laboratory test the patient stated that, &#34;Yes they did a lab test on me yesterday (02Mar2021) as I went to the emergency room with some heart problems. They did blood work, that&#39;s all they did.&#34; The patient reported for the results, &#34;They said everything was fine.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient explained that &#34;No, I didn&#39;t take any medication for that.&#34; However treatment was received for Whole body felt like itching, whole body was just feeling funny.

The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                brain has slowed down; starting to lose his memory/memory loss; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot nubmer: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included heart valve replacement on an unknown date. The patient stated that he was taking concomitant medications (unspecified) but nothing out of the ordinary. It was reported that on 31Jan2021, Sunday afternoon, he noticed that he was starting to lose his memory. He said he suddenly forgot his age and had to ask his wife about it. He said he has consulted his doctor about this already, but still wants to give Pfizer a call to ask for advice on what to do. He also said he wants to go on record that he&#39;s having this kind of experience after receiving the vaccine. He said he has serious memory loss. It was bad Sunday afternoon and Monday morning but Monday afternoon it got better. The day before the report it was better but on the day of the report it is bad again. He went to see doctor regarding this; he hopes he doesn&#39;t lose his memory. He stated that on 01Feb2021 his brain has slowed down; his memory is gone. He went to see his primary care doctor, on 02Feb2021 he went to see another doctor, a brain doctor. He did a sleep test on 04Feb2021 with unknown results.  The patient stated that he is still struggling with it. He has seen his doctor and is working on it but wanted to let Pfizer know about this and would like us to know the conditions and if Pfizer would have any information on this happening. The patient had blood tests and an MRI done on an unspecified date in 2021 with unknown results. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the events is not recovered.

I could not sleep much on March 8 evening. The pain persisted all day Tuesday March 9, 2021.  I called my ortho doctor and made a morning appointment for March 10, 2021 at 8:15am. I did not sleep much on evening of March 9. On Wednesday March 10 I went to the doctor. On this morning, the upper back muscles were OK, and the pain and spasms wer now in the neck. I could hardly move my head up or down and left and right. Dr. perscribed Methylprednazolone (4mg, 6-5-4-3-2-1 doses) and cyclobenzaprine 5mg (3x daily).  after 1 day and 1 dose, I feel I can movemy head a little farther without the stabbing pain.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and reported that he had no problems with the first dose. The patient experienced severe left arm pain at the arm where the shot was given on 08Mar2021, the night after he received his second COVID vaccine dose. He almost called a number because he thought he was having a heart attack. What he did was he got up to walk around and the pain went away and when he sat down on his recliner, the pain came back so he didn&#39;t get much sleep that night. He was fine the next day. The patient took an ASPIRIN 325 mg coated pill because he thought he might be having a heart attack. If he had known, he would have taken the vaccine on his right arm. His arm hurt the night of 08Mar2021 until 6:00 AM the following day. The patient then stated that his recommendation was to tell the people who are administering the shot that a left arm pain may possibly occur because anybody who has the left arm hurting is afraid and can think they have a heart attack. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 09Mar2021 at 06:00 AM, and recovered on 09Mar2021 for all other events.

An 87-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 in left upper arm shoulder area at single dose for  vaccination; glimepiride (manufacturer unknown), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 2 mg, 1x/day (once per day in the morning) for diabetes; vitamin d (manufacturer unknown, lot# 300015, expiration date:  Jan2022), via an unspecified route of administration from 2019 and ongoing at 3000 iU, daily (2000 IUs in the morning and 1000 IUs nightly) for bone and immune health; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN, lot# P139558, expiration date:  Aug2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 81 mg, 1x/day for helping thin his blood; apixaban (ELIQUIS, 2.5 mg), via an unspecified route of administration from 2018 and ongoing at 2.5 mg, 2x/day (morning and night) for blood thinner; simvastatin (ZOCOR, 20 mg), orally from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, 1x/day for cholesterol; metoprolol (manufacturer unknown, 50 mg), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 25 mg, daily (1/2 tablet once daily (25mg total daily dose)) for an unspecified indication; celecoxib (CELEXA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at unknown dose with daily (1-20 mg tablet once daily) for clinical depression; vitamin c (manufacturer unknown, lot# 205348, expiration date: Jun2023), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 1 DF, daily for supplement to boost immunity; famotidine (manufacturer unknown), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at unknown dose with 2x/day (1-40mg tablet twice daily) for nauseated; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12, 2500 mg, lot# 511333-01, expiration date: Jun2023),  via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 2500 mg, 1x/day for supplement; magnesium (manufacturer unknown, lot# 205340, expiration date:  Jun2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at unknown dose with daily (400 mg mostly every day but not strictly every day) to keep himself going; immuneti (manufacturer unknown, Capsule, NDC: 2817636726), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 capsule taken daily  for an unspecified indication. Medical history included bad hearing problem. This consumer called on behalf of her husband to ask about possible side effects he was having. She reported that these possible side effects could be from Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine or his other medications: glimepiride; Vitamin D; acetylsalicylic acid; apixaban; simvastatin; metoprolol; celecoxib; Vitamin C; famotidine; Vitamin B12; magnesium; and Immuneti. She was concerned about the possible side effects and wanted to ask Pfizer if these possible side effects could be from the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine or his other medications. Caller&#39;s husband was administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 15Jan2021. Caller also got her Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 15Jan2021. Neither patient or caller had any problems with the product initially. Then her husband had onset of possible side effects last night. Starting 17Jan2021 after patient took his usual night medications, which caller was unable to clearly define which of the other suspect products that included, patient began to feel real bad. He said he smelled some kind of chemical and caller said she did not smell anything. Patient got to feeling worse and worse and they stayed up fairly late to see if he got to feeling better. When he got up this morning: 18Jan2021, he was feeling some better. He came in the room and when he put his medications in his mouth, before he even got them swallowed, he began to feel bad again-caller was unable to clearly define which of the other suspect products that included. Patient had been on simvastatin a long time and one time they took him off of this and started it back; he had been back on this for about 1 year. Metoprolol was discarded after 10th and 9th of 2021, documented as provided by reporter. Patient started it maybe 2-3 years ago. Vitamin C was Over the counter product, start date was probably 6-8 months ago. Vitamin B12 was probably started about 6-8 months ago. Magnesium was Over the counter product and probably started about 6-8 months ago. Caller verified that there are no other relevant products/medical conditions to provide for this report. She mentioned separately that patient had a bad hearing problem so caller handled his calls for him. The action taken in response to the events for all drugs (except for bnt162b2) was dose not changed. Outcome of events were unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch has been requested.

He said this symptom started several days after receiving the vaccine at an outside location.  Symptoms gradually worsened over the last few days until his hand became so swollen that it became difficult to make a fist and is impairing his activities of daily living.  Reaction seems to be localized to the hand and patient reports no other symptoms.

Hospital Course:   COVID-19 pneumonia.  The patient was treated with convalescent plasma and IV remdesivir and completed the course.  He was treated initially with IV Decadron which has been transitioned to oral tablets for discharge to complete a 10-day course.   Chronic systolic heart failure.  Coronary artery disease.  Orthostatic hypotension in the setting of chronic hypertension.  The patient does have chronic systolic heart failure with an EF around 20% and is followed closely at the heart failure clinic.  He is chronically prescribed Lasix at 80 mg twice daily, however he did have some episodes of orthostatic hypotension during his hospitalization and has been unable to tolerate other guideline directed medical therapy due to his hypotension.  He is euvolemic at this time.  I have decreased his Lasix dosing to 40 mg twice daily to restart tomorrow morning.  His last dose of the 80 mg of Lasix was yesterday morning.  I do feel that in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased oral intake that he is more at risk for continued hypotension and dehydration aggressive diuresis.  He will remain on aspirin, Plavix, and simvastatin.   Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His last hemoglobin A1c showed good control at 6.3 on 3/3/2021.  His glipizide was held while inpatient.  He was on long-acting Lantus insulin 10 units with stable blood sugars in the hospital.  He was also on correctional lispro insulin.  His glipizide will be resumed upon discharge.

                                                Upon leaving the site my husband had great difficulty walking. Upon arrival home he seemed unusually confused and over the course of the next 15 hrs had bouts of incontinence. He was up 6 times during the night (usually only 1-2x) and unable to get himself out of bed without assistance. Walking continued to be very unsteady. I thought perhaps he had a mini-stroke. I relayed this to his PCP but he didn&#39;t think it was vaccine related

An 88-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER9231), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high, diabetic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he had started no new medications and not had any other recent vaccinations. He took a lot of medications for a lot of things. He was diabetic, had high blood pressure, COPD, a variety of things get over the years, he took medication for these things. He was affected by medications more than most people. No further details provided about his medications. He reacted to medications in general and that because of that he usually took lower dosages. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After 2 weeks from the vaccine. Have weakness and stomach pains and diarrhea. The patient had been artificially sick like 4-5 days since 21Jan2021, and had a test done and it didn&#39;t show up. He said he hadn&#39;t been anywhere to get the virus. He said he didn&#39;t have any fever, his oxygen level hadn&#39;t changed, he had a testing kit with thermometers, so he knew he never had a fever, but he got chills. He got all the symptoms, the stomach problems, diarrhea, back problems, overall weakness and low energy. He was fine two weeks before this, this started almost two weeks to the day and minute from when he went and got the shot. When he got the shot he had nothing, he waited 15-20 minutes with no problems, his arm was hurting for a couple days, but there was nothing else. Two weeks later he got basically an artificial case and the corona virus test said no, clarified to being negative, but he said it didn&#39;t go away, it had been from Thursday to Monday, so 5 days. The big problem was he was supposed to get his second shot Friday, and he had an appointment Wednesday, he would like to ask them too, but he would like to know was it dangerous for him to get the second shot. He didn&#39;t think he can get any sicker. He did not do a report online, he tried to get onto the website but nothing told him how to do it or whatever, so he stayed on the line waiting to talk to someone. Height: he was five feet and nine and three quarters inches tall, he had shrunk with age, everyone got smaller. His arm was not sore for very much, he didn&#39;t remember how long, he got sick two weeks later, and now he was really not well, though he was better than he was on Thursday or Friday, though he was not 100% yet. He would like to know if he should get the second shot, because he was too old to die from a corona virus shot. Investigations: He didn&#39;t know which COVID test they used, they did an instant test with results in an hour. The patient inquiry if he should get the second shot since he had had this artificial sickness for 5-7 days, two weeks after getting the vaccine. He had &#34;sore arm for a couple of days&#34; after the 1st injection, but &#34;nothing more&#34;. However, in the last 4-5 days, he&#39;s been feeling &#34;miserable&#34;. He didn&#39;t have fever. But he&#39;s been experiencing aching, diarrhea, upset stomach, lost weights and nasal drip. He tested negative to the COVID virus. He has a doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled this Wednesday. The outcome of events was unknown.

This week he has had some funny bleeding in his ileostomy.  It was spurting out blood.  He had to go to the ER on 4Feb2021 night because it was bleeding and then it stops. People in ER did not know what the bleeding was from.  He was bleeding in the ileostomy on 04Feb2021 and 05Feb2021.

                                                My father was given his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Feb. 13, 2021.  He went downhill the following week.  He fell 9 times and was very confused.  He was taken to the hospital on Feb. 20 and admitted that day.  He spent a week there.  His condition continued to deteriorate.  He was totally bedridden for a week.  His mental status deteriorated.  By Feb. 22, he was unable to talk, he drooled, and had to be fed.  He made  slow improvement later in the week.  We were never given any reason for his condition.  There was no infection, no stroke, etc.  He was discharged and sent to rehab on Feb. 27.  He remained there until April 8.   He is currently doing fairly well.  He uses a walker and gait belt in the house and is receiving home therapy.  He is not as independent as he was before.  His short term memory seems to be more impaired than it was previously.

                                                The weeks following vaccination, the patient felt lethargic, dizzy, unstable on his feet. Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

                                                My Father had been in his usual state of health when he received his first Pfizer Covid-19 shot on 1/12/2021 and his second dose on 2/2/2021.  He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.  He had another episode of lethargy/unresponsiveness on 2/26/2021 and was once again sent to the hospital where they did not show any new findings.  He spent a few days in the hospital before returning to his facility where he continued to have periodic episodes of increased lethargy/confusion and decreased eating.  He was placed on Hospice and passed away on March 29th.

He has also reportedly had a cough and some fever.  There has been some report of incontinence of both bowel and bladder.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 3/17.  He and his wife have returned to the home after wintering in another state.  According to his wife, with whom I have spoken this evening, last night he suddenly became confused.  The confusion continued throughout the day today, thus prompting the EMS called to the house and the subsequent journey to the ED for further evaluation.

Within half an hour from  finding the patient laying on the floor, he seemed almost back to normal. However, since he is 89 years old, the patient was transported by ambulance. Blood was drawn, a urine sample was taken, a chest Xray, and a CT scan of his head and his spine were the labs that were run. All the labs came back normal.
