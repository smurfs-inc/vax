                                                I felt great after my vaccine until midnight that same day.  My legs from the knees down including my feet were painfully cold as if they were on dry ice.  I didn&#39;t get much sleep that night, but the next morning at 2:00 a.m. the pain was gone.  I was just extremely fatigued which was a symptom I expected.  I don&#39;t know what to think of the first symptom but wanted you to know.  Thank you.

They took my vitals - blood pressure was 116/73 and temperature was still 102.6.  Paramedics offered to take me to the hospital but I refused.  Paramedics told my wife that if my breathing became labored, she should get me to the ER or call 911 again.    I was not able to get out of bed the whole day on Thursday 3/25, because I was so weak I could not stand up, and I also had body aches and had to use a urinal because I could not walk to the bathroom.  My wife gave me Tylenol and the fever finally broke late evening of Thursday 3/25 and I started to feel a little bit better.  I had not eaten all day, but my wife made sure I stayed hydrated with water.  On Friday morning 3/26 I was able to sit up on the side of the bed, and I was able to walk with the assistance of a cane to the bathroom.  Extreme fatigue affected me all day Friday, but I did feel better.  Fever did not come back after it broke.  Saturday 3/27 - still experiencing extreme fatigue, but feel better overall.

After that had 1 hour of uncontolled severe shaking and shivering . Next day felt fine.  Afew days started noticing LOW FREQUENCY INTERMITTANT TINNITUS THAT IS A HUM, BUT ONLY IF I AM AROUND HIGH VOLTAGE POWER TRANSMISSION LINES AND POWER TRANSFORMERS .  HEAR IT IN MY HOME  WHICH IS 1000 FEET FROM HIGH VOLTAGE LINES 24/7 SINCE DAY 2-4 OF DOSE #1.  Can hear it in other enclosed areas, but doesn&#39;t seem to happen AS MUCH outdoors, although if I am within 1000 feet of high voltage lines I will hear it UNLESS  there are many trees to block the EMF&#39;s or HUM between me and the source.  SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT IS TRUE  FOR PAST 3 MONTHS 24/7 AND HAS RUINED MY LIFE BECAUSE I CANNOT SLEEP AND SLEEPING PILLS DON&#39;T WORK.   HAS DISRUPTED MY SLEEP CENTER SOMEHOW.  ALL OF THIS IS SINCE FIRST COIVD19 SHOT !  HAVE HAD #2 SHOT AND WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER !

Did not sleep for 2 nights in a row, until finally the reaction started to subside. Also, the vaccine gave me a minor case of hives rash. This has not subsided yet.

A 76-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9264, Expiration Date: 31May2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus. On 04Feb2021 the patient experienced his arm was sore, nausea, headache, fatigue. On an unspecified date Feb 2021, the patient experienced this is different feeling than what he normally feels. The reporter stated, Yes, he takes a lot, I would rather not because its lot he is diabetic and he takes blood thinner and statin and its very long list, but these are different so those, the reason I called because this is different feeling than what he normally feels when he gets ups in the morning, and that&#39;s why I thought maybe it because of Covid. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included glycosylated hemoglobin, diabetes, I do I have to look up the result and the date, the date was 30Jan and it was blood draw for his A1C. The outcome of event different feeling than what he normally feels was unknown and other outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 76-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 intramuscular on 25 Feb 2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at clinic. Medical history included hypertension, blood cholesterol increased, myocardial infarction, colon cancer (had surgery for that and also had chemotherapy), coronary artery disease (30% blocked coronary artery), covid-19 from 19May2020 to an unknown date. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril for hypertension; amlodipine; rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol increased; evolocumab (REPATHA), subcutaneously at 140 mg (twice a month) for blood cholesterol increased. The patient reported, he was diagnosed positive with COVID-19 on 27May2020 from which he seem to have recovered without any residues of symptoms or side effect. He received first Pfizer COVID vaccination at noon time this past Thursday 25Feb in a vaccination clinic set up, the following day Friday the 26 he woke up the next morning and entire body was so sore from head to toe and could hardly get himself out of bed, but when he got up, he was having difficulty walking, so anyway he stayed in bed all day on 26 and 27. He initially had a slight temperature, some chills, slight cough, runny nose and those symptoms except for the cough seem to have resolved, what hasn&#39;t resolved is about every 30 or 40 minutes or so he had been having to urinate ever since 26Feb2021 night, his mouth has been constantly very dry. Still urinating every half hour 45 minutes and ongoing. Mouth has been very dry and had a couple of areas where it seems like maybe he had bit his lip or something, maybe when he was sleeping. It was nothing like that in mouth anymore but the mouth is still constantly so dry like dehydrated and no matter how much of fluid he drank that doesn&#39;t seem to help it and what in fact has also caused was on yesterday morning he had been a little constipated on Friday night and then yesterday morning had a severe case of diarrhea. Now he had not had another bowel movement since yesterday morning as no appetite and feeling so lousy, and so tired and fatigued. He had been feeling even much worse since getting the vaccine. He still feels very fatigued, very sore all over, very tired, still have the slight cough and he would say that&#39;s about it. Outcome of events for cough, pain and tiredness was not recovered and for the rest of the events it was unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

I woke up around 3am violently panting and trying to get his breath.  After what could have been a minute or many minutes, I started breathing normally.  My Friday night sleep was terrible.  I woke with a temperature around 101.  After taking Acetaminophen, my temperature went back to normal. Towards evening my temperature went up to about 101 and I was achy all day.  Saturday evening was a good evening and I woke up feeling fine on Sunday.

Pain at site of injection started about 6 hours post second vaccine injection (7-8 on a 0-10 scale) that lasted for almost 48 hours, most intense during the day following injection. No treatment for that. 2. Significant fatigue on the morning  14 hours following the injection (could have started during the night) . Difficult to maintain balance. Just rested the whole day. Unable to exercise on stationary bike. 3. Low grade fever (just under 99 F; base line for me has been 97.6 F) in the evening following injection, gone next morning. No treatment.

He went to the hospital with his wife on 3/1/2021.  He stated &#34;I think I&#39;m going to die&#34;.  Patient had been off Cymbalta  for 3 days completely- treating neuropathy (previous daily medication that his primary physician advised him with weaning down the dose).  The patient was manic and had tangential thoughts- from crying/angry to laughter.  It is believed that the agitation could be due to medication withdraw.

The patient indicated he had an appointment unrelated to this event scheduled with his primary care physician on March 3, 2021, and was advised to discuss the reaction with the physician at this appointment.

A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient woke up and had  severe acid reflux, trouble breathing for about 15 minutes, couldn&#39;t catch his breath, was wheezing and sounded like an asthma attack.  He felt like something was stuck in his throat. It cleared in 10 seconds and he could breathe and swallow fine.  He took a Benadryl as treatment and drank water.  He also felt tired. The patient further reported that he had the covid vaccine shot. He did not know if he was having a reaction, but he was taking a nap, and he guessed he regurgitated. He had a difficult time catching his breath, it was like it was stuck in the throat. He vomited lying down. He felt the stomach acid come up into mouth after he was able to breath better. But before he was not breathing at all. This never happened before. He was lying flat, he guessed he threw up. He had a large lunch, maybe too large. It was like he was getting something caught in in throat. The patient also reported that his throat was burning and mentioned that he slept on a triangular pillow. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

By mid-afternoon had to go to bed and slept for hours. Got up at 9PM and went back to bed at 11PM. Sunday was better, but this AM (Monday) awakened with itchy skin, pins and needles on hands and feet (gone now) and total exhaustion. Had difficulty breathing (better now), can barely lift arms and had to miss work and went back to bed. I am reporting this because I am scheduled for a 2nd shot on the 26th and not certain it&#39;s a good idea.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 19Feb2021 08:40 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications including blood thinner and Afib medications. The patient takes 6 medications: some of those medications for 40 years, some for a bit less. There were a couple more added for his heart because 10 years ago he had a case of Afib and the doctor who has now retired took him from 3 meds to 6; and has had no issues for the last 10 years. The patient had his first dose on 19Feb2021 at a clinic and was due/scheduled for his second on 12Mar2021. The patient had severe reactions to the first one so he wanted to know if he should accelerate second shot or stay within three weeks. His reaction was for the first two weeks, he had severe nausea, etcetera, which was getting better that week. He gives 20-minute presentations each morning and the participants in the presentation were nice about it but they say that the patient has fog and thought he should see if he should go in sooner as they were worried about him. His only symptoms remaining after two weeks of severe reactions was that he was very sleepy. All that was left was being tired and mentally in a bit of fog (also reported as mental fog). The patient only had pain to the injection site for a day and was not an issue, then it didn&#39;t take long for him to start getting extremely tired and have nausea. He says all he knows was that from the sheet listing severe reactions, he had every one during the first couple weeks (unspecified), though he never had a fever. He says this week he felt better and he was starting to eat, this was not normal for him to be tired all the time, but at least he was not sick. He says he didn&#39;t treat the pain or nausea, because he was healthy as a horse, and has no problems with a vaccine, shots don&#39;t bother him other than having soreness the first day. The patient was just foggy and tired. The patient was recovering from nausea. The patient recovered from injection site pain on 20Feb2021. The patient has not recovered from mental fog/bit of fog and tired. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Uncommonly tired, no headache fever, chills, or neurodeficit otherwise.  ( I am a retired physician).  This lead to change in gait: slow, foot dragging, unstable.  Near accident in driving auto.  More than 4 time of urinary incontinence ie incontinence when bladder overfilled.  Mental clarity lost.  speech impaired by word searching.  Obvious change in behavior to those around me.

                                                spiking of his blood pressure; sore arm; legs swollen; pain on one leg; on and off nausea; not feeling right; This is a spontaneous report  from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (Lot number was not reported) at the age of 77 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. On an unspecified date the patient experienced spiking of his blood pressure, sore arm, legs swollen, pain on one leg, on and off nausea, not feeling right.  The patient had lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 190/80.  The clinical outcome of the events was unknown. The clinical course was reported as follows: 77-year-old caller reported receiving his second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 24Feb2021 and experienced a &#34;sore arm&#34; after. He explained that a week after vaccination, on the Monday, he &#34; woke up with his legs swollen and pain on one leg&#34;. He stated he also experienced spiking of his blood pressure (BP), however on Monday 03Mar2021 he went to the ER since his BP rose over 190/80. He explained at the ER, he guessed they got him more call, and he received a prescription of &#34;water pills&#34; to take for &#34;a couple weeks&#34;.  He added then, there were moments when he &#34;didn&#39;t feel right&#34;. He specified he would be &#34;good&#34; in the morning then he &#34;just didn&#39;t feel right&#34; in the afternoon. He reported about a month later, 13Apr2021 he had a &#34;second incident with the spiking&#34; of his BP, which led him to the ER. He explained his cardiologist then changed his amlodipine prescription to &#34;5mg in the morning and 5mg at night&#34;. He explained he would take 1 pill of Amlodipine 10mg in the morning before vaccination. He added he would take 5mg of amlodipine for a year before being increased to that 10mg a day.  He explained before vaccination, he &#34;never experienced such spiking with his BP and considers himself healthy for his age. DSU agent reported his BP is generally around 120/70 and he routinely use the treadmill. He mentioned he now seems ok, has not have a &#34;violent&#34; BP spike, but has &#34;not felt 100%&#34; yet. He added some days he is &#34;fine&#34; and others he has &#34;on and off nausea&#34; or he &#34;feels his legs are swollen in the evening&#34;. The main reason for his call is to see if Pfizer have any experience with people who have covid, the long haulers, with the effects for quite a while, that are 3 months in. He was wondering whether or not any long hauler folks that have had on and off side effects attributed it to the vaccine.    Information about Lot Batch number has been requested.

He was taken to ER via EMS, where his HR was initially 15 - He was admitted to hospital - initially a temporary pacer was placed, then a permanent one on Monday, 2/22. He has had other episodes like this in past 13 mos. PCP referred him to neurologist and EENT. Neurology work-up, including MRI and 72 hr EEG were unremarkable, although he learned retrospectively that there was a time during EEG where HR was only 35. EENT found no auditory or other issues . *MD in ER told him that if issues were not neuro in nature, they were probably cardiac.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine.

                                                The day after the injection I started felling disoriented and suffering from what I call a mind-body disconnect.  Walking was unsteady and organizing thoughts was difficult.  This was my primary symptom with the infection which lasted through 02/16/2021.  The last three days were spent in the Covid-19 unit of a local hospital after which the symptoms disappeared.  The day after the vaccination, the symptoms came back but only lasted for about 24 hours.

                                                Patient had second dose of Pfizer vaccine in morning. That afternoon began complaining of abdominal pain with subsequent vomiting (x2) and possible diarrhea. Patient could not sleep that evening . Awoke next morning with continued abdominal pain throughout the day and ultimately was found unresponsive in bed. Transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Subsequently autopsy was performed which revealed significant pre-existing hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with evidence of acute myocardial infarction. There is no clear evidence that this is related to the vaccination, however it is being reported due to potential public health interest and temporal proximity to vaccination.

                                                On March 2, he woke up feeling bad and had a fever of 102.7. He took tylenol and liquids all day and the fever came down to around 100. The next morning he woke up complaining of excruciating pain in his left arm (site of the injection). He couldn&#39;t stand to have anything touch it, couldn&#39;t move it and couldn&#39;t sleep because of the pain. The next morning he woke up very weak, wasn&#39;t able to speak clearly, wasn&#39;t making sense. He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn&#39;t do it at that hospital.  He was transferred to another hospital.  The doctors at that hospital determined the pacemaker was not the source.  It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.  He lived another 2 weeks but never was able to recover. Until the day he was put on paliative care, he expressed pain in the arm where he had received the vaccination. He died at 5:30 a.m. on April 1, 2021.

No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No history of previous immunizations with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, this was the first dose. No additional vaccine administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 13Jan2021, the patient received the vaccine. He clarified the reaction as, on Saturday 23Jan2021 all of a sudden it was quick he got real light headed, dizzy, he felt like his equilibrium was way off. He felt like he had a mild case of vertigo. He was wobbly, he ached, and felt terrible. It was a yucky feeling. He also felt nauseous, and it went away soon as he ate. He had never had a feeling like that before. He stayed down all day. He noticed all these events that occurred on Saturday 23Jan2021 started late morning around 10-11 in the morning. By the afternoon he was on his back for the rest of the day. It knocked him for a loop. Sunday 24Jan2021 he woke up and felt a little better. He still had some of the symptoms, but they were milder and kept getting milder through out the day. By Sunday afternoon they were almost gone and by Monday 25Jan2021 he felt normal and great. Tuesday 26Jan2021 these same feelings hit him again, but not the same way and was not as bad. Then 27Jan2021, they were gone and he felt fine. He went to the doctor&#39;s office yesterday (27Jan2021). The doctor thought he was having an inner ear problem. He has a history of tinnitus and the doctor thought this was causing the light vertigo symptoms. He was light headed, wobbly. He was prescribed Meclizine-25mg one tablet by mouth three time a day. Now, today, 28Jan2021, he woke up this morning and he had the same feelings again. He was wobbly. He had the same feelings that he experienced on Saturday 23Jan2021. However, they were milder. He felt like it is a little vertigo. He did not feel stable. He had never had anything like this happen before. The patient stated he is pretty healthy for his age. he is very active. He usually plays golf, but has not recently. The patient believes he is having a reaction from vaccine, he is not sure, but he is having some of the symptoms. The doctor provided him with medication, but he has not started it yet. He does not know if he should. Caller is thinking these events are related to the shot. He is due to get his second shot on 03Feb2021. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

My stomach became quisy and I had to go into the bathroom, became nauseated and had to vomit. I had a quisy stomach most of the balance of the day.  I experiecnced a restless night. However, by mid-morning  Sunday I began to feel better and have had no additonal inegative effect.  The only other  unexplained  item was that on Sunday I checked my blood presure and it was 154/ 85. This is very unusual,  as due to the nifedipine I take for my DES, my average for years is around 125/80.  Today, Tuesday, I checked it again and it still  at 158/87.  I have an appointment with my cardiologist  in 2 weeks and will discuss this with him.

On third day after second vaccination,  should symptoms gone but I started to develop diffuse myalgias.  By 4th day, began having problems with my memory. I could not figure out some instructions on a computer program. I had some trouble recognizing a common object in my hand.  Then mild ataxia.  Excessive sleepiness in 2-3 hour intervals.  On 8th day, developed  abdominal pain similar to diverticulitis. And became very constipated. I had forgotten to take the Parnate and missed two doses. I had forgotten to take Metamucil and Miralax. these led to the constipation and abdominal pain.  On advice of psychopharmacologist, I resumed Parnate  and started to feel better.  I resumed laxatives and good effect. Abdominal symptoms abated in two additional days.  I had gone to ER  but seen only informally by my medical friends. After 3 hour, and getting better, I left.   Blood tests were normal.  No exam.   Since 02/27/2021, I have felt perfectly normal.   Recovered.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports, reporting for self. This 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) via unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID virus in Aug2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM and got a reaction around 9 PM. The patient stated a lot of the same symptoms from the COVID virus came back after the vaccine. The first thing was chills, patient took a couple of paracetamol (TYLENOL), and they went away after about a half hour. The patient had a low grade fever 101.9 at 29Jan2021 night to 30Jan2021, and took paracetamol then as well. The patient reported the biggest thing was everything hurt including muscles and head. Patient felt weak, more or less tired with no energy following the vaccination. The symptoms were from 29Jan2021 night until probably 31Jan2021 morning noon, then he started to feel little bit better. The patient hardly miss work, but missed work on 30Jan2021. The patient stated feeling pretty good and pretty much back to normal on 01Feb2021, it did not affect breathing or cough, just fever and feeling lousy. The patient commented that he can relate to COVID because he had had the COVID and for 2 weeks he was like that. He also had the breathing problem with the virus in Aug2020, and he think he had every symptom but did not lose taste or smell. The patient asked if he should take his second dose of vaccine. The outcome of event chills was resolved on 29Jan2021. The outcome of event fever was resolved on 30Jan2021. The outcome of other events was resolving.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. ; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021148753 same reporter/drug/events, different patients

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, dose 2, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostate cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and major radial prostatectomy from 04Feb2021 to an unknown date. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced chills, low grade fever and fatigue. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of BNT162B2. The patient was fine, had no problems until 15Mar20201 (4 days afterwards), the patient stated, &#34;I started getting chills, shaking uncontrollably , nausea, fatigue, a little bit of everything. I wouldn&#39;t be calling you but this has not subsided. It&#39;s been 3 weeks now and I&#39;m not feeling well. It ebbs and tides. I&#39;ve been taking a diary. I went to the ER last Monday because I was wheezing in the morning and had shortness of breathe in between all the other symptoms. They did all kind of blood tests, covid test which was negative, chest x-ray showed bronchitis. Blood work and ultrasound of my bladder with unknown results. They sent me home with a inhaler, steroid and an antibiotic and every day since then it seems like at night 9, or 10 o&#39;clock I start feeling better and sleep through the night. My fever is 97.7 degrees fahrenheit but about 2, 3 or 4 o&#39;clock my fever ticks up a little and I start to feel lousy, my stomach feels. I feel like I have hot flashes; a feeling of warmth with achiness and lack of appetite. So I take my Tylenol 7 or 8 o&#39;clock at night my temperature is 97.7F. I haven&#39;t had 1 good day since. I&#39;ve been to my doctor, ER, I&#39;ve talked with the CDC. What information do you have for people who have had long term symptoms/side effects? What am I supposed to do? Someone from Pfizer needs to give me advice. If not I&#39;ll go to  the news network. I don&#39;t feel well. It&#39;s directly related. No one has given me relief or help. It&#39;s impacting my life. I&#39;ve been sick every day.  Is there someone above you who can tell me what to do? I took their (Pfizer&#39;s) vaccine that was recommended. It was your vaccine. Not mine. Someone has to have an answer for me. Unless you want to go and have lawsuit and the news. Just think about it, if you had to go through the symptoms of having the flu everyday. Please relay this to someone. If I don&#39;t heard back within a week, then I&#39;m going ballistic. It&#39;s not going to be pretty. Someone has to get back to me to help. I want someone to tell me that I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m not the only experiencing this. There has to be an answer. I took your vaccine. You are responsible. I want to know. I can&#39;t be the only one in the whole world who is feeling like this. I&#39;ve been to the ER and the doctors. I&#39;ve had every side effects but theirs go away in a few days, but mine hasn&#39;t. I need advice, that I&#39;m not nuts, something that will help me get better. I want to feel better. It&#39;s effecting my family my life. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd? I can&#39;t be the only one? Someone has to know something. They (drug companies) like to hide the facts. I am sick because I took BNT162B2 vaccine. I need someone to get back to me.&#34; After the second dose of BNT162B2, the patient has been experiencing an achy feeling, heat throughout the body, shivering, shaking, trouble walking, and some fever. He reports taking Tylenol, and that helps, but he is still having symptoms that come and go and it has been 3 weeks since the second injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. He reports going to the ER for treatment after the second injection, and a COVID-19 test was negative and they did not find anything else other than the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine that would be causing his symptoms. The events hasn&#39;t gone away, it&#39;s now about 3.5 weeks and he hasn&#39;t had a good day since then he has been experiencing chills and fever.

The patient previously received the initial dose of the BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) in 2021 (March or April) in the left arm which was deemed invalid by the vaccination provider due to temperature related issues (i.e wasn&#39;t cold enough). He explained he received a letter informing him of this incident and recommending a replacement dose (which he thinks was on 06Apr2021). About 2 to 3 weeks before he got his first COVID shot, he got a flu shot in his left arm, about 4 or 5 inches above where he got his COVID shot. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not specified. He reported that the second vaccine (BNT162b2) caused him problems. On 06May2021, he woke up with his right wrist twice as thick as his left one, it was swollen real bad. The right wrist was quite sore and painful. He didn&#39;t know if he was getting carpal tunnel or what it was, so he went to the ER about it and they gave him three different kinds of pills, two of which included tramadol 50mg one every day and ibuprofen 400 mg. The ER couldn&#39;t determine the cause for his reaction. About 3-4 days after taking the prescribed medication, his reaction subsided quite a bit and was not nearly as hurtful, but his left wrist then started swelling and being painful/sore. Therefore, he continued to take his medication and it improved. It was like that for a couple/ three days, and it calmed down. He thought he was okay 2-3 days ago, but this morning (14May2021), his right shoulder was swollen and pretty sore and was getting worse; he was in so much pain, so sore he could hardly even move his arm, he couldn&#39;t pick it up straight in the air, couldn&#39;t get his elbow up past his ear. The patient also reported that when he got off his bed, his left knee was sore and it felt like a fire underneath his kneecap and he was having trouble walking. The left knee was swollen real bad and was hotter than a firecracker. Thus, he went back to taking his pill again. The knee pain started the morning  of 14May2021 about the same time it seemed and has worsened, and he took a 400mg ibuprofen and the other pill he&#39;s taking, &#34;100 mg doxycycline or something&#34;. Patient hadn&#39;t been doing much since, he was feeling kind of laid up, he had thought it was all done with yesterday (13May2021). He stated he&#39;s been hearing things about allergic reactions to this COVID shot, was sure that a lot of people are having complaints of allergic reactions, and was sure he&#39;s not the only one who has had a problem like this. He asked if there was anything he can take to block it because he is sure when this calms down after a week or whatever, it will be his in his right knee or left shoulder or wrists or ankles and he&#39;s 100% it&#39;s about that COVID shot. He stated he&#39;s never had arthritis before. He stated that he has never had any problems like this before. He is supposed to go see his doctor in a week or two. He tried to call the doctor to make an appointment, but he figured he would wait a couple days, but he is hurting bad today (14May2021), and he hasn&#39;t been to anybody yet except for the ER. The patient stated it looks like the vaccine is methodically causing this spread into his body. He also reported that it feels warm outside of his left wrist, towards the edge of it and all the way to the joint of the little finger and he thinks the swelling will start again. He expressed feeling anxious about his reactions. He asked if there were any kinds of pills he could take to block the effects of the vaccine from working in his body. He stated it seems like it&#39;s going from one area to the next and it seems like it&#39;s going through his joints and he doesn&#39;t like that. His left wrist still got a little bit of soreness in the back near the joint, but doesn&#39;t appear to be swollen. Regarding the right wrist, he has recovered completely, it feels better; doesn&#39;t feel any soreness in any place and doesn&#39;t look swollen. The clinical outcome of right wrist twice as thick/left wrist started swelling recovered on unspecified date; left wrist painful/sore not recovered; right shoulder is so sore not recovered; left knee was sore not recovered; anxious was unknown; feels &#34;warm&#34; outside of his left wrist/ felt like a fire underneath his kneecap was unknown; left knee is swollen not recovered; arm was so sore unknown; carpal tunnel unknown; trouble walking unknown; right shoulder was swollen was not recovered.

                                                heart attack; chest pressure; hardly slept; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife).  An 80-year-old male patient (reported also as 81-years-old, to be clarified) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot # EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 80-years-old. Medical history included ongoing emphysema and ongoing diabetes (caller has been diagnosed for 35 years for both conditions), heart was damaged because of the diabetes, and a history of bypass 4 years ago however he hasn&#39;t had any issues with chest pressure since before the bypass. Concomitant medications were none. On 15Jan2021 at 1:am he developed pressure in the chest which ultimately resolved. This trouble last night, lasted over 1 hour. He couldn&#39;t get back to bed. He had to sleep sitting up on the sofa. That was the only way he was comfortable. Her husband has hardly slept. She was seeing how he was doing. He said he was okay sitting. The pressure on his chest would go away while he was sitting, but laying down it would come back. This morning (15Jan2021) she made him check when he woke up at 8 o&#39;clock. She made him lay down, and he said it was gone after sitting the whole night. He is well now. He is feeling fine. He didn&#39;t even ask for help getting on his clothes. He got the vaccine because of his age and because of underlying conditions. Her husband has done very well this year. He even has underlying conditions. He has had Emphysema for 35 years, but it hasn&#39;t been bothering him. He has also had diabetes for 35 years. The reporter spoke to her husband&#39;s hcp (nurse) who said it could have a heart attack and for him to go to hospital if it reoccurs. She did speak with a nurse with his primary doctor, and she said the pressure in his chest for 1 hour could have been a heart attack. That if it occurs again to give him the nitroglycerin. She told the nurse it wasn&#39;t pain. The reporter stated chest pressure could have been a heart attack. He is scheduled to get the 2nd dose on 21Jan2021. The reporter was wondering if her husband can have the second dose given it has potassium in it (given he has bypass history). The reporter is afraid the vaccine is not safe, and they may not go for the second vaccine. She wants more information if it is safe.  The events recovered on 15Jan2021.

An 80-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231; expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high cholesterol and blood pressure abnormal from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included propranolol hcl for blood pressure and an unspecified cholesterol pill. The patient previously received influenza (Flu shot) on an unspecified date (years) ago for immunization and experienced light headed. The patient reported that his blood pressure went up the day he hook the vaccine to 200/93 and he was real concerned about that. He took a blood pressure pill and was having some sharp pains in his right eye (he had 3-4 at different times). He was anxious feeling and could hear it blowing in his ears (which happens when his blood pressure is high). He stated he has never had his blood pressure that high and has never had any heart problems. The patient asked, whether he was in the danger zone, the danger zone of having a stroke and if they should take their second dose. The patient wondered if they could just take the first dose only. It was further reported that he took the vaccine yesterday or the day before (19Jan2021) at 11&#39;o clock. He didn&#39;t have any problems, he just got home. Then 11&#39;o clock at night he had fallen asleep during the day and woke up at that time, 11&#39;o clock and he felt Antsy, his blood pressure was up, his ears puffed real high, he&#39;s on Blood Pressure medication.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

By 3/1, I also had thigh and buttock ache with effort and left TMJ pain. On 3/2, I saw Dr. My sed rate was 24. She made a diagnosis of probable PMR and prescribed prednisone. After I single dose, my symptoms almost magically abated and I was almost normal. On 3/11, the only residual symptom with soreness with with extreme neck rotation. On clinical grounds, this confirms the diagnosis of PMR. I assume treatment will continue for several weeks.

The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.   On 29Mar2021, the reporter stated that patient had a really bad reaction last night and had to go to the emergency room, she stated that overnight her husband kept passing out and states that when he would come to, he would say it&#39;s the medicine, the medicine. The reporter thought he was talking about his blood pressure medication because she states she checked and he hadn&#39;t taken it yet, but when she asked if what medicine he was talking about, her husband would say the one in my arm. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                At some time after the vaccines were given I started having muscle aches and pains throughout my body.  Thighs, calves, butt, hips, biceps, forearms, and inside area between bicep and lower arm (opposite side of elbow) which would keep me awake at night due to the pain.  That pain was only at night, the other pains were during the day and most times would last the whole day, but other times would lessen as the day went on.  I still cannot sleep on my left side, due to hip and arm pain, but the very painful left arm pain persists as described above even when sleeping on my right side.  I still have these pains as of the date of this writing, April 17, 2021.

An 80-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EM6207), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Mar2021 15:00 (Batch/), single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Diagnosed with COPD 3-4 years ago and is not taking any medication for it, (blood pressure) hypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing had been taking Atenolol for blood pressure. Concomitant medication included atenolol. The patient had the first dose of bnt162b2 vaccine (Lot EN6023) on 27Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization and experienced hypertension aggravated. He went back to doctor and had been taking Atenolol for blood pressure. It has always been dose 50/25. His blood pressure was up just a bit and he cannot verify who this girl was that changed it to 100/25. He did not like the way he felt and eliminated it and went back to the previous dose. He had two over a period of 2-3 days. It is in a pharmacy vial.  He does not have a lot or expiration for the Atenolol 100/25.  The date his blood pressure was up was for the past couple of times.Usually, it is 120/60-70 and  then it jumped up to 150/60-70 and that is why it needed to be changed.  It was filled on 18Mar2021, which was after first vaccine but before second dose. Patient got deathly sick over the weekend on 02Apr2021. He had the shot on 20 Mar 2021, and it has been more than the two days you could have a reaction. He was deathly sick. On 02Apr2021, he had just about all of the symptoms; sweaty, chills, face red, and hands red, indigestion, constipation and could not go to the bathroom. He was about as sick as he had ever been.  He know it is not supposed to be that long. He could not sleep for two days. His face and palms got really red. He did not have a fever. He walked the floor and only slept 2 hours in two days. On 31Mar2021, he goes to a pain center and got shots in his neck. He asked the doctor if his shot had anything different than he had been getting and he confirmed that it was no different. He never had a reaction before the one he got on 31Mar2021, and thought it may have been the virus shot. He said one other thing happened and is not sure if it had anything to do with it or not. He just started to feel worse and worse. Today is the first day he felt better. He is 80 and has not been this sick. It got really bad but today it is much better. He did not sleep for two days and last night he slept and feels better. For the indigestion, it got worse before it got better. For constipation, he got relief last night and that is why he feels better today. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required- He had a previously scheduled office visit for pain center. The outcome of the events was recovering. The event insomnia was assessed by the reporter as medically significant.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Patient was in his usual state of health and independent with his ADLs until 2-3 days after his 2nd COVID vaccination on Feb 26th when he began to have bilateral knee and LE pain.  He then was having difficulty walking for a couple of weeks. The leg pain was not constant, but he did fatigue easily with walking.  On 3/11 he had his lower dentures placed and that evening/early morning of 3/12 he apparently fell. Patient does not remember anything about the fall - he cannot recall when he fell, how he fell, or any of his symptoms leading up to the fall.  Patient remembers being on the floor and attempting to get up but was too weak. He has rug burns on his forearms from attempting to get up.  He was hospitalized on 3/13 for dehydration, traumatic rhabdomyolysis, and w/u following fall.  Despite very stable labs prior to 1st dose of vaccination on 2/5/21, following vaccination he has had significant and substained leukocytosis as well as transfusion dependent anemia that has not resolved at the time of the reporting (5/13/21).  He remains at a skilled nursing facility due to debility.

Treatment team COVID-19 Principal problem Chronic anticoagulation  Persistent atrial fibrillation (CMS/HCC)  COVID-19  Confusion  Hypoxemia Hospital Course: In his hospital stay we managed his medical issues as follows;   Confusion/Syncope in the setting of COVID-19 infection Chronic atrial fibrillation/sinus node dysfunction Hypertension Prediabetes Patient received first dose of vaccination on 3/16 and afterwards started having muscle aches and body pains, later on found out to be having Covid 19&#43; test, he might be having Covid infection before vaccination as well and symptoms showed with vaccination.  On 3/24 he was found out to be having confusion, family called EMS.  They tried to debride patient on his feet and he collapsed for about 10 seconds.  He did mention that he usually get dizziness/lightheadedness upon standing from bed.  Although patient has a history of A. fib but remained rate controlled during hospital stay, we held his antihypertensives including HCTZ and ARBwhile continued his Eliquis.  I believe his syncope was likely due to dehydration with decreased oral intake in the setting of acute illness with COVID-19 symptoms. Before discharge is blood pressure was rising so his ARB were restarted while decision regarding HCTZ will be made by primary care physician. In regard to his COVID-19 infection, initially was started on 2 L of supplemental oxygen but his oxygen demand decreased rapidly and most of the time he remained room air, he was not showing any dyspnea, cough, fever or any other generalized symptoms of Covid 19 infection.  He did get plasma and remdesivir while inpatient, decision was made to discharge him on 3/26 as patient was symptom-free.  He also had received first dose of vaccination. I believe that he would need further remdesivir.  We will continue him on steroids for now after completion of dexamethasone for next 8 days he can recent resume his home medication of prednisone.

                                                crying; feeling nausea; depression; feeling dizziness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). An 80-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17May2021 09:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8729) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included heart valve replacement from 12Mar2021, kidney infection, had a heart bypass and is diabetic. The patient has no concomitant medications. The patient got the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 17May2021, and the next day (18May2021) he woke up with dizziness. The reporter asked how long the symptoms last after the Covid vaccine. He is sort of getting nausea when he tries to get up. He was also real depressed. It kind of started the next day after the vaccine (18May2021), but Wednesday she was concerned because the patient was crying a lot which is unusual for him. The nausea started today (25May2021). He hasn&#39;t been up and about. The dizziness is about the same. They called his primary caregiver who started him on some antidepressants. She picked up the information sheet that was given to them with the Covid vaccine and read there that dizziness was a side effect and a feeling of impending doom which is sort of how he was feeling. Now that&#39;s why she was wondering when the symptoms would be over. She doesn&#39;t really think he needs anything. He has never been depressed. She thinks now it is a side effect from the vaccine. She thinks the depression has improved. He is not crying anymore, but somebody is with him all the time. This was his first dose of the vaccine. He is supposed to go back on 07Jun2021 for his second. The outcome the event depression was recovering, event crying was recovered on an unspecified date and the other events was not recovered.

I believe it has to do with the vaccine since I have never experienced tinnitus this severe before.  In addition, I started experiencing anxiety all during the day and had a severe panic attack before bedtime.  If it doesn&#39;t subside, I will need to find a doctor for this condition.

I was not able to go back to sleep.  I realized it was Tendinitis, as I have had systems of Tendinitis, over the years, but it just came and went, and was not loud enough or lasted long enough to be anything but a minor annoyance .   In this case while it is not loud, it is loud enough to be annoying, and it still did not go away. (time is now -01:13 PM 2/16, I am hoping it is just the vaccine working its way through my system.   I notified my primary care doctor at the VA, as well as audio dept.

They to put on blood pressure monitoring, EKG. They gave my a chest x-ray. Cat-scan , blood work and gave me something in my IV.  I went home that about 9:30 PM  that night. My blood pressure was 213/99 and started my new medicine Nifedipine 30 MG . The ER Doctor told me to schedule an appointment with my doctor ASAP. The appointment was scheduled for today but was canceled as my doctor&#39;s office still has no power and was rescheduled for Monday the 22nd.  Prior to receiving the vaccine I have no had high blood pressure. I was feeling anxious once I was informed that  my blood pressure was dangerous high.

This condition has persisted since then and has not improved significantly.

Without warning, he fell to the ground, losing control of bowel and bladder, although no seizure activity noted at the time.  He transiently lost consciousness and then woke up confused and combative.  Brought to emergency room and admitted with multiple rib fractures.  Initial brain imaging was negative but 24 hours later, noted to have small hemorrhagic brain contusion in left frontal/temporal region and a small subdural hematoma.  One day later, there was not noted to be any extension of the hemorrhage/hematoma.

Was probably the lymph node; Was like a very dull irritation in the right side of the neck. Was probably the lymph node.; coughs; very mild sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 81-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm at the age of 81-year-old on 27Mar2021 (Lot Number: EP6955) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cancer from 2018 (started out with BCG treatments, where they insert bacteria into the bladder); Had another form of immunotherapy that didn&#39;t work too well for him and the cancer kept growing chemotherapy; Had a couple of operations and surgeries where the doctor removed it all but it came back. Best reaction was chemotherapy (It stopped the bleeding and was working on the cancer). Last one was 15Feb2021. Was getting blood work for every treatment. Had to miss one of the treatments due to low platelets. Has a chest port for treatments and blood work.  Was very conscious before having chemo. It is kind of a rough thing to kill cancer but also kills good cells too. Definitely worked on killing the cancer for a while; the last treatment was 15Feb2021. Stage 4 was taking chemo. Had bladder cancer (which got out of the bladder and started spreading in to the lymph system), Height: used to be 5&#39;7&#34;, is now maybe 5&#34;4&#34;. The caller remarks that when he started with chemotherapy. he also lost a lot of weight.  Weight: When he went in for last appointment it was 129 or 130 pounds. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took chemotherapy nos from unknown date to 15Feb2021 for cancer. The patient experienced pain in neck and back on 28Mar2021, pain in chest on 29Mar2021. Caller stating that he and his wife had shot number one 27Mar2021 and are scheduled for second shot 20Apr2021. Wife had no symptoms, maybe a bit of a sore arm and he had the same reaction. Was a very mild sore arm in 2021. On day 2 or 3 on the right side of the neck, had felt a little nagging in Mar2021 and slight pain, especially when he moved and felt it around his back. It is just starting to go away now at 3 weeks. Around the back, around the perimeter and when he coughs in Mar2021, he can feel it in his chest. He is scheduled for the second shot. Is wondering if the second shot will have those symptoms. It&#39;s not like it is anything severe, it is just nagging. What worries is him, is that it lasted this long. Is a cancer patient and had last chemotherapy 15Feb2021. His oncologist said to go ahead and take the shot because he really needs the protection. It was asked what if he has the same reaction again. Will go on website but wanted to find out what other people are experiencing and whether or not to take the second shot. Wants to take it for protection. Really wants to take the shot on Tuesday. Pain in neck and back: Only when he coughs, is more of an ache. Started day 2 after vaccine on 28Mar2021. Was like a very dull irritation in the right side of the neck in Mar2021. Was probably the lymph node in Mar2021.  Pain in chest: When he sneezes in Mar2021, there is a sharp pain, all around the perimeter of his chest. Is gone as soon as he stops coughing. Feels when muscles are contracting in Mar2021. Started day 3 after getting the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Stage 4 was taking chemo. Had bladder cancer, which got out of the bladder and started spreading in to the lymph system. Wants to be put on immunotherapy but can&#39;t until he is finished with his shots. If he gets the immunotherapy and if he has a reaction, would have to use steroids and they do not want to do that with the vaccine. The doctor wanted to start him earlier on the immunotherapy but thought it was important to get the vaccine first, that taken care of.  The pain is only sharp if he lifts something. Otherwise, it is just dull. He knows it is there. It is not completely gone. This morning was the best that he had. Really got good sleep last night. The best since it has happened. When he sneezes, he can kind of feel it around his chest, just around the perimeter of the muscles. Treatment: The first couple of days, just put up with it. Took Tylenol one day and then on another day. Takes at bedtime. Does not like taking Tylenol because it effects his liver. If he doesn&#39;t need it, he doesn&#39;t take it. In the last week, every night he has been less and less bothered by how he slept. Last night he didn&#39;t even know he had it, the pain, and slept really well. Have not taken any meds, just Tylenol on day 4 and 5 to help sleep. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of events very mild sore arm, sneezes and feels when muscles are contracting was unknown. The outcome of other events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

The patient stated that he had many vaccine (Unspecified Vaccine) over the years and have never had anything that hurts so bad after about six hours. The patient just wanted to know that was that normal. Consumer further stated, &#34;I took the vaccine about 10:30 in the morning and about four hours later, it started getting sore but that thing was normal you know some vaccines (Unspecified Vaccine) do that but along with that it started hurting about four hours after the vaccine and it continued to get worse and that night I went to bed and I cannot sleep, it hurts so bad. The patient even have thoughts about getting up and go in to the emergency room. It was the worst pain I have ever had and I could not move my arm. I could not sleep on the right side or on a left side and all I did was take Tylenol as prescribed and that helped a little bit but not much but I did not go to the emergency room, I am not going to do that but I felt like it because it hurts so bad but I made it through the night and next day it continued to hurt really bad. I just keep taking Tylenol every four hours and that continued for two days and then finally I was able to raise my arm up above my head without little pain, it was discomfort, but it was not hurting so bad.&#34; The patient stated that the event started about two hours later it started, it started hurting and then it continued to get worse and worse and it was severe, that is the reason why I am calling that it was severe. I wanted a shot or morphine to relieve myself that how bad it was.&#34; (no clarified further). The patient stated that the vaccine was given in my left arm only about one inch below the top of my shoulder which I think that might have been the problem, I don&#39;t know if you can answer that or not but I have never received the vaccine or shot anywhere near that area, it is always three or four inches down in my muscle, on my arm either on left or right, this was given in my left arm but this was given almost in my joint I am wondering if that would cause pain.&#34; The patient stated it was given only one inch below the tip above shoulder may be that is causing so much pain.&#34; The patient just wanted to report the severe pain, that was for two whole days and then it was subsided and it lasted for four days and I still have uncomfortable feeling in my arm. I was finally able to raise it above my head, my left arm, after two days but it was not comfortable to do it, it was painful.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 82-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient also started to receive mirtazapine (MIRTAZAPINE, 50 mg, Capsule, soft), via an unspecified route of administration, from an unspecified date at 50 mg, once a day for sleep. Medical history included sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], calcium, escitalopram, finasteride, lamotrigine, simvastatin, tamsulosin. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported receiving the Pfizer vaccine in his right arm on 06Feb2021. That evening he took his nightly medication and went to bed at 11:30 pm. He stated he wasn&#39;t able to sleep because he felt like he was in a refrigerator and he was shaking. He had lower back pain, right arm/shoulder pain, and went to the bathroom 5 times (all on an unspecified date in Feb2021), which was not normal for him. The patient added that it was the second dosage of the Pfizer (Covid-19 Vaccine) her received on 06Feb2021. And he had some negative response: a little pain in his shoulder but the worst thing that happened, he went to bed 11:30 did not sleep at all. At 11:30 night, he took his medication (Mirtazapine) and went to bed. He was shaking and he had to put another blanket on himself. Eventually, it was okay, but the problem is he was not able to sleep all night, from 11:30 to 9&#39; O clock this morning (07Feb2021). Consumer stated, &#34;Yesterday my wife and I had the second dose of the Pfizer and I had really strange reaction and I will tell you what it was. Last night at about 11:30 I took my night medicine (later clarified as Mirtazapine), I went to bedroom, I started shaking all over. And the worst part is from 11:30 to 10 o&#39; clock this morning, I was not able to sleep. There is slight pain in my shoulder&#34;. When confirmed if the consumer wanted to report the same or have any questions, consumer stated, &#34;No, we have no problem with temperature is fine, the oxygen is fine. Just I don&#39;t understand why in fact the medication (mirtazapine) is to induce sleeping, use to for sleep within half hour but it didn&#39;t help. I wanted to know what happened. So, this will eventually go away?&#34; The action taken in response to the events for mirtazapine was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on batch number has been requested.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that an 82-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number was reported as &#34;EUO150&#34;/&#34;LU0150&#34;), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 13Apr2021 11:15 (at the age of 82-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included blood pressure, allergy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), liver genetic deficiency, and had allergy mice, cat, dust and trees. The patient previously took sulphur and aspirin and makes him bleed because his blood was already thin. Concomitant medications included amlodipine taken for blood pressure; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for allergy; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]) taken for an unspecified indication; all were start and stop date were not reported. An 82-year-old caller received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine yesterday (13Apr2021), around 11:15 am. He added he was monitored for 15 minutes post injection and then used the public transportation to run some errands and return home. He said he received the injection on his left arm had soreness in this arm after vaccination. He explained around 3-3:30 pm he was walking to get the bus and then felt very tired to the point he wanted to sit on the pavement. He also described it as feeling exhausted. He explained he was so tired on the bus that he was falling asleep and almost missed his stop. He said he also began having joint and muscle pain on the bus. He specified he got home around 4 pm and he then experienced tiredness, headaches, muscle and joint pains, hot flashes, chills, and felt nauseous but didn&#39;t vomit. He specified he felt so hot, he had to turn off the heat and remove his clothes, but then he had chills/cold chills and had to turn the heat back on and thought he had a fever. He said around 11 o&#39;clock he had appetite. He added he had cramping all through the night to the point he wanted to cry. He couldn&#39;t sleep. He specified the pain was in his hands, legs, feet, and joints. He also said he felt tired like he had worked for 12,000 hours and was not able to move. He said he had weakness to the point he couldn&#39;t get up to go to the bathroom. He said he had the headaches all through the night. He was feeling unwell, dizzy. He explained he felt like he was going to die; he was worried about his body. He said he still feels tired. They told him he would only have a sore arm, which he did, but everything else was sore too until about 08:00 today (14Apr2021). He explained that he didn&#39;t have all these issues before vaccination. He explained how disappointed he was with his reaction to the vaccine given that he was reluctant to the unapproved vaccine at beginning because he wasn&#39;t the person that take a lot of injection and medications, and so finally after his primary physician to influence him to get the vaccine. He mentioned he lives alone, healthy, vegetarian, never smoked, never took recreational drugs, does acupuncture, and takes little medications. He explained most people and his acupuncture doctor said he shouldn&#39;t get much reaction from the first dose and the reactions to the second dose are more prevalent. He added he was told that people have mainly experienced soreness in their arm after this vaccination with the first dose. He asked if his symptoms were reported after getting the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Everyone told him the first vaccine is a whiz. That it was easy. The second vaccine is the one that have side effects on. He also stated that he almost called to get an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Said that if he had these reactions with the first one, he does not want to take the second vaccine. Sometimes he regret that he have taken it now because he did not expect all of this to happen to him and they just told him that he will have a sore arm on left arm. He was in kind of shock to experience all of this and he was G6PD (Intent: History). He cannot take Sulfur and Aspirin because that makes him bleed because his blood was already thin but that would be no problem also have a liver genetic deficiency (Intent: History). He was allergic to mice, cat, dust and trees (Intent: History). So, he told all what he had that they knew in the beginning they said none of those things will affect. He take B12 (Intent: History) too once a month, he get injection for allergies for his cats and trees and grass once a month but they told him none of the things will affect him. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

After the first dose, the patient experienced shaking (&#34;the patient was a little shaky following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021, but it was nothing major&#34;) and was nervous (&#34;the wife reported that when it was time to get the second dose on 13Feb2021, the patient was so nervous to get the shot that he was too nervous to drive&#34;). Concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, once daily, in the morning, from an unspecified date to Apr2021, for high blood pressure; eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (VASCEPA) 1 mg, twice daily, from an unspecified date to Apr2021, for blood triglycerides; atorvastatin 40 mg, once daily, from an unspecified date to Apr2021, for blood cholesterol; omeprazole from an unspecified date, for an unknown indication; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D (colecalciferol)) from an unspecified date, for an unknown indication and an unspecified multi vitamins.

He wanted to go outside; vision illusions like people were calling him to come outside&#34;), depression, shaking and he was feeling abnormal (&#34;he went berserk. He was just crazy. Said and saw things that was not there. Patient was hearing people calling him to go outside&#34;). The patient might have Alzheimer&#39;s. Patient&#39;s wife reported that the physician stated that the Covid-19 vaccine might have jump started Alzheimer&#39;s. Treatment was received. Patient was prescribed donepezil, ondansetron, quetiapine, escitalopram, trazodone, and sertraline after he went berserk to help with altered mental status. None of the medications worked. Patient also received risperidone. Patient&#39;s wife reported that even with the risperidone, the patient was not his complete self like he was before he received the Covid-19 vaccine. Risperidone helped some. Relevant laboratory tests, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included: computerised tomogram head (CT brain scan) normal, lumbar puncture (Spinal tap) normal, and magnetic resonance imaging head (MRI brain) normal. Clinical outcome of the events was unknown at time of this report.

An 83-year-old male (also age at vaccination) patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right (reported as Right upper arm) on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported that &#34;I have had one stent and one angioplasty done. Stent was done last year in 2020 and angioplasty was done in &#39;1990&#39; (not confirmed).&#34; The patient also added &#34;I gained a bunch of weight when I had my thyroid removed.&#34; The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date for Covid-19 immunization. For the concomitant medication the patient stated, &#34;Yes, I am taking medications.&#34; (specified medications not reported/ provided). It was reported by the patient that, &#34;I got this, my second COVID-19 Vaccine shot Saturday morning. All day Saturday (27Feb2021), all day Sunday and most of Monday, I was so sick, I didn&#39;t realize what was going on. Yesterday (02Mar2021), I ended up in the emergency room because I was having some problems with chest pain. So, I presume this is all connected to the second shot I got.&#34; It was added by the patient, &#34;I am asking question. About an hour or less than an hour ago I woke up, and my whole body felt like it was itching. I mean my whole body was just feeling funny. I was itching all over, that went away, I took a pill a while ago for that. &#39;Lorazepam&#39; (not confirmed over the call), it&#39;s a nerve, anxiety pill and it kind of helped. But right now, my feet are numb and cold.&#34; For the laboratory test the patient stated that, &#34;Yes they did a lab test on me yesterday (02Mar2021) as I went to the emergency room with some heart problems. They did blood work, that&#39;s all they did.&#34; The patient reported for the results, &#34;They said everything was fine.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient explained that &#34;No, I didn&#39;t take any medication for that.&#34; However treatment was received for Whole body felt like itching, whole body was just feeling funny.

Became bloated with severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath and difficulty walking due to pain. Tried OTC stool softeners, miralax, prune juice and no relief. Seen in ER on 03/20/21 for abdominal pain, bloating and constipation. CT scans did not provide answers. Seen by GI specialist and had colonoscopy and EGD on 03/29/21 which did not provide answers on sudden stop of bowel movement. Almost a month later still not having bowel movements regularly despite taking Linzess as prescribed, still have abdominal pain and bloating daily, difficulty eating due to bloating and pain, have lost 7 pounds in the past 3 weeks and now remaining in bed more throughout the day due to pain/bloating. Becoming depressed and irritable which was NEVER a problem prior to the 2nd Pfizer covid-19 vaccine.

An 83-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Apr2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure and mild case of COVID-19 both from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included lisinopril taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date was not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced chills, fever, weakness, i had couple of days when i had cough at night and little bit of this and that, I am worrying about the reaction because I didn&#39;t realize that I probably had covid antibodies from the mild case that I had and then the shot hit me, was really bit apprehensive, muscle ache, tired, I had like laryngitis type like my vocal cords were little bit swelled and aches. It was reported that the patient had his first Pfizer shot last week and Monday, he had quite a reaction about four to five hours later and had chills, fever and weakness and so forth. He called one of the pharmacists about it and was asked if he had COVID before. The patient said that he was checked in for that but last month or so and was not checked down but he had couple of days when he had cough at night and little bit of this and that and he suspected that he might have something. The patient had COVID before he got the first shot within 5 or 30 days and that is why he got that reaction when that shot hit him. Now, the patient was concerned about the second shot, like if he will have a problem with that too, he was worrying to go to from about 2 or 3 days for that shot which was scheduled for next Monday,  believed it is 3rd of May. The patient was really bit apprehensive about getting the shot simply because they usually recommend 90 days, in other words, after someone had COVID, to not get vaccination until at least 90 days afterwards. So, he was not sure what to do. The patient took as recommended for the fever, he took Tylenol and it was helpful as far as the aches, muscle ache and all that. Also, he was still very tired and the fever that he got after the shot was only for one day or he got it that night and lasted maybe till the next day and he was sure that it&#39;s going to come down and he will feel better. The weakness that linked, had a cough anyway, was going through this cough a little bit and had muscle ache. He also had like laryngitis type like his vocal cords were little bit swelled but was now getting better and it took like a good week like week and a half and that&#39;s why he was concerned about the second shot. The patient thought what he was hoping to do, was to stop a week or two and give it a little bit of time because he may be close to the 90 day window, it appeared the best way to do that but he thought that it was what the experts should be able to tell him. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: No- Negative on 23Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events fever, muscle ache and aches included TYLENOL. The outcome of the event I had like laryngitis type like his vocal cords were little bit swelled was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Our triage nurse retrieved a voicemail from patients daughter on 2/10/2021 stating that her 84 year old father was having delirious reactions from his COVID vaccine.  She said that she has taken him to the ER 6 times.  The nurse called the daughter back and she said that she spoke with someone at Clinic COVID-19 Vaccine Information hotline and was told that they would consult with a doctor and call her back.  The daughter also states that patients primary care physician is involved as well.  The daughter is concerned because her father is very restless and cannot sleep.  The triage nurse encouraged the daughter to call us back if she did not hear from  Health Clinic.

An 84-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 84-years-old) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient started feeling bad and it may have nothing to do with a side effect of the vaccination. On an unspecified date, the patient felt pretty bad. He was coughing up phlegm. He was supposed to go back on 28Apr2021 but he was sick. It occurred to him that maybe he had COVID when he got the vaccine and it was just developing. He was pretty sick. He was coughing up a lot of grey mucous from his lungs. He felt terrible like he had a bad flu on an unspecified date. He might go to the hospital. He probably should have done that anyways. He was dizzy and terribly sick on an unspecified date. The patient was irate and yelling on an unspecified date. The outcome of events &#39;it occurred to him that maybe he had COVID when he got the vaccine and it was just developing&#39;, &#39;dizzy&#39;, &#39;irate&#39; and &#39;yelling&#39; was unknown.

A 84-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Feb2021 (at the age of 84-year-old) as a dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cancer and had surgery, prostate surgery in Tombstone and caller stated he always has headaches. Concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 (at the age of 84-year-old) as a dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that, He gave transfer agent some dates of the 2nd, the 17th and the 21st and then stated it was the wrong one. Those were the dates the transfer agent was given. Transfer agent stated that, the caller never told her which vaccine it was. The caller was transferred to the call handler at that time he was asked to confirm information. The caller was asked whether he was calling about the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine when he referred to vaccine and he stated that, he has had both vaccines, he had them both way back. The caller stated that, the first was 27 21. Caller stated, it is the first month, call handler should not ask him that. The truth was, he cannot remember, was had been a while passed. Call handler asked for clarification of first month and caller does not provide. Call handler asked whether first month January and caller were stated that, it had to have been January or he does not know. The second was the 2nd, 17 27. The caller stated that was the second month, January and February. The call handler attempted clarification, but caller could not provide. He stated that, 27Jan2021 and 17Feb2021 he guesses means the second month and a first month, that was what was written on his card. No further clarification was provided. Dates remain unclear. The caller stated that, the second shot was really rough. It was a hard time before. The caller was asked for clarification and additional details were not provided. Caller stated that, he got the shot, he was skeptical about taking it but it was something he was taking. He was talking to a lot of different people and they were getting him to do what was important. The shots - the cold - nothing. He has never had to do that. He was really pretty to snuff other than at one point he got cancer and had surgery, prostate surgery, in Tombstone when he went through all that stuff. The caller did not provide additional details. Caller stated that, his problem was he saw his neighbor two weeks ago. He has not been talking to her a long time because she was over aggressive and pushy. He has tried to treat her kind but she was a drug addict and he was not interested in her or her lifestyle. He does her favors an cuts her grass. He was not interested in more than the process of doing this. Stated that, he had not talked to her in a long time and she stabbed him coming into the back of the house. She was stressed out and he thought she had a problem. He listened to this between him and her and at one point she got four or five feet from him and it was hot, like 90 something degrees. He was talking to her and he came back to her gate and then he started feeling woozy but maybe it was his head and heat. He could hardly get into the house. Since then, he was concerned about her because she said she had the virus and she worked at the hospital and she had the virus for 3 months and that was scary. The caller stated that, he always has headaches, he has always had them and that has nothing to do with this. The second shot gave him different types of things. Like, he had already had headaches so he could not say that was on the shot. Exposed to Covid-19 after having vaccine. Sometimes, he felt things in his workouts, in his legs and feet, sometimes his back. The caller did not clarified and stated that, he could not make a distinction between the workout and this particular thing. He workouts with 115 to 120 pounds every day and for a period of time it has happened over night. He has always done it, he started when 20 to 21 when it started. Stated that, he was not to the point he could not do what he had to do. He could walk and do all those things that has gotten better. He got a scratchy thing in his throat about 2 months ago. This occurred a long time after the vaccine. it was not so bad it was bothering him but he could still eat and do what he had to do. Still do normal things like his weights and stuff everyday. Something told him to get checked out and they told him to go back home because they could not believe he was so strong and he could hold 50 pounds. The caller was asked to clarify his question and events. Stated that, there was concern because he thought about what his neighbor said, that was 2 weeks ago he talked to her and he wanted to know what call handler thinks. The last two times he went to the hospital they said he did not have no Covid and sent him back home. Another day, they put him to another doctor. The caller stated that, he talked to call handler&#39;s office once before and she did not know the neighbor. He talked to and did checkups with Pfizer because he does not have knowledge and this was all new to him. The caller did not provide additional information. The caller stated that, not to stop and he was covered when he was talking to her. Caller clarified, he means that, he was wearing a mask and ever since he got the shot he was covered and the only time he was around people was the gas station or grocery store. He has no temperature and never did either. The caller was asked to clarify whether his question was regarding that, he had his Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine and then was exposed to his neighbor who had Covid-19 for three months. The caller stated as yes, he wanted to know what call handler thinks because call handler works there and deals with people like him all day. The caller then stated that, he will tell call handler what - maybe he should call his doctor and if that was better he would call, where he has been there a long time and they can check him because of his athletic things and age. Stated that, he started calling them before Pfizer but it was lunch time. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                I experience muscle pain in my upper back muscles, both sides.  When I moved my head, I felp sharp stabbing pains which made me shout. I could not sleep much on March 8 evening. The pain persisted all day Tuesday March 9, 2021.  I called my ortho doctor and made a morning appointment for March 10, 2021 at 8:15am. I did not sleep much on evening of March 9. On Wednesday March 10 I went to the doctor. On this morning, the upper back muscles were OK, and the pain and spasms wer now in the neck. I could hardly move my head up or down and left and right. Dr. perscribed Methylprednazolone (4mg, 6-5-4-3-2-1 doses) and cyclobenzaprine 5mg (3x daily).  after 1 day and 1 dose, I feel I can movemy head a little farther without the stabbing pain.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

Prior to this vaccine he was living alone, preparing meals, driving to errands, etc. Over the following few weeks after release he became unable to live at home so he was moved to an assisted living facility where he rapidly declined and was put on hospice less than 2 weeks after his second Covid shot on 3/2/21 (Lot EN9581) (which he only took because his doctor pressured him).  He died on 6/2/21 of heart failure.

An 86-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 08Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib) and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient was taking loads of medications. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and reported that he had no problems with the first dose. The patient experienced severe left arm pain at the arm where the shot was given on 08Mar2021, the night after he received his second COVID vaccine dose. He almost called a number because he thought he was having a heart attack. What he did was he got up to walk around and the pain went away and when he sat down on his recliner, the pain came back so he didn&#39;t get much sleep that night. He was fine the next day. The patient took an ASPIRIN 325 mg coated pill because he thought he might be having a heart attack. If he had known, he would have taken the vaccine on his right arm. His arm hurt the night of 08Mar2021 until 6:00 AM the following day. The patient then stated that his recommendation was to tell the people who are administering the shot that a left arm pain may possibly occur because anybody who has the left arm hurting is afraid and can think they have a heart attack. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 09Mar2021 at 06:00 AM, and recovered on 09Mar2021 for all other events.

An 87-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 in left upper arm shoulder area at single dose for  vaccination; glimepiride (manufacturer unknown), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 2 mg, 1x/day (once per day in the morning) for diabetes; vitamin d (manufacturer unknown, lot# 300015, expiration date:  Jan2022), via an unspecified route of administration from 2019 and ongoing at 3000 iU, daily (2000 IUs in the morning and 1000 IUs nightly) for bone and immune health; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN, lot# P139558, expiration date:  Aug2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 81 mg, 1x/day for helping thin his blood; apixaban (ELIQUIS, 2.5 mg), via an unspecified route of administration from 2018 and ongoing at 2.5 mg, 2x/day (morning and night) for blood thinner; simvastatin (ZOCOR, 20 mg), orally from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, 1x/day for cholesterol; metoprolol (manufacturer unknown, 50 mg), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 25 mg, daily (1/2 tablet once daily (25mg total daily dose)) for an unspecified indication; celecoxib (CELEXA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at unknown dose with daily (1-20 mg tablet once daily) for clinical depression; vitamin c (manufacturer unknown, lot# 205348, expiration date: Jun2023), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 1 DF, daily for supplement to boost immunity; famotidine (manufacturer unknown), via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at unknown dose with 2x/day (1-40mg tablet twice daily) for nauseated; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12, 2500 mg, lot# 511333-01, expiration date: Jun2023),  via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 and ongoing at 2500 mg, 1x/day for supplement; magnesium (manufacturer unknown, lot# 205340, expiration date:  Jun2022), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at unknown dose with daily (400 mg mostly every day but not strictly every day) to keep himself going; immuneti (manufacturer unknown, Capsule, NDC: 2817636726), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 capsule taken daily  for an unspecified indication. Medical history included bad hearing problem. This consumer called on behalf of her husband to ask about possible side effects he was having. She reported that these possible side effects could be from Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine or his other medications: glimepiride; Vitamin D; acetylsalicylic acid; apixaban; simvastatin; metoprolol; celecoxib; Vitamin C; famotidine; Vitamin B12; magnesium; and Immuneti. She was concerned about the possible side effects and wanted to ask Pfizer if these possible side effects could be from the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine or his other medications. Caller&#39;s husband was administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 15Jan2021. Caller also got her Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 15Jan2021. Neither patient or caller had any problems with the product initially. Then her husband had onset of possible side effects last night. Starting 17Jan2021 after patient took his usual night medications, which caller was unable to clearly define which of the other suspect products that included, patient began to feel real bad. He said he smelled some kind of chemical and caller said she did not smell anything. Patient got to feeling worse and worse and they stayed up fairly late to see if he got to feeling better. When he got up this morning: 18Jan2021, he was feeling some better. He came in the room and when he put his medications in his mouth, before he even got them swallowed, he began to feel bad again-caller was unable to clearly define which of the other suspect products that included. Patient had been on simvastatin a long time and one time they took him off of this and started it back; he had been back on this for about 1 year. Metoprolol was discarded after 10th and 9th of 2021, documented as provided by reporter. Patient started it maybe 2-3 years ago. Vitamin C was Over the counter product, start date was probably 6-8 months ago. Vitamin B12 was probably started about 6-8 months ago. Magnesium was Over the counter product and probably started about 6-8 months ago. Caller verified that there are no other relevant products/medical conditions to provide for this report. She mentioned separately that patient had a bad hearing problem so caller handled his calls for him. The action taken in response to the events for all drugs (except for bnt162b2) was dose not changed. Outcome of events were unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch has been requested.

The patient had other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination for High Blood Pressure, Thyroid, Cholesterol, and Stool Softener. It was reported that the patient has had light symptoms about once or twice a month of disorientation. However since he&#39;s received the vaccine he has not had any fever with either dose but has throughout the day and night doesn&#39;t know where he is, he&#39;s imagining people are here and he is talking to them. He doesn&#39;t recognize where he is at, at times. He wakes up screaming talking to people who aren&#39;t present. Tries to leave the house even though he is vision impaired and has never tried to leave the house on his own. He wakes up sometimes and acts as if he is eating and and does all of the motions as if he is using a spoon and chewing but he hasn&#39;t ate anything and there isn&#39;t any food near him because he is in his bed. It was reported that the events occurred on 06Feb2021. The events were not considered as serious by the reporter (for any criteria). The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Hospital Course:   COVID-19 pneumonia.  The patient was treated with convalescent plasma and IV remdesivir and completed the course.  He was treated initially with IV Decadron which has been transitioned to oral tablets for discharge to complete a 10-day course.   Chronic systolic heart failure.  Coronary artery disease.  Orthostatic hypotension in the setting of chronic hypertension.  The patient does have chronic systolic heart failure with an EF around 20% and is followed closely at the heart failure clinic.  He is chronically prescribed Lasix at 80 mg twice daily, however he did have some episodes of orthostatic hypotension during his hospitalization and has been unable to tolerate other guideline directed medical therapy due to his hypotension.  He is euvolemic at this time.  I have decreased his Lasix dosing to 40 mg twice daily to restart tomorrow morning.  His last dose of the 80 mg of Lasix was yesterday morning.  I do feel that in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased oral intake that he is more at risk for continued hypotension and dehydration aggressive diuresis.  He will remain on aspirin, Plavix, and simvastatin.   Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His last hemoglobin A1c showed good control at 6.3 on 3/3/2021.  His glipizide was held while inpatient.  He was on long-acting Lantus insulin 10 units with stable blood sugars in the hospital.  He was also on correctional lispro insulin.  His glipizide will be resumed upon discharge.

                                                Patient admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and      cough after being diagnosed with pneumonia in the clinic.  He was found to have Covid pneumonia and      was treated with maximal support but unfortunately became profoundly delirious and developed      worsening hypoxia associated with Covid pneumonia.

Decision was made to transition to comfort care and      aggressive life-prolonging interventions were discontinued for primary focus on comfort.  Patient     subsequently expired at 1810 on 04/18/2021.           Patient was vaccinated against COVID 19.   Death Certificate Information:  Part 1: Cause of Death: A. COVID B.

                                                Upon leaving the site my husband had great difficulty walking. Upon arrival home he seemed unusually confused and over the course of the next 15 hrs had bouts of incontinence. He was up 6 times during the night (usually only 1-2x) and unable to get himself out of bed without assistance. Walking continued to be very unsteady. I thought perhaps he had a mini-stroke. I relayed this to his PCP but he didn&#39;t think it was vaccine related

An 88-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER9231), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high, diabetic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he had started no new medications and not had any other recent vaccinations. He took a lot of medications for a lot of things. He was diabetic, had high blood pressure, COPD, a variety of things get over the years, he took medication for these things. He was affected by medications more than most people. No further details provided about his medications. He reacted to medications in general and that because of that he usually took lower dosages. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After 2 weeks from the vaccine. Have weakness and stomach pains and diarrhea. The patient had been artificially sick like 4-5 days since 21Jan2021, and had a test done and it didn&#39;t show up. He said he hadn&#39;t been anywhere to get the virus. He said he didn&#39;t have any fever, his oxygen level hadn&#39;t changed, he had a testing kit with thermometers, so he knew he never had a fever, but he got chills. He got all the symptoms, the stomach problems, diarrhea, back problems, overall weakness and low energy. He was fine two weeks before this, this started almost two weeks to the day and minute from when he went and got the shot. When he got the shot he had nothing, he waited 15-20 minutes with no problems, his arm was hurting for a couple days, but there was nothing else. Two weeks later he got basically an artificial case and the corona virus test said no, clarified to being negative, but he said it didn&#39;t go away, it had been from Thursday to Monday, so 5 days. The big problem was he was supposed to get his second shot Friday, and he had an appointment Wednesday, he would like to ask them too, but he would like to know was it dangerous for him to get the second shot. He didn&#39;t think he can get any sicker. He did not do a report online, he tried to get onto the website but nothing told him how to do it or whatever, so he stayed on the line waiting to talk to someone. Height: he was five feet and nine and three quarters inches tall, he had shrunk with age, everyone got smaller. His arm was not sore for very much, he didn&#39;t remember how long, he got sick two weeks later, and now he was really not well, though he was better than he was on Thursday or Friday, though he was not 100% yet. He would like to know if he should get the second shot, because he was too old to die from a corona virus shot. Investigations: He didn&#39;t know which COVID test they used, they did an instant test with results in an hour. The patient inquiry if he should get the second shot since he had had this artificial sickness for 5-7 days, two weeks after getting the vaccine. He had &#34;sore arm for a couple of days&#34; after the 1st injection, but &#34;nothing more&#34;. However, in the last 4-5 days, he&#39;s been feeling &#34;miserable&#34;. He didn&#39;t have fever. But he&#39;s been experiencing aching, diarrhea, upset stomach, lost weights and nasal drip. He tested negative to the COVID virus. He has a doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled this Wednesday. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                The weeks following vaccination, the patient felt lethargic, dizzy, unstable on his feet. Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

                                                My father was given his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Feb. 13, 2021.  He went downhill the following week.  He fell 9 times and was very confused.  He was taken to the hospital on Feb. 20 and admitted that day.  He spent a week there.  His condition continued to deteriorate.  He was totally bedridden for a week.  His mental status deteriorated.  By Feb. 22, he was unable to talk, he drooled, and had to be fed.  He made  slow improvement later in the week.  We were never given any reason for his condition.  There was no infection, no stroke, etc.  He was discharged and sent to rehab on Feb. 27.  He remained there until April 8.   He is currently doing fairly well.  He uses a walker and gait belt in the house and is receiving home therapy.  He is not as independent as he was before.  His short term memory seems to be more impaired than it was previously.

                                                My Father had been in his usual state of health when he received his first Pfizer Covid-19 shot on 1/12/2021 and his second dose on 2/2/2021.  He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.

He has also reportedly had a cough and some fever.  There has been some report of incontinence of both bowel and bladder.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 3/17.  He and his wife have returned to the home after wintering in another state.  According to his wife, with whom I have spoken this evening, last night he suddenly became confused.  The confusion continued throughout the day today, thus prompting the EMS called to the house and the subsequent journey to the ED for further evaluation.

An 89-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 12:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included vascular dementia; hypertension; hypothyroidism; malignant melanoma of back (resected/in remission); bladder cancer (surgery in Nov2018/in remission); prediabetic; chronic kidney disease stage 3 due to hypertension; and sleep related hypoxia. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included donepezil taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; memantine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; levothyroxine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lisinopril taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lovastatin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; fluoxetine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and unspecified multivitamin tablet. The patient previously received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19) on 26Feb2021 07:45 PM in the left arm for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has not received other vaccine in four weeks. The first day after the shot, there were not any adverse reactions. The next morning at approximately 11:00 am, the reporter found patient laying on the floor next to his bed, eyes glazed over, disoriented, and he said &#34;he felt funny&#34;. The reporter got him sitting up leaning on the side of the bed and called. The EMT&#39;s came and checked his vitals. Within half an hour from  finding the patient laying on the floor, he seemed almost back to normal. However, since he is 89 years old, the patient was transported by ambulance. Blood was drawn, a urine sample was taken, a chest Xray, and a CT scan of his head and his spine were the labs that were run. All the labs came back normal. However, once patient got home after being in the ER for 5 hours, he is very weak, can barely stand and barely walk without human assistance and his walker. The way he is acting is more like he had a stroke. Onset of the events reported as 20Mar2021 11:15 AM. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient used walker due to can barely stand and barely walk; for other events, there was no treatment given. The patient was not diagnosed of Covid prior vaccination and has not been tested for Covid post vaccination.

                                                slightly dizzy; pain in arm slightly; His head was still just a little foggy; Unrestful night; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 89-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN5318), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in arm right (Injected into right shoulder in the muscle) on 10Feb2021 09:50 to 10Feb2021 09:50 (at the age of 89-years-old) as single dose for prevention (COVID-19 immunisation). Medical history included ongoing AFib (Diagnosed 7-10 years ago), sulfa allergy, ongoing to keep bowels soft and pliable, down from 210 lbs (he found out his wife had breast cancer, he lost the weight, prior receiving vaccine), bad ankles (uses a cane and walker and noticed he was having). Concomitant medications included warfarin at 5 mg daily (Started taking 7-10 years) for AFib; diltiazem hydrochloride at 180 mg daily (Started taking 2 years ago) for AFib and omeprazole at 20 mg daily (Taking for 7-10 years) to keep bowels soft and pliable and unspecified medication. They reported that he called Pfizer yesterday about the same question; however, today he would like to know if he can get a letter stating that it was permissible to get the vaccine 4 days short of the 21 days. Caller reports that he received first dose yesterday, and felt slightly dizzy afterwards and today he had pain in arm slightly Feb2021. Caller reports he had a sulfa allergy. Caller was scheduled for second dose on 27Feb2021. He received the first shot this morning. It went along nicely. He had two questions. He went back in to reschedule next appointment and the only thing they had available at (College name) was this month on 26Feb2021 or 27Feb2021, so he picked out the 25Feb2021, which he later stated was 26Feb2021. He had the shot this morning and it was only 15 days and he understands it was not supposed to be given until 21 days and wanted to know if that was true. His second question was after he had injection and he told them he was only allergic to Sulfa, they told him not to worry about it that there were so little problems with that. Before he got it, he had a sleepless night. He said he was old and he was worried about all kinds of things. He started talking to the guy the drove him over. He noticed he was a little dizzy and he probably could drive but should not. They dropped him off at his place and he was only one block away. When he got home, he drank some water and ate lunch and still feels a little bit out of it. He had a feeling if he got a good nights sleep, he would be fine. But, he wondered if it was related to the Sulfa allergy. He was down from 210 lbs. It just happened when he found out his wife had breast cancer that he lost the weight, which was prior to receiving the vaccine. She just passed away 6 weeks ago and had bone and breast cancer. He was bending and his back was starting to arch. He used to be 5&#39; 11.5&#34;. That was before the vaccine. This has been happening for years. He has bad ankles and uses a cane and walker and noticed he was having more trouble right after he got the vaccine. Now, he was not having any more problems than usual. His head was still just a little foggy on 2021. When getting up, he stated he did not fall. He had a very unrestful night on 2021 and it could be related to that. He heard second dose should be 21 days and not 15 days. He provided on his vaccine card. They were having an influx of cases in his area and his wife and he had planned to get the vaccine as soon as they offered it. He said the reason he takes Omeprazole was his insides, all through his hose system, every once in a while he had some problems, and it started to bleed, so this was something to keep it soft and pliable.
