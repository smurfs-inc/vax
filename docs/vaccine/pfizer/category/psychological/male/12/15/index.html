                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

                                                PT was sitting with guardian and started to have seizure like activity for him which consists of audible and visual auras and Right arm twitching. This lasted about 1 min.  Once we got him into a dark room he started having slurred speech and Left sided weakness that lasted about a min.  He was A&amp;OX1.  Pt had a right sided slant in his eyes.  His pupils were dilated to a 9 and were equal and non reactive.  he became sluggish and kept starring off to the right side.  This lasted about 2 mins and 45 sec.  His pupils returned to 6 and were equal and reactive and he became less lethargic.  He started to complain of a head ache.  At 1302 he stated that he stated tapping his face and trying to speak.  He began to have a right sided glance again and his pupils dilated to an 9 again and we equal and non reactive. he did not respond to his name.  This lasted for almost 2 mins. He then stated he was foggy and his pupils returned back to a 6 and were equal and reactive.  He was struggling to find sounds in the room. His Vital signs were initial B/p 138/98 resp 22 HR-78.   at 1320 his B/P was 128/68 Resp 20 HR 80.  Pt was transported by EMS for medical evaluation by his neurologist.

More worrisome was the heart pain he woke up with in the middle of the night and throughout the day on 5/20. He complained of a sharp stabbing pain on left side of his chest and said it was hard to take a deep breath. I gave him ibuprofen and he rested. I called his doctor and they said not to worry, these side effects were normal. I?m a bit nervous for him to get the second vaccine  since he had the chest pain side effects as to why I?m reporting this. I?m surprised they give the same dose to a 80lb child, they do to a 200 lb grown man.

Felt more like a pressure in the bones of his skull and less like a standard headache. The chest pains are sharp and come on sporadically. At first they were accompanied by hacking cough but then progressed to sharp chest pains at random times especially when lying down.  He has difficulty sleeping and staying asleep. Also, lower abdominal pain but no vowel issues.

A 12-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: unknown and Expire Date: unknown) on 22May2021 via unspecified route of administration as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. As medical history it was reported that, he had allergies and allergic to a lot of things, mold, feather dust and everything and dyspepsia. He had been taking Claritin for allergies (but not when he got the vaccine). She stated her son did not have any allergies to medications. Concomitant mediations were not reported. On 26May2021, 4 days after that he was complaining of chest pain. Caller wants to know if her son should get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Caller stated, &#34;He had other symptoms. On Tuesday the chest pain went away then complained again on Thursday. His doctor gave him an EKG and his heart rate was fine. Caller did not take him to the ER at the time because did not want a medical bill. His blood sugar spiked up. He had sweating, vomiting, diarrhea. He said he had &#34;sharp pain in my chest and never felt that before&#34; His blood sugar spiked up. He was dehydrated. He had ketones from it. Caller gave him extra insulin. He had chest pain from the vaccine. It was on Tuesday and happened again on Thursday but had not come back since then. It subsided. EKG was ok.&#34; No one was informed (doctors). I took him to the regular doctor. She did not know. She was not aware of the symptoms. They are not specialized in the medications they are giving. It was hard to give them any kind of referral. Both of us had vomiting, headaches and chills. He had never had chest pains from any vaccines. He had fatigue, these are symptoms form the covid shot. It was 4 days and then 6 days after the vaccine. A fast heartbeat. HCP are not going to help. If they are dosing the covid shots but they are not given the vaccines they did not want to do anything. There was no accountability. Caller having a hard time. No one can give me an answer, no one. Not from the experts, no one was telling me. The vaccine administration should have been through the doctors, they will not take your data without understanding the vaccines. All the kids 12 and up and all male and like my son and probably a lot more but they are not saying it. Caller scared. My son did not have a heart defect. Caller did not know. Heart inflammation; they need to know if it was safe or not. It was scary to know no one knows what was going on or not. Caller asked about myocarditis. The patient had heart burn before but said the chest pain was not that. With the symptoms the caller saw online, she thinks the patient had pericarditis. The patient&#39;s next dose was on 12Jun2021.The caller was reading online that people reported chest pain and ended up in the emergency room and the caller did not want that. All the events occurred on an unspecified date in May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood glucose increased: spiked up on May2021, electrocardiogram: fine on 25May2021 EKG and his heart rate was fine, heart rate increased: fast on 25May2021. The outcome of event chest pain was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of dehydrated. The outcome of blood sugar spiked up, sweating, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, felt sick, extreme fatigue, and slept on and off for about 4 days, dehydration, fast heartbeat and pericarditis was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Threw up twice on Friday June 4 at 9:30am &amp; 1:30 pm. Very uncomfortable, bad headache, no energy. Mostly slept from 6pm Friday June 4 to 5am Saturday June 5. Immediately threw up when he woke up Friday. Threw up again about 30 min. later and 4 more times during the day. Still having bad head pain. Started to become confused and say things that didn&#39;t make sense. Went to ER around 4:30pm Saturday June 5. Blood work showed his sodium level was dangerously low. He was immediately given sodium and transported to Hospital ICU. Had brain MRI, lumbar puncture and lots of blood work done. Brain MRI showed signs of encephalitis. Also had myocarditis. Was in hospital until Thur. June 10.

                                                My child began feeling tired and ran a temperature about a degree warmer than usual for the first three days after his second COVID vaccine on Sunday 13 June. (So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). Thursday he was extra tired and began to complain of itching under the chin in the evening. Friday morning he woke up and had what he described as itchy/painful raised, red patches of skin on his right collarbone, under his chin, across his face (right cheek, temple). His temperature was about 100* and he was, quite frankly, pretty miserable. These weren&#39;t little skin irritations, they were giant patches of inflamed tissue covering the better part of each cheek, his temple, under the chin and then in smaller spots on his collarbones and back. Saturday the rash moved to cover the left side of his face, and the left collarbone. (And no, for the record, I did not switch laundry detergents, change his diet or anything like that.) As of today, 6/21 condition has improved but not fully resolved.

Another customer was there and she noticed him and immediately got him to focus, breathe, popped an ammonia inhalant, applied instant ice pack to his back and neck which brought him out of it.....asked mom and we called 911, EMT&#39;s  responded and transported Patient to the hospital to be checked.

                                                Patient was given the shot at 9:36 am and was asked to sit down for 15 minutes to watch how he reacts with the vaccine. He had been very nervous and anxious before getting the shot because he never had a shot before and was afraid of needle. After around 5 minutes, his dad notified me that his son had upset stomach. I asked the patient if he ate or drank anything in the morning. His dad and he confirmed that he didn&#39;t eat or drink anything (because dad thought that he should not eat anything before getting the shot like getting blood drawn). He confirmed that he breathed okay and didn&#39;t have swelling of lip and throat. His father told me that his son did feel a little bit dizzy and sweating. Since the clinic is full of patients and humidy, I told him and his dad to sit in a room in clinic without patients and bring a fan to the room. After 15 minutes (around 9:51am), after drinking water and eating a banana, all the side effects were gone. He felt better, and he could watch videos/games and have full focus. At 10:24 am (which was more than 30 min resting in clinic), his father and he confirmed that he was feeling better and didn&#39;t have any side effects and decided to leave the clinic and go home.

Went to walk across the room to his brother, turned to look out the window, and all of a sudden fell straight back. Came to 10 seconds later, didn&#39;t know where he was, felt like he had had a bunch of dreams, &#39;everything turned white&#39;, doesn&#39;t remember much, didn&#39;t know where he was (thought he was in bed). He had hit his head on the wood floor, back of head (standing to smacking head). We live on an island, had to take ferry to town. Possible concussion. We went to Hospital in town. We worked with Dr.   They gave us the verbal instructions if HA gets worse, anti nausea meds, rest, ibuprofen; concussion.

Immediately, my wife called Telehealth and described the situation. They said to get him some Benadryl and we gave him that. He also had a headache - we might have give him a Tylenol. With Benadryl - he took four or five doses according to the protocol on the Benadryl. He did not go to school. The next day, he was swollen but not as bad. My wife bought him Claritin and he didn&#39;t do anything because he didn&#39;t know which to take (Benadryl or Claritin). His swelling went away quite a bit that day without taking anything and he went back on Wednesday -there was still a little bit of swelling but not much. He wasn&#39;t feeling great though that whole week. He was still tired and was a bit headachy until Friday or so. Somewhere on the weekend he felt back to himself.  He is due for second vaccine this weekend and we aren&#39;t going to have him take it then. We&#39;re concerned and have decided to hold - the physician said he shouldn&#39;t have had a COVID vaccine two weeks before this Pfizer one (he received the Varicella) on the 29th of April- -Dr said  it should have been a month  or so of waiting  still before  he had this vaccine after that.

                                                Patient presents to the ED with myocarditis s/p dose #2 of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.    From note: Patient is 13 yo M who was in his usual state of health prior to getting his Pzifer COVID-19 vaccine #2 on Saturday morning (6/5). Saturday night he began to feel fatigued with fevers as high as 102.8 F. These symptoms continued through the night and into Sunday morning when he had episodes of NBNB emesis. Sunday night he was actually feeling somewhat better and was able to sleep through the night. He stayed home from school on Monday due to fatigue. At 3 am this morning (6/8), he woke up with aching parasternal non-radiating chest pain that he describes as an 8/10 and worse while lying down. Denies SOB and heart palpitations. His parents took him to a hospital where he was found to have an elevated troponin (reported 5.84 - unknown scale) and Hct 28.8. There was also question of an abnormal EKG (?p wave inversion). He got a bedside echo which showed no pericardial effusion. Additional labs included: WBC nml, plt nml, MBCK 16.   In the ED, his vital signs have been stable. EKG was normal sinus. Trop elevated to 0.43 and echo was normal. Reassuringly his echo was normal, he has had no arrhythmias (after nearly 24hrs of continuous monitoring), his chest pain has largely resolved and his troponin has remained stable.

He received his 2nd Pfizer Covid vaccine on 6/12 and began having symptoms the next night. He began taking ibuprofen for headache and fever. His symptoms worsened through the day until he had vomiting. He was saying strange things and behaving oddly. He became very hot and agitated at home, prompting mom to bring him into an outside hospital ED.  There, rectal temperature was 106F and he was noted to be combative.  A CMP was obtained, which was mostly normal. CT of his head was obtained, during which he had an episode of left upper extremity shaking concerning for seizure. He was reportedly alert throughout.   Patient is a 13 yo M with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents with 1 day of fever, headache, altered mental status, vomiting, found to have cerebral edema and elevated CRP. There is no acidosis, elevated lactate, or metabolic derangement, and utox is neg. The etiology could be related to the vaccine. Ingestions are also possible given the high fever and altered mental status - particularly serotonin syndrome. Infectious etiologies are also possible given the fever.

A 13-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0167, expiry date: Aug2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 13May2021 at 12:15, as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and other allergies compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity were none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no family medical history relevant to AE. The patient received no other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. On 13Jan2021 at 20:00, 8 hours after getting the shot, the patient experienced tonsils started hurting. He didn&#39;t feel well and had headaches. On 14Jan2021, he had some pretty bad symptoms on Saturday morning, he woke up with herpes zoster on his lips and his mother called to pediatrician and he was very dismissive about it and said that if the body was under stress it can come out, but he never had anything like this before. It looks like little pustules around his mouth and looks like when my mom had shingles. He did mention his arm hurt a little but went to soccer practice. Clarifies the herpes zoster didn&#39;t show up until Saturday evening/night and it was starting to go away. She took son to get Covid PCR testing on 14Jan2021 and it was negative and was told that the herpes zoster was probably a reaction to the vaccine. The patient received treatment with Abreva. The outcome of the events Since the first dose he woke up with what mother states is herpes zoster on his lips was not recovered, and the other event feeling horrible was unknown, and all other events was recovering.   PSCC Communication: PC Filed Product Complaint: Yes, Description of Product Complaint: Description of complaint: Asks if this could be a bad one since he was so sick and took him to get Covid PCR testing and it was negative. Thought was weird since she and her husband both had the Pfizer Covid shot and did not have any reactions. This was son&#39;s first Covid vaccine, Lot number: EW0167, expiry.

                                                My son experienced palpitations and racing heart, described an 8-10 chest pain level from Midnight to 4am on July 1st, before this poor boy finally came to wake me up. He said he?d been trying to relax himself and felt like he had been exercising. He had only been laying in bed trying to go to sleep. No electronics, no sugar as these are things we asked him thinking he riled himself up somehow. No to all those questions. Just laying down the whole is what he said.

                                                He woke up with chest pain in the upper right quadrant at midnight and then it intensified when he was breathing deep breaths. They woke him up when he was sleeping and did not go away. Then, it continued through the next day and we asked our doctor if we needed to keep an eye on him because of all the reporting and stuff about the heart problems. They did a triage consult visit to see if it could be an adverse event from the vaccine. The course of action was to take 2 ibuprofen every 4 hours and use ice and heat to see if the pain improved to rule out musculoskeletal situations because that was what they thought it was. We did that for 2 days and then the pain moved to his back upper right quadrant and we noticed a rash all over his abdomen and we were not sure where he got that. Based on the fact that the pain moved the doctor was more confident that it was not an adverse event.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

                                                Patient passed out immediately following administration of the vaccine to the left deltoid. His head fell backwards and limp. The Rph administering the vaccine moved in front of the patient and gently moved his head into an upright position. The patient had mild muscle spasms and twitches while passed out but when he regained consciousness he immediately began talking saying he was ok. Father came into the consultation room at that point and Rph explained what had occurred. Patient looked a little pale and eyes were having a hard time staying open so with the help of his dad Rph helped him down to the ground in the corner of the room so he could have back and head support from the wall. Patient was given a glucose tablet and water, and later orange juice.

He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

Pharmacist and patients mom got patient down on the ground flat with legs elevated on chair, a cold pack and water.  Pharmacist did not witness loss of conscientious.  Patient was nervous about getting vaccine.  We called 911, emergency services came, did a work up.  It appeared to be a vagal response, possibly from fear of needles.  When emergency services got patient up he seemed a little nauseous.  They took him to hospital.

Pain is central, to the right of the sternum, without radiation. The pain then became more dull, aching, and has been interfering with his sleep. It does seem to be worse when he is thinking about it, better when he is distracted. He went to basketball tryouts 6/15 and the pain has been more frequent since that episode of strenuous exercise. He has not taken anything for the pain. He also notes more frequent fatigue. He denies any prior covid infection. No recent illness or sick contacts. Denies cough, fever, GI upset, diarrhea. He is going to school in-person, they all wear masks.

Initially after the vaccine he had some generalized fatigue and nausea but yesterday started experiencing some chest tightness lasting up to 4 minutes.  He also feels an irregular heart rate or like his heart is bounding.  He also had some generalized bilateral neck stiffness.  This is all resolved currently.  He did vomit 1 to 2 hours ago.  No fevers or chills.  No cough or cold symptoms. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with ST 1 box upsloping elevation V3 through V6.  Initial troponin is elevated at 2.6.  Attempted to consult  cardiologist  and they recommended pediatric cardiology consultation.  Spoke with Dr. .  She recommended admission with trending troponins and Motrin.  She says they typically do echocardiogram and if normal then cardiac MRI.  Spoke with Dr.  in the  ER and they graciously accept patient in transfer.

Myself as well as 2 of my technicians checked in on him for  a total of 3 checks. He was waiting for another person to get their vaccination. Upon checking in on the other person (he was still sitting in the waiting area) I asked him how he was feeling. Approximately  25 min had elapsed. He said his throat felt weird like closing. I had him remove his mask immediately. I assisted him to the immunization booth. He was able to walk on his own. I observed him. He said it felt the same maybe a little worse. No other signs of allergic reaction. Technician called 911. He said he was not dizzy and his color was normal. His blood pressure was slightly elevated. He said he had to keep yawning and felt tired and his throat seemed to be getting worse. I administered an epipen and immediately afterwards the paramedics were there. He walked to the stretcher and they took him to the hospital for further evaluation.

I had him sit for monitoring with his family. His parent told me he still felt weird, and that they walked around the store, but now he has a bad headache and feels a little winded. I had him sit in the immunization room with mask off for further monitoring. After a few more minutes, he said it felt like he was suffocating. I administered 1 Epi-Pen at 10:08PM in his left thigh and called an ambulance. Soon after, he was shaking/shivering, but said it was getting easier to breathe. EMT arrived shortly after, noted the hives on his back, and took him to the hospital.

                                                Patient reports onset of chest pain three days after his second Pfizer COVID vaccine. In the following three days after his vaccine, he had headache, decreased appetite, and mild nausea. However was still taking in fluids, decreased solid food intake. He also experienced insomnia and generalized malaise. At midnight on 07/02 he began to experience 9/10 substernal chest pain that was sharp, burning in sensation and located in the middle of the chest, non-radiating, pleuritic which lasted for several hours. Patient has had no fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, congestion, sore throat or cough. Denies any  SOB, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, edema, orthopnea. There has been no trauma to the chest. No recent URIs. He was seen at a hospital where he was found to have a trop of 1251 ng/L (converting to ~1.5 in our system) then one hour later up to 1500mg/L. His EKG at the hospital demonstrated lateral ST elevations. Had a normal CXR. He was given Maalox which was not helpful. He was transferred to another medical facility after 3 hours at the hospital.   Upon presentation to the emergency department, his vitals were stable. He had elevated CRP to 7.69, troponin was 1.0. CBC and Chem were normal. BNP normal at 15. Bedside ultrasound showed no pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted and ECHO showed mild left ventricular dysfunction with EF 47%. Repeat EKG here showed ongoing ST elevations in lateral leads, though mild. His pain has since improved to a 2/10. He has not required any medication for his pain. He is COVID/flu/RSV negative.   On arrival to the floor, his chest pain had completely resolved. Patient reports the pain was pleuritic, worse with exertion and improving on rest.   PMH: idiopathic urticaria  Allergies: NKDA  Family history: none reported, no cardiac disease or sudden cardiac death  Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 2 doses. He initially had some very mild chest discomfort that improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which showed improvement in his EF to 54%. Given his dysfunction, he was started on Enalapril 2.5mg twice daily. He was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were trending down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional PVCs but no arrhythmias. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.  By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.

                                                At approximately 6 PM on 05/23/2021, family was sitting down for dinner when all of a sudden she noticed that he was turning his head to the left and appeared to be falling out of his chair.  Mom states that eyes were darting back and forth at this time.  He was not responding to her shouting his name and his left arm was curled in towards his body with the rest of his body remaining stiff.  This lasted approximately 1 minute, followed by a time of confusion and drowsiness.  Approximately 1 minute later mom states that patient&#39;s eyes rolled back to his head and he had full body movement consistent with tonic-clonic seizures.  Family were able to lay him onto the ground during this time.  Mom denies any color change, apnea, or loss of bowel or bladder.  States he did have one episode of emesis following the event, and 2 episodes of emesis in the ambulance on the way to ED.  Patient has no previous history of seizures or seizure-like activity.  No new ingestions.  Has not been sick recently and denies any new sick contacts.  There has been no head trauma.   Per Mom, patient&#39;s dad has a history of &#34;partial seizures&#34; but never required any medication for them.   At arrival to the ED he continued to be drowsy and not at his normal baseline.  Continue to hold his left wrist up toward his body in a contracted manner and tended to have repetitive speech.   Briefly, ER course significant for a CT head and evaluation by pediatric neurology.  CT head was unremarkable for acute intracranial process.  A CBC, CMP, and coags were also obtained due to patient&#39;s continued contracture positioning and the possibility of a stroke.  CMP was unremarkable with a sodium of 139, potassium of 3.7, chloride of 107, bicarb 25, BUN of 12 and creatinine of 0.64.  CBC was also unremarkable with WBC of 10.72, hemoglobin of 14.8, hematocrit of 44.4 and platelets of 370.  There was 81.77% neutrophils after evaluation by neurology it was felt that the patient remained postictal and recommended that he be admitted on continuous EEG and possible MRI in the a.m.

We took him to the local hospital and after examination they said the blood work and ekg was fine so they released him. We are at home now and he feels the pain still if he pauses his breath, and he just showed me you can hear a very strange sound coming from his heart as it beats. I can hear it sitting near him a loud pumping or squirting sound in there as his heart pumps! Never heard anything like that before coming from someone?s chest!

                                                My 15-year-old son received dose #2 of Pfizer?s Covid-19 vaccine at 10:30am on 6/6/21. At 1:00am on 6/8/21 he was struggling to breathe due to pain in the center of his chest upon inhalation. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before. His chest pain was worse lying down and he could not lie down or sleep and wanted to stay standing on his feet. He felt pain in both forearms too. He was crying from the pain and the difficulty of breathing, and was very tired but unable to recline in order to sleep. I called the advice nurse, who checked with the doctor on call at his pediatrician?s office, and she told us to go to the ER due to concern it may be myocarditis or pericarditis.

                                                Pt was a little nervous before receiving the vaccine, but did fine. He was sitting with his brother for the 15 minute wait period when his brother called for help. I told my staff to call 911. Pt had his head back and his legs outstretched in front of him. He was unresponsive at first and pale. Then he sat upright and said he thought he had just hallucinated. He was distraught and did not understand what had just happened to him. I asked the brother if an adult was with them. He called for his mom and she suggested we lay patient down on the floor. She sat with him until EMS arrived. A paramedic took his blood pressure and EKG. He drank some soda and was able to sit up, his color returned, and he was able to stand.

                                                PT had his first dose of Pfizer vaccine at 5pm on 21st. He looked low energy at night. We felt his forehead and he was warmer than usual. However, thermometer did not show he had a fever. He looked much better in the morning on 22nd. We thought that was it.  Only after a week did PT tell us he had more reaction. However, because he was well then, we did not pay too much attention. When we learned of the link between Covid 19 vaccine and Myocarditis, we asked him in detail again. Here are his responses.  He started feeling his throat hurt when he had dinner that around 7pm. It lasted only that night.  He started feeling chest pain around dinner time too. It only hurt when he moved. That chest pain lasted longer and disappeared on the 23rd.  He started feeling there were air bubbles under his skin on the flat part of his left shoulder (above the injection site and below his neck) on the 22nd. He did not see them. He just felt them. When he pressed them with fingers, he felt them popping. This feeling lasted for a total of three days. He could feel the amount of air bubbles become less over the three days.   We have not seen any side effect in the news like his. We are not sure that he should get his second dose. Please someone could advise us, please send us an email. Much appreciated.

                                                Patient  came in for 2nd dose and was already anxious about getting the vaccine as he had the same fainting episode after the first dose. Rph and intern giving vaccine where both in the immunization room along with the dad.  Rph counseled patient on what to do if feeling light headed and to help prevent fainting . Intern gave vaccine and within a few seconds he said it was getting dark and so immediately as the patient was sitting down I grabbed him gently from the front and his dad came and held him from behind. We both supported him as he was sitting down and within 10 seconds he came back and was fine.  We then moved him to the floor lifted his legs and supported his head and he remained there for about  20 minutes. He then sat up slowly and we monitored him sitting for another10 minutes. He we doing well. My intern then proceeded to help his dad walk them out to the car. The dad did NOT want us to call paramedics as this was a known issues with his son fainting after getting immunizations. Made a follow up phone call with patient after about an hour and half and dad said he was doing great.

                                                My son developed neck soreness and and an enlarged lymph node that weekend.  On Monday following the vaccination a severe headache started which lasted 4 days, even with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Tuesday, he started complaining about not remembering what he did the day before when he woke up in the morning..memory started coming back around noon. The memory issues lasted one week and began to dissipate thankfully.  After a few weeks got a call to schedule his second shot.  Called the pediatrician and the pediatrician told us not to administer the second vaccine due to adverse reaction to the first.   We are monitoring his memory issues..he is almost a straight A student in school last year and on an Advanced Learning Plan in high school due to high IQ. We will know if this is long lasting after attending school and monitoring his grades and headaches in the fall.

                                                Starting from the night of the second day (i.e., June 10th), the patient feels chest pain. The pain also extends to neck and left shoulder. Deep breath aggravates the pain. The patient could not fall asleep. He had a light fever at the night of vaccination day but the fever was gone before the chest pain.  Single lead ECG with Watch has been measured and sent to a friend of the parents&#39; who is a physian, and no abnormal sign was shown from ECG. 400 mg Advil (ibuprofen) was given in the coming morning around 7 AM and the patient was able to fall asleep and symptons were gradually relieved. Another two doses of 200 mg Advil were given with six hours apart on the same day. The pain was gone by the following morning (i.e., June 11th) and no ibuprofen has been given afterwards. We suspect that this is related to myocarditis or pericarditis.  This was the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. There was no symptons for adverse effect after the first dose.

                                                Patient felt like he was having an asthma attack on the night of the 21st when playing outside with friends (running and climbing). He has never had asthma, but said his chest was tight and it was hard to breathe. He said when he stopped and sat for a while it seemed to get better. He went to sleep at about 2am and woke me up at 5:20am crying. His chest hurt really bad and the pain was traveling down his arm. When we took his blood pressure at home it was 205/125 and his heart rate was 112. We went to the emergency room at hospital immediately. Once there they did an EKG. The doctor said there was not reason to be alarmed, but the EKG showed signs of possible pericarditis. They then took blood work, a urine sample, an xray and did an echocardiogram. The doctor told us that the blood work did not show any signs of an actual heart attack or any damage done to the heart. She said the echocardiogram showed some fluid build up in the pericardia sac surrounding his heart. She said this is considered pericardia. She mentioned that some young men are having this happen after being vaccinated. She said we seem to have caught it early. They gave him Tordal through his IV when we were there and that took his pain away. We were told to follow up with a cardiologist within 24-48 hours. We have an appointment at Hospital tomorrow at 10:45am.

                                                Patient had a vagal response caused by an anxiety attack due to fear of needles. Technician, gave the vaccine and then immediately called me in. The mother and son were worried about the needle disappearing due to the retraction mechanism. The son was loosing color in his face and becoming dizzy. I had him sit upright, talked with him for a few minutes, gave him Benadryl as a precaution, and checked his blood pressure. He was having no difficulty breathing and blood pressure was WNL. His mother said that he has passed out with needles before and that he had not eaten today. Eventually the patient claimed to lose his sight, and within 30s passed out. He was still sitting in the chair, bent over, vomited, and then immediately came back to consciousness. The patient then said that he felt fine and wanted to leave. I talked with him and his mother for around 20 minutes, had him eat a banana, and drink a full bottle of water. After the time, he felt fine and him and his mother left.
