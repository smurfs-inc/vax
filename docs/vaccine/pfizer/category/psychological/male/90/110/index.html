                                                Severe abdominal pain unable to eat or sleep for 36 hours. He went by ambulance to the Hospital emergency room. They tried to pump his stomach but he aspirated and and went into cardiac arrest. He was revived but never regained consciousness. (The ICU Dr said that he had blood clots in his abdomen from a recent stroke. We were unaware of him having a stroke other than in 2026. The same Dr. said that he had necrosis in his lungs from aspirating. The necrosis was from his bowel dying) He was put on a ventilator and given drugs to increase his heart rate. On 3-5-21  the heart drugs were reduced and he died. I was with him when he recieved the vaccination and he was healthy, just old. I think that the shot killed him.

His oxygen levels decreased and his blood work showed low platelets, so he was admitted to hospital on March22-23.  Discharged with recommendations to see hematologist.  Bone marrow biopsy indicated a very rare form of leukemia (Hairy Cell ).  Cancer likely not a cause of vaccine of course, but suspected low blood platelets and exacerbation of COPD?

Patient was anxious, napped during the day, couldn&#39;t sleep at night, couldn&#39;t concentrate on anything for any length of time, breathing irregular, had no energy to walk; 03/11-16/2021: in Hospital 04-10-14/2021: in Medical Center, for ablation and pacemaker. Great improvement, had more energy, was ale to drive again but was not back to his active self pre- 02/23/2021. Medications as of 04/27/2021 were Allopurinal 300mg daily; Atorvastatin 10mg, daily; Eliquis 5mg 2x a day; Furosemide 20mg daily; Melatonin 10mg, daily; Metoprolol succinate ER 50mg daily; Valsartan 40mg, daily; Adult 50&#43; Eye Health, daily; multivitamin, 1 daily; Docusate sodium 50mg as needed.  By 05/26/2021, the patient is once again sleeping off and on during the day, has no energy, coughs more, can&#39;t concentrate, has lost his appetite, is anxious and discouraged. His speech is often muffled instead of clearly enunciated as is his wont. The medications have been adjusted again:  as of 06/07/2021, Metoprolol 200mg, daily; Furosemide 40mg daily; the other medications remain the same. The patient, over the more than 3 months, has had xrays, electrocardiagrams, CT scans; bloodwork done. The question is: is it possible that these seemingly uncontrolable atrial fibrillation episodes are an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer vaccine? Has research been done on the vaccine and cardiac problems?

A 90-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- UNKNOWN) via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 28Jan2021 as 1st dose, single (at the age of 90-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination Facility Type was reported as Clinic. Vaccine was not administered at another Facility. Patient medical history and concurrent conditions included: Ongoing prostate cancer with onset at least 15 years ago, extraction of 2 molar teeth which was done last week on an unspecified date in 2021, height shrunk. The concomitant medications included ongoing leuprorelin acetate (LUPRON) injection about every 4 months taken for prostate cancer with last dose administered last week. On 28Jan2021, patient was pretty much been in bed most of the time, had body aches, chills, headache, sheer exhaustion, felt like he got hit by a truck. The patient was administered his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 28Jan2021. The patient is normally incredibly active. He does all of his own lawn moving, snow shoveling and he still works. Starting the night of 28Jan2021 he had pretty much been in bed most of the time ever since. Most of the time since then he has had lots of body aches, chills-but no fever, headache and just sheer exhaustion. The patient went into work at the office for a couple hours Monday (01Feb2021), he pretty much slept all day Tuesday (02Feb2021). They called the patient doctor office, and the nurse gave a not real professional response to the events reported to her, that it is really common to have body aches for 2 weeks. They reported to the nurse that this is not normal for the patient. The nurse told them that this happens all the time; but advised them that if they think it is a problem to take him to the urgent care. They have not heard of people with the first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine being so knocked out. Some days he was ok, some days the adverse events were incredibly bad. A day before (03Feb2021) he was fine for a couple of hours, on Monday (01Feb2021) he was fine for a couple of hours. His usual statement regarding these adverse events was that he felt like he got hit by a truck. The outcome of the events was unknown.    Follow-up (19Apr2021): This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

                                                After the first dose my father got what the eye doctor thought was pink eye. After treating him it didn&#39;t clear up. It was later diagnosed as herpes of the eye and he became blind in one eye. Shortly afterwards I read an article from researchers who stated they had found fragments of the herpes virus in the vaccine. After the second vaccine he was fine one day and 2 days later started having seizures. He was hospitalized for the seizures. His personality totally changed. He no longer recognized my sister. He also became hostile which is not the person he was. He was released from the hospital and brought to a new facility. Then the lights went out. he just stared off into space. A day later he was dead.

A 92-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3246, expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 am (at the age of 92-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in other type vaccination facility: park. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported. There was no history of any previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were no other additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. On an unknown date in 2021 patient experienced dizziness, weakness, tiredness, was sleepy, lightheadedness, unstable feeling. On 30Jan2021 patient had shoulder pain (arthralgia). It was reported that patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine 9 days ago. However, he said he was still experiencing mild tiredness, weakness, and dizziness. He wants to know if these side effects are still associated to the vaccine and if it is normal that he is still experiencing it 9 days after his 1st dose. He also mentioned that he has no temperature and his pulse and blood pressure was normal. It was then reported that patient was still suffering some side effects 2-1/2 weeks after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said the side effects come and go. He said the side effects will last 4-5 hours, and then go away, and come back the next day. He said he has checked his blood pressure and pulse, and they are both OK. He said he uses an oximeter to check his oxygen level, and his oxygen is good. He said he sleeps well at night. He said he is having periods of dizziness, weakness, and feeling tired and sleepy. He said he feels lightheaded and unstable on his feet, also. He said he feels fine now. He said his right shoulder is bothering him a little, too. He said his right shoulder was uncomfortable and bothered him if he laid on it at night. Reported his back was bothering him, so he bent over a little, but if he stands up straight, he was about 5&#39;10&#34;. He stated his side effects started a day or so after he received his COVID-19 Vaccine, and he can&#39;t remember the exact day. He said the side effects lasted continuously for several days, or about a week. He said now his side effects are sporadic. He said in the morning he will wake up and feel OK, and then after a while the side effects start. He said some days his side effects will start in the morning, and other days his side effects won&#39;t start until the afternoon. Patient declined any treatment. He said he read that any side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine only last 2-3 days. Reporter wants to know if it is a problem that he is still having side effects after 2-1/2 weeks or is there some action he should be taking. He said he figured Pfizer is the expert, so he would ask Pfizer directly. He said otherwise, he was thinking of going to an urgent care to see what the urgent care thinks of his side effects. There was no emergency room or physician office visit. There were no relevant tests. Reported his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was scheduled on 26Feb2021 at 9:30AM and asked if still can get the 2nd dose Vaccine after having a reaction to the 1st dose. No PQC was present. Outcome for the events weakness, periods of dizziness, tiredness, lightheadedness, sleepy, unstable feeling was not recovered, outcome for shoulder pain was recovering and for unstable on his feet, back discomfort was unknown.

Medical history included type 2 diabetes, CHF, impaired kidney function, atrial fibrillation, multiple strokes, dementia/memory issues, confusion. Concomitant medications were not reported (unspecified 15 meds). The patient previously took blood thinners. It was reported that the patient suffered from memory loss and dementia, and on 19Jan2021 his confusion was the worst the reporter had ever seen. He was totally inattentive - like, he kept tuning out until she said, Dad, Dad. Then he&#39;d listen and it was as if he couldn&#39;t remember the sentence from 2 minutes ago. He was having difficulty putting together a coherent thought. He was not in any pain. The patient still functioned well. She said since receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine, she noticed that her dad&#39;s cognition has degraded in a very concerning way. He was very confused and anxious. She said this was all new behavior, and just started to happen after her dad received the vaccine. Then last night on 19Jan2021, apparently he wandered, which he never does, and he tried to push a nurse or aide, and tried to go into a neighbor&#39;s room, a friend, so he was looking for a safe place, and he was hitting a doorknob, and he is on a blood thinner, so he wounded himself and bled, he is on blood thinners, he didn&#39;t bleed out, she wrapped his wrist and it&#39;s fine. No treatment was received for the events &#39;his confusion was the worst I&#39;ve ever seen. He was totally inattentive&#39;. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a facility. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No known allergies. Outcome of the event &#39;his confusion was the worst I&#39;ve ever seen. He was totally inattentive&#39; was not recovered while unknown for the other events.

The patient experienced disorientated, in a lot of pain in his chest and rib area, hurt to breathe and move and short of breath/it hurt to breathe on 29Jan2021. The reporter seriousness for the events was medically significant. The events didn&#39;t require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The patient did go to urgent care. The caller explained her father became disoriented. He received the first vaccine on 28Jan2021. The next day, her father began to move his car around 12 pm and he became disoriented and stated he wasn&#39;t going to drive. Caller stated they were not aware of this disorientation until Friday, 29Jan2021. Her father was not sleeping and was up the night before because he was in a lot of pain in his chest and rib area. It hurt to breathe. He was short of breath. It hurt to move. Caller clarified further her woke up feeling so bad he thought he was going downhill. He thought his cancer got worse over night. He told the caller&#39;s brother after he became so disorientated that he was no longer going to drive because he was so shaken up. He was taken to urgent care on Friday, 29Jan2021. He was prescribed Naproxen, 500 mg Friday evening and he slept all night for the first night in years. He usually gets up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. He woke up on Saturday morning, 30Jan2021, and he was feeling 100% better. He recovered completely. He was up moving around and in no pain. Caller verified she has no NDC, Lot number and expiry date for the Naproxen her father was prescribed. She didn&#39;t see any of that written on the discharge papers, that may be with the pharmacy. She wanted to put a chest x-ray was done. He has Metastatic Prostate Cancer and the pain was coming from the lesions on his lung and rib. Caller explained the Chest X-Ray showed the mets (metastasis) but no new lesions, no infiltrates or anything.

A 93-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261, Expiration date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 24Jan2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 93-year-old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization in hospital. Medical history included muscle relaxant, blood pressure or cholesterol and broken neck from 1978 to an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing atorvastatin calcium 10mg taken once daily by mouth for blood pressure or cholesterol taking for a while, ongoing propafenone hydrochloride 150mg taken one twice daily by mouth, taking for a while, ongoing baclofen 10mg taken one five times daily by mouth as muscle relaxant taking for years, ongoing diltiazem HCL 180mg taken once daily by mouth, taking for long time, ongoing mirtazapine 30mg taken one at bedtime by mouth, taking for a while, ongoing citalopram HBR 20mg take once daily by mouth, taking for a while. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced unable to sleep, aches and pains, arm was sore, on 25Jan2021, experienced weakness, severe muscle weakness, on 26Jan2021, experienced increased confusion and on an unspecified date, experienced fatigue, unable to get up on his own, heavy breathing and thick mucus. But his father has tremendously decreased. Mentions his father was previously independent, using a walker, going to exercise class by himself and totally fine. Now after receiving the vaccine his father is unable to sleep, has aches and pains, was experiencing increased confusion and profound weakness. Adds his father can&#39;t get up on his own and has to be guided to use the walker if he can get up. They did call his HCP and were advised not to get the second dose and to make sure patient was eating and drinking. He was scheduled to receive the second dose on 14Feb2021 but he was unsure if he will get it. Adds his father had been water walking everyday and this wasn&#39;t like him. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                I received  my first COVID 19 Pfizer Vaccination on Jan. 21, 2021 from clinic about 2:30 pm. I am age 94.  My wife brought me home about 3:30 pm and I was tired and went to bed and to sleep. I slept soundly until about 8 pm, and my wife awoke me to eat.  I was too weak to sit up or stand, my legs felt like rubber.  I didn?t feel like eating, and I couldn?t answer her questions coherently.  My wife was worried and called the 911. They checked me and found my vital signs were normal, so they helped my wife get me settled in bed. The next few days I still felt weak and had to use a cane or walker.  My second dose is scheduled for February 11, 2021 at 2 pm.  Will I likely have worse side affects?  What precautions should I take.

He presented to this institution on 4/19 with aphasia and confusion, concern for stroke. MRI showed no signs of stroke and at discharge 5 days later he was back to baseline. Pt underwent standard inpatient COVID-19 testing: rapid test was positive on 4/19, then PCR test was negative on 4/20. Patient is s/p Pfizer vaccine with his first dose on 1/20 and second dose on 2/10. He was asymptomatic, with no hypoxia and did not starts steroids nor remdesivir. Team decided that presentation is most consistent with false positive, but per ID and epidemiology, pt must remain in isolation for 10 days as a precaution.

A 95-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient has a hearing and memory problem. He later clarified the main thing is he wanted to know if he can continue with getting the second COVID vaccination. He wanted to continue but wanted to know if these symptoms will prevent him from continuing with getting the COVID vaccination. He confirmed he has no problems around the injection site. However, this is the second day and in Jan2021, he had dizziness. On 11Jan2021, last night he had a very bad headache and fatigue. This morning he is feeling better, but he still has slight dizziness. He is still three weeks away from getting the next vaccine. He wanted to know if he would be able to still take it. He wanted to be immune and to know if there would be any reason why he cannot take the second dose of the vaccine. He then mentioned these symptoms that he is speaking of are general symptoms and he assumed other people have reported them along with him because it is listed on the information sheet. Outcome of the events of dizziness, fatigue and headache was recovering, other events was unknown.    Information about batch/lot number has been requested.
