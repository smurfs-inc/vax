After the chills my mind went in to a fog, found it very hard to concentrate, and felt like I was moving in slow motion. Also had some GI upset, but discharge. The fog lasted until 4:00 pm.

It cleared in approximately a minute. The 2nd heat flash came on about 5 to 10 minutes later and cleared about a minute later. The 3rd heat flash came on about another 5 to 10 minutes, again clearing at about 1 minute. Next I felt like my head was in a fog, found it very hard to focus, and was forgetting what I was doing. I walked over to the office, my supervisor asked if I was ok as she said it looked like my eyes were glazed over, my head was still in a fog. This cleared by 2:30 p.m.

Approximately 30 minutes later my head was in a fog, I could not focus, thoughts left my mind. When returning to my office my manager asked if I was ok and said my eyes were glossed over and my face was red. All this cleared around 2:30 pm.

About tens of consuming them, I felt like I was getting a cold and had to keep clearing my throat.  I told my wife I feel wired and she mentioned my right eye looked different.  In about two more minutes my right was swollen closed and speaking became difficult due to the swelling.  My wife drove me to Hospital and I received Epinephrine and Benadryl and fluids.

It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown.

                                                I have been have contact with my primary care doctor because of the reaction with the first dose. He advised me to take Benadryl 15 minutes before receiving the injection.  I stayed at the vaccination site for an hour instead of 15 minutes. I left the vaccination site and went home and went to sleep, I worked over night. I did not sleep well that day. I got up around 6pm and I went to work at 10pm and I was extremely anxious and tired all night. I was a little confused while at work. I got off work and went to my chiropractor who noticed and my wife also noticed that I was extremely pale, after the appointment I went home and went back to bed. When I woke up I was still exhausted that I ended up calling out out of work that night.  I went back to bed and slept all night till 9am this morning. The next morning my color was back and I was looking better. My energy level is slowing  improving but still feel tired even when I got a good nights of sleep. I don&#39;t know if it related, but I went and brought some new shoes and then my hip started hurting. It is to the point where I set up a doctor&#39;s appointment on Monday to have my hip looked at.   See VAERS report 906796 for first dose reaction.

                                                hives; anxious; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional. A 61-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) intramuscular at the right leg on 25Jan2021 (lot number EN5318 and expiry date unknown) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a nursing home/senior living facility. Medical history included COVID prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. On 25Jan2021, the patient experienced hives and was anxious, the patient was taken to the hospital. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The events caused hospitalization on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events hives and anxious was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the urticaria and anxiety. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 61-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL9621), intramuscular on the left arm on 22Jan2021 (reported as 07:45 to 08:00) at a SINGLE DOSE for prevent COVID, at 61 years old. Medical history included triple bypass surgery from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime. Symptoms (unspecified which) reported as recurring and are notably worse at bedtime. Patient is hesitant to receive the second dose. The patient stated he just went to sleep and prayed and then when he woke the next day, at night it did it again. At night it comes and goes, and he still has it happen but not like the first time. He tried to describe that he was washing his hands and he almost passed out like on an unspecified date in Jan2021, he was going to lose his mind. Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown.

He complained that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and missed appointments saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the two weeks or so between the time of his second vaccine and his death.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

Increase in metabolism leading to being warm all the time ( no sweating).  Two weeks after second vaccine and while experiencing the above symptoms, I had sudden palpitations with a rapid ventricular response ( 186 beats per minute), severe light headedness, ambulance transport to hospital leading to admission for two days.  This has never happened to me or any family members before.  Discharged from hospital after 2 days in normal rhythm.  Also at this time, taste has returned to normal and foggy feeling has improved.

                                                Following morning patient was &#34;Foggy&#34; in the brain and unable to string words together in a sentence very well.  He let me know he could not focus enough to read and retain anything.  He wanted to talk but couldn&#39;t find the words.  He remained very quiet but had no other symptoms of fever, pain, or anything else.  10 days post vaccine and he is doing better but still not feeling normal and not talking and holding conversations as usual.  He is able to answer appropriately .  The last two days he said all food is tasting bland without a lot of flavor.  He has taken a couple Tylenol  the last two days and drank Echinacea tea to try and make an improvement.  Is there data or information to give us any idea how long this could last?

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/ lot number: EL9269, Expiration date: Unknown, NDC number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder area on 08Feb2021 16:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing asthma for about 60 years, ongoing high blood pressure for about 3 years and was on blood pressure medication, issues with thyroid for about 3 years and was on thyroid medication (ongoing). Concomitant medication included ongoing thyroid medication. Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. Family medical history relevant to adverse events was none. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Adverse events following prior vaccinations was none. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect was none. The patient experienced bad prostate, bladder infection, sore arm on an unspecified date in Feb2021. On 11Feb2021, the patient experienced body aches, feeling worse, shivers, headache, mild fever. It was reported that, caller received his first dose of bnt162b2 on Monday 08Feb2021. He&#39;s reporting adverse events and would like to know: If he takes Tylenol to treat his symptoms, would it decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine or not. Also, if he were to go for a COVID-19 viral test, would the fact that he was received the vaccine interact with the test and cause a false positive result or not. Patient was reporting that yesterday, day 4, he started with body aches, headache, and &#34;when he got in bed, he had chills and shivers real bad, little chilly&#34; so possibly a mild fever. Enquired could these all be side effects of the vaccine or not. If he go for the COVID test - would it be positive or not. He also states he has a history of asthma and has been hypervigilant about avoiding COVID infections. Caller, reporting on the COVID vaccine and who explains that he got the first shot on Monday and he had a mildly sore arm- this lasted 2-3 days, no big deal. Then 5 days later he had really bad body aches and a headache. He went to bed cause he was feeling worse but before going to bed he noticed he had shivers really bad, uncontrollably almost which lasted over an hour. He presume they are fairly normal side effects but wants to confirm this could happen after five days. Also, he was told not to take Aspirin or Tylenol before getting the vaccine because it could affect the efficacy, but he wants to know could he take a Tylenol now 5 days later for the headache and body aches. He was better now than he was doing. Caller clarified the event was 4 days after the shot, the shot was Monday and events started Thursday. On Thursday evening, 11Feb2021, was when he had the bad body aches, headache, and shivers. At this point he still has the headache and body ache. He felt like, last night, he had a fever, but he didn&#39;t check it. At the same time, he had the chill and the shivers. Those feelings were resolved by this morning.

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: Not Reported), via an unspecified route of administration on Arm Right on 18Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included spinal injury, an infection in his scrotum, some neurogenic things, white blood cells (his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine). There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that, the consumer stated, &#34;my wife and me went to hospital and we got a COVID vaccine first one, we had some, my wife had terrible side effects, I am crippled, and I had not it before in Mar2021, she is ok, but she is just sick, I am sick, but she is very sick and she got bad stuffs (rash).&#34; Caller states that both him and his wife were having some side effects, although his wife was having the worse trouble. Caller states that last night, him and his wife were up all night. Caller was up because his wife was up so sick. Caller states that both him and his wife are sick and disabled, that is why they got the shot. Caller reports that he is retired and disabled because he got hurt at work. Caller states that what he is experiencing, is he just feels bad on 18Mar2021. Caller states that he did previously go to a doctor to do a blood study, the doctor is looking for blood diseases or cancer in the caller, and caller thinks that taking the COVID shot just exposed his weak spots. Caller reports that both him and his wife have body aches. Caller was wondering if there was anything, he can go get over the counter at the pharmacy to help. Caller reports that he cannot call his doctor, because they are all out on Fridays. Caller states that him and his wife are not planning to take the second dose of the product. Caller states that they have a lot of hurricanes where they live. Their house got tore up in one, and they sold it to one of their sons, and the caller and his wife moved out to their beach house for a while. He had an infection in his scrotum, something stung him, and that is what the doctors are looking for in him now, because his white blood cell count is high, and he has a rash on his scrotum in Mar2021. It was infected. Caller states that this infection in his scrotum has flared back up since getting the COVID vaccine yesterday, so caller had thought it went away but he guesses it never went away. Caller confirms that the issues with his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine, but the caller thinks that the vaccine was exposing the caller&#39;s weak spots, and maybe that is a god send because it is all flared up now, and the caller will be able to tell his doctor that. Caller states that he has been getting high white blood cell count readings since the stuff with his scrotum first started, and that is why his doctor sent him to an Oncologist for all this blood testing, so maybe this will be a b lessing in disguise for the caller, in finding out what is wrong with him. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Around 330 on 4/6, I started feeling bad and arrived home around 530pm and  had a slight Temperature (99) with hearing loss in both ears. But the right one had complete hearing loss. Thinking it would be a short term side effect, but realizing on Thursday am with was not, I called my physician office on Thursday and they called back on Thursday for a Friday 9am appt with the PA. She said it was sinus related , fluid in the ears was pushing the ear drum back and gave me a prescription for Fluticasone and to take my Zyretx and Sudafed. Call her in a week if symptoms did not away. On 4/12/21, I still have massive hearing loss and pain, so called a ENT for an appt and received a 1:15pm on the same day. This  was the first day I had balance issues.

A 63-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.

On 04Apr2021, he was taken to the emergency room and admitted to the hospital. They had been running test after test and can&#39;t seem to find anything wrong. The doctor thought that it was some kind of reaction to the vaccine.

He stayed home from Wednesday until Sunday when he started experiencing new crazy vision symptoms. Stated that started Saturday. He was taken to the hospital on Easter and was admitted to the hospital, and was still there. The vision problem was new and it started to develop Saturday night.

There were no white blood cells found in the spinal tap and that the echocardiogram was good. Everything came back normal. He had seen cardiologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, primary care doctors, and no one can find anything. They did another kind of test regarding his vision.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

I felt super foggy and unable to process things. They did a CTA of my neck and chest and a CT with perfusion which was normal. They did lab work and all was normal.  THIRD EPISODE 01-25-2021, i was at home happened around 9am, felt fine all morning and then i felt another episode come again. Same symptoms just not as dense as before and texted my wife. I had body aches, felt like I had the flu.     I saw my PCP 01-25-2021 (same day as my third episode)and set up an appointment  with a neurologist.

Droop began to worsen, and he had difficulty moving his right eye lid, so he decided to go to Urgent Care and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy.  He was started on Prednisone and Valtex which are reducing his symptoms.  Symptoms are almost resolved.  He does feel fatigued and slightly anxious.

                                                After not sleeping well Monday night I woke up on the 23rd of February not feeling 100%. So around 8:00 AM I took two Bayer Back &amp; Body. Around 8:15 / 8:20am I began feeling very dizzy and unable to stand up on my own. I couldn&#39;t walk down the hallway without holding onto the wall. This went on all day, long after the effects of the Bayer Back &amp; Body would have worn off . Even at dinner time I was uneasy / unstable walking around. The only time I felt well was when I was lying in bed. By the next morning, Wednesday the 24th, I wasn&#39;t 100% that morning either but I went to work and did the work. It was very difficult but by afternoon I was feeling much better. It wasn&#39;t until Thursday that I was feeling 100%. I had never felt this way in my life. No it was not Epilepsy related and I had been taking Bayer Back &amp; Body FOR YEARS without problem except maybe taking two, occasionally would feel the caffeine.

This 65-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Mar2021 probably around noon (at age of 65 years old; lot number: ER8730) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed about 10 years ago and diabetes type 2 diagnosed about 10 years ago (as of 24Mar2021). He caught COVID a few months ago (as of 24Mar2021) and was sick for 3 weeks and then came out of that and at that time got a rash and came out of that and wanted to get the vaccine because he was age 65 and did not want this thing to kill him. Concomitant medication(s) included gabapentin 300mg, 1 capsule three times per day by mouth, taken for neuropathy in his hands and his hands hurt from 22Mar2021 and ongoing. He was given the gabapentin to stop his hands from hurting. He also had medications he took every day and had diabetes type 2, and also had high blood pressure that he took medication for. No additional vaccines were administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the Pfizer vaccine. The patient reported he saw his healthcare professional (HCP) for the first time the same day he got the Pfizer Vaccine on 22Mar2021 and saw the HCP that morning. When he left he felt fine that day 22Mar2021 and felt fine that night. That night he tore up his bedroom and cleaned it and felt fine. Then the next morning (23Mar2021) he went to work and felt fine for a while and then got to building. He started working and then felt like he was in slow motion and couldn&#39;t think and it was crazy and his mind was blank and he could not think and felt like he was in slow motion; couldn&#39;t think to do anything. The feeling like he was in slow motion and not being able to think began yesterday morning on 23Mar2021 and stopped yesterday 23Mar2021 also. Yesterday he came home because he runs saws at work and stuff like that and he couldn&#39;t think and couldn&#39;t be around stuff like that because he was cutting things and could get hurt. He had not had this happen before and the feeling as if he couldn&#39;t think and felt in slow motion was not ongoing today, 24Mar2021. Today he now has nausea and the nausea was ongoing and about the same as when it began. Also stated as today (24Mar2021) he felt kind of nauseated and couldn&#39;t do anything again today and thought he would stay home because of these small side effects of the vaccine that he wanted to report. He had no treatment for the reported events but just went home and laid down. The events did not require an emergency room visit. Regarding whether the events required a visit to physician office the patient replied &#34;Yes&#34;, he saw his HCP the morning of the day he got the vaccine on 22Mar2021. Patient was going to call the HCP to see if the medication she gave him would have these side effects and he had not taken the Gabapentin before; stated the HCP issued him Gabapentin that he began taking on 22Mar2021. He was calling the HCP to see if the reported events were related to the gabapentin as he had not taken that before. &#34;Feeling like he was in slow motion and not being able to think&#34; was recovered on 23Mar2021 and patient had not recovered from nauseated.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

Watch did not show higher than 84 through the night but I could not sleep much due to the heart pounding. Arose for work at 6:15 and felt tired but the palpitations did not bother while standing. Temperature 98.8. about 90 minutes later, while at work, HR was 130-148, I was breathing deeply, otherwise okay. Chills started about 17 hours post-injection and temperature rose as high as 102.4 in the next 3 hours. HR lowered to about 110 about 16 hours post injection and did not get below 100 for another 12 hours. some coughing throughout this time, not productive. Heavy night sweats around 34 hours post injection. I had mild chills about 48 hours post injection, and fine since then. The palpitations were very uncomfortable but stopped once the HR lowered to about 110

                                                According to staff....Recipient received the above vaccination and went to sit for 30 minutes.  He had already explained to the staff that he had had previous reactions to bee stings that required epinephrine so the nurse practitioner had  instructed him that he was to wait for 30 minutes vs the usual 15 minutes.  It is unclear exactly how many minutes into the post-vaccination period passed before he began to report numbness around his lips.  The nurse practitioner then indicated he began a &#34;rash&#34; on the back of his neck.  The recipient reported that this was feeling very much like his previous allergic reactions.  They took his BP and it was reported to be around 180/100 at that time.   He did not report feeling SOB but reported his throat felt like it had in previous allergic reactions.  Recipient remained alert and oriented the entire time.  It was decided by the two nurse practitioners on site that he be given the epinephrine and Benadryl IM.  His BP remained elevated and then, following the epinephrine, he became very shaky and a bit foggy. 911 was then notified for further assistance from the EMT&#39;s and possible evaluation at the local hospital which was about 5 minutes away.  Paramedics evaluated the recipient and agreed that evaluation at the hospital would be warranted.  He never lost consciousness or required oxygen or other assistance. He was able to place himself on the gurney and was speaking with his wife (that was present)as he was taken out the door.  The transfer was done out of an abundance of caution. We do not know if the hospital kept him following the incident.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3302 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol since 90s and was taking medication to keep it down, and ongoing neuropathy in the feet back in the 90s. Patient seemed to be okay after the vaccination until he didn&#39;t rest well last night on 13Jan2021. The morning of 14Jan2021, he had chills and was aching all over. He has a headache, and he was pretty tired on 14Jan2021. His temperature was 99.9. and wanted to make sure he was okay. They gave him the sheet of side effects but was wondering how long it was going to last. He also had fever and chills on Jan2021. He has been just resting all day long which was all he felt like doing. Patient felt he has a bad case of the flu. When his chills started, he noticed he was tremoring and shaking and his muscles are achy on Jan2021. He usually waits until his temperature is over 100 to take something and noticed where he got the shot was achy on Jan2021. During the night he went to aching more. He was not too excited about getting up and doing anything now. He was tired on 14Jan2021, because he didn&#39;t rest well last night and slept in late today. He finally got around, and ate cereal and stuff. He has just been sitting. He would still get the second vaccine, which was not exciting. Outcome of the events aching all over, headaches, and tired are not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

At various times after I would become aware I was home, alone, on couch, unable even sit up. On one occasion I determined it was 1437hrs, Tuesday, 08 Feb 2021, and sent two text messages with great difficulty just saying HELP. IT was actually 0237hrs, Monday, 08 Feb 2021. Both HELP messages had been replied with questions about what the problem was. At 1200hrs, Tuesday, 09 Feb 2021 I became lucid again though at first I believed it to be Wednesday, 10 Feb 2021.

(Temperatures were in the 80&#39;s)  a feeling of nerve irritation under  the skin that moved from place to place.  unsteadiness on my feet, lack of focus, a basic, total shut down. I curled up in fetal position under a pile of covers for 24 hours. Didn&#39;t fully recovery for 3 days  All simptoms hit me more or less simultaneously within 5 minutes, about 12 hours after 2nd covid shot.  Didn&#39;t seek medical attention, just plowed through it.  I imagined a biological warfare agent would have felt like that. &#34;I thought I was gunna DIE!&#34;

It has no information about the syringe that was used, NDC/LOT/EXP information were unknown, they didn&#39;t put it down or the information on the card for his wallet. Patient stated he saw a doctor but not for the injection site pain. He stated if it was just initial pain, he wouldn&#39;t be asking but it has been 10 days now, he thought it would be gone by now, he tried to see how long it could last on the paper they gave and called the number from the paper. He says he had no swelling, it was just really sore, he would like to know if this is normal, if so, he can hang on and tough it out. Treatment was given in response to the events.

No tachycardia as he was checking his Apple Watch and no other symptoms.  ? 10:20 he drove home and called his wife can kept her on the call as he drove. He them experienced some mild tingling in his ears, face and lips.  ? 10:30 he got home and his lips were mildly swollen, more so on the upper lip, not as much on the lower lip.  ? 10:45 he took an Allegra and about 30-40 minutes afterwards the lip swelling started to calm  ? 5:45pm I spoke with him. He said he has no more symptoms. A little tired perhaps from the day or the Allegra (though it doesn?t cause too much drowsiness compared to Benadryl) ? He also reported he had a flu and shingles vaccine back in early November so it has been more than a month.

Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

A 68-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 15:30 at single dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included back disorder and is waiting for back surgery, high blood pressure, and very likely diabetic. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon, didn&#39;t notice anything until Saturday. On Saturday afternoon (23Jan2021) he had a couple severe/serious episodes of shortness of breath. He has no other symptoms. It was better on Sunday and is better today but he still feels uncomfortable on Jan2021. He bought a oximeter today and while at rest he is at 94 but when he gets up to do anything it goes to 80. He doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the vaccine but wants to know where the shortness of breath is coming from, if it is a side effect. The vaccine was administered on 19Jan2021. He has been very inactive and is waiting for back surgery that has been put off due COVID, the hospital delayed the surgery. He is very likely diabetic and takes one pill a day for this. He also has high blood pressure but is controlled and normal range is 120/70. It was elevated along with his heart rate (on Jan2021) with the bad breathing or shortness of breath episodes. He is trying to get surgical clearance and so he had an echocardiogram the Monday before the vaccine was given and a stress test on the Thursday prior to that. It was given in the upper left arm, he also has a little bruise that is still there now (Jan2021). It was given about 3:30pm. No treatment received. Event outcome of shortness of breath was not recovered, of others was unknown.

My wife called police to try and find me.  When I finally go home, I couldn&#39;t remember anything of the events of the day.  The following morning (Sun. Feb. 14th) @7:00AM, I collapsed in the kitchen and 911 was called as my heart stopped.  10 minutes passed by and I was turning blue. I still can not remember getting the vaccine or any of the events of 02/13/2021.

In addition to the headaches and severe dizziness I started having significant bouts with diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite and have not slept well.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

It also felt like a nerve was being pinched causing a discomfort down to my ache and foot.  Felt like my foot was trying to go to sleep and tingling. This feeling woke me up about 1 am in the morning ( 2/26) and unable to get comfortable to go back to sleep.  Cause me to limp , unable to put full weight on the leg. This lasted all night and during the day has improved.  It feels somewhat weak, but I can put weight on the leg with a light limp. My foot feels like it has recovered from going to sleep and now has blood flowing, less tingling.

It has been 72 hours since the shot was given and I am still feeling tired like I did right after shot was given. I am a light sleeper and some nights I will toss and turn and get a poor nights sleep. Last night, Sunday 2-28-2021 was that kind of night. As I type this I am not sure if my tired feeling is from the vaccine shot or the poor nights sleep. I can still function as I always do but being sure I don&#39;t run myself ragged. I have called my primary doctor and I am supposed to be getting a call back tomorrow.

                                                18-20 hours following the vaccination, after going to bed, I started experiencing chills, followed by intense, all-over body aches. This was accompanied by either bizarre dreams or hallucinations during the night. When I awoke in the morning I was very unrested and very unstable. My morning coffee did not taste appealing. By 30 hours after the vaccination I had returned to feeling better, albeit with a mildly sore injection site, and was able to return to normal activity. No treatment was sought.  No further issues presented themselves.

The intensity was severe enough to prevent sleeping for over eight hours. This was accompanied by chills alternating with feeling hot without a measured fever. Six hours after the onset of pain two 500 mg acetaminophen were taken with some blunting of the pain though minimal improvement. After the initial eight hours the pain in in the joints and muscles subsided over about four hours. The headache that was akin to migraines in the past persisted for another six hours and was eventually relieved by two doses of ibuprofen 600 mg six hours apart.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3302), intramuscular on 22Jan2021 15:10 at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml by intramuscular injection left shoulder) for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (diagnosed about 21 years ago), ongoing gout (Diagnosed about 2 years ag), ongoing ankle spur right foot, ongoing diminished cartilage both knees, joint pain. The concomitant medications included torsemide. The patient reported adverse event (AE) after his first Pfizer-Biontech covid19 vaccine at 15:10  on 22Jan2021. He reported arm pain starting 3 hours after vaccination until noon the next day (23Jan2021). When he woke up on 23Jan2021 he reported lower back pain, that has migrated more to the right hip and into the glute. The pain inhibits walking, standing, etc. He did note that he is &gt;300lbs and has had joint pain in the past, but the hip pain is new. He also thought it might be kidney pain, as he takes a daily diuretic. He stated he has been treating with Aleve twice a day, but that walking is still very bad.  The patient is an optometrist that was calling about the Covid-19 vaccine and said that he did not know if the Lot number written on the vaccination card is EL3302, E13302, or EI3302. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and reported that he got a sore arm about 3 hours after receiving the injection. He woke up with a sore lower back pain. He is 5ft 9.5 and 310 lbs and he is on Torsemide, a pretty strong diuretic. He woke up with the back pain and stated that it moved right and middle to his buttocks, a little lower than the end of his spine and to the right. He did not think it was his kidneys. He said that Torsemide can make kidneys work overtime. His knees were pretty shot, the left worse than the right. No further details provided. He was upset to know that he has shrunk a 1.5 inches over the years. He has been taking 2 Aleve a day since Saturday, this morning was his 4th pill. He said that it is really odd when he stands equally on both feet his lower back hurts. He has to sleep on his right side and that it hurts more when he sleeps on his back and on his left side. He was fearful doing eye exams next to his patient and how the lower back pain would affect him.  Reporter considered seriousness for Lower back pain was Medically significant. The outcome of event lower back pain was not recovered; of event arm pain was recovered on 23Jan2021; of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event low back pain cannot be excluded. The ongoing gout and concomitant drug torsemide may also play contributory roles to the event.

                                                About 8 hours after injection, I began having pain on right side of back just under ribs. Pain worsened through night, causing difficult sleep. On evening of second day, pain spread to right flank and right front of abdomen, causing entire right side of abdomen to experience significant pain. It is possible this is muscular pain, but after reading the Internet, I believe it is inflammation of the gallbladder. I have never before experienced gallbladder issues. The pain is much worse than the &#34;muscle aches&#34; described as a COVID vaccine side effect. There is no fever or other significant symptoms. Today (third day) I emailed my doctor. His nurse responded that it is hard to tell if it is vaccine related, and that if it begins to resolve not to be concerned about it, but if it gets worse I should be seen by the doctor. I am taking Tylenol and applying Voltarin topically, but neither helps much.

                                                Spasm in the back of neck; difficult to sleep; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (reporting for himself). A 71-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular route on his left arm from 29Jan2021 11:40 to 29Jan2021 11:40 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included cholesterol, gout, vitamin supplementation, and hypothyroid. Concomitant medication included simvastatin for cholesterol, allopurinol for gout, cinacalcet for hypothyroid. On 30Jan2021, the patient has a spasm in the back of his neck that makes it difficult to sleep and if you turn your head in any direction, you get a crook in your neck and it feels like someone is grabbing you by the back of neck. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spasm in the back of neck which included Tylenol Arthritis pain. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

                                                shingles; he started feeling strange; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, at the age of 71 years, on 20Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included white blood cell count decreased from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient stated that his white blood cell count was usually on the low side and his doctor sends him to a hematologist to do whatever, then they say he was fine. Concomitant medication included an unspecified flu shot. The patient said that he had his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot 20Jan2021, and this coming Wednesday he was supposed to have his second shot, but unfortunately in the interim he found out he has shingles. He says he would like to know if he can get a second shot or would he need to hold off. He says that developed shingles 9 days later after getting first COVID-19 vaccine shot (31Jan2021), and he doesn&#39;t want to do something that will be a problem. He says that he was on an antiviral to treat the shingles. No further details provided about the antiviral. He says he didn&#39;t go see his doctor until last Wednesday, he thinks he has been suffering from shingles since 07Feb2021 or a little before that when he started feeling strange. The patient clarified he meant 31Jan2021 since he began dealing with this. The patient said when he was diagnosed with shingles they didn&#39;t do any tests, the doctor walked into the room and looked at him, though he didn&#39;t have a lot then, over the days it has gotten worse. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of shingles (herpes zoster). The outcome of the events was unknown.

On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

Rushed him to Urgent Care, they sent him home and the next day I took him to ER. He was admitted. MRIs, CT scan, Blood Cultures, 2 Covid tests.  Nothing definitive as to why he was so ill other then a viral infection.   We are not assuming or indicating it is vaccine related but we think it&#39;s worth noting.  Nothing in his routine had changed other then receiving the 1st vaccine.   No one at the hospital indicated it was related.

A 71-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 06Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.

In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital in (Name). Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter believes that patients sister has A-Fib. There were no concomitant medications. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Patient received a flu vaccine way back in Aug2020. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was Not provided.

If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue.

Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit.

Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital. Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress.

On the same day 11Apr2021 the patient also experienced difficulty breathing, low oxygen blood level,  potassium level increased and extra fluid in his body which led to the emergency room and admission to the hospital. Clinical course was described as follows: everything was going good until Sunday at 3:29 am. Her husband woke up shivering, quaking, and he was freaking out repeating oh my god, so she called emergency number.  When her husband found out that she couldn&#39;t get into the ambulance with her husband and ride to the hospital, so her husband refused to go to the hospital. She states that her husband also felt nauseous and vomited in this period of time. She stated that he had no fever, though. So fast forward to 8:30 am her husband was having difficulty breathing, and she called again and this time they had 7 paramedics come out to the house. She states that all of them were very nice. An EKG was performed because patient reported that he had a soft pain in his left side of his chest. She states that everything was cool with that, except his pulse rate was high.

At the ER they discovered that potassium level increased and she said that he had some extra fluid in his body. He was a dialyses patient so they gave him dialysis on Sunday evening. He had calmed down at that point and they were constantly taking blood from him. She found out about the COVID vaccine had potassium and phosphate as active ingredients and her husband shouldn&#39;t have that. She also informed that they had to give him a tranquilizer because he was having a panic attack during this whole episode. She says that they gave him alprazolam. Patient doesn&#39;t know exactly when the side effects went away because he didn&#39;t have a clock or a phone.

                                                The day after the vaccine, I just had a mild headache and mild leg aches, off and on, and took Advil twice with complete relief. Then I was fine until 7th day when I awoke a 7am. I felt mentally &#34;weird&#34; and couldn&#39;t concentrate. Not dizzy. I ate my normal breakfast of lox, cream cheese and bread with coffee with cream and Stevia. I sat at the computer and could not concentrate or even read well, and felt confused at times. Then I got hot and sweaty, my mouth got very dry, I had pains and needles over my entire body, and the tip of my tongue got numb. I laid down in my bed and felt worse. My blood pressure was 160-170/105-110, and normally it is 120-135-70-84.  I thought maybe I was having a neurological event, so I had my wife take me to the ER. I was there about 6 hours, but after about 3-4 hours, let better. The symptoms would come and go, lasting 3-5 minutes, and slowly improved. After the 2nd treponin was negative, they let me go home. I felt tired and mentally off a little. I rested. The next am, I was back to normal and have stayed OK since.

                                                This was the second Covid vaccine from Pfizer.  First vaccine was given 1/28/21 . EL3244.   No adverse side effects other than slightly sore arm at site of injection.  Second vaccine was given on  2/18/21 within a couple day I noticed tremors in my hands.  When to the doctor on Feb 25, 2021 , I talked to her about tremors.  No treatment at that time.  March 4, 2021 had a video doctor appointment and talked about tremors. She prescribed Propranolol 40mg.  No previous history of tremors.  Tremors are a little better with medicine after a couple days but not gone.  I can&#39;t use fork, button my sleeves or work tools at my job.  I did notice tremors in my back when climbing on a ladder at work.  These tremors started within  2 days of second vaccine.

They ordered antibiotics. Symptoms persisted, so he went to a ?minute clinic? and got a chest xray. When his PCP got those results, he was instructed to go to the ED immediately, where he was admitted for pneumonia. PCP told patient that pneumonia was caused by covid vaccine and has instructed patient to not get second dose.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Dec2020 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He was an ER doctor and the medical director of his hospital. The patient was asymptomatic when he got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. 3 hours after the vaccine he began to get chills, HA, anorexia, myalgias, and extreme fatigue. This worsened and he slept all and had no appetite. On 19Dec2020 he woke up delirious with a fever and was ataxic, hypoxic, incontinent, and confused. The patient was hospitalized due to the events on 15Dec2020. The events also caused prolonged hospitalization due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab post vaccination with unknown results. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as the patient required oxygen, plasma, and remdisivir.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, BNT162B2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of reported serious events might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  Fever, chills, headache, fatigue and muscle pain are the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  More information such as detailed underlying medical conditions and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient&#39;s official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

He was off pressors but remained intubated due to poor mental status with unclear etiology. It could be related to liver failure, vs neurological insult vs renal failure. Head CT 4 days prior on the 2/24 were without acute intracranial pathology. Hepatology was consulted and did not believe the liver was the main etiology behind poor mental status. Patient progressively declined with continuously increased IV pressor requirement. ABG showed worsening lactate acidosis and was anuric. Patient&#39;s family was notified of decline and agreed for the patient to be transition to comfort care early 2/28. Bedside RN notified pronouncing physician of cessation of respiration and cardiac activity.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: LE3301), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 12Jan2021 at 15:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included belief that he had agent orange and tiredness. The patient did not have additional vaccines administered on the same date as the Pfizer vaccine and did not have vaccinations within four weeks. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received a flu shot in October (year unspecified). On 12Jan2021, the patient was throwing up. The patient stated that his whole body has gone, it did not work anymore, his legs have gone out, and was having headaches on 13Jan2021. The patient initially stated that the feeling that his body did not work anymore started six hours after he got the vaccine. He later clarified and stated it started on 13Jan2021. He further clarified that what he meant by the body did not work was issues with his lower extremities, he cannot walk and he was having a lot of headaches. The throwing up started on the evening of 12Jan2021. He could not get up to go to the bathroom. He had a couple of episodes of throwing up. He confirmed the throwing up has resolved, but was unable to provide any additional details. He also added that he was feeling very cold on 13Jan2021. The headaches left him concerned. At end of the call, the patient indicated he wanted this bad feeling to go away. The events did not require any visit to the Emergency Room or Physician&#39;s office (patient stated he considered it, but he just stayed in bed). Outcome of the event throwing up was recovered, for the events body does not work anymore, very cold, and headache was not recovered, while for the other events was unknown.

After an hour of being unable to function normally, I took two meclizine tablets and slept for 12 hours. As of now (Friday night, Jan. 29). I have continued to experience vertigo--only mildly as I am sitting still or lying down, but severe vertigo (almost falling) if I move my head wrong.

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 27Jan2021 13:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Facility where the COVID-19 vaccine was administered: Other. The patient&#39;s medical history included stroke, blood pressure high (HBP), diabetes (Non-Insulin Dependent) and known allergies to medications, food, or other products: Lisinopril, Penicillin. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took lisinopril and experienced drug allergy. The reporter&#39;s husband (for whom she was reporting) had been having bouts, what she thought are slight hallucinations, since receiving the vaccine. The first (onset of bouts) was twenty-four hours later (28Jan2021) when he described a &#34;floaty&#34; feeling in the morning and was not wanting to get out of bed. Second was forty-eight hours later, on the 29Jan2021, in the morning when he had (as with routine), left his empty water pitcher out for refill (which was per normal), he proceeded to question her about what happened to it and was stating that something was not right with the time frame of events. Thirdly, he had a feeling of being &#34;trapped&#34; as he was trying to exit the latrine on the 31Jan2021 (early hours of the morning). He at that point referenced a specific &#34;disease&#34; where things in time-space was not adding up. Before the vaccine, he was doing fine. After receiving this first dose, it seems to the reporter that he was suffering a reaction contrary to the general side effects. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.

Found to have lesions on liver and in lungs on scans.  Told to follow up with Oncologist on 3/16 but instead had to go to ED due to worsened fatigue and confusion. Liver enzymes noted to be very elevated on admission and progressively deteriorated in to liver failure and subsequent kidney failure over 3 day hospitalization. Unable to biopsy lesions due to risk of bleeding. Discharged to hospice facility on 3/19/21 and died 3/20/21 early AM.
