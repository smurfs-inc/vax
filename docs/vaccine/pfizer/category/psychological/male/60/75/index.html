It cleared in approximately a minute. The 2nd heat flash came on about 5 to 10 minutes later and cleared about a minute later. The 3rd heat flash came on about another 5 to 10 minutes, again clearing at about 1 minute. Next I felt like my head was in a fog, found it very hard to focus, and was forgetting what I was doing. I walked over to the office, my supervisor asked if I was ok as she said it looked like my eyes were glazed over, my head was still in a fog. This cleared by 2:30 p.m.

In about two more minutes my right was swollen closed and speaking became difficult due to the swelling.  My wife drove me to Hospital and I received Epinephrine and Benadryl and fluids.

Medical history included diabetes, stent, and cholesterol. Concomitant medication included metformin for diabetes, atorvastatin from 2009 (also reported as Jan2020) for cholesterol, ticagrelor (BRILINTA, NDC: 01860776-60, LOT: MM0189, EXP: Apr2023), saxagliptin hydrochloride (ONGLYZA, NDC: 0310-6105-90, LOT: MJ0731, EXP: Feb2023) for diabetes, and terbinafine.

Patient says he got the Pfizer vaccine, clarified to Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a couple days ago and the first day he felt bad and had chills and felt wobbly and woozy. He says yesterday (13Jan2021) he felt pretty good, and even worked out. He says he also worked out today, but he has had chills and feels like he has a big weight walking on him, he doesn&#39;t know the right word. He says he is also a diabetic, and he noticed today that his blood sugar has been lower than normal, it is usually normal at 110-120, it is lower today at 96. He says he is careful with his diet and eats the same thing. He says he hasn&#39;t taken his meds today, and he checked his blood sugar again later and it was 153, which is not through the roof, even without his medication so he would like to know does the vaccine affect your blood sugar? He says he got his first dose of the vaccination on Tuesday at 08:00AM, in his left arm. He clarifies that he has had chills today and then feels like there is a big heavy weight on him, he is real tired and his sugar is low, that was odd. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I got the shot last Tuesday and I feel like I am on drugs like I on &#39;some acid&#39; (not clarified). But I am not hallucinating, I am not seeing things, I am not hearing things, I just physically feel that way. Everything is kind of blurry, my vision is blurry and it&#39;s kind of hard to concentrate on television and stuff like that. It seems like some people are playing mind games with it but I don&#39;t think they have (further clarification unknown, hence not captured as event). I don&#39;t know if I hallucinated that or not (consumer was not sure). That&#39;s pretty much here I feel like I am on drugs constantly and it is just kind of scary.

I can not say 100% that the vacine is the the sole reason for the extreme symptoms  but can tie nothing else to the change. The ringing, screeching and high pitch sounds are louder than I have ever e,peri encased in my 15 years with tinnitus.   I TS constant,  unnerving,  stressful,  and never ending.  Difficult to impossible to sleep  and if I do happen to fall asleep the symptoms wake me up within an hour.  Kinda at my wits end at this piint.

                                                Vertigo/dizziness. Lost control and fell to the bed on the first symptom morning. Vertigo lasted for 10 days with varying, unpredictable intensity. Then, it was downgraded to occasional dizziness until now, Day 14. The vertigo restricted my movement and driving out of precaution. After reading similar experiences at website and others, started taking Ibuprofen and diphenhydramine, which helped a bit. Currently waiting for my second shot in 5 days warily.

I received my first Covid vac on March 21, 2021 and within a couple of days i began to develop a fairly serious BRAIN FOG.   It was difficult to concentrate and make decisions.   This lasted for about 2-3 weeks.

In the last week, twice I was awakened by it in the middle of the night and was not able to fall back to sleep because it is so loud. In the past, I never heard it during the day, but now it is very loud even in the daytime. This is very serious. Not being able to sleep and rest at night is very hard to cope during the day. I&#39;m not sure what to do as there is no cure for this tinnitus.

                                                I experienced a very sudden and intense Gout flare up that caused and is still causing an unbearable swelling in my right foot and ankle.  I have not had a flare up of this intensity and severity for over 12 years.  My Gout has been successfully managed by Allopurinal for over 12 years and I have not experienced any significant events during this time.  This time includes over 20,000 miles on my road bicycle and dozens of days over 100 miles.  Never have I had a problem.  Last Tuesday, I received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and I have yet to be able to walk or sleep through  the night for six days and counting.  This adverse effect should be followed and researched.  I also will be requesting reimbursement for out of pocket expenses due to this event.

                                                About 1 week following first Pfizer vaccination, I began having achiness in left leg and thought this was possibly from sitting in a chair without enough cushion.  I simply could not get leg comfortable.  Over a couple days duration the leg continued to be achy and slightly swollen.  On December 23rd at night I awoke due to such discomfort in leg and could not get comfortable enough to go to sleep.   I went to ED where I was examined and found to be mildly short of breath and in pain.  Ultrasound of leg showed large upper leg DVT.  CT of chest showed submassive Pulmonary Horseshoe Embolus.   I was placed on Heparin and anticoagulated.  Hospitalized for several days while anticoagulated and observed for any clot progression or respiratory distress and discharged home on Xarelto for anticoagulation and follow up with PCP, Hematology, Pulmonary medicine.

                                                Immediately after the injection I felt a warm sensation flowing through my body and my head felt warm but I did not have a temperature.  This subsided within 20 minutes.    Prior to the vaccination I had slight Tinnitus on a scale of 1-10 I would say it was a 2.  I had no trouble sleeping at night and did not use any sound machines to mask the tinnitus. I would characterize myself as a great sleeper.   About 48 hours after the vaccination in my left ear my Tinnitus went from a 2 to a 5.  Now to sleep I must run a fan or noise machine to mask the tinnitus and sometimes have to take benadryl or Tylenol PM to sleep.

For my second Coivd vaccine in my right arm on Friday, 5/28/2021, my symptoms included a headache and fatigue which lasted for Friday and Saturday. I also had a bad night on Saturday. I had trouble sleeping, was achy and may have been running a slight fever. I have been slightly more sweaty than normal. Today, 5/31/2021, I had some blood in my urine.

A 60-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EW0153), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 13Apr2021 at age of 60-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ER2613), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 at age of 60-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hadn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. On 15Apr2021 (Day 2), patient had lump on left arm at injection site. On 16Apr2021 (Day 3), itchy rash inner left arm. On 17Apr2021 (Day 4), itchy rashes on left palm.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including head CT/MRI and viral serologies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I have been have contact with my primary care doctor because of the reaction with the first dose. He advised me to take Benadryl 15 minutes before receiving the injection.  I stayed at the vaccination site for an hour instead of 15 minutes. I left the vaccination site and went home and went to sleep, I worked over night. I did not sleep well that day. I got up around 6pm and I went to work at 10pm and I was extremely anxious and tired all night. I was a little confused while at work. I got off work and went to my chiropractor who noticed and my wife also noticed that I was extremely pale, after the appointment I went home and went back to bed. When I woke up I was still exhausted that I ended up calling out out of work that night.  I went back to bed and slept all night till 9am this morning. The next morning my color was back and I was looking better. My energy level is slowing  improving but still feel tired even when I got a good nights of sleep. I don&#39;t know if it related, but I went and brought some new shoes and then my hip started hurting. It is to the point where I set up a doctor&#39;s appointment on Monday to have my hip looked at.   See VAERS report 906796 for first dose reaction.

                                                hives; anxious; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional. A 61-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) intramuscular at the right leg on 25Jan2021 (lot number EN5318 and expiry date unknown) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a nursing home/senior living facility. Medical history included COVID prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. On 25Jan2021, the patient experienced hives and was anxious, the patient was taken to the hospital. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The events caused hospitalization on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events hives and anxious was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the urticaria and anxiety. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 61-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL9621), intramuscular on the left arm on 22Jan2021 (reported as 07:45 to 08:00) at a SINGLE DOSE for prevent COVID, at 61 years old. Medical history included triple bypass surgery from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime. Symptoms (unspecified which) reported as recurring and are notably worse at bedtime. Patient is hesitant to receive the second dose. The patient stated he just went to sleep and prayed and then when he woke the next day, at night it did it again. At night it comes and goes, and he still has it happen but not like the first time. He tried to describe that he was washing his hands and he almost passed out like on an unspecified date in Jan2021, he was going to lose his mind. Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown. Outcome of the events dizziness, &#34;feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his brain wanted to pop out of his head/ his brain wanted to swell up&#34;, felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy, and fever was reported as recovering.

                                                Within 15 minutes of my 2nd covid shot I developed extreme lightheadedness, shortness of breath, disorientation, dehydration and consequently extreme anxiety from the incident. I was taken to an examination room at the vaccination clinic by their nurse director. Blood pressure was high and there was a question if I was having a stroke or heart incident. the director sent me by ambulance to Hospital as they didn&#39;t know if I was having an anaphylactic shock or cardiac incident. All this occurred within an hour if the first symptoms.

The exact date of the vaccine is unknown. His girlfriend told me he got his second Vaccine at the end of February. I also don&#39;t know what vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer) he got, so the Pfizer is just a guess. Patient started feeling bad and looking bad after his second vaccine. He complained that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and missed appointments saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the two weeks or so between the time of his second vaccine and his death.

                                                About two weeks after the 1st shot I noticed my facial skin was very itchy.  This was a constant thing.  Two days after I had the shot shot my face swoll up and was very itchy.  I was waking up in the middle of the night several times a night because of the itches and I was going my best no to scratch.  i rubbed moisturizer in to my face and later started using some over the counter itching creams that would work for a few hours.  I began to realize the itching was worse in places where I had five years ago had Bellafill infected into acne scars and deep wrinkles by a licensed cosmetic surgeon.  I like the results and have no issue with the doctor or filler, but this stuff itched terribly.  I see on the internet some complaints from others, but I wanted to report that I too have this.  As of today, weeks later, it is not as bad, but as I write this I want to itch a place above my right cheek bone that was injected with Bellafill.   I thought it was a problem with the Bellafill, I am convinced now it is a side effect of the vaccine.  Guess this means it is working to adopt to odd things in my body.

Within an hour, extreme shaking, fatigue and worse headache ever experienced in my life. Went to bed, covered up and tried to rest, but headache was too severe. About 6:00pm, took ibuprofen and headache began to subside, but too weak to walk without holding onto support items. Nausea left me unable to eat and drinking water was unpleasant. Fell asleep about 10pm and woke at midnight with cold shakes and did not get back to sleep. Went to work next morning and just felt somewhat fatigue and had no appetite.

When I woke up on April 14, I was tired but otherwise felt fine except my arm was a bit sore.  However, after working at home for a couple of hours, shortly before 10:00 am I began to feel nauseous. I rushed to the bathroom thinking I was going to throw up, and almost immediately fainted. My wife and sons found me on the floor and woke me up. I threw up shortly after and felt pretty lousy the rest of the day with low grade fever, chills, body aches, fatigue, and a headache. I began to feel better at night and had a good night of sleep. Today (April 15), I feel fine except I&#39;m a little tired.

Normally I have much relief with Rytary, Carbidopa-Levodopa, and deep brain stimulator, but nothing helped. I&#39;m now at 65-70% of where I had been. While I can&#39;t say with certainty that my medication failure resulted  from the vaccine, I have no  other explanation. I would rather risk whatever one vaccine has done for me against COVID, than go through this again, or worse!

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 16Apr2021 17:00 (Lot Number: Lot EW0151) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Mild seizure disorder and Hay fever. No known allergies.

Since the vaccination, patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient felt fine following the 2nd shot, for 48 hours on 18Apr2021, but unusually tired so he knew it must had been the shot. The next day on 19Apr2021 his sinuses became burning and he assumed it was hay fever because he had experienced some symptoms of that for the previous two weeks. But the next day on 20Apr2021, Tuesday, it was worst, like a bad cold (which all of this &#34;reaction&#34; may had been), but then the next 3 days he could barely get out of bed and that&#39;s unusual because he run every day and nothing stops him, including a cold. he had bad headaches on 19Apr2021 for 5 days or so and symptoms included coughing, from a dry cough at first that Wednesday to a very wet cough and very large thick solid segments of gelled mucous coming out of his sinuses, something he had never seen before. After almost two weeks he felt better but was still coughing, and now three weeks later he was still really tired, could not think as tightly as usual on 19Apr2021. His doctor&#39;s office told him not to come in, just to take pain reliever and cough syrup, which he was doing anyway. Test was neg. The adverse event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No covid prior vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests included covid test (Nasal Swab): negative on 24Apr2021.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 09Apr2021 (lot number: EW0158), as 1st dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization, at a clinic. Medical history included high cholesterol (controlled with diet); bone spur in left heel (bone spur in his left heel began coming on gradually, probably for 10 or 12 years) which has gotten little worse and made it hard for him to walk in the evening, in long distances, it was like a knife in his heel and he would get that real soreness and pulling after a walk; and allergy to sulfa drugs, more specifically sulfa antibiotics (he was given them 25 years ago and had a reaction). The patient has not had any vaccines or shots for years. He reported that he is very healthy and has not had the flu or anything in 25 years. The patient does not smoke and is careful with what he eats. There were no concomitant medications. On 09Apr2021, within minutes of receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was not feeling well, he felt strange. He wondered if it was his imagination or if something was going on. Then it got worse and worse within 12-15 minutes after the COVID-19 vaccine. The staff member sent paramedics over to him. The paramedics set him up with a blood pressure cuff and heart monitor. Apparently, his blood pressure dropped a lot/dropped a good deal and his heart rate went to 30 beats per minute. His heart rate is normally around 65 beats per minute. The paramedics informed him that if his blood pressure and heart rate didn&#39;t come up, he was going to have to go to the hospital. The paramedics instructed him to stand up and it seemed to bring his blood pressure and heart rate back up to normal. The patient reported that everything returned to normal within a 15-20-minute time frame. He was then able to leave the vaccination facility. His health care provider advised him not to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. His physician informed him that he could possibly go into cardiac arrest. The patient did not have any problems after that other than a sore arm later in the day on 09Apr2021. His arm was sore for a day or two. The patient stated that this was the only effect after the incident in the vaccination facility. The patient also reported that on the weekend after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, in Apr2021, he can walk long distance and his bone spur in his heel quit bothering him immediately. He reported that if he walks a mile and back, it quit the hurt. He reported that he would get that real soreness or pulling after a walk and that kind of stopped. The patient thought this was really strange. The patient reported that he cancelled the appointment for the second dose and did not get it. He was a little apprehensive about the second dose of as he didn&#39;t know if his reaction would be worse. The patient asked if the vaccine is 80% effective after one dose, if Pfizer has heard of that type of reaction from others, if his reaction was rare, and if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He mentioned that he would like to have a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, but he is afraid to get it because he doesn&#39;t want to go into cardiac arrest. The patient recovered from &#34;blood pressure had dropped a lot/blood pressure dropped a good deal&#34;, &#34;his heart rate was 30 beats per minute&#34;, not feeling well and felt strange on 09Apr2021, and from sore arm in Apr2021. The outcome of &#34;his bone spur in his heel quit bothering him immediately/he can walk long distance/he would get that real soreness or pulling after a walk and that kind of stopped&#34; was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

PCP stated could take a month. It has now been over a month went to PCP again 05/24/2021 and gave him a script of pain. Why is he still having this issues over a month later.

                                                I had a stroke on April 30, 2021, 10 days after the second dose of Pfizer on April 20, 2021.  The stroke was the result of a blood clot.  I&#39;ve never had blood clots until I subjected my perfectly healthy body to the Covid vaccination.  On the morning of April 30, 2021, I was suddenly overcome with a sense of disorientation and dizziness.  Spouse drove me to the ER. They discovered I had experienced a stroke. Let me be absolutely clear.  The Pfizer vaccine is the sole reason I developed blood clots and had a stroke.  I was perfectly healthy until I got vaccinated.  I now have brain fog, dizziness, and every day is a challenge. I feel so dumb for falling for the get vaccinated garbage.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                Pt had some amazing hallucinations and was actively communicating while I believe he was asleep.  He called me on the phone and his voice was slurred and he thought he was being held down by some things that were flying around.  I was able to direct him to sit up after ensuring him that he wasn&#39;t being held down and eventually get him to walk to the bathroom, turn on the light and look in the mirror and describe to me what he saw (he lives at a different address than I do).  By this time, he had &#34;woken&#34; up and his voice was no longer slurred and he was &#34;making sense&#34;.  My concern was that he had had a stroke or Bell&#39;s palsy or something.  He was fine and slept well the rest of the night.  I will bring him to my home after his second shot just in case this happens again.  He hallucinated after his anti-anxiety medications for the first couple of weeks and to a more minor amount with his other medications, again for the first couple of weeks.  I am assuming that his brain reacted to the vaccine with hallucinations but I don&#39;t know.   This may be nothing or it may be something that other patients are experiencing, who the heck knows.

A contactable consumer reported for himself, a 62-year-old male patient who received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (reported as by injection) to left arm on 14Jan2021 at 3pm at single dose to prevent COVID/COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety. Concomitant medications included antidepressants. The patient received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine last 14Jan2021 at 3pm, and everything went well. When he left the place, he had a slight headache. He had to stay there for 15-20 minutes to make sure he had no reaction. He just got a little lightheaded, he didn&#39;t think much, and it didn&#39;t get worse. The patient took 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL) and forgot about it. It went away for a while. He took the shot at 3 pm and he took paracetamol at 4 pm. Later that night, about 10 pm, everything kicked in. He was sick again at 10:30 pm, or so, the headache was gone for several hours. He was ok between 4 pm and 10 pm. Then about 10 to 10:30 pm, when he went to go to sleep, his heart started racing, like he was having a panic attack, then he started getting hot flashes, sweating, chills, and aching, and this went all night from like 10 pm to 11 to the next morning. He had a doctor&#39;s appointment to get his knee examined for an upcoming knee surgery. The patient clarified that he didn&#39;t go to the doctor because of the symptoms, he went for his knee. He asked the doctor, before getting examined, and the doctor said he got off easy, as the doctor himself was sick for 3 days. The patient asked the doctor if he could take something to calm down, as his blood pressure was high on 15Jan2021 at 8 am. They had taken his blood pressure to examine his knee, and the doctor said it was alright. He was prescribed with alprazolam (XANAX), and the doctor said it would be fine. The next day, he was tired from the night before. He had no symptoms the next day. After he took alprazolam, he slept fine, he felt better. The hot flashes, heart racing, body aches, and chills were gone, and he read everything as far as symptoms. The heart racing went away about 11 the next morning because he took alprazolam. The patient stated that he forgot to add one more, he had all the symptoms described as side effects, but he also had itching. He had very mild itching and was given cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC, lot number: OHE2723, expiry date: Feb2022, UPC: 4122053077), it was like 80% gone. Every now and again he has a little itch, but it was bothering him all night that first night. Currently, the patient felt pretty good. He has no symptoms other than the slight itch. He further stated that his second dose is on 04Feb2021. Out of all symptoms, the thing that freaked him out the most was the heart racing, he asked if he could take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) before the shot. He has been on antidepressants for a while, he has a lot of anxiety, but the day he went in, he felt good, and didn&#39;t take alprazolam. He also asked if this have triggered all that heart racing stuff. He was seeking for information if there was anything to do to prepare him better, he knew you have to sit there for 15-20 minutes to see if there was a reaction. The outcome of the event headache and lightheadedness was recovered on 14Jan2021, unknown for blood pressure high and tiredness, recovering for itchy, and recovered on 15Jan2021 at 11 am for all other events.

Some chills etc. by the time I went to work right side hearing was severely affected with what sounded like phase shifter in my head. No relief through weekend, too dangerous to work due to my job in a busy kitchen. Saw my Dr. on Tuesday 04/13. Treated as an ear infection. 3 day steroid with nasal spray. No relief. By now the ringing, whooshing, roaring and chirping in my right side are extremely disorienting! Started antibiotics on 04/15 with wait and see effectiveness.  Today is 04/16 at 10:15am. To date no relief of symptoms.

                                                Initially, the first day as with the first dose, my left arm ached but this time it lingered for about 4 days. I was working a job that requires heavy lifting and at first thought it was the work, but after not working at all for about 3 days, my body would start aching all over. This is approximately 10 days after my second dose of Phizer. My bones ached, sort of like getting the flu. Late in the afternoons is when this pain would begin and by 7-8 at night, all I wanted to do was sleep. Each day, when waking most all the aching would be gone only to start up again about the same time in the afternoon/early evening. Last night, I went to bed about 7 pm and slept up until 6 am. As I am writing this, the aching is beginning in my arms again and I have tons of tiredness. It is 4:25 pm. and day 12 after the 2nd dose of Phizer.

                                                Soreness on the around the shot site; Severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is; Severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is; Has not slept due to pain; cannot sleep, the pain wakes him up; Could not use his arm; 50% deficit with the use of his left arm; After the vaccine, he could not lift his arm above his mid face level; Burning and tingling down the left arm; went to his hand and fingertips and progressed to the whole left side of his body including his rib line, hip, leg, and foot; Burning and tingling down the left arm; went to his hand and fingertips and progressed to the whole left side of his body including his rib line, hip, leg, and foot; Nauseous; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient who is a retired paramedic). A 62-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: ER8732), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 30Mar2021 at 01:00 PM (13:00), as first dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included bipolar depression from probably 10 years ago (2011) and ongoing, torn rotator cuff (15 to 20 years ago), and food poisoning in mid-Aug2020 (maybe it was more than that; may get tested to see if he ever had COVID-19). The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included vilazodone hydrochloride (VIIBRYD) from 2017 and ongoing (for at least four years) for bipolar depression. The patient has no known allergies. The patient was one of those people who doesn&#39;t get sick and he doesn&#39;t normally get the flu shot and everyone told him to get this Pfizer vaccine. The patient was not panicking but got the first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine on Tuesday (30Mar2021) around 01:00 PM and saw some things about having soreness on the around the shot site and all of that from that night (30Mar2021). This is going on for three days (from 30Mar2021) with severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is; if you ever have pulled a rotator cuff it feels like that and he has not slept in almost 3 days due to pain from 30Mar2021. The pain is severe at times that it makes him nauseous (Mar2021). He figured the soreness was normal and later in the evening on 30Mar2021, the pain became an issue when he tried to go to bed that evening. Since the first two nights compared to last night, the soreness is actually improved; every time he tries to sleep with pain as a factor it is not easy. The patient can feel throbbing with his heartbeat and with the circulation there is throbbing pain. The pain was terrible and was throbbing like his heartbeat and similar to like a shoulder rotator cuff injury. For the first two days, on Tuesday (30Mar2021) and Wednesday (31Mar2021) after the vaccine, he could not use his arm or lift his arm above his mid face level. According to the patient, it was like a rotator cuff and he had a torn rotator cuff 15 to 20 years ago and this is the same arm that his torn rotator cuff occurred in; this is very painful and he is comparing it to the torn rotator cuff. In Mar2021, the patient had burning and tingling down the left arm and 3 days no sleep because the pain is worse at night. During the last week (Mar2021), his left leg down to his foot is also tingling and burning. The patient&#39;s primary care physician just retired, and he is in the process of finding a new one. The patient had no treatment or physician or emergency room (ER) visit for the reported events because being in the ER field, he can tell right now that it would be a waste of time of the effort to go into the ER as they would do nothing but tell him to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) and that is it. The patient did not like to take paracetamol and hates taking paracetamol. The patient clarified it is generic acetaminophen extra strength (Strength: 500 mg; Lot Number: P119682, Expiration Date: Mar2022, UPC Number: 5084417594) that he has taken (maybe every 6 hours oral) and it does relieve the pain so that is only so good. He does not know if in motion of the course of the day, something happened because at night laying still in bed is when he has pain. The patient did a lot of research before he made this call and the severity of the pain is enough to actually keep him awake for three days. He thought it was severe pain; maybe he should have told them to administer the vaccine in his right arm, but it was administered into his left arm. The only reason he made this call was because he wanted someone to know what he was having which could be just completely normal and he is sure every reaction is different and he expected the soreness because he remembers as a kid having shots. Also, this level of pain he is experiencing is what he wanted to report; imagine having  himself going three days without a full night of sleep and he wanted to report this to make sure Pfizer knew this if they were keeping track of numbers of how many people have a similar pain level. The patient also asked if there were other people who called and reported these symptoms and if there is any information or treatment recommendations. As of 08Apr2021, even up to five days after getting the shot, now going on seven days that he has had some pretty severe reactions. The patient called in after 3 nights of getting no sleep. The patient was calling today to see if someone was ever going to call him back and asking will there be a follow up call from someone to see if he&#39;s still alive. The patient had some pretty severe reactions and they have actually gotten worse. There also have been new developments. The patient had pain in his arm that pulses along with his heart rate. It is so bad that it kept him up for 3 nights and still wakes him up at night. The pulsing pain in his arm started on the first night and has gradually gotten worse. The pain in the arm that is enough that it keeps him awake at night only starts getting severe when he goes to bed. He has tried sleeping in an upright position and he has tried everything, and nothing seems to alleviate it. The patient took generic acetaminophen which did not work during his last phone call. The patient also tried naproxen sodium (ALEVE) and that doesn&#39;t work wither. It was absolutely debilitating at times to where he has a 50% deficit with the use of his left arm (Mar2021). The patient initially reported burning and tingling sensation that was on his left arm and went to his hand and fingertips but now it has progressed to the whole left side of his body including his rib line, hip, leg, and foot. He is a retired paramedic and is pretty sure he is not having a long stroke. The patient feels it is too long to have symptoms from a shot he got. The patient has a lot of friends in the medical field and he&#39;s been told even going to a primary care physician, it is kind of gray area when it comes to dealing with COVID-19 vaccines. The patient was having second thoughts about getting the second shot. He had been told he can take NSAIDS over the counter for pain which has not helped him; there is no protocol for diagnosing or treating anything that happens from the shot. People in the medical field have told him there is thin line now to treat side effects because of liability; some doctors won&#39;t even get into it, just refer to Pfizer because medical insurance will not cover any services related to COVID-19 vaccine reactions. The patient continues to explain that is why the federal government is the only one that owns the shot due to liability. The patient&#39;s main concern is calling and reporting and maybe getting some help in deciding whether or not to get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. In his opinion, that is too long to have pain that he cannot sleep, the pain wakes him up. This all happened along with the shot, the same night and there are times where he can&#39;t work due to it. The patient asks if anyone is concerned with it and will someone feel bad because he doesn&#39;t get the second shot. His main concern is that people are underscoring or even lying about side effects, stating he can&#39;t believe he is an isolated case. The patient continued to ask if this is something he&#39;s stuck with, or if it is something he would have to deal with from now on from getting this shot. The patient regrets getting the first shot and stated that if he knew then what he would be going through now, he wouldn&#39;t have got it. The patient has no sort of history of being a hypochondriac and the feelings he is going through right now are sensations that he has never felt in his life. The patient continues to explain he doesn&#39;t even know how to categorize it other than mentally relating it to the shot since it all occurred in line with Mar2021 getting the shot. The patient further commented that if he ran a call with an ambulance right now with a patient telling him what i he was telling the company, he wouldn&#39;t even know what to do with them other than getting them comfortable and to a hospital. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Soreness on the around the shot site&#34;, &#34;Severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is&#34;, and &#34; Has not slept due to pain; cannot sleep, the pain wakes him up&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 62-year-old (age at time of vaccination) male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm right, on 14Apr2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at clinic.

The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing Parkinson&#39;s from 2010. He did not know about family history of having Parkinson&#39;s. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any vaccine within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The patient reported that after two vaccines on an unknown date in Apr2021, he started to shake and now was still shaking. He was wondering why he was shaking so hard. He said it could potentially be his Parkinson&#39;s and asked what he should do. Mailing and email address declined. Primary care doctor&#39;s address, telephone number, and email address declined. The patient stated the doctor was not in. Shaking was noticed after the second dose. It was improved, but he didn&#39;t like it. He could not concentrate, he didn&#39;t think right, and could not talk right. When asked to provide information from vaccine card, the patient stated he had a hard time moving, he moved so slowly and had card but could not find it.

                                                pt says the next day after taking the vax his arm was a little sore but when he stood up he had a hard time moving around, he was hyperventilating and he felt very exhausted.  He got a severe pain in his left hip.  He said the pain was so intense he could barely move so he took a low dose pain killer.  He was in so much pain he curled up in a fetal position and rock back and forth.  He says he was crying and in a hallucination state for about an hour.  After that the he said the symptoms seemed to be getting better but was completely exhausted.  His eyes were red and had trouble with his vision.  On 6/4/2021 he still has some pain and has an ache inside the bone, gets winded w/ moving around but says his symptoms seemed to be improving.

                                                Following morning patient was &#34;Foggy&#34; in the brain and unable to string words together in a sentence very well.  He let me know he could not focus enough to read and retain anything.  He wanted to talk but couldn&#39;t find the words.  He remained very quiet but had no other symptoms of fever, pain, or anything else.  10 days post vaccine and he is doing better but still not feeling normal and not talking and holding conversations as usual.  He is able to answer appropriately .  The last two days he said all food is tasting bland without a lot of flavor.  He has taken a couple Tylenol  the last two days and drank Echinacea tea to try and make an improvement.  Is there data or information to give us any idea how long this could last?

                                                This was my first COVID-19 vaccine.  Second is scheduled for 2 March.  Soreness developed at point of injection that evening, but not unusual.  I felt pressure in head/neck area and had dry cough that evening.  Took Advil PM before going to bed.  About 2am that night I started having severe chills.  I took temp at 5am and it was 101.7.  Took Tylenol and temp went to 99.8 by 7 am.  Temp went back up to 101.5 by noon.   Had called my workplace medical and they want me to stay out for 3 days due to the reaction.

Started around 6 AM by 9 AM couldn&#39;t stand  very weak  slightly lightheaded    Threw up till almost choking.  At noon my temp hit  103.7   Took tylenol all AM and wasn&#39;t lowering temp.  That was the highest temp  Then gradually began to  come down   At 5:00 PM temp at 100 and able to put soup down.  Woke up  4 AM next day in  total sweat that had to move to other side of bed  Soaked but felt OK   On 23rd  Got headache above right eye to side of frontal lobe,   Not any strong headache at all   Dull  Like a 2 out of 10.  My concern is I still have the exact same headache as I did three weeks ago  Not a smidgen lower at all  SAME.  And I booked second vaccine for Sat 2/27th    I am concerned as I have heard second can be worse.   I have never had the flu and this was my first ever vaccine of any kind    Please advise

He&#39;s reporting adverse events and would like to know: If he takes Tylenol to treat his symptoms, would it decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine or not. Also, if he were to go for a COVID-19 viral test, would the fact that he was received the vaccine interact with the test and cause a false positive result or not. Patient was reporting that yesterday, day 4, he started with body aches, headache, and &#34;when he got in bed, he had chills and shivers real bad, little chilly&#34; so possibly a mild fever. Enquired could these all be side effects of the vaccine or not. If he go for the COVID test - would it be positive or not.

Then 5 days later he had really bad body aches and a headache. He went to bed cause he was feeling worse but before going to bed he noticed he had shivers really bad, uncontrollably almost which lasted over an hour. He presume they are fairly normal side effects but wants to confirm this could happen after five days. Also, he was told not to take Aspirin or Tylenol before getting the vaccine because it could affect the efficacy, but he wants to know could he take a Tylenol now 5 days later for the headache and body aches. He was better now than he was doing. Caller clarified the event was 4 days after the shot, the shot was Monday and events started Thursday. On Thursday evening, 11Feb2021, was when he had the bad body aches, headache, and shivers. At this point he still has the headache and body ache.

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: Not Reported), via an unspecified route of administration on Arm Right on 18Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included spinal injury, an infection in his scrotum, some neurogenic things, white blood cells (his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine). There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that, the consumer stated, &#34;my wife and me went to hospital and we got a COVID vaccine first one, we had some, my wife had terrible side effects, I am crippled, and I had not it before in Mar2021, she is ok, but she is just sick, I am sick, but she is very sick and she got bad stuffs (rash).&#34; Caller states that both him and his wife were having some side effects, although his wife was having the worse trouble. Caller states that last night, him and his wife were up all night. Caller was up because his wife was up so sick. Caller states that both him and his wife are sick and disabled, that is why they got the shot. Caller reports that he is retired and disabled because he got hurt at work. Caller states that what he is experiencing, is he just feels bad on 18Mar2021. Caller states that he did previously go to a doctor to do a blood study, the doctor is looking for blood diseases or cancer in the caller, and caller thinks that taking the COVID shot just exposed his weak spots. Caller reports that both him and his wife have body aches. Caller was wondering if there was anything, he can go get over the counter at the pharmacy to help. Caller reports that he cannot call his doctor, because they are all out on Fridays. Caller states that him and his wife are not planning to take the second dose of the product. Caller states that they have a lot of hurricanes where they live. Their house got tore up in one, and they sold it to one of their sons, and the caller and his wife moved out to their beach house for a while. He had an infection in his scrotum, something stung him, and that is what the doctors are looking for in him now, because his white blood cell count is high, and he has a rash on his scrotum in Mar2021. It was infected. Caller states that this infection in his scrotum has flared back up since getting the COVID vaccine yesterday, so caller had thought it went away but he guesses it never went away. Caller confirms that the issues with his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine, but the caller thinks that the vaccine was exposing the caller&#39;s weak spots, and maybe that is a god send because it is all flared up now, and the caller will be able to tell his doctor that. Caller states that he has been getting high white blood cell count readings since the stuff with his scrotum first started, and that is why his doctor sent him to an Oncologist for all this blood testing, so maybe this will be a b lessing in disguise for the caller, in finding out what is wrong with him. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications. On 30Jan2021, when he woke up in the morning, he felt like had a weigh on his entire body and got up and he just instantly started having chills, and fever usual (statement incomplete). He looked at all the symptoms of getting the vaccine and he had like 98 percent of them that was just normal, just like a flu. But he was travelling tomorrow morning at 5am and he don&#39;t want to travel right now. He still have a fever on and off. He doesn&#39;t know if it was safe enough to go on a plane after getting my first dose and how long the symptoms will last. The patient felt like he got run over. His wife got her second dose a couple of days ago and had really bad reactions like flu and could not move all day and that was a Moderna one. Patient stated that he was 6 ft; however, not appropriately paraphrased and clarified. The patient received unspecified treatment for the events. The patient considered a causality between the event because of the vaccine. Outcome of event fever was not recovered; outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch number is requested.

                                                Rash covering the majority of my face when I woke up the next day. No hives and did not itch. Red patches and blotches. Not really bothersome. Got a little better every day until it was hard to see any a week later. Momentary dizziness, also the next day, like a three second flash, when rising from laying flat, laying flat from standing or sitting, or rolling over while laying down. Passes and I can sleep and not notice it unless I am awake enough, and cognizant enough, to notice it when I roll over. Once standing and moving about there is no problem except a feeling, I have seen described as brain fog, of being a little off mentally. Not sharp, but no dizziness. Can maintain normal activity that includes bending over, kneeling down, driving and riding in a car without any dizziness. Have tried eply maneuver, something I can do, but have not had any improvement. Brain fog seems to improve with normal daily movement and I have been trying to avoid my normal caffeine intake.

                                                Around 330 on 4/6, I started feeling bad and arrived home around 530pm and  had a slight Temperature (99) with hearing loss in both ears. But the right one had complete hearing loss. Thinking it would be a short term side effect, but realizing on Thursday am with was not, I called my physician office on Thursday and they called back on Thursday for a Friday 9am appt with the PA. She said it was sinus related , fluid in the ears was pushing the ear drum back and gave me a prescription for Fluticasone and to take my Zyretx and Sudafed. Call her in a week if symptoms did not away. On 4/12/21, I still have massive hearing loss and pain, so called a ENT for an appt and received a 1:15pm on the same day. This  was the first day I had balance issues.

A 63-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient medical history: no. Family medical history: no. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Vaccination facility type: hospital. Vaccine administered at military facility: no. The patient experienced high fever (over 102, 103.7, 102.7, 99 or 100) on 04Apr2021, blurred vision on 04Apr2021, headache on 2021, horrible chills on 2021, night sweats on 2021, shaking like crazy on Apr2021, has no energy on Apr2021, had been feeling tired and rundown on 2021, it was double vision, like looking in a fun house mirror on Apr2021, he was still freezing on Apr2021, did not feel like himself on Apr2021. On Saturday, her brother was out shopping with her and stated that he felt very tired and run down and had a headache. He started running a high fever but stuck it out at home. On 04Apr2021, he was taken to the emergency room and admitted to the hospital. They had been running test after test and can&#39;t seem to find anything wrong. The doctor thought that it was some kind of reaction to the vaccine. The patient was still running a high fever over 102 and was still experiencing fatigue and headaches on and off, and horrible chills and night sweats. The patient wanted to wait until the day after Easter to go to the hospital but started experiencing new symptoms. He was starting to experience blurred vision. Was then taken to the emergency room. The fever went down with Tylenol but continued to go up again when Tylenol wears off. Temperature was 103.7 at one point and has mostly been over 102, stating that this morning was 102.7. It had been one week that he was still having these symptoms. It was strange because the patient was feeling all right for the first 2 weeks. At the hospital, they kept giving him Tylenol to bring the fever down. He had been shaking like crazy. Had horrible chills and night sweats. He had no energy. He had not had the second dose. They cannot find anything else wrong. He was a health nut and run five miles a day. Took good care of himself. He seemed ok the first 2 weeks. Had been a week that he still can&#39;t break the fever. When looked up the symptoms, he had everything except for nausea. He also had blurred vision. They did a spinal tap, echocardiogram, EKG and blood work. He had seen 5 different doctors. The fever was highest at 103.7 and has consistently been over 102. With Tylenol, it had gone down to 99 or 100 but always shoots back up. 2 weeks after the shot, he took his temperature and wasn&#39;t feeling good all day. He stayed home from Wednesday until Sunday when he started experiencing new crazy vision symptoms. Stated that started Saturday. He was taken to the hospital on Easter and was admitted to the hospital, and was still there. The vision problem was new and it started to develop Saturday night. It was double vision, like looking in a fun house mirror. He still experienced the double and blurry vision now but only occasionally, when he tried to get up. It was on and off when he had to get up to go to the bathroom. He was still freezing and had shake and chills. He got night sweats and fever, chills, and did not feel like himself. The reporter didn&#39;t think he had high cholesterol or high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything like that. Tests: They did bloodwork, CT scans, MRI of the brain, echocardiogram, EKG, spinal tap.  There were no white blood cells found in the spinal tap and that the echocardiogram was good. Everything came back normal. He had seen cardiologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, primary care doctors, and no one can find anything. They did another kind of test regarding his vision. Her brother was depressed and wanted his energy back. It had been a whole week. The outcome of the events high fever (over 102, 103.7, 102.7, 99 or 100) and blurred vision was not recovered, outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient was hospitalized for high fever (over 102, 103.7, 102.7, 99 or 100) and blurred vision from 04Apr2021 to an unknown date. The reporter was not sure if this was happening because of the vaccine.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

This happened on 5/21/2021.  His wife is here giving the history.  Him and his wife have the first Covid injection by Pfizer on 5/21/2021 at 3:30 PM at pharmacy.  Within 2 hours they were back home sitting on the porch relaxing and he had the sudden onset of stroke like symptoms as noted above.  EMS was called.  Apparently by the time EMS arrived he had recovered to baseline and they advised him he did not have to go to the hospital for evaluation if he did not want to apparently.  Since that time he has had no further stroke like symptoms but has continued to feel a bit foggy in the head with a slight dizziness.

A 64-year-old male patient reported received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK4176  and expiry date: Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 10Jan2021 08:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history bypass surgery (10.5 years ago, in June it will be 11 years ago) and hard of hearing. Patient said he used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but right now he is 5&#39;6&#34; or 5&#39;5&#34;. He says that change in his height happened before he got the vaccine, that is effects of being short. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) and simvastatin. It was reported that the patient had been healthy all his life, he doesn&#39;t have any medical conditions which could have contributed to side effects. He does not think they would have contributed but he takes Simvastatin and Baby Aspirin. The patient got the vaccination, the first one (BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization, on unspecified date) he did not have anything happen, no side effects or nothing. It was as if he didn&#39;t receive any vaccine. The second dose he received it at 8:45 AM on Sunday (10Jan2021) and Sunday night he began experiencing tiredness and then chills, fever, generalized aches and could hardly sleep through the night. It was reported as the worst night in his life and then, fortunately during the day on Monday, gradually, the intensity and severity of the symptoms began to subside but he was not able to do any of his normal functions. Then last night Monday night (11Jan2021) he slept well and today on Tuesday (12Jan2021) he was okay, this morning everything was fine. On Tuesday night he took Acetaminophen for pain, he clarified that was Sunday night after he had gotten the vaccine he took Acetaminophen and he still had the problems then Monday night he thought it would be the same so he put the medicine next to the bed on the night stand but he did not need to take it. He slept and woke up this morning and his back to work. Now it is like nothing has happened. He has recovered completely from all effects. The outcome of the event could hardly sleep through the night was recovered on 11Jan2021 and all the other events recovered on 12Jan2021.

A 64-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), first dose (at the age of 64-years old) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm (reported as injection in left shoulder) on 11Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 1982 and ongoing, ongoing seizure (he had seizures for about 6 years and they got worse,  probably it has been 6 or 7 years he has had seizures), high blood pressure, heartburn and insomnia (comes and goes). Concomitant medication included atorvastatin (manufacturer unknown, Tablet) 40mg strength,  oral administration, 20 mg daily (half a tablet at bedtime) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; cholecalciferol (manufacturer unknown, Tablets) oral administration, 2 tablets in morning taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; escitalopram (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg once daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; lacosamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 200 mg twice daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for approximately a couple of years) and ongoing; lisinopril (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg daily taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; mesalazine (MESALAMINE, Tablet), oral administration, 4 tablets a day  taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; omeprazole (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 20 mg as needed (two or three pills daily as he feels like he needs) taken for heartburn and ulcerative colitis from 2001 (approximately 20 years ago) and ongoing and zonisamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 100 mg twice a day taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for a couple of years) and ongoing.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received the vaccination on 11Mar2021. After he received his first dose of the vaccine he experienced a bunch of symptoms which he listed as sweating, he could not sleep at all the first night, he was falling down, he had no appetite, and had no energy that same day. This occurred after the 15 minute window of waiting after getting the vaccination. On 11Mar2021, after the vaccination, the patient went to the store to buy groceries and started sweating like crazy. He could hardly carry the groceries to the car. He also had wobbliness. On 11Mar2021, the patient fell down and passed out coming home that night and he had blood all over him. He later clarified that he did not pass out, he got into the house and fell down and somehow landed on the recliner. He was covered in blood and all kinds of stuff. On 11Mar2021, he could not sleep at all that first night and his prescription Melatonin (Manufacturer Rugby) 3mg did not help at all. The falling down occurred roughly that same night on 11Mar2021. The patient stated that they told him they thought he was having seizures again but he was not. He had imaging which showed no seizures and Xray of his brain with unknown results in Mar2021. He had to have another Xray to make sure he did not have bleeding on the brain.  Xray of his stomach showed kidney stones on 12Mar2021. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The patient was scheduled to return for the second dose 01Apr2021.  The patient inquired if he should get the second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of events kidney stone, blood all over him, could not sleep at all and wobbliness was unknown. The outcome of events sweating and falling down was recovered on 11Mar2021 and no appetite was recovered in Mar2021. The outcome of no energy was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

My primary care physician immediately referred me  who performed a needle biopsy on the reactive lymph node on 4/6.   Test results show no cancer cells and determined it was most likely a benign  reactive node. It is not known if this is a direct result of the vaccine.

When we got home he said he was disoriented and did not remember the month we were or the name of our dog. He was checking the phone saying he did never send the messages that were sent by him some minutes ago and did not remember the conversations he had in the morning. He never have had problems like this and we were very surprised. He rested a bit and the disorientation stop about an hour later. He is now feeling fine. My aunt, who is an MD said he should take a cardio aspirin and that&#39;s what he did. His blood pressure and temperature were always well. As a reference, he had COVID in March 2020 and was hospitalized due to it but recovered well. He then received the first covid dose in March 19, 2021 and had some fever, chills, and headache but was otherwise fine.

                                                On 04/22/2021, a patient was determined to have pericarditis, possibly secondary to COVID-19 vaccination. The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer) on 2/27/2021. The patient reported feeling poorly and presented to ER on 03/02/2021 with chest pain and dyspnea. He states the chest pain he is experienced this week is similar to the 2 episodes of chest pain he had after each of the two-step Pfizer COVID vaccination that he received in February 02/27/2021 and March 03/15/2021. He underwent a stress test on 03/11/2021 which did not show any reversible perfusion defects. Of note, the patient had COVID-19 back in October 2020 which manifested with night sweats, malaise for a few days and then cleared completely without any &#34;long hauler&#34; symptoms. The patient was treated with ibuprofen and colchicine.  I did not find any evidence suggesting a relationship between pericarditis and covid-19 vaccination. In clinical trials, pericarditis was not statistically significantly different between treatment arms. Other potential causes of pericarditis include atrial fibrillation.

He also had onset of headaches which are ongoing-not sure which date (in Jan2021) these started other than toward the end of the 5 days of feeling tired. He was not sure if the headaches are due to a stuffy nose, or because he was needing a little extra coffee because he was so tired during that 5 days; he was drinking like 3 cups of coffee daily. The reporter stated that, he was going to see his mom and dad who are 93 years old; he did not want to end up doing anything to them, so he got vaccination.

Then about the 3rd day he noticed the pain was still there and when he holds the phone for a long time talking he starts feeling the pain.  Also when he&#39;s laying down on the left arm after a while it starts hurting and he has to turn over to get rid of the pain, and this happens all the time and when he&#39;s laying down every night he has the pain.  He cannot hold his phone in his left hand for a long time due to the pain.  The pain is localized around the injection site itself.  He has a friend that is having the exact same symptoms as well.  He has not taken anything for the pain/reaction or called his doctor.   This has been going on for almost 2 months and wonders if he has a blockage in that arm.   This pain wakes him up at night and he has to switch locations in order to get rid of the pain.

A 64-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17May2021 (at the age of 64-year-old, Batch/Lot Number: EW0177) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included was walking pneumonia twice and other than that just a typical flu. The patient races dirt bikes so he was tough. Also, he had carpel tunnel from his job, and he had left over pain pills from that, and he had been taking them to help reduce the pain since he cannot really do anything about his side effects. Concomitant medication included pain pills, no other products reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 26Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0162) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and on an unspecified date in Apr2021, experienced muscle stiffness and soreness that was in left arm and around his buttocks and his thighs and reported felt soreness for a few days afterward. This report is not related to study or programme. It was reported that, honestly, he wishes he never got it because he cannot do anything. He was on the fence about getting it since we are at the end of the pandemic and the hospitals are not as overwhelmed anymore. Everyone thinks that he was still in his 50&#39;s, he was very healthy, and he has no medical or health issues and he works out all the time, which was why he was so concerned about why it was affecting him like this. He has had his second dose of the COVID vaccine, and he wanted to report what was going on with his body. It was reported that, then he got the 2nd dose and within a day or two he was sore, and he was at the 11th day of experiencing this. He was sore and tight on his upper body like his chest, both arms, his shoulder blades, biceps, triceps, lower neck muscles and on his shoulder blades behind him. He had his 2nd dose not last Monday but the Monday before that. It did dissipate during the day. He jokingly said it was like the Pfizer vaccine retreats and hides during the day. Because of this he has had no decent sleep for the last few nights. His shoulder aches like someone took a bat and hit it. It feels like that on his left arm too but a little less pain. He was a side body sleeper, and he cannot sleep on his side because of this so then he ends up sleeping on his back with his mouth wide open which then makes him dehydrated of course. he has no energy, and the pain was like it was hitting a nerve where he barely can pick up 5 pounds. This was an extending issue and he just wanted to report and see if anyone else has had this before. The hospital said that they have not had anyone else report this before. It was slowly dissipating but he did not understand why it reinforces itself in the evening. Yesterday, he had to go service a customer and he was moving so slow and had lower back and thigh tightness. His upper body was sore and tight so when he got home, he was walking around trying to get his blood flowing and stretching some but then in the middle of the night those reserves came out and he gets attacked. The stiffness, soreness and pain were all concentrated mostly on his upper body. Also, his neck pops and he has never had that happen before. He looked it up and it looks like it was something with air in his bloodstream or something and when he rotates his head and looks around it makes a pop sound, and it has been doing it ever since his 2nd shot. He says this started probably on 18May2021 right after the vaccine. The patient clarified that for the side effects after his second dose that began soon after the COVID vaccine and he states that it was like all hell broke loose. This has gotten a little bit better but not a lot. Maybe 10% better or maybe 15% better. As he was sitting there his shoulder area on the right side was a little bit in pain. He feels like he was 80 years old, he was walking slow, and his body was stiff. No further details provided on the pain pills. He says he was flexing his bicep and he has some pain and there was pain in his triceps. He also has pain between those muscles, it hurts. It was maybe where he had the COVID vaccine.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.

                                                Patient received his first covid shot this past Saturday and about 20 minutes following he noticed a right sided facial droop.  Droop began to worsen, and he had difficulty moving his right eye lid, so he decided to go to Urgent Care and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy.  He was started on Prednisone and Valtex which are reducing his symptoms.  Symptoms are almost resolved.  He does feel fatigued and slightly anxious.

                                                After not sleeping well Monday night I woke up on the 23rd of February not feeling 100%. So around 8:00 AM I took two Bayer Back &amp; Body. Around 8:15 / 8:20am I began feeling very dizzy and unable to stand up on my own. I couldn&#39;t walk down the hallway without holding onto the wall. This went on all day, long after the effects of the Bayer Back &amp; Body would have worn off . Even at dinner time I was uneasy / unstable walking around. The only time I felt well was when I was lying in bed. By the next morning, Wednesday the 24th, I wasn&#39;t 100% that morning either but I went to work and did the work. It was very difficult but by afternoon I was feeling much better. It wasn&#39;t until Thursday that I was feeling 100%. I had never felt this way in my life. No it was not Epilepsy related and I had been taking Bayer Back &amp; Body FOR YEARS without problem except maybe taking two, occasionally would feel the caffeine.

Used Albuterol inhaler twice, 5 minutes apart, and took Prednisone 20 mg orally.  Within 60-90 minutes, symptoms completely resolved and did not reoccur.  He did not seek medical attention at the time of this reaction, but called this office on 3/11/2021 so that the reaction could be documented.  That prompted today&#39;s office visit and the completion of this VAERS form.  Patient does have monthly allergy injections, but last injection was on 2/23/2021.

As soon as eat breakfast have to go back to bed for 1-3 hours. Same with lunch, eat, go back to bed about 3 hours and same with dinner. Then go to bed for evening. Extreme brain fog and forgetfulness. Can&#39;t think of words or make sentences. Can&#39;t remember anything. Feels like a very heavy feeling in head like head weighs a lot and very cloudy. Pain from shot in arm moved up to neck, ear and jaw the day after shot. Arm quit hurting but couldn&#39;t lift it. Pain stayed in neck, ear and jaw for a week and now is a stiff feeling. I think the lymph nodes are swollen. Effects eating, hard to keep food down. Nausea and stomach pain. I have appetite but have to eat while nauseous and pain. Still severely fatigued every day and have to sleep most of each day or at least sit and rest. So exhausted. Also night of shot started getting hot and cold chills. Still have them over 2 weeks after shot. Bad tinnitus started night of shot and still have it over 2 weeks after shot. Very loud and nothing makes it go away. Bad headache started morning after shot. I have had a headache pretty much everyday, all day since the shot over 2 weeks ago. I feel sick like I have flu.

This 65-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Mar2021 probably around noon (at age of 65 years old; lot number: ER8730) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed about 10 years ago and diabetes type 2 diagnosed about 10 years ago (as of 24Mar2021). He caught COVID a few months ago (as of 24Mar2021) and was sick for 3 weeks and then came out of that and at that time got a rash and came out of that and wanted to get the vaccine because he was age 65 and did not want this thing to kill him.

By routine, I mean a run that I have done thousands of times without muscle soreness. At first, the pain was treatable with a 400mg dose of Ibuprofen but gradually worsened to the point where over the counter NSAIDS were no longer effective. Moving to 200mg Celecoxhib 2x day was only  modestly effective.  The pain was so intense that I am unable to get adequate sleep and has consolidated in the left leg.

                                                Neurologist Consultation Note dated 04/27/2021: I saw him in consultation on 04/13/2021 and to follow up yesterday on 04/26/2021.  Well until he had the second of 2 Pfizer COVID-19 vaccinations 03/03/2021 and about 2 weeks or so later, around the third week in March, he had onset over a day or two or several days of numbness of the bottom of the feet, spreading to the ankles and calves, affecting the hands.  Balance is affected and feet and hands are weak.  This numbness is also painful, affects sleep with symptoms of restlessness in the legs when he tries to sleep.   Prior to my evaluation, was seen at the ER and had CT scan of the head and CT angiogram probably of the chest as well as Doppler of the lower extremities.  He was given gabapentin 100 mg at bedtime, which was not helpful; and prescribed oxycodone 5/325 mg, which he did not start.   After consultation, referred for electrodiagnostic study, performed on 04/22/2021 of all 4 extremities by a doctor.  Findings were of absent or reduced amplitude with normal latencies of all sensory nerves.  Specifically, sural potentials were absent bilaterally.  Motor nerves showed absent or delayed F waves and reduced recruitment, disproportionate amplitude loss or acute denervation, consistent with proximal demyelination.  In my opinion, this confirms the presence of a demyelinating neuropathy.  Further, absent sural potentials are more consistent with chronic as opposed to acute inflammatory demyelinating peripheral neuropathy.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

Watch did not show higher than 84 through the night but I could not sleep much due to the heart pounding. Arose for work at 6:15 and felt tired but the palpitations did not bother while standing. Temperature 98.8. about 90 minutes later, while at work, HR was 130-148, I was breathing deeply, otherwise okay. Chills started about 17 hours post-injection and temperature rose as high as 102.4 in the next 3 hours. HR lowered to about 110 about 16 hours post injection and did not get below 100 for another 12 hours. some coughing throughout this time, not productive. Heavy night sweats around 34 hours post injection. I had mild chills about 48 hours post injection, and fine since then. The palpitations were very uncomfortable but stopped once the HR lowered to about 110

                                                According to staff....Recipient received the above vaccination and went to sit for 30 minutes.  He had already explained to the staff that he had had previous reactions to bee stings that required epinephrine so the nurse practitioner had  instructed him that he was to wait for 30 minutes vs the usual 15 minutes.  It is unclear exactly how many minutes into the post-vaccination period passed before he began to report numbness around his lips.  The nurse practitioner then indicated he began a &#34;rash&#34; on the back of his neck.  The recipient reported that this was feeling very much like his previous allergic reactions.  They took his BP and it was reported to be around 180/100 at that time.   He did not report feeling SOB but reported his throat felt like it had in previous allergic reactions.  Recipient remained alert and oriented the entire time.  It was decided by the two nurse practitioners on site that he be given the epinephrine and Benadryl IM.  His BP remained elevated and then, following the epinephrine, he became very shaky and a bit foggy. 911 was then notified for further assistance from the EMT&#39;s and possible evaluation at the local hospital which was about 5 minutes away.  Paramedics evaluated the recipient and agreed that evaluation at the hospital would be warranted.  He never lost consciousness or required oxygen or other assistance. He was able to place himself on the gurney and was speaking with his wife (that was present)as he was taken out the door.  The transfer was done out of an abundance of caution. We do not know if the hospital kept him following the incident.

                                                Anxiety. Severe concern about how I felt at the moment, lying in bed. Started at about 2:30 am. An electric feeling. Hard to describe. I thought I might be having a heart attack. It happened several times, resolving to a normal state after 40 min or so, being ok for maybe 1/2 an hour then returning. After 3 or 4 worrisome crescendos, I decided to go to the Emergency Room at 4:30 am. Observed there, released with analysis being it was anxiety, not a heart problem.

Also I noted that the 2nd covid-19 dose recorded on the15th of March is identical to the one I received  on February 22, 2021, leading me to believe that the person who administrated the second shot simply copied the lot number information from the first shot that was recorded on card.

                                                Five days after my second vaccine, at about 8 am, I developed fairly diffuse abdominal pain, and retching.  I left work and went home.  This lasted for about 3 to 4 hours, then let up, but then developed about 45 minutes of profound rigors, which then let up, then my temperature (had been normal) went up to less than 102 F.  For the next six days I continued to run fever, never higher than 103, chills, and some migrating abdominal pain, no diarrhea, normal stools, constipated if anything.  Stayed home from work obviously.  On Sunday, and Monday am, still running fevers, my pain seemed to settle into my right lower quadrant.      My wife, a family physician, helped arrange a CT scan Abdomen and Pelvis, as we were concerned about appendicitis, maybe an abscess.  The scan revealed normal appendix, but several lesions in the right side of the liver thought highly suspicious for &#34;metastatic disease.&#34;  MRI recommended, and had this Wednesday that week, and it confirmed the lesions, with characteristics suspicious for metastatic tumors.  By Monday afternoon, my fever abated, and I felt much better.  Able to return to work.  The abdominal discomfort was improved, maybe due to constipation.  Friday of that week, I was able to get to see my primary provider, who is in Omaha, NE to review the situation, and we agreed a liver biopsy was needed.       A week later, Friday, Jan. 29, I had CT guided liver biopsy at  hospital in Omaha. 16 cores taken, and no malignancy found, but significant inflammatory cells, especially lymphocytes.  Meanwhile I have felt fine.  Decided to do a follow up MRI of liver, which was done Friday, April 2, and all the areas have resolved.    There is an entity called &#34;Inflammatory pseudotumors&#34; of the liver, and my condition fits with this.  It is very rare.     A consideration would be whether it would be possible to stain the biopsy to see if the lymphocytes carry antibodies to the corona virus.

                                                Symtoms:  headache, loss of vision in left eye, vertigo.  Stroke took time to diagnos, I thought it was a vision problem.  Long time delays occurred while scheduling further testing (CT and MRI). Summary from MRI:  &#34;Study Result Impression:  There is diffusion restriction along the left thalamus consistent with subacute ischemia, greater than 6 hours in etiology but less than 2 weeks.&#34;  Outcome:  Vision is slowly improving, headache is mostly gone, vertigo &amp;  mental status slowly improving.

On April 10 the fever got worse and went as high as 101.8°, and I started to develop a cough. I called my local general practitioner for advice on Monday, April 12. Should recommended A Covid test. Over the course of the week I continue to have symptoms of fever oscillating between high and low temperatures (chills and fever) and an increasing development of the cough. Over the course of the illness mornings seem to be better and the temperature with spike in the afternoon. Sleeping was difficult because of the persistent cough. It is currently April 19, 2021 and I still have the persistent cough and intermittent low-grade fever. I had an appointment with my my doctor Dr., she indicated that although the duration is longer than a normal lease see that this would appear to be an adverse effect two of the Covid vaccination. She requested that I report the symptoms that I was having.

                                                I have been sick since the day after the first the first Pfizer shot. 24 hour head ache, drowsy, lost concentration, ringing in my ears and just cant seem to wake up. I have been to the doctor three times and had mutable blood labs, and am now seeing a neurologist who has ordered a MRI of my brain. The problem is none of the doctors have any experience dealing with these adverse symptoms from the injection, does anybody? So who is going to help me before the lights go completely out?????

His fever lasted almost 3 weeks using Ibuprofen and Tylenol twice a day ever day with his fever rarely breaking. I took him to the ER at Hospital on Monday, May 10th. They diagnosed him with Colitis after reviewing a CT scan of his abdomen. He was discharged back home later that evening where he continued on to oral antibiotics: Flagil and Levaquin for 10 days. He was in bed for over 4 weeks with no appetite and lost approximately 15 pounds. It made his chronic vertigo worse with increased memory loss and loss of dexterity in fingers.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3302 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol since 90s and was taking medication to keep it down, and ongoing neuropathy in the feet back in the 90s. Patient seemed to be okay after the vaccination until he didn&#39;t rest well last night on 13Jan2021. The morning of 14Jan2021, he had chills and was aching all over. He has a headache, and he was pretty tired on 14Jan2021. His temperature was 99.9. and wanted to make sure he was okay. They gave him the sheet of side effects but was wondering how long it was going to last. He also had fever and chills on Jan2021. He has been just resting all day long which was all he felt like doing. Patient felt he has a bad case of the flu. When his chills started, he noticed he was tremoring and shaking and his muscles are achy on Jan2021. He usually waits until his temperature is over 100 to take something and noticed where he got the shot was achy on Jan2021. During the night he went to aching more. He was not too excited about getting up and doing anything now. He was tired on 14Jan2021, because he didn&#39;t rest well last night and slept in late today. He finally got around, and ate cereal and stuff. He has just been sitting. He would still get the second vaccine, which was not exciting. Outcome of the events aching all over, headaches, and tired are not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

At various times after I would become aware I was home, alone, on couch, unable even sit up. On one occasion I determined it was 1437hrs, Tuesday, 08 Feb 2021, and sent two text messages with great difficulty just saying HELP. IT was actually 0237hrs, Monday, 08 Feb 2021. Both HELP messages had been replied with questions about what the problem was. At 1200hrs, Tuesday, 09 Feb 2021 I became lucid again though at first I believed it to be Wednesday, 10 Feb 2021.

I curled up in fetal position under a pile of covers for 24 hours. Didn&#39;t fully recovery for 3 days  All simptoms hit me more or less simultaneously within 5 minutes, about 12 hours after 2nd covid shot.  Didn&#39;t seek medical attention, just plowed through it.  I imagined a biological warfare agent would have felt like that. &#34;I thought I was gunna DIE!&#34;

                                                My husband has had a fever and extreme exhaustion every day, all day. for 16 days, since he go the Pfizer vaccine. He is retaining water, does not sleep at night, has heavy night sweats, and is emotionally spent. He has no appetite and forces himself to eat. He tastes what little food he eats. He visited his family doctor, a gastroenterologist, and has been in the emergency room two times for sheer exhaustion and pain. He was released both times after tests. Each time, no one could find a cause and no one sent him to other doctors for help. They would not admit him because there was no guarantee he could see other doctors any faster than if he were at home making appointments. He was referred to an infectious disease specialist by the gastroenterologist, but that appointment  isn&#39;t until March 9, 2021. He will have faded even more by then.

I received the Pfizer vaccine on Feb. 5, and had muscle aches, chills and a cough. I passed out at home on the 10th, cut my forehead, and had to receive stitches. That is when I tested positive for COVID-19. I continued to by symptomatic and opted for the monoclonal infusion. About 5 hours after I received the infusion, I became completely disoriented. I was unable to stand and did know where I was. My wife summoned an ambulance, and I was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. I received fluids intravenously. I was released from the emergency room about 6 hours later.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6203; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly (in the muscle) in right shoulder on 14Mar2021 at age of 67-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen for an unspecified indication, but the reason for taken this drug was &#34;get up and get moving&#34;, the patient took it for many years. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine.  He would like to speak with someone about the effects he had and any suggestions Pfizer may have to help him. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. He received the first dose on 14Mar2021 and on 19Mar2021, he started experiencing side effects. He said all 4 people in his household all got the vaccine and all had side effects. The moment the patient was helping his wife he felt like a sharp needle type pain going through the heart side of his chest. They were little ones, but it was uncomfortable. It caused him to panic. He hanged on to it and it went away in a bit. But 2 hours after that, he had chills and crawled in blankets and stayed until the rest of the night. He has not gotten up since 19Mar2021.  He has bone aches and leg and lower back pain aches. He has a headache on 19Mar2021 and started checking temperature on 25Mar2021. The highest was 104 degrees on 25Mar2021 and ever since (Mar2021) then he had 101 degrees or 100 and something. It also reported he began to have fever on 19Mar2021 (pending clarification). He was told to use Tylenol for fever reducer and started taking it. It also reported he has been taking Tylenol for the headache and fever only and it has not been working, it has actually caused him to have a rash on his face and skull causing dandruff and severe itching and bleeding, so he stopped it. He would like to take Ibuprofen and wanted to know if he could.  When he stopped taking Tylenol, his daughter gave him a lotion for face.  Face is clear and only one place is left that is behind his neck on head.  No further details provided for lotion that he put on the rash. He provided information on Tylenol Extra Strength 500 mg each. He took 2 for rash on 2 occasions every 6 hours and then he started only taking 1 because he has not eaten and felt bitterness in stomach and mouth and was uncomfortable (19Mar2021). The Lot is SSA011 and expiration is Oct2024. He has been taking Ibuprofen for many years and only taking one tablet instead of two. He needs to get up and get going and takes it to help him every day. He did not get tested for COVID, but his wife, son and daughter did and they all tested positive after receiving the vaccine. He assumes he has COVID as well since he has the same symptoms and lives in the same household. He would like to know if he can postpone next dose or can he quit.  Will this get better. If he could take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol. The outcome of events &#34;sharp needle type pain that went through heart side of chest&#34; and &#34;chills&#34; was recovering, of &#34;fever/ highest was 104 degrees&#34;, &#34;bone aches&#34;, and &#34;leg and lower back pain&#34; was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8730 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 13:10 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroid which he have had for 15 years.

The patient took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206) in the left arm on 08Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The reporter (patient&#39;s wife) called about the Pfizer vaccine for COVID 19.

He is on seizure medications, he is not allowed to drive for 1 month because he had the seizure, he has a zoom call meeting with his doctor on 19Apr2021. She says not driving is a problem, he is trying to work from home. She said upper arm for shot location then consulted her husband in the background who said both shots were in his left arm. She said he takes low dose thyroid medication. She consulted her husband in the background for some information. After giving some information she says no he doesn&#39;t take anything else. He is never sick and he&#39;s never ever been hospitalized. This is his first time ever. She said her son says when the body gets into that condition, it enters fight-or-flight, he went into fight, 5 firefighters had to hold him so they could give him the calm-you-down medications in the ambulance. One was his son, he said that he had the power of 10 men. She said her husband doesn&#39;t remember any of it. She says he is very healthy. For investigation, she said, well everything turned out negative. She says he had a CT scan, MRI, EEG, bloodwork, urinalysis on an unspecified date in 2021 and they can&#39;t find anything wrong. She said that they just said everything was normal. She said some of his levels were high last week, on an unspecified date in 2021 in his bloodwork and his doctor wanted him to do bloodwork again in 3 weeks. She said several things were high. The events required a visit to emergency room. She said that the fire department took him. She did not visit the physician office until after he got out of the hospital where he saw his primary doctor. She said she wanted to include on the report that it scared the crap out of her. She said, she was holding his neck up and tilting his head up to make sure he was getting air. She wanted to let everyone know what happened. The outcome of the event Grand mal seizure was recovered with sequelae on an unspecified date while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

A 67-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EK9231; Expiration Date was not reported), via intramuscular route of administration in Arm Right on 23Jan2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostatomegaly, drug hypersensitivity both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included finasteride (FINAS-TERIDE); ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 23Jan2021 12:30, he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient states he felt fine at the clinic after 15 mins and then after he left he felt lightheaded and dizzy and this continued on. Patient says his reaction was about 20 plus minutes after his injection, which he was fine when he got the injection, he became lightheaded and that has kind of continued on. He says it was pretty bad on the first day, then the second day it went away. He says a couple days later it came back, with his heart kind of racing, and he was still experiencing that though it was getting better. This was not something he had be-fore and he feels anxious and body is tight with dizziness. He says he experiences it periodically, and today it was not bad, but yesterday it came back again. He says he was concerned about that, but he hasn&#39;t passed out or anything. He says he went to the doctor and had an EKG and blood work done, which were all ok. He says it has been off and on, and he was kind of very anxious and tense as well, his insides are tight and jittery, sort of. He says he didn&#39;t see that listed as a common side effect. He says he had soreness at injection site, that went away, and he had no fever or any-thing, just the lightheadedness. He says he wants to see about the lightheadedness, if it had been reported by others, since he didn&#39;t notice it as a common reaction, to see what is going on there, since it has been over a week and it hasn&#39;t totally gone away, so he is concerned about having his second dose. Am doing better now. Went to the doctor for tests on 27Jan2021 (Wednesday). Test results were okay. Patient states these are not some of the common side effects he has seen or read about. He would like to know when will his symptoms go away. Patient would like to know if he should receive the second dose that was scheduled in less than two weeks. Patient states he called his doctor had an EKG and blood work done and his tests were negative. The outcome for soreness at injection site was recovered on an unspecified date and for rest events was recovering.

A 67-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9262 and expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in Deltoid Right, Tuesday on 26Jan2021 at 14:00 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at hospital.

He stated he was in a coma for 2 of those 4 weeks in the hospital and no further details provided. Concomitant medications were not provided. The patient took B Complex Vitamin from long time. He said his doctor actually insisted him to get the COVID-19 Vaccine, even though he told his doctor that he had the COVID-19 Virus antibodies from having COVID-19 last year. He asked his doctor why he needed to get the COVID-19 Vaccine if he had the COVID-19 Virus. His doctor said the medical community at large decided that it was best to get the COVID-19 Vaccine, unless a person had the COVID-19 Virus within the last 3 months and another doctor also told him the same thing about the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient reported that last year, he was in good health, with no underlying conditions, before getting the COVID-19 Virus. He said now his lungs were damaged from the COVID-19 Virus. The patient said his doctor told him the stress and trauma of having the COVID-19 Virus probably weakened his body, and the doctor had hoped the Testosterone shots would help boost his body. The patient reported that he had a Testosterone shot on Monday, 25Jan2021. He stated the Testosterone shot was given to him at his doctor&#39;s office, so he did not know the Testosterone dose, NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said about a month ago (clarified as 6 weeks ago), he complained to his doctor about generalized weakness. He said his doctor did blood work at the time, and told him, his Testosterone was low. He said he got his first Testosterone shot about 6 weeks ago. He clarified he had a total of 3 Testosterone shots before seeing his doctor, again, on Monday, 25Jan2021. He had a blood test again (clarified as last week) to see if his Testosterone levels had improved. He said when he went to his doctor on Monday, 25Jan2021, his doctor told him his Testosterone level was not improved and had actually gotten worse. His doctor was wondering if his body was not absorbing the Testosterone like it should. The patient said he was feeling better with the Testosterone shots he was received so far and no further details provided. On 26Jan2021, the patient had injection site pain immediately, describing the pain as a stiffness. He said his injection site pain was improved and now he only had injection site pain when the injection site was touched.

The did a second biopsy on 05/20/2021, they sent samples, no cancer was detect in the sample but it shows abnormal tissues. Now just waiting to see another doctor because they don&#39;t know what is causing the lesions.

No tachycardia as he was checking his Apple Watch and no other symptoms.  ? 10:20 he drove home and called his wife can kept her on the call as he drove. He them experienced some mild tingling in his ears, face and lips.  ? 10:30 he got home and his lips were mildly swollen, more so on the upper lip, not as much on the lower lip.  ? 10:45 he took an Allegra and about 30-40 minutes afterwards the lip swelling started to calm  ? 5:45pm I spoke with him. He said he has no more symptoms. A little tired perhaps from the day or the Allegra (though it doesn?t cause too much drowsiness compared to Benadryl) ? He also reported he had a flu and shingles vaccine back in early November so it has been more than a month.

Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

                                                The patient fainted ~20 minutes post-vaccine while talking to his colleague. I immediately assessed the patient for s/sx of anaphylactic or severe reaction. He woke up within ~30 seconds of fainting. He was breathing and speaking fine. He told me he was anxious and also did not have anything to eat or drink all day and believes this is the cause of why he fainted. I had him take a few deep breaths. Injection site looked normal and no issues with breathing. Called EMS to assess him: glucose, blood pressure, &amp; vital signs were all normal. While being assessed he passed out in chair so EMS took him to the hospital. He was discharged from the ER the same day per RN, at the facility. They did not find anything wrong with him and also believe it was due to nerves/lack of eating. No significant medical history per form patient filled out or that he verbally stated.

A 68-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 15:30 at single dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included back disorder and is waiting for back surgery, high blood pressure, and very likely diabetic. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon, didn&#39;t notice anything until Saturday. On Saturday afternoon (23Jan2021) he had a couple severe/serious episodes of shortness of breath. He has no other symptoms. It was better on Sunday and is better today but he still feels uncomfortable on Jan2021. He bought a oximeter today and while at rest he is at 94 but when he gets up to do anything it goes to 80. He doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the vaccine but wants to know where the shortness of breath is coming from, if it is a side effect. The vaccine was administered on 19Jan2021. He has been very inactive and is waiting for back surgery that has been put off due COVID, the hospital delayed the surgery. He is very likely diabetic and takes one pill a day for this. He also has high blood pressure but is controlled and normal range is 120/70. It was elevated along with his heart rate (on Jan2021) with the bad breathing or shortness of breath episodes. He is trying to get surgical clearance and so he had an echocardiogram the Monday before the vaccine was given and a stress test on the Thursday prior to that. It was given in the upper left arm, he also has a little bruise that is still there now (Jan2021). It was given about 3:30pm. No treatment received. Event outcome of shortness of breath was not recovered, of others was unknown.

I still can not remember getting the vaccine or any of the events of 02/13/2021.

                                                Within an hour of receiving 2nd dose started experiencing headaches and dizziness. In addition to the headaches and severe dizziness I started having significant bouts with diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite and have not slept well.  Within a couple days I noticed pronounced tremors in my right hand and I started losing weight from 180 pounds to 157, around 23 pound loss.  I contacted my physician and was alerted to make this report and have an appointment on March 1.

                                                Slight headache about 30 minutes after receiving shot at 11 AM, Saturday, 3/6/2021. About 5 hours after shot I started feeling like I was coming down with something, like I had a mild fever and headache was a little more pronounced, but still mild. By 8pm I had fever of 102F, headache was now uncomfortable, so took 2 Tylenol and went to bed. Fever broke about 3-4AM, but still retained a very mild fever of 99F with very mild headache,  muscle aches and joint stiffness/pain for the following day and the day after. By Tuesday 3/9, head was starting to clear and feeling like I had mild fever was gone. Headache was no longer. Each day thereafter, my head seemed to be more cognitive/clearer and looking back, I could tell I was not thinking clearly, with difficulty remembering things. Since I was not working, fogginess had zero impact on my lifestyle. I should note the first shot, received on 2/13/2021, I had no effects at all. Nothing. Since I was not feeling very well during this time, I tended towards comfort foods which elevated my blood sugar, but that returned to normal levels by 3/9/2021.

Doctors are saying that it is only arthritis.  They have run blood work and xrays.  But symptoms continue to affect me and I am unable to work due to severity.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was administered on March 11th 2021 at Walgreens Pharmacy, Pfizer Lot number EN6199. The side effects from this dose were mild nausea, shakes, chills, dizzy, somewhat disoriented and &#34;foggy&#34; brain. These disappeared the next day. My second dose was on April 1st. at the same facility. This time I had no reaction. On the morning on April 11th I woke up feeling miserable. The symptoms were identical to the side effects of the first dose, except worse. This time I also had a low grade fever. These symptoms dissipated in 36 hours. On April 13th I woke up to the same symptoms again, though milder, lasting about 8 hours. Today, April 21st,, I woke up with the symptoms one more time, lasting about 5 hours. As I am writing this I feel fine again. As a lay person I have no idea if these are all related. The whole scenario  seems rather odd to me. For your information, I had my yearly physical in late March 2021, all tests were normal.

                                                My arm was quite sore from the shot which was not surprising. However, It has continued to hurt for 7 weeks now. If I take Advil, it hurts less. But it continues to bother me every day and night. If I wake at night, it usually hurts more, probably from moving it or laying on it.

                                                Following the first shot I had typical flu-like symptoms - fever, aches in joints and muscles, headache and brain fog. The second shot had the same symptoms as the first but after about 22 hours I apparently had some type of anaphylactic reaction - I remember going to the bathroom - but I woke up on the floor by the bed, and could not think how to get back in bed.  My wife called 2 neighbors who helped me up.  It was difficult to form complete sentences.  I was transported by ambulance to ER.  The ER ran a battery of blood tests, CT scan and chest x-ray. The ER doctors and oncologists concluded that I must have had a delayed reaction to the vaccine. Today, April 28, things are back to normal.

                                                brain fog; vicious chills; Really Hot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 68-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6100 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm right, on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 68-year-old), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing asthma, brain injury, concussions (patient stated he had three. The most severe was three years ago. Patient stated he was knocked completely unconscious and was unconscious for a while), pneumonia from 1980 to 1983. Patient got pneumonia back in the 1980s, around 1983; and after that he had asthma. Patient was having issues seeing things as he went to the eye doctor today and they dilated his pupils. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm right, on 29Jan2021 16:00 (at the age of 68-year-old), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization; and experienced brain fog and tired. The patient experienced brain fog, vicious chills, and really hot. Patient stated that he also had 1-2 instances of vicious chills and 1-2 instances of being hot. Patient said the hot and chills definitely happened after the second vaccine. Patient stated it happened somewhere in the 7-10 days after the vaccine and then was gone. Patient had brain fog after first dose vaccine. It never went away completely. After the second injection the brain fog returned stronger again. Patient stated that if he was to rank his brain fog on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being not able to function; at it&#39;s worst he would rate it as a 6. Patient said he could function but would be working and be in the middle of an email and typing and would get lost in the middle of a sentence. Patient said it had improved; as of now he would rate it as a 3-4 on the same scale. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The outcome of the event &#34;brain fog&#34; was recovering; of events &#34;vicious chills&#34;, &#34;really hot&#34;, was recovered on unknown date.    No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

He was in his car and thought he had put his car in park, but it was in neutral and he hit another car, which he thought he was hit.  The gentleman informed him that he was the one that hit him as he had watched him slowly advance to hitting him.  He did not know or was aware that he was even moving.  He has headaches normally but they have gotten worse since then.   He also has motion sickness but has learned to deal with it and get used to the side effects.  He also has blurry vision and just not feeling normal.  He did go see his PCP and she put him on Meclizine for the dizziness, which works about 50%, but not completely.     He did have the 2nd vaccine on 2/22/21 and still had the symptoms, which have stayed since then as well.  He then saw his PCP a week ago and she is scheduling for a CT scan to see if he has any blood clots.    He did have an aneurysm in his brain 28 years ago and they felt that he would not be able to survive it and deemed that he would be left as a vegetable, but has survived that and does have a little residual headache, but nothing severe.   He now is still having these three symptoms that he did not have prior to the vaccine.

A 68-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0182, Expiration Date: not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in upper left arm on 17May2021 09:30 (at the age of 68-year-old)  as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient did not received any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first dose.

Medical history included ongoing spinal stenosis diagnosed 5 years ago. Concomitant medication(s) included codeine phosphate, paracetamol (TYLENOL WITH CODEINE) taken for spinal stenosis. The patient experienced feeling foggy, couldn&#39;t walk/felt like a drunken sailor, that&#39;s how bad the walking and gait pattern were, couldn&#39;t do any of his work, couldn&#39;t take phone calls, couldn&#39;t concentrate on 31May2021, 2 weeks after first shot and felt a little weird on an unspecified date. AE(s) did not required a visit to emergency room or physician office. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: spinal stenosis on an unspecified date diagnosed 5 years ago. It was reported, according to the MRI 5 years ago, had supposedly been suffering for over 30 years and they just discovered it 5 years ago. It was reported that, his second dose was scheduled this coming Monday, 07Jun2021. He stated the first 2 weeks between 17May2021 and 31May2021, he was fine and had no side effects, not even a pain at the injection site in his left arm, until 31 May. He suddenly started feeling foggy, couldn&#39;t walk- he was walking &#34;like a drunken sailor&#34;, couldn&#39;t do any of his work, couldn&#39;t take phone calls, and couldn&#39;t concentrate. He was getting a little better- still had a little trouble walking and still feeling a little foggy. He have spinal stenosis and wasn&#39;t sure if that had anything to do with it but said the nurse he spoke to before said she didn&#39;t think it had anything to do with it. He wanted to know if anyone else reported that. He also had concerned about the two week delay in side effects. He stated his 29 year old son took the vaccine the same day and had no reaction what so ever. He did not said if his son had concerned about efficacy because of that or not. Patient enquired if he should go ahead and take the second dose. Patient stated at the moment, he didn&#39;t had a primary care doctor and he hadn&#39;t been to a doctor in over 5 years. He suffered or had debilitating condition, spinal stenosis and he never discussed it by the nurse and it didn&#39;t come up on the questionnaire. He still had a problem walking, he can&#39;t walk a straight line, it was very strange. He improved slightly, it was all terrible on Monday, he was like a drunken sailor, that&#39;s how bad the walking and gait pattern were and he had gotten a little bit better, but it was still a problem. Patient was curious and have concerned about his second dose as he has heard stories from people that the side effects are worse.

My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

                                                A short time after getting up in the morning (10 -15 minutes) I felt light headed and unstable on my feet. I couldn&#39;t walk or stand without holding on to something, touching the wall, a chair, or kitchen counter top, etc. It looked like everything was moving sideways. I measured my BP and O2; BP = 119/77, HR = 80; O2 = 98%, HR =77. I also felt nauseous and only had a piece bread with butter. I took a Nautamine tablet and slept for about 2 hrs, until 10:30. Things were better, I could move around and back to normal by 2 pm.

Very Erratic and disrupted sleep for Days. The Major Adverse effect is that these Reactions are within the Range of Published and known Effects. I treated them at home with Rest and Some Tylenol, but was not really capable of normal functioning or to be Employed.. But they were Persistent for 6 1/2 Days....   I have spoken to No One who have had the symptoms last this long. It seemed and felt like descriptions  of Real Covid or past Influenzas but the symptoms seemed more severe and longer. I have spoken with many who have had real Covid who&#39;s symptoms and length of illness were milder... I did contact my Physician to advise of this event.

                                                I became and felt very medicated with glassy eyes. That lasted for four days. During that time, I experienced slight chill for about 30 mins/one day, and headaches off an on for about three days. I also felt somewhat tired - as if I never slept. That lasted about three days off and on albeit I went about my normal activities. For the headaches, I just took aspirin. The rest I let go it&#39;s course. I began to feel my real self about the fifth day, and then everything was fine.

The clinical course of the event was reported as follow: the patient received 1st dose of the COVID vaccine last Thursday, 8 days ago (as reported), he got headaches, and he inquired how long do they last. Headache started a couple days after, his head felt like it was going to explode, his blood pressure was higher, base line was 120/70 - 130/75, it went to 150/. The doctor turned off the light and it went to 130/. He had not had it that high in a long time, his dad had a stroke 20 years ago and inquired if all of this related to the vaccine. He felt like he was racing and he could not relax, like he drank a bunch of caffeine drinks. This started just after getting the vaccine, could be a coincidence, but could be something else. He got an allergy shot today at 10:00 am eastern time, in the arm where they did the vaccine. It was still black and blue from vaccine shot, the band aid the person put over it, he asked if he was allergic to latex. He reported that where the band aid was, it was a red area the size of the band aid. He questioned that there was latex in his vaccine or was this due to the band aid, making a red mark after he had taken off the band aid for 7 days. Going to healthcare professional on Monday (as reported), he talked with his medical assistant and set up an appointment. He also inquired if increased blood pressure was side effect and how long did it last. The patient mentioned he asked his son who was a pharmacist and he did not know the answer to his question about his headache. Patient stated his head seemed full and now after a week he still had a headache. He added it felt like his head was going to explode. It was still there but better now but it came and went. His blood pressure was up too. Usually, it was only 130 at the top but now it was 130 to 150 on the top. Added he felt like he was racing all the time and could not relax. He was unsure how long after the vaccine he noticed these effects but stated it had been going on for several days. He was scheduled to get the second dose 18Feb2021. Patient went to get his allergy shot today (as reported) and when the nurse went to do the shot, his arm was still bruised and where they put the bandaid over there was an impression of the bandaid was all reddish. No events required a visit to physician or ER (emergency room). No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were reported. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none.The outcome of the event headache was recovering, outcome of the event head felt like it was going to explode was unknown, and outcome of the other events was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 69-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0171), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 01May2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pulmonary embolism shower, cholesterol and arthritis. Concomitant medication(s) included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) 10 mg 1x/day taken for pulmonary embolism from 2013 and ongoing; simvastatin 40 mg 1x/day taken for &#34;to keep my cholesterol under control&#34; from 2010 and ongoing and oxycodone hydrochloride, oxycodone terephthalate, paracetamol (PERCOCET) taken for Arthritis (and because of the blood thinners he could not take any other NSAIDs) from 2013 (started taking it right around time he got on blood thinners) and ongoing, 325 mg/5mg, 2 pills a day, sometimes less and sometimes more depending on his pain levels. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EW0153), administered in right arm on 01Apr2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization and Zithromycin topical. The patient neither receive any other vaccines on same date of the Pfizer suspect nor within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient reported that he had COVID like symptoms after getting his second shot and was taking prednisone along with the shot after going to urgent care for poison ivy. The patient wanted to know if this would be an adverse event. The caller was also taking Zithromycin topical. On 05May2021, 4 days after the vaccination, he went to urgent care where he was told he had poison ivy. Urgent care started him on Doxycycline and Prednisone. The prednisone was tapered from 60mg for 4 days, 40mg for 4 days and 10mg for 4 days. A week ago (Saturday), his niece visited him and they hugged and stuff. The patient&#39;s niece was not vaccinated. They sat outside. On 27May2021, the patient started feeling very tired, his stomach was upset and was very nauseated. The patient further reported that he was doing yard work a week ago this past Thursday and he thought he didn&#39;t feel right so he took shower and laid on couch in the dark all day. He stated that his stomach was nauseous, he felt out of sorts, he was flipping and flopping. That night he went to bed and woke up with a really bad headache to the point of where he thought of taking pain medication for the headache. He never had a fever. The patient did not want to take any COVID tests if it were to come back positive because he heard about the baseball players getting the Johnson and Johnson shot and having COVID and not having any symptoms and one of them had symptoms, but it only lasting for a day or two. The patient&#39;s brother-in-law and sister, who he lives with, also received the vaccines and were fully vaccinated at the time of his nieces visit and were in close proximity to niece. They didn&#39;t had any effects from hugging her so that was why he thought maybe it was related to him taking prednisone. The patient did not require a visit to emergency room but required an urgent care for poison ivy. There was no family medical history relevant to events other than brother-in-law and sister-in-law didn&#39;t have any side effects after hugging niece. The patient did not undergo relevant tests. The outcome of the event stomach nauseous, feeling abnormal and really bad headache was resolved on 28May2021; while Poison Ivy, very tired and stomach was upset was unknown. The patient thought his symptoms (stomach nauseous, felt out of sorts/ didn&#39;t feel right/ flipping and flopping, really bad headache, very tired and stomach was upset) maybe related to the Prednisone.  Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.

The paramedic and I looked up and  noticed a sudden change in mental status- dropped his phone and started making slight grunting noises as well as turning pale. We rescued the patient, got the stretcher and he became  lucid. His activity was seizure like  (petit mal). I  called the ED charge nurse, provided report, and the patient was transported via paramedic X 2 to the ED for an evaluation.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

I suffer from this on a regular basis and have dealt with this since 1974, but this was the worst I have had in many years. It lasted for two days and then today it has cleared.  There is no other reason why I would have this except for the vaccine.  I am OK now and did not contact anyone about it.  I wanted to report this because I did not see it on the list of side effects and it would be nice for others to know it was coming.  Please feel free to contact me if necessary.  Thank you for getting me the vaccine and keep up the good work.

The inching is not severe just agitating .

This feeling woke me up about 1 am in the morning ( 2/26) and unable to get comfortable to go back to sleep.  Cause me to limp , unable to put full weight on the leg. This lasted all night and during the day has improved.  It feels somewhat weak, but I can put weight on the leg with a light limp. My foot feels like it has recovered from going to sleep and now has blood flowing, less tingling.

It has been 72 hours since the shot was given and I am still feeling tired like I did right after shot was given. I am a light sleeper and some nights I will toss and turn and get a poor nights sleep. Last night, Sunday 2-28-2021 was that kind of night. As I type this I am not sure if my tired feeling is from the vaccine shot or the poor nights sleep. I can still function as I always do but being sure I don&#39;t run myself ragged. I have called my primary doctor and I am supposed to be getting a call back tomorrow.

                                                severe hypoglycemic event (POC=38)/hypoglycemia; chest pain; He was found driving the wrong way down the highway; no memory of the event; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable pharmacist. A 70-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9265) intramuscular, on 01Feb2021 at 08:00 (at the age of 70 years old), for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 01Feb2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced severe hypoglycemic event (POC=38)/hypoglycemia and chest pain. He was found driving the wrong way down the highway with no memory of the event, once stopped by authorities. He was admitted to the hospital with hypoglycemia and chest pain. His home diabetes coverage was an insulin pump and there was denial of decreased PO intake. The insulin pump was stopped once the patient was admitted. His glucose improved and insulin regular SSI was initiated. He was brought for cardiac cath on 02Feb2021 with no new issues seen. The patient was stabilized, was set for follow-up with PCP and endocrinologist and discharged on 04Feb2021. The events resolved on an unspecified date in Feb2021.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This was accompanied by either bizarre dreams or hallucinations during the night. When I awoke in the morning I was very unrested and very unstable. My morning coffee did not taste appealing. By 30 hours after the vaccination I had returned to feeling better, albeit with a mildly sore injection site, and was able to return to normal activity. No treatment was sought.  No further issues presented themselves.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                My left arm muscle located on underarm between elbow and injection site, halfway between elbow and injection site higher up became extremely sore to the touch and prevented me from lifting my arm to preform functions.  Today is much better and function has mostly returned. The reason I am reporting is because I just (jan.29 2021) tore my rotator cuff on right  shoiulder and the loss of function is similar. Function is returning on left arm so no worried, the right shoulder will need shoulder replacement surgery.  But that was the effect on this adverse event. Loss of function to left arm about 3 days with improvement after 36 hours. Kind of a delayed response, so not sure its related. But I didn&#39;t injure the left so probably related.

Transfered on 3/13 to the facility. Noted increased SOB without CP, palpitations, cough, orthopnea or PND. No history of home O2 use but required 2-3L O2 during this hospital stay. Was noted on admit to Facility to have troponin elevation with unchanged EKG. Was started on NSTEMI protocol with heparin ggt, ASA, BB, and statin. Initially received one dose ceftriaxone/azithro for possible PNA. On admission, primary team held home BB. On arrival to Facility, troponin at 3.998 trended to 4.442 and then trended down. underwent CTA to evaluate for PE that was negative. CXR and CT showed pulmonary edema consistent with HF exacerbation and a proBNP 8613. Patient was given 40mg IV lasix x2. RRT was called twice, once for BP 80/50 treated with 500ml IVF, and second for CP that resolved with NTG and tramadol. Cardiology was consulted with goal to cath patient, however some concern for medication adherence going forward so they will reevaluate. Patient began to have tachycardia with rates in the 150s sustained and hypotension. EKG showed likely sinus tachycardia with wide QRS similar to prior EKGs. Patient has ICD in place that was interrogated and showed good function. IV metoprolol 5mg given x3 with rated decrease to upper 120s. Patient remained asymptomatic, awake, and alert. Per discussion with wife after transfer, patient BP has been in the 50s systolic at home for the last month. Cardiac cath was performed showing 99% stenosis of LCX. Did not tolerate procedure with nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. RRT was called after cath procedure. He is nauseous, diaphoretic. He complained of chest pressure. STAT EKG obtained. Noted ST depressions in the septal leads significant from before. Cardiology concerned pt was having an inferior MI. STEMI call was activated and hospital cath lab was called and report given to the cardiologist on call. Pt was then transported to the Facility and he passed away on 3/24/2021.

Patient stated he had the 2nd vaccine about 2 months ago and a month later he got tinnitus in both of his ears. Patient stated he didn&#39;t think it was the vaccine. Patient stated his hearing was perfect but the tinnitus interferes with his hearing. Patient stated it was a month and a half when the tinnitus came on, he woke in the morning and had noise in his ears and thought what was that he must be getting old and found that it didn&#39;t do that, it happened in one ear or the other it&#39;s never both ears equal amounts. Patient relayed that his left arm hurts really bad occasionally. It&#39;s been going on since it was put out with tinnitus and losing hearing since the beginning. Patient stated he contacted doctor about hearing loss and tinnitus and something going on. Patient stated when he lays down he had it too.

Patient stated he was told the CT looked great for his age and doctor said his hearing was real good and both doctors said his hearing was real good and they don&#39;t have a reason to explain it.

This consumer reported for a 70-year-old male patient. A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0171 and expiry date: 31Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 27Apr2021 at 16:27, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included COPD, Schizophrenia, UTI (took antibiotics), traumatic brain injury (when he was 16 or 17) and indwelling urinary catheter. Concomitant medication included Haloperidol for Schizophrenia, salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) for COPD, Diazepam, Trazodone for sleeping, and Ipratropium (Nebulizer). The reporter (care giver) stated that, the reporter spoke with a gentleman this morning about the adverse reaction that the reporter&#39;s partner had, he was nonverbal that&#39;s why the reporter was calling to check. The patient had his vaccine in the evening at 04:27, on 27Apr2021. He had around 08:30 quarter 9 and we were driving home around 9 o&#39;clock and the reporter asked to patient that was he feeling weird, and the patient said yes. The reporter asked how the patient feeling weird. The patient said, in his head because he had this problem with his brain from his accident done, it was a little tricky because it was been years to start functioning in a way that he could relate to. The patient felt weird and low and he said his head, so he had some issue not like headache just mental issue that he didn&#39;t feel like in head, and he said today that&#39;s starting to go away that because the reporter asked him the question so the reporter just wondering if, he suggest when the reporter talk to the man early this morning and reported it. An hour, he took all the medicine he was taking and also his information. The reporter was wondering, he told the reporter to contact him for medical information and he gave the reporter this no to call him and he transfer the reporter and the reporter already too busy. The reporter already been over the phone so, the reporter would like to know if the reporter could help him to move this out of his system if that happen and the reporter would probably ask him not to have the second vaccine. The reporter wanted to know how he feel about that. When the reporter goes off, he was not the happy person actually. The patient started smoking after again after quitting 20 years ago after the vaccine. The reporter also stated that the patient said he was little better. The patient took little bit of Ganja by mouth not smoking it, that he made Ganja medicine and took little bit of that. He was taking it some of the local dispensary CBD and THC. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. There was not a product complaint to report. There was a medical information request.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Barely able to get out of bed, extreme exhaustion and apparent loss of brain function. Dazed.  These continued over the next few weeks, lessening over time.  What occurred during that time were aches in different joints.Knees, elbow, shoulder etc.  Extremely old injuries were brought back.  3rd week most of muscle and joints aches subsided.   To this day there are sudden bouts of lethargy and exhaustion.  occasional joint aches but how much of that could be related to old bones. The brain confusion continues. No seeming trigger to bouts.

It progressed to hurt considerably by the time to go to bed that I had to support my head with a towel around my neck.  I took a Flurbiprofen 100mg before going to bed and I had the my neck massaged with Aspercream.   I sleep on the sides and moving from one side to the other I had to support my head with my hands.

Now, in the evening, the pain slightly increase again and spreading toward the shoulder blades and  lower on the spine.

The intensity was severe enough to prevent sleeping for over eight hours. This was accompanied by chills alternating with feeling hot without a measured fever. Six hours after the onset of pain two 500 mg acetaminophen were taken with some blunting of the pain though minimal improvement. After the initial eight hours the pain in in the joints and muscles subsided over about four hours. The headache that was akin to migraines in the past persisted for another six hours and was eventually relieved by two doses of ibuprofen 600 mg six hours apart.

The pain inhibits walking, standing, etc. He did note that he is &gt;300lbs and has had joint pain in the past, but the hip pain is new. He also thought it might be kidney pain, as he takes a daily diuretic. He stated he has been treating with Aleve twice a day, but that walking is still very bad.  The patient is an optometrist that was calling about the Covid-19 vaccine and said that he did not know if the Lot number written on the vaccination card is EL3302, E13302, or EI3302. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and reported that he got a sore arm about 3 hours after receiving the injection. He woke up with a sore lower back pain.

Sleep was fitful and finally impossible, with every breath being painful. We went to ER about 6:00 A.M., thinking it was either a heart attack or COVID. I was checked very well, with good results. EKG was fine, Oxygen at 97%, chest x-ray looked good, white blood count was good, but platelets were low. A subsequent flu test and COVID test both came back negative. My symptoms were constant for several hours then diminished, increased, and diminished until Friday when I felt largely symptom free.

                                                Absolute ZERO side effects from first dose, not even a sore spot on injection location.  Migraine intensity headaches started 4 hours after injection of the second dose and lasted for approx. 40 hours. Went to sleep at 10:30 PM the night of the second dose and woke up in a startled state every half hour until I got out of bed at 5:30 AM.   From 5:30 AM until approx. 10 PM the day after my second dose I experienced seizure-like symptoms where I would seem to fall asleep while in a sitting position and awake just a minute(s) later in a confused state of mind. This would happen frequently and stopped its frequency slowly and stopped entirely late that same night.   I experienced eye pain to the point I had to apply ice bags to my face the entire day after the second dose. Body pain was so sever I cannot compare it to any other flu-like symptoms I&#39;ve ever had.   Totally recovered after 48 hours.

He had to be watched overnight in the hospital 2/11-2/12.  By 48 hours after the vaccine, he felt improved and normal by 72 hours.  Note that pt had similar but not as severe reaction the first vaccine(Pfizer EL9882) that I was not aware of til now.  Also note that pt had covid infection about 3 months prior to this vaccine.

These were the same symptoms that I experienced after my first injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine administered on February 2, 2021. I reported that event under VAERS temporary  case number 279639 on 02/02/2021. As with the first event, the symptoms began in 5 minutes and lasted about 8 hours. However, the symptoms associated with event in this report (second injection) were more severe and peaked about 45 minutes after injection, as opposed to about 30 minutes after the first injection. I reported the first adverse event to the nurse before she gave me the second injection and she had me placed under observation for an extended period of time. The trouble mentally focusing, unsteadiness, and shaking were more pronounced this time and got worse after 45 minutes when I got up and walked to the car, but began to diminish rapidly that. I did not attempt to drive.

                                                About 8 hours after injection, I began having pain on right side of back just under ribs. Pain worsened through night, causing difficult sleep. On evening of second day, pain spread to right flank and right front of abdomen, causing entire right side of abdomen to experience significant pain. It is possible this is muscular pain, but after reading the Internet, I believe it is inflammation of the gallbladder. I have never before experienced gallbladder issues. The pain is much worse than the &#34;muscle aches&#34; described as a COVID vaccine side effect. There is no fever or other significant symptoms. Today (third day) I emailed my doctor. His nurse responded that it is hard to tell if it is vaccine related, and that if it begins to resolve not to be concerned about it, but if it gets worse I should be seen by the doctor. I am taking Tylenol and applying Voltarin topically, but neither helps much.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

                                                shingles; he started feeling strange; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, at the age of 71 years, on 20Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included white blood cell count decreased from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient stated that his white blood cell count was usually on the low side and his doctor sends him to a hematologist to do whatever, then they say he was fine. Concomitant medication included an unspecified flu shot. The patient said that he had his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot 20Jan2021, and this coming Wednesday he was supposed to have his second shot, but unfortunately in the interim he found out he has shingles. He says he would like to know if he can get a second shot or would he need to hold off. He says that developed shingles 9 days later after getting first COVID-19 vaccine shot (31Jan2021), and he doesn&#39;t want to do something that will be a problem. He says that he was on an antiviral to treat the shingles. No further details provided about the antiviral. He says he didn&#39;t go see his doctor until last Wednesday, he thinks he has been suffering from shingles since 07Feb2021 or a little before that when he started feeling strange. The patient clarified he meant 31Jan2021 since he began dealing with this. The patient said when he was diagnosed with shingles they didn&#39;t do any tests, the doctor walked into the room and looked at him, though he didn&#39;t have a lot then, over the days it has gotten worse. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of shingles (herpes zoster). The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

After receiving the vaccine the patient went to the recovery area for the required 15 minutes. About 10 minutes later his breathing rapidly increased - eventually turning to large gasps of air. The patient then briefly passed out but then quickly woke up. He then started vomiting for the next 10 minutes. Eventually he recovered enough to walk with the help of his wife. The wife stated that he has had episodes like this from other vaccines and blood draws. He has never vomited from the episodes, however.

The patient clinical course was reported as follows: About 12 hours later almost to the hour, he had symptoms including: fever, real bad headache, chills, and the fever ran somewhere 100 or a little over he guesses. This lasted most of that morning on Wednesday on the 24Feb2021. He took his temperature with an oral digital thermometer. He reports his temperature usually ranges 97.7-97.6 somewhere around there. And he couldn&#39;t get warm. He had a mattress heater turned up and he felt weak and since he&#39;s by himself he has to get up to get water and he put his heavy robe on then he got back in bed. He never went to sleep, he couldn&#39;t fall asleep, his arm really hurt where he got the shot. There was a little ache with the first one but this one here really, really was bothering him. When he first got the second shot, he hates needles, it was a little sore and then when this started it really started to hurt and it was warm. That went on to the morning, then it started letting up a bit. His daughter came by and made him chicken soup and he felt a little better, still weakfish. His fever went down kind of far and he laid down the rest of the day. Towards dinner time or so he felt warm but didn&#39;t have fever, he went the opposite from being chilled to being warm but his temperature was around 98. Then later on he was taking some pain medicine, called his doctor and asked what he should take for the headache. Take whatever he has there is what he was told. Acetaminophen-aspirin/pain reliever/caffeine/pain reliever he thought he said it was 250 a pill. 250mg of aspirin 2 at one time by mouth. 65 mg of caffeine. Took 2 about every 5-6 hours. It says Headache relief, caller states he is just about blind, acetaminophen-aspirin/pain reliever/caffeine/pain reliever he thought he said it was 250 a pill. 250mg of aspirin 2 at one time by mouth. 65 mg of caffeine. Took 2 about every 5-6 hours. It got rid of whatever he had. Patient stated he needs to change the thingy on his CCTV. Clarified he uses a CCTV magnifying system, it&#39;s a camera system with the 24 inch monitor. He felt better then he fell asleep around 10 that night and he woke up around 4:00AM on the 25Feb2021. He reports whatever fever he had, he was soaked but he felt really ok then from then on. He finally got up around 7-730 AM and he&#39;s feeling ok now. If he had a fever it broke. He reported it seems to be improved on the 25Feb2021. He was feeling pretty good he started making coffee so he didn&#39;t feel bad and he hasn&#39;t had anything since. He reports his arm is not bothering him unless he pokes it. It&#39;s the same thing with the flu shot, if he pushes on it in a certain place he knows he got the shot. The injection site is not warm, all that went away on 25Feb2021. The clinical outcome of fever, real bad headache, chills/ couldn&#39;t get warm, weak, couldn&#39;t fall asleep, was recovered on 25Feb2021.

Rushed him to Urgent Care, they sent him home and the next day I took him to ER. He was admitted. MRIs, CT scan, Blood Cultures, 2 Covid tests.  Nothing definitive as to why he was so ill other then a viral infection.   We are not assuming or indicating it is vaccine related but we think it&#39;s worth noting.  Nothing in his routine had changed other then receiving the 1st vaccine.   No one at the hospital indicated it was related.

He said that he also felt it in his right hand but it was not as pronounced. It was noted on 10Feb2021, and was pretty severe for two days, now he is experiencing it, he had it last night, it is going on today, and it&#39;s more becoming more a stiffness, more like it is hard to bend his fingers, and the burning sensation is in all 3 fingers between mostly in the last joint of those fingers.

It was reported that his wife has osteoporosis. The patient was very sensitive to aspirin, he can take a half dose to what normal people require twice as much as him Baby aspirin looks like 200mg for him, so he tries to stick to Aspirin, as it has less side effects than other pain killers.

A 71-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 06Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.

He drank electrolyte water. started to take BP and HR and Oxygen level, his Blood pressure was 64/55, She called PCP, the nurse got on the phone and asked questions, and monitor what had happened, monitored Heart rate until 20 minutes it became regulated, in the 90s and staying in the 90s. If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue.

Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure.

Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital.

A 71-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EN6203; Expiration Date: Jun2021) dose 2 via an unspecified route of admin-istration on 07Mar2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included diabetes mellitus; he does not take medication for it. It was controlled by diet and exercise, high blood pressure, high lipids, herpes zoster from Oct2019, bell&#39;s palsy from Oct2019, herpes zoster oticus from Oct2019, paralysis, vertigo, ear disorder, paraesthesia oral and his tongue was tingly. Concomitant medications included alprazolam taken for sleep disorder, simvastatin taken for lipids increased, alprazolam (XANAX) taken for sleep disorder.  The patient had his second shot last sunday and had a discussion had with his doctor&#39;s nurse this morning that centered around people taking the Moderna and had some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or some-thing like that and he wanted to call about what had happened. He has had overlapping stuff from cer-vical stenosis that manifests on the left side on his shoulder arm and hands and also about a year and half ago Oct2019 he had shingles in his ear and mouth on the left side of face. He had Bell&#39;s palsy and Ramsey Hunt syndrome number 2. He had paralysis, droopy mouth, eye wouldn&#39;t close, vertigo, ear issues, hearing drop and that recovered which was weird. He went to physical therapy until early last year before COVID then he was steered away from that. About 10 months ago some of the symptoms came back in a odd way. His eye had the feeling like it couldn&#39;t close. His eyelids had at night the muscles in his face on the left side face felt taut. The inside of his gum felt like his skin was thicker, he was not sure it was the sensation and that never went away. With the shingles he had an issue where down the side of his tongue was tingly, these things overlap and it was either very little or really an-noying. In last 10 months it had got quite a bit better until about 5-6 weeks ago it was back to where it was, it was just annoying on and off. Then he got the shot sunday, and it was weird at first, he was writing it off as both stress and relief and other things. He was not dizzy and that evening the left side of his mouth went bonkers, it wound up being like when the shingles were acting up on the inside of his mouth it felt tingly and weird, and it was confined to the left half of his face and nothing else. He did not have droopiness or any Bell&#39;s palsy kind of thing had gone away the Ramsey-Hunt syndrome, he says it was a series of things and he has number 2, he does not know what the other ones are, but it was something that comes along with the chicken pox or the herpes zoster virus. The stenosis, the cervical stenosis, the left is the main problem, but the right was not far behind with regard to nerve compression, the right does not bother him as much in the way of tingling and numbness. The weird thing is he had his hands sitting in his lap and he moved his thumb towards his forefinger, there was a couple inches between and it felt like there was a rubber band pulling his thumb back, it happened 2-3 times he was fooling around with it and it went away, the sensation was still there a little in the back ground, the rest of him the right side of him was fine and today is a lot better like he said things over lap so he is not saying anything has anything to do with the vaccine but he is operating under the as-sumption that if Moderna patients are having some issues with Bell&#39;s Palsy or something similar, if he has left over inflammation and in Nov2019, he had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), when he first got sick and then he had another one done and his neurologist said on an unspecified date in Aug that he still sees some nerve inflammation particularly down jaw line, he saw inflammation from 2019 to 2020 he still seen inflammation and the upper part of his eye, the brow seems to behave as if there may be some inflammation running through it. His hand on the right is not doing the thing is his left thumb, it is being weird and the thing sunday night with his mouth. He thinks the whole idea is that the vaccine wakes up the immune system and gets it to recognize the RNA for COVID and generate anti-bodies and if it is acting like inflammation gets the body&#39;s attention, he is not a biologist but maybe it also caught on to his nerve inflammation and took a look at his nerves and cause them to bounce around and have other things occur that were more intense and he was trying to report to let some-one know that the underlying things left over from his shingles, he does not know about the rest of it because sleeping wrong could affect his neck shoulders and arms, he was not sure if it could be an is-sue with the vaccine, there was no clear definite thing, but the thing sunday night with his mouth was definitely far more, he thought this was the way he felt in his mouth a couple weeks after he got the shingles diagnosis like he had hives on inside of his cheek and tongue, it was crazy with extra salivation but he did not have the hives. The last time he got a vaccine it was the Shingrix it was probably too late last year, he got pretty sick off of it with flu like symptoms but he doesn&#39;t ever want another run in with shingles. It was his second COVID 19 vaccine he got 07Mar and it was the same day that the thing with his mouth happened and that was the most noticeable aspect of it, if he had not had the vaccine he would be sitting here right now just thinking he was having a bad day it runs down the left side of his tongue and stops smack in middle of the front of it. It jumps over sometimes but he was not sure if the nerve endings go on both sides of the tip of tongue or not. It has improved since sunday there was a span there where it was pretty annoying and he commented that he feels like it did when he first had shingles and over a period of time when he went to bed, whenever that was, it abated a bit. His second dose was EN6203 and it is dated Jun2021. The patient was sure they were trained to draw up the exact correct amount in there but he did not ask to look at it, it did not even occur to him. The only other thing is he was diabetic, he takes no medications for that it was diet and exercise controlled both of which COVID has been horrible for, his weight has gone up because they have a tough climate there, it has been cold for 2.5 months. It was finally starting to get a little better but the primary things he would have would be blood pressure, he takes medication for and the same for lipids he takes Simvastatin for that, the things many males his age are taking medication for. He also takes Alprazolam and Xanax to get to sleep at night, because his brain doesn&#39;t want to shut off, cost of being an engi-neer. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, the thing never changed since, it never showed up anywhere else. he does not know if that disappears but he never ended up getting it again. Apparently it shows up frequently in lungs but it did not with him. Those 2 things would be the top of the list type of things for him. He has never had cancer or blood disease, he had mononucleosis in college. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerized tomogram there was nothing left on. He had one case of sarcoidosis uncovered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left, magnetic res-onance imaging was an unknown results on Nov2019. He first got sick and then he had another one done , x-ray: there was nothing left on an unknown date. He had one had case of sarcoidosis uncov-ered, there was only one node of it at the back of the trachea where it splits to go into the lungs. His pulmonologist was keeping track of it with X-ray and CT scans, the last time everyone looked in there, there was nothing left. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Per report of the patient&#39;s daughter, he received his 1st Covid vaccination approximately 21 days ago.  Ten days ago he tested positive for COVID-19.  Despite this, the patient was instructed to proceed with securing a 2nd Covid vaccination after which his symptoms came on.  Upon presentation here, the patient was noted to be quite febrile to a temperature of a 103.2°.  On diagnostic workup, he did have a chest x-ray done which demonstrated vascular and alveolar congestion.  Fluid overload or cardiac decompensation.  No other suspicious acute abnormality identified. NO CHF HAS COVID   It is not recommended to take the covid vaccine within 30 days of covid infection due to increasing infammation and symptoms and should have immunity for at least 90 days from the infection with covid We did walk you and you do not require any oxygen .

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19,Respiratory failure. Sigmoid perforation with abscess. Hospital Course; 71-year-old male prolonged admission for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. No history of colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung mets. Prior resection of bowel, prior chemotherapy. Required management in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure over the time that he has been admitted to Hospital (20 days). He had remained on BiPAP therapy throughout that time, received appropriate corticosteroids, and antiviral therapies. Approximately 1-1/2 weeks ago he began to develop mild left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In the last 48 hours this is significantly worsened. CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained on Friday, which displayed pneumoperitoneum, sigmoid abscess with sigmoid perforation. There is a prior anastomotic site distal to this. Given his overall complexity he was to be medically managed to avoid the need for OR and intubation.  He did well through the initial 24 hours of IV antibiotics, fluids and bowel rest. This afternoon he became increasingly dyspneic, required implementing nonrebreather mask, and subsequently developed severe rigors, tachycardia.  I obtained a stat follow-up CT scan which shows similar findings of free air within the abdomen. Given signs of impending sepsis, BiPAP therapy was initiated, bolus IV fluids were given. Blood gas, blood counts, lactic acid are pending.  He is receiving empiric Zosyn.  I discussed this with general surgery, whom is well-known to the patient. In agreement the patient likely needs surgical intervention. However given his overall complexity and in light of the fact that this area surrounds the ureter, and we do not have urology coverage. It was felt he was most appropriate to be managed in Hospital. Case was discussed with Dr. at Hospital, patient will be transferred there via air transit. At this time his blood pressure appears stable, he is tachycardia, is currently on BiPAP which will be transitioned to CPAP for transport. He has received several doses of Dilaudid, for improved pain control. No further advancement of airway was performed prior to discharge. Case was discussed with family at length, all risks and benefits of transfer were discussed with wife and patient. It is recommended to involve pulmonary critical care services including surgical ICU care as if requiring surgery he is high likelihood for prolonged vent needs.

Similar perisigmoid  collection; colon enteric fistula, probably at least subacute in duration. The perisigmoid collection is prominently gaseous and there is no frank abscess. 3. Suspected mild enteritis the small bowel loops or loops associated with the fistula. No obstruction. 4. Additional findings as described are similar to recent prior imaging. COMMENTS: Any incidental renal lesion less than 1 cm or classified as too small to characterize, or any incidental cystic renal lesion characterized as simple-appearing, is likely benign. No follow-up imaging is recommended for these lesions per consensus recommendations based on imaging criteria.

Active Problems: Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon. Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present COVID-19. Perforated viscus. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Respiratory failure, acute, Hospital Course; Patient is a 71 yr.. male with history of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, prior bowel resection and chemotherapy. The patient initially tested positive for Covid in early March. His symptoms at that time are mild and resolved. He was later vaccinated and that month. He started having severe symptoms again on 4/3 for which he presented to Hospital. Since that time, he has received full course of Remdesivir and steroids. He had a CT scan performed on 4/23 which revealed pneumoperitoneum secondary to presumed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with focal sigmoid abscess. Patient was weaned down to minimal nasal cannula settings but somewhat suddenly earlier on 4/25 patient had increased work of breathing, became tachycardia, and had rigors. Hospital ordered repeat CT scan which showed similar findings in the abdomen. Patient had been maintained on Zosyn. Repeat labs were sent which were largely unremarkable. Given concerns for worsening sepsis and potential need for surgery, he was subsequently transferred Hospital. On admission to hospital, he had a normal lactic acid and no leukocytosis. He did not have evidence of peritonitis. The decision was made to treat his diverticulitis conservatively. However, early on 4/26 the patient started to develop a lactic acidosis. An extensive discussion was had with the patient and his wife regarding surgery and the possibility the patient may never be able to separate from the vent given his worsening Covid pneumonia. The patient elected to undergo an exploratory laparotomy with with segmental resection of distal descending and loop transverse colostomy. However, as the days progressed the patient had worsening respiratory status that required deep sedation, paralytics and proning all of which were unsuccessful in maintaining his oxygen saturation greater than 88%. His wife, knowing that he would not want to have a prolonged course on the ventilator, elected for transition to palliative extubating with comfort care on 4/30 and the patient expired roughly 10 minutes after extubation.

The patient reported severe fatigue, achy shoulder, neck not sleeping well and body pain. The patient went to hospital in April and was referred to Chiropractor, he has been going for two weeks.

The patient underwent shoulder and neck x-ray in May2021 result arthritis. It was also reported as January and early February, he was out walking 4 to 6 miles a day, not having any real problems. He had the Pfizer vaccine both shots and he did not have any problem at the time of the shot, his arm didnt get sore, he didnt have any problems at all. Fast forward a couple of months, he was very fatigued, tired, had no energy, sleeping from 12 to 16 hours a day and very lethargic and then his muscles and joints started to ache like crazy, pain in his shoulders, and now if he walks a mile thats a long walk for him, hes very tired. He has lost 4 to 5 pounds in the last couple of months, he just wonders if this Pfizer vaccine is causing his antibodies to kick against itself. He went to the emergency room about 2 to 3 weeks ago, they did x-rays of the neck and shoulders because it was bad. He had some arthritis and sent him to physical therapy because he cant lift his arms up above his chest. His muscles are starting to hurt and as long as he is up and moving, he is not as bad. When he lays down at 10:00 PM at night to go to sleep, he is up at 12:00 in pain. He got his shots in February, and in April it started, so it was like a couple of months after the shot because he went online and they said side effects usually last one to two weeks right after it, but he didn&#39;t have anything right after, but then 2 months after, he started getting really tired and aching and then the pain came. The pain in his shoulders, muscles from his groin to his thigh, it&#39;s in his hands when he wakes up in the morning. Once he starts moving things, it&#39;s okay. The pain also began in the first two weeks of April. He&#39;s tired still and aching but could be due to the fact that he doesn&#39;t get good sleep at night, if he was sleeping all night then maybe he wouldn&#39;t be as tired. Fatigue, tiredness has gotten better, its improved. But the pain is getting worse; sometimes he will be lying in bed at night and the bottom of his feet will start to grab and cramp up and hurt. The events required a visit to Emergency Room; he doesnt really remember when he went, he knows its been over two weeks ago. The first part of MAY 2021, they did an x-ray on the shoulder and neck, that&#39;s where the greatest pain was, and all they saw was arthritis. They scheduled physical therapy and he started physical therapy and did that for two weeks but that has not done anything. He has continued with physical therapy while doctors start doing other checks. The patient called physician today and he is having blood work done this week and they are having a CT scan done next week. Outcome of the events arthritis and when he lays down at 10:00 PM at night to go to sleep, he is up at 12:00 in pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021542938 Same reporter/drug/event, different patients;US-PFIZER INC-2021542943 Same reporter/drug/event, different patients;US-PFIZER INC-2021542944 Same reporter/drug/event, different patients;US-PFIZER INC-2021542945 Same reporter/drug/event, different patients

                                                flu; felt like he was back having the COVID-19 virus all over again; Urine was a bright yellow color; soaking wet sweating; fever of 101; tiredness; headaches; chills; He slept the whole day; joints; shortness of breath; weakness; lower back was hurting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information Team. A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/ Lot number: On CDC vaccine record card reporter thinks Lot is EN6206, pretty sure but could be EV6206) (pending for clarification), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (reported as Monday) (at the age of 71-year-old) at around13:00-13:30, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in clinic. Patient had a history of COVID-19 virus around onset about the last day of Sep2020 or Oct2020.Down and out for about 14 days before totally turned it around (when he had COVID-19 virus they turned him away from his normal doctor and told him to go get tested on his own so the whole process was handled through emergency urgent care testing) and had a blood disorder, does get blood clotting. The patient had no relevant concomitant products or other medical conditions. Nothing relevant; he has just been taking the medicines he has always taken; mostly a lot of vitamins and stuff and he takes a full acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN). Patient had his last blood work and testing done in Oct2020 when they gave him clearance, told him he was no longer positive for COVID-19 virus, no bloodwork taken since then. Patient had undergone height measurement and resulted as 5 feet, 9 inches, probably 5 feet, 8 inches because he shrunk getting older but thinks 5 feet, 9 inches. Patient had no exposure that he was aware of other than his own history of COVID-19. He went and asked if he should get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and was told yes because it was over 90 days since he was cleared of COVID-19. On 15Mar2021, patient had some issues with first shot. After his vaccine by the end of the day he felt like he was back having the COVID-19 virus all over again and had all the symptoms he had before, like weakness, shortness of breath and everything. He stated he was really got effected at the end of the evening but did not know until the following morning when he woke up and was soaking wet sweating and had a fever of 101. He slept the whole day and by the end of the second day he felt much better but still had a fever. He sweat that evening and the next morning felt good again. This all lasted a total of maybe 24 hours until he felt good again. He had something different after the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine that he did not have when he had COVID-19 virus which was his urine was a bright yellow color from 16Mar2021 to 17Mar2021. His urine looks normal again today (18Mar2021), but he did not have urine symptom when he had COVID-19 virus previously. Patient reported that he had the flu on an unspecified date. He asked because he is slated for the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 08Apr2021, he stated he knows the first shot was supposed to give him 50 percent immunity, he does not think he should go do it again, it makes him real nervous about the results he had from the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; asked if he should or should not get the second dose relative to these events. Everyone else said it was a piece of cake, but it wasn&#39;t for him. He was ok all day after the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered 15Mar2021, felt pretty decent the rest of the day and evening. On 16Mar2021 his whole world changed, felt like he was back having the COVID-19 virus all over again starting 16Mar2021 he had exactly all the same things, feeling like he had before, that he experienced when he had COVID-19. He woke in the middle of the night with sweats, really hot-his wife took his body temperature, and his body temperature was 101; he slept most of the day on 16Mar2021. He had tiredness; headaches; chills; joints; fevers; the whole thing for about a 24 hour period until event finally subsided, clarified as improved the patient was started feeling a little better 16Mar2021, but he sweat like crazy that evening so that must have broken the fever. It was not until morning of 17Mar2021 that he felt functional. He still once in a while gets a little headache but that is minor. The only thing was on the second day after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered, after events onset, patient received a couple of Aspirin because his lower back was hurting, probably from sitting so long. The reporter assessed the events as non serious. The outcome of the events urine was a bright yellow color was recovered on 18Mar2021, lower back was hurting was unknown and the rest of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Also a very occasional, intermittent, very weak dry cough. During the day on 2/2/2021 my temperature was 99.8.

Slept a little the night of 2/2/2021 but often woke up and had a hard time fall asleep due to tremors.

He suddenly did not know where is was, how he got there, or why he was there. He continuously asked those questions throughout the balance of the day. The nurses on duty in the clinic got a wheel chair and escorted us to the  hospital ER in the same building. He was immediately taken to a room where a doctor met us and began asking him questions. The Dr quickly ordered a multitude of tests. Results shown in item 19

                                                The day after the vaccine, I just had a mild headache and mild leg aches, off and on, and took Advil twice with complete relief. Then I was fine until 7th day when I awoke a 7am. I felt mentally &#34;weird&#34; and couldn&#39;t concentrate. Not dizzy. I ate my normal breakfast of lox, cream cheese and bread with coffee with cream and Stevia. I sat at the computer and could not concentrate or even read well, and felt confused at times. Then I got hot and sweaty, my mouth got very dry, I had pains and needles over my entire body, and the tip of my tongue got numb. I laid down in my bed and felt worse. My blood pressure was 160-170/105-110, and normally it is 120-135-70-84.  I thought maybe I was having a neurological event, so I had my wife take me to the ER. I was there about 6 hours, but after about 3-4 hours, let better. The symptoms would come and go, lasting 3-5 minutes, and slowly improved. After the 2nd treponin was negative, they let me go home. I felt tired and mentally off a little. I rested. The next am, I was back to normal and have stayed OK since.

                                                This was the second Covid vaccine from Pfizer.  First vaccine was given 1/28/21 . EL3244.   No adverse side effects other than slightly sore arm at site of injection.  Second vaccine was given on  2/18/21 within a couple day I noticed tremors in my hands.  When to the doctor on Feb 25, 2021 , I talked to her about tremors.  No treatment at that time.  March 4, 2021 had a video doctor appointment and talked about tremors. She prescribed Propranolol 40mg.  No previous history of tremors.  Tremors are a little better with medicine after a couple days but not gone.  I can&#39;t use fork, button my sleeves or work tools at my job.  I did notice tremors in my back when climbing on a ladder at work.  These tremors started within  2 days of second vaccine.

Pt received covid19 vaccine on 2/16/2019 while inpatient, right before his discharge on 2/17/2021.Of note, pt was put on hospice care at the time of discharge to patient&#39;s home. He passed away on 2/26/2021. I could not find the death notice in the chart (which usually contains the medical cause of death). This was reported to us from an staff. The following describes his hospitalization: At facility, was noted to be dehydrated and reported to not have been taking his medications or having good PO intake. Per reports from nursing home, patient wasnoted to have difficulty swallowing&#34; and spit up meals and medications. SLP evaluation with concerns for mastication and dysphagia. At time of hospitalization his Na was at 153, also noted to have AKI2. His hypernatremia, aki, and dehydration resolved with fluid replacement. His potassium was also replaced. His constipation resolved with laxatives which also improved his abdominal discomfort. Also, his olanzapine was changed to disintegrating tablet which helped with his intermittent agitation. Currently, he was calm, amenable, and with medication compliance. To help with his poor appetite, his mirtazapine dose was increased to 30 mg from 15 mg. Pt was discharged on 2/17/2021 when family decided to place him under hospice care.

Approximately around 2:00 am that night (early morning)  I started to  experiencing severe heart palpitations and could not sleep. These lasted until 6:00 am that morning.  I believe this was an adverse reaction to my second dose of the Covid shot.  I notified clinic where I received the shot to inform them of the problem as well as my primary health physician. I have not had any issues since then.

                                                Several hours after 2nd vaccine shot my lungs began to ache. Not adverse pain, or breathing problems-- just s subtle ache. This continue for 3 - 4 days. No interruption of daily activities-- just that quiet ache. Heavier breathing upon exertion, but not interrupting routine. Though the aching is over, my breathing never fully recovered. I&#39;m not a medical professional-- but estimating I lost 15% ish of my breathing/capacity. This doesn&#39;t interfere with daily activities, but is &#34;present&#34; with me all the time. Even walking the dog requires a brief  slow down.

                                                Pain began about 6 hours after injection in both my shoulders and neck. As it intensified it spread throughout my body: down my left arm into my wrist, to my back and hip area (i have had issues here for 20 years), into my knees and ankles and into my left calf muscle. Further, it gave me a bad headache. i was so uncomfortable I got very little sleep that night. It continued into the following day and didn&#39;t begin to subside until about 4:00 pm. The pain in my left shoulder and arm continued off and on until today, 03/19/2021, and was at it&#39;s worst when laying down and first thing in the morning upon waking up.  (see continuation page) 5/24 follow-up:  Apparently I was a bit too quick in my assumptions of things calming down and going away. I am still experiencing many of the problems as noted above and a new one. These problems are not continuous but rather come and go but never completely disappear. And in the last couple of weeks I&#39;m now having issues with my fingers and my trigger-finger issues have been awakened along with some other finger soreness not attributable to the trigger-finger.

Uneasy sleep, awoke the following morning in a sweat, with overall discomfort and nausea, began to retch and vomit for nearly 13 hrs. throughout the only comfort was to sit in a hot shower till the hot water ran out sometime falling into a deep sleep, I did this many times through the day, Accompanying this was a general fog and complete loss of equilibrium, extreme weakness. this made it difficult to move from bed to bath or anywhere in my home. I am writing this at 5:13 am Mar  6 and find it hard to gather thoughts.

Wife was able to help me crawl back to bed. A few hours later had to urinate again, but could not get out of bed. No control no strength. Was half on the toilet and could not get myself straight on due to literally no body strength. Fell off the toilet, could not move at all. Had to call my son over to get me up.

They ordered antibiotics. Symptoms persisted, so he went to a ?minute clinic? and got a chest xray. When his PCP got those results, he was instructed to go to the ED immediately, where he was admitted for pneumonia. PCP told patient that pneumonia was caused by covid vaccine and has instructed patient to not get second dose.

A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6204), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 04Mar2021 11:15 (at the age of 73-years-old), at 0.3 mL (30 mcg), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: service connected disability diagnosed from the (name withheld) for a lower back injury; last Spring and early Summer (2020) he went through treatment for 45 days with External beam radiation therapy (EBRT), which was 405 doses of radiation from a machine called FORD, had radiation treatment for early stage prostate cancer last year (2020);  had anaphylactic shock, rash, awful case of hives when in military service in response to shots then and stayed for half an hour until okay (The patient was unable to provide names of vaccines given in past in service since that was in 1969-1970&#39;s. At that time, they got the shots in big air guns and was shot 3-4 at a time. Had those 3-4 shots during his basic training. During that time, he woke up around midnight and had awful case of hives and was taken to the base hospital and was given adrenaline in one arm and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) in the other); allergies to sulfa drugs; diagnosed allergies (unspecified); compromised immune status; respiratory illness; genetic/chromosomal abnormalities; endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity); blood stools, rare occasion; glasses. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination or on the same day as the vaccination. The patient received the first dose on 04Mar2021 at about 11:15. He had not had much of a reaction, just a little soreness and soreness (04Mar2021). The soreness started that afternoon of getting the vaccine. When he went to sleep, he noticed the soreness was in right arm, so he didn&#39;t lay on that side. He noticed it enough to sleep on the other side. On 07Mar2021, the patient had bloody stools, which were a rare occasion in the past. The patient stated the blood was significant enough to draw his attention, almost felt like a blockage in the system. The patient &#34;sat on the pot&#34; for 15-20 minutes and broke into a sweat (07Mar2021). The patient did not know if he had bloody stool then, because he didn&#39;t turn on the light, but ever since then, it has been bloody. No BM&#39;s (bowel movement) since yesterday (09Mar2021). The patient was tired yesterday (09Mar2021). He just laid around all day on a heating pad. He had a dull ache in stomach since it started (07Mar2021). Still there today, but not that bad. The patient stated he had radiation treatment for early stage prostate cancer, they tried to prevent burning or damaging the rectum, but this could be related to that. On Sunday night (07Mar2021), about midnight, he got an awful, awful stomach pain that woke him up about midnight. He tried to move his bowels 2-3 times Sunday night (07Mar2021) and on Monday morning (08Mar2021) he was able to move them a little bit. His underwear he had from Sunday night had lots of red stains in them, and all day Monday (08Mar2021) he was having a bellyache. Every time he managed to move his bowels and it was bloody and seemed to get bloodier pretty much all day. Yesterday (09Mar2021), he laid on a heating pad and went to bed early about 20:30, he usually goes about 22:00. He managed to stay in bed for about 9 hours, and he usually can&#39;t sleep that long. He slept on his side. He started having dark thoughts (unspecified date Mar2021), stating that last Spring and early Summer he went through treatment for 45 days with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). On Monday night (08Mar2021), the patient had terrible cramps about midnight, with very cold sweat and diarrhea. The next morning (09Mar2021), every bowel movement was very bloody. Then all day Tuesday (09Mar2021) very lethargic. No more bowel movements until the following Friday. The patient stated he felt like I was trying to pass a blood clot. The patient stated he seemed to have problems with bowels all day yesterday (09Mar2021) and was not much better; he had really low energy (09Mar2021). Today (10Mar2021), he seemed to feel better, but not much. He had not eaten much (Mar2021) and was hesitant to put food in his system, since his system was not functioning very well. The patient had not been seen by doctor or in an emergency room. His wife was a retired nurse, and they have discussed if he was not better, they were going to call his primary care provider and urologist. The patient had coffee this morning (10Mar2021), and he barely touched it yesterday morning. So far, no bloody discharge, no discharge or bowel movements today. Three to four times in the night he did pass gas (Mar2021), and that was all that happened. The patient knew side effects were rare with this (vaccine) and unsure if these side effects were something reported; this was certainly unusual for him. The clinical outcome of bloody stools, dull ache in stomach, had really low energy, terrible cramps, very cold sweat, diarrhea, tired, and lethargic was recovering. The outcome of belly ache, decreased appetite, and gas, was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Could not stand up.  Once helped to my feet, could not walk unassisted.  A friend came by to see how I was  and I have zero recollection of him being here.  My wife got me into bed, and a few hours later I &#34;came back to consciousness&#34; with a massive headache.  The following morning was &#34;back to earth&#34; so to speak, but for two more days felt achy, tired, lethargic.

The pain was bad enough that I was not able to sleep on the Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights after the Tuesday shot.  However, during most of the day Saturday, I was almost pain free. But the pain returned on Sunday  afternoon and I had a difficult sleep .   Monday, the pain level was diminished but did increase by the end of the day.  I took 2 ibuprofin at bedtime and 2 additional when I was awake 4 hours later. Today, Tuesday the pain is minimal, but still present.

It was him that wasn&#39;t solid; Headache; This is a spontaneous case received from a contactable consumer reported behalf of her husband. A 73 years old patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (lot/Batch: EN6206) on 13Mar2021 at single dose on left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was High blood pressure (Treatment of high blood pressure: &#34;Lisinopril dose one a day and dose is 12.5 according to it, it says here is HCTZ 10-12.5 mg it&#39;s oral tablet takes one at breakfast time); And then something else he takes because we had a storm earlier in summer, he was working where he works and wind just blew him face down into concrete side wall, but he put his arm up to resist it off, so he has been back and forth with his neurologist on this.&#34; There is another one that he does take because of hitting the side walk when I told him the wind blew him the side walk, he put his arm up but he gets a little dizzy once in a while because of that. It&#39;s Meclizine 25 mg, tablet, afternoon and evening 2 times a day.&#34; Concomitant drugs included Lisinopril, HCTZ and Meclizine. This past three weeks ago, &#39;my husband and I&#39; (not clear) had our first injection for the Pfizer and within 4 minutes he was showing all kinds of reaction to it and he know he does not have reactions to very much of anything. I have no idea like it was something within the Pfizer medication that he was allergic to, allergic reaction. He stood on the floor I didn&#39;t figure out why he was standing up, he said the floor doesn&#39;t look steady to me which meant he was a little weak or dizzy whatever I don&#39;t know, so I reached over and I looked at his forehead and I said his forehead was dripping and I touched his forehead and it was cold, so the cold sweat coming from the forehead.&#34; He was excessively tired for almost 2 weeks. Like I said he kept on standing up the couple of times and I said what&#39;s the matter and he said I don&#39;t feel like I am standing on a solid ground and I said yes you are, then he told me a few days later that his feet bothered him after that shot, he couldn&#39;t really describe what it was, but he told me it went right down to his feet and that&#39;s probably why he didn&#39;t feel right. So, anyway I end up calling over an RN and she and another RN had to take him over to take his blood pressure, his blood pressure went down and now only he had high blood pressure, he took his medication (Unspecified Medication) that morning like he always does and it went down to 107/70 and when they gave him a small bottle of water to drink and they said just stand up and take it. Took the medication stood up and it was 132/80, it was probably more than his normal. So, I mean I couldn&#39;t understand what was happening that he was tired through, excessive tired to the point that he didn&#39;t want to go to work, so I mean I didn&#39;t question what&#39;s wrong specially when I looked over and his forehead just dripping, for approximate 4 minutes after the injection. So, I mean I really don&#39;t know to have been that way. Then often had, he told me he had &#39;more&#39; (not clear) saliva for a week and a half, it&#39;s just saliva in his mouth that kept on foaming up. I had noted to if this was anything that was never him, he has never had lot of saliva in his mouth anyway. But, this side of him of course it showed it was working and that lasted almost 2 weeks as well, 2 week I think 2 weeks. And now he is starting to feel better but he didn&#39;t feel well but better than 2 weeks after the first injection. I had taken that was on 13th, 13th took him to his doctor and he recommended to not take a second one. He felt very weak, I mean this took 2 weeks to go away. He did mention that when he stood up he didn&#39;t feel like he was standing on solid ground and I know this as I have been there probably for more than 50 years, so of course he was. He received them, his blood pressure dropped to a 107/70 went that down, changing back to 132/80, actually they gave him a bottle of water in between and he did drink water for it so. And his forehead was dripping cold sweat and he told me later that he felt something strange in feet and that&#39;s why he was standing up I couldn&#39;t figure that part out in fact he was on solid floor or solid ground, so I am thinking the weakness set in him very quickly. So, that he was really dizzy, I don&#39;t know and that&#39;s why I said I called over the RN and she grabbed another RN and they helped him over to take his blood pressure they took it down it was almost 107/70. Now if he has got high blood pressure, it just the blood pressure going to be really in morning and this is at 5:30 at night, doesn&#39;t mean like and he is a lot to me. And he had excess saliva in his mouth seem to be foaming in his mouth. I don&#39;t know if you had any of these reactions or unless it&#39;s just him I really don&#39;t know. When probed for the start date of the events (event not specified), reporter stated, &#34;Approximate 5:39, maybe 5:39, 5:40 in the evening which was last month, that on the 13th.&#34; Reporter confirmed that patient would not go for second dose of vaccine and that reporter is due for second dose on this Saturday. And according to what I understand and what I was told 107/70 wasn&#39;t trending down, to me it was, but I am not a doctor nor a nurse or any other professional to have said not in medical field but when his forehead started dripping cold sweat and he was acting little strange and standing up and what is wrong because I was right next to him, I said what is wrong, he said I feel like I am falling down. The biggest one that bothers him beside being also retired for 2 weeks. He keeps on getting this foam in his mouth from saliva, excess saliva foam and that has no idea what&#39;s close to. High blood pressure, he had taken that tablet (Unspecified Medication) that morning. Actually the tiredness is gone away, the blood pressure is back to normal, like I said he was absolutely tired for 2 weeks and I think it coincide with Pfizer&#39;s 1 to 2 days. He is also having a headache and he just take Tylenol for that. Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow up attempts needed. Information about lot/ batch number not requested.

                                                May 20 Had felt &#34;fatigued&#34; most of day - attributed it to having to rise earlier than usual and having not slept well. Evening of 2nd dose date I began to feel somewhat more fatigued. (Had also drank a shot of tequila before dinner and had a glass of white wine with. Was also smoking high quality cannabis in moderation.) At 11:00 pm I rose from my chair having been seated for probably an hour and symptoms hit me full force: chills, the mild soreness in my upper arm became moderate to severe and spread to my shoulder and lower back, whole body particularly joints (including fingers of left hand) aches, mild nausea. Rough night May 21 Symptoms continue with less severity. Especially notice pain in lymph gland areas - armpits, lower back, sides of neck. by evening (with the help of 1/2 Percocet (10/325) I was feeling ok and stayed up til 1:30am May 22 Awake @ 8am. whole body particularly joints still ache including left hand (exacerbated by phone use). Upper left arm &amp; shoulder still sore but mid-back left side more so. May 23 Pretty much back to normal. &#34;Flu symptoms&#34; ran their course. Still have a tough immune system at 73yo apparently (I rarely get sick at all)

The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL5318, expiration date not provided), 1st dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on an unknown date (reported as 02Feb2021) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. List of any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included: Losartan, Atorvastatin, asprin. The adverse events resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment received for adverse event (AE). Treatment included Cortisone, NSAIDS, opiods, physical therapy.

Clinical course: After the second shot patient developed pain in his upper thighs and buttocks while sitting. This had lessen somewhat, but he still cannot sit for extended periods without pain and he had more leg stiffness than he was used to, especially in the morning. Following the leg pain, he developed severe pain and stiffness in his right upper arm and shoulder. This occurs mainly at night, and prevents his from sleeping more than an hour or two at a time. The pain diminishes during the day. He had to take Percocet to manage pain when it&#39;s at its worst. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) do not help. He had seen his Primary Care Provider (PCP) multiple time and had two cortisone shorts which provided very short term relief. He had had x-rays of his right hip and right shoulder which were negative for arthritis. He had seen a orthopedic specialist who diagnosed bicep tendonitis. He had been doing Physical Therapy (PT) for a month for this with no improvement. He had blood work to test for rheumatoid arthritis; it was negative.

                                                Patient did not report this event to the vaccination site for several months, which is why the report is just now being submitted.  Below is the exert from an email that patient sent me.  Upon asking his PCP about the reaction, he was instructed to reach out to the vaccination site to report the event.  &#34;I received my first Pfizer shot on January 28, 2021 at 2:00PM.   felt fine when I left after the fifteen minutes waiting period.  I felt fine when I went to work the next morning.  However, when I returned home from work at about 1:00 PM I did not feel well.  My legs were very weak, upset stomach, headache, rash and some fever.  I stayed on the couch the remainder of Friday and slept,  I slept on Saturday for a total of approximately 22hrs and the same on Sunday.  I went to work on Monday even though I still did not feel very good.  It was several more days until I felt near normal.   About 10 days after the first shot, both of my feet began to swell and my toes began to turn purple and black.  My feet became extremely painful.  I went to the emergency room where they drew blood and said I had gout.  I was given a prescription for a 5 day packet of steroids.   That helped, but my feet reverted back to the swelling and extreme  pain within 1 day of no steroids.  I contacted my primary care doctor who prescribed an additional 10 day packet of steroids plus two other prescriptions that I do not remember.  I was in extreme pain and needed a walker to function.   I have had two follow up visits to my primary care doctor.  He did blood work which showed several results were outside of the normal range, however the gout indicator was within the normal range.  My RA level was 32 which is very high.  And, never have  had my RA factor number high prior to the shot.  He referred me to a RA specialist, but the appointment is still months away.     My feet are still somewhat swollen and walking is very uncomfortable and a little unsteady.  Before the shot, I was doing well.  My blood work was fine.   It has been almost 4 months and I still do not know when my feet will return to normal. I am no longer using a walker.   My Primary Care doctor advised me to report my adverse reactions.&#34;  Patient did received his 2nd Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2/25/2021.  He states he &#34;did not experience any effects from the second shot&#34;.  At this point I am not sure if the COVID-19 vaccine is the culprit with patients RA level, but did want to report this event since patient indicates the timing of the vaccination and his symptoms appear related.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Dec2020 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He was an ER doctor and the medical director of his hospital. The patient was asymptomatic when he got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. 3 hours after the vaccine he began to get chills, HA, anorexia, myalgias, and extreme fatigue. This worsened and he slept all and had no appetite. On 19Dec2020 he woke up delirious with a fever and was ataxic, hypoxic, incontinent, and confused. The patient was hospitalized due to the events on 15Dec2020. The events also caused prolonged hospitalization due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab post vaccination with unknown results. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as the patient required oxygen, plasma, and remdisivir.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, BNT162B2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of reported serious events might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  Fever, chills, headache, fatigue and muscle pain are the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  More information such as detailed underlying medical conditions and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient&#39;s official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

                                                About 26 hours (a Friday afternoon) after the 2nd COVID shot, I suddenly began to feel bad and found I had 2.5 degrees of fever.  My shoulder where the shot occurred became painful and a pinkish rash formed there.  The temp rose to 3.5 degrees over the next seven hours and remained that high until mid morning Saturday.  Then it oscillated between 1.0 and 3.0 degrees until Sunday morning.  Finally it began to fall and reached normal Sunday afternoon around 4 pm.  The rash disappeared on Monday and the shoulder pain stopped on Tuesday.

Then less frequently (bigger intervals - maybe 4 times) till about 5am 3/6/21.  Then it more or less stopped.  Headache left, and though the stomach was worked over, I was now feeling better. Other than a rough night. All this time I had been rehydrating  frequently - trying to keep pace with discharge . . . (fizzy water - no additives) sometimes cut with a very little cranberry juice.  Since then  BRAT and now back to almost normal.   4lb lighter . . . That&#39;s good.

He was off pressors but remained intubated due to poor mental status with unclear etiology. It could be related to liver failure, vs neurological insult vs renal failure. Head CT 4 days prior on the 2/24 were without acute intracranial pathology. Hepatology was consulted and did not believe the liver was the main etiology behind poor mental status. Patient progressively declined with continuously increased IV pressor requirement. ABG showed worsening lactate acidosis and was anuric. Patient&#39;s family was notified of decline and agreed for the patient to be transition to comfort care early 2/28. Bedside RN notified pronouncing physician of cessation of respiration and cardiac activity.

The Imiquimod was in individual foil packets of 0.25 grams each.  I applied the medication to my forehead and small area on the left side of my neck.   I noticed a quick response to the treatment; within a week small rd pimples were evident on the application site.   Mar 31 I came down with flu (symptoms): Major:  Chills, diarrhea, spacey feeling Moderate:  Loss of appetite, aching joints, sinus congestion Minor:  Nausea, fever Terminated the skin treatment.

I have 13 foil packets remaining  so I applied one per day for 11 days. Noted that flu symptoms are listed as a side effect of at least one of the dermatology treatments.   Apr 1 Flu (symptoms) continued   Apr 2 Since flu symptoms can indicate covid, I went to prompt care for a rapid covid test.  Negative covid. Except for diarrhea, the flu symptoms moderated. Results from the dermatology treatment became more intense and spread well beyond the area treated.      Apr 3 Took Pepto Bismo tablets for diarrhea.  Seems to have worked. Skin reaction has spread well beyond the treated area.   Applying antibiotic cream twice daily   Apr 6

A 74-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9263 and Expiration Date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 17Feb2021 (at the age of 74-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Lyme disease in the past that was treated. He take no day to day medications. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that patient wanted to report experience with BNT162B2. On 17Feb2021 patient received BNT162B2 around mid-day. First day he got the COVID-19 vaccine, by late afternoon his skin was feeling very, very irritated. He was feeling irritated. Started sensing aggression and anger in himself. Couldn&#39;t get comfortable. Doesn&#39;t know if this is an expected result because he hasn&#39;t seen this. Started to get extremely tired. Did have to lay down a couple times later that afternoon to early evening. Worse thing was his whole body felt irritated. 18Feb2021 (Yesterday), he didn&#39;t have the same feeling. He had a very good morning. Early afternoon started feeling chills and couldn&#39;t get warm. Got into bed with big quilts. Chill sensation lasted two to three hours. Sees that chills are an expected result. 19Feb2021 (Today), so far he has had a good day. He is fatigued now this afternoon. That would be the extent of anything unusual for him. Most concerning was how he was feeling the first day. He doesn&#39;t think he was being a good driver at the time. Probably thinks there should be a recommendation to try and not drive or have a designated driver. Patient would like to know if the anger and aggression was within the range of expected results. Stated he doesn&#39;t know if there was real value in knowing it at this time unless there are booster shots that come out in the next year or so. Stated he wanted to report to Pfizer so it was known there are other things than what was being seen. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 74-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection; Lot number: ER8732) via an unspecified route of administration at right shoulder on 27Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.   The patient concomitant medications includes, zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN CR 12.5mg) still ongoing for insomnia, taking it from years as patient comes from family of insomniacs &amp; high-pressure jobs; triazolam (HALCION) (0.25mg) still ongoing for sleep, rivaroxaban (XARELTO) (20mg) started taking in 2012 for pulmonary embolism &amp; has been on blood thinners, aspirin acetylsalicylic acid (low dose aspirin of 65mg) for supplemental blood thinner still ongoing. Patient has history of seasonal allergies and its prime time right now so its compounding. Relevant medical history includes, both knee replacement, pulmonary embolism, bad blood pressure problems maybe 5 years ago all on an unspecified date. The patient historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: EN6198), at Right shoulder on 06Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.  On 27Mar2021, When the patient got home from his shot, he had no problems at all and he went to bed. Being an old guy, he got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and he lost his balance and took a nasty fall, so has a bummed up knee and stuff too, so that is what aggravates it. He clarifies he has a bum knee and nose after having the fall. Since he took the fall and has the bum knee, it is kind of a chore going up and down stairs.  On 28Mar2021 the patient experienced general sense of weakness , general tiredness. It has been over a week and he wants to know if that is unusual. Patient adds there was kind of a brain fog thing From: 28 Mar 2021  going on. The brain fog concerns him because he has to get his taxes done. He was still having trouble with the nose bleeds, which sort of compounds his misery, but he is getting better. It seems the side effects are getting incrementally better every day, but its not like he wakes up and its completely gone. It&#39;s like some prolonged illness. His side effects are getting marginally better. He is fairly clear headed today and he even had the nerve to take a short drive to the supermarket and stuff, although he wouldn&#39;t want to drive cross country in terms of being able to concentrate. But doing his taxes, will take a little work. Patient stated in the beginning he had muscle aches and chills from: 28Mar2021, but that went away after a day or two. Patient stated he had muscle aches/chills for a couple of days. He feels he has recovered completely as far as he knows. He never had nausea. On an Unspecified date patient mentions feeling a little short of breath, but states that could be more of the asthma thing. He does not recall having injection site pain at all. The tiredness is definitely ongoing, but has improved. He clarifies it has probably improved incrementally but doesn&#39;t really want to classify it as improvement because it might be temporary. He did not have a headache until he was waiting on the phone to speak to this call handler. On 28Mar2021 the patient experienced muscle pain for a few days and that sort of cleared up. This was the same with joint pain. After the big bang, clarified as the fall, everything proceeded. He still feels the muscle and joint pain, only in his knee, but its starting to fade. His knee was really a beautiful shade of purple, but it seems to be fading and hurting less so that is recovering, too. This pain is secondary. The side effect was the dizziness, stiffness, and inability to keep his balance. Caller states he was stiff as a board and he just couldn&#39;t move fast enough to get one foot in front of the other, and he landed on his knee, so the pain in his knee was not directly caused by shot. He felt fine at the center where he took the shot. He had to wait 15-20 minutes after the shot. He felt fine, drove home, went to bed, and in the middle of the night, it all started. He still feels a little dizzy and unsure and has been using a cane. He got both knees replaced and is worried that he damaged the actual replacement joint as opposed to just the muscle tissue. He just doesn&#39;t trust himself without the cane. He hasn&#39;t fallen over and hasn&#39;t passed out. He feels stiff all over but that could be from not getting to the gym and working out and not doing his regular work outs. Patient stated that the lethargy might be slightly better. He was making himself do more but he still gets really tired and it was really hard for him to get motivated, like to get out of the chair and go downstairs. He went to the supermarket and had to unload his car in stages- he took the perishables out and rested for a while and then went back out and got another couple of bags and then rested again. He just could not work straight through like he normally does. States he is in pretty good shape normally. He does not feel particularly great and that is the reason that he called to find out if this should last this long. Patient stated that he does have high blood pressure and heart problems. In fact at the end of the month, he will be going in for a catherization with Dr. (Name) so that was another reason he wants to have this stuff cleared up and out of the way. He still has dizziness and weakness. Patient stated that last night was the first night of decent sleep he had got. He has insomnia actually and he takes two sleep medications, but even taking those and washing it down with a glass of wine, he could not sleep for a whole week. He clarifies even with the Halcion and Ambien CR, it didn&#39;t work for a whole week- he could not sleep which adds to the brain fog. Typically, he goes to sleep, wakes up after a couple of hours, and then he is awake so he reads for a few hours and then takes the second medication and then sleep the rest of the night. He ends up getting a full 8-9 hours of sleep normally and he did that last night.   On 08Apr2021 he developed a pounding headache but it was probably independent of the shot. He took Tylenol and he is okay now, but he just thought it was ironic that he had one while waiting to talk to Pfizer when he hadn&#39;t had one before. Outcome of the events muscle pain and joint pain, dizziness and stiffness, Feeling unwell were ongoing and those of other events were unspecified.  No further information was provided or obtained

He cannot explain it, he can take pain,  but with vaccine he couldn&#39;t even open the eyes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 74-year-old male consumer reported that he received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number unknown), into the left upper arm on 22Mar2021 (at the age of 74years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high cholesterol and &#39;prostate&#39;.  Concomitant drugs included  Flomax 0.4 mg for prostate, one a day, Simvastatin 40 mg once daily for High Cholesterol and Clonazepam 2 mg for sleep for years. The patient reported that he received first dos of vaccine and the next day was discombobulated. He was hanging up against wall. His equilibrium was completely off that got better little bit but he was still wobbly but the headache got on his left side, he felt like he was having a stroke and he still has a headache that comes and goes, it was sharp as somebody hit you with a nail and he just does not know if he should take second shot or not since he was afraid. &#39;&#39;He cannot explain it, he can take pain,  he had done operations (Clarification unknown) and everything but with vaccine he couldn&#39;t even open the eyes, his equilibrium was so off and sleeps, he has been taking 2-3 hours nap and that&#39;s not him.&#34;   As per treatment, the only thing they gave him was Aspirin or Advil. He tried Tylenol and it did not work and he tried everything and then he tried Sinutab and he tried Motrin, he tried everything. At the time of reporting the patient had not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right upper arm on 04Mar2021 at 11:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6199) as the 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at the military facility. He previously received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number: EN9581) on 11Feb2021 at 2-3 pm (at the age of 74 years old) in the right upper arm and experienced a bout of diarrhea, but he took loperamide (IMODIUM) and it went away; he expected the first shot and last only about a day. Relevant medical history included ongoing legally blind, wherein his central vision was screwed up and this was something going on before the shots and with his peripheral vision, there were areas he could see clearly, and also had eye pain; his hearing was hypersensitive on certain frequencies, which was ongoing; and residual neuropathy in feet; all from an unknown date prior the vaccine. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient previously took clonazepam (KLONOPIN) from an unspecified date in 2009; further reported that the patient had no information on this medication other than it was Klonopin that caused him to stop breathing and put in coma in 2009 and that he was given intravenous (IV) antibiotics, because he had 3 major infections and this was when the issue with his vision started. The patient previously received and stopped getting the flu shot years prior reporting when he got sick for 6 weeks. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) other than the first dose. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). The patient reported that he got the second shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and within 5 minutes, he had a severe reaction. He was in an observation area at the facility and less than 5 minutes after getting the shot, he had problems breathing on 04Mar2021, it was painful to breath; however, it was further reported that &#34;painful&#34; was not the word for the problems breathing. The triage team gave him shots and he went to the emergency room (ER) and ended up spending the night in the hospital. It was further reported that they gave him an epinephrine (EpiPen) and some other shot in the left arm and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) in the right arm and put on oxygen on him. He was admitted to the hospital and released the next day. He was given the option to leave the next day and so he did. The doctor explained, they were concerned it was cardiac related, but did blood work and told them he was fine on an unspecified date in 2021. The doctor also told him they saw a rash on the left ankle on 04Mar2021 and therefore knew it was an allergic reaction. The rash on ankle was barely visible the next day, it had resolved though, but was not sure of the exact date. He couldn&#39;t have seen it anyway. There had also been other issues since then. He remarked that he moved things, but couldn&#39;t remember where he moved them on an unspecified date in 2021. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the hypersensitive on certain frequencies was reported as worsened. Regarding the patient&#39;s hearing, he explained that while in church, they were playing music and it was pure pain. He went to the clinic and saw an otolaryngologist, who told him that his hearing was hypersensitive on certain frequencies, not all though. He stated he had this before, but never with music at the church or like this. He was in the car and a car beside him with heavy base playing was giving him issues; the same kind of the pain, but on the opposite end with base. This was something new and not like he had before. It was ongoing and he had not gone back to church, so as not to experience this again. This started within a week or 2 after the second shot. Since the shots on an unspecified date in Mar2021, his vision was compromised. There were upper and lower areas, &#34;sweet spots,&#34; he could see. With his last check up, the vision in the lower section had shrunk even more; where he could see from about the 3:30 to 8:30 area before, currently it was from 5:00 to 7:00. He explained this was like on a clock. Also he was able to see the big E at the top of a vision chart, but in Mar2021 after the second shot, he noticed within days, he could no longer see the large E. He had a regularly schedule appointment a couple weeks after the second shot and this was noticed. It had gotten worse. Additionally, he would stand in front of the eye chart and as part of the eye exam, they would hold out fingers to see if he could see them. Last year at 6 feet (ft), he could see them, but currently, he couldn&#39;t see them until 2 ft away. If he was in bright light, he had severe eye pain, to the point of crying. He had to leave and get out of that situation, it was so bad. Even going outside with a hat and sunglass without looking at bright light, it still impacted him. The lighting in his bathroom bothered him; he had to have the blinds closed and was home bound. His closet was the only way to get relief. This was all new since the Covid shot. On an unspecified date in 2021, the residual neuropathy in feet was reported as worsened. He had this previously, but currently had hypersensitive in his feet in those areas. The patient found some essential oils that help so he could get to sleep and keep it from itching in his feet. The patient was deducting that for whatever reason, it was impacting nerve areas that had issues previously. It was causing them to get worse. He could only find this commonality; the optic, auditory, and residual neuropathy, the shot was aggravating these things that he already had problems with previously. It was added that he had also noticed his eyes had a throbbing pain, like a feeling of wanting to explode. He has had this in the past, but not too often and currently, it was daily and it was getting worse. It started about 3 weeks after, but it didn&#39;t happen often at first. Currently, it was almost daily. The doctor told him that there was not a way this could happen, there was no evidence this could happen. There had been no treatment, nothing had been done. He said with his DNA, if something could go wrong even just 1% then it would happen to him. The AE &#34;problems breathing&#34; did require an ER visit. The patient was hospitalized for the event problems breathing from 04Mar2021 to 05Mar2021. The patient underwent further lab tests and procedures, which included hearing test with unknown results on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of problems breathing, allergic reaction, and rash on the left ankle. The patient recovered from the event &#34;problems breathing&#34; on 04Mar2021; he recovered from the events &#34;allergic reaction and rash on the left ankle&#34; on an unspecified date in 2021; he was not recovered from the events &#34;residual neuropathy in feet was reported as worsened, hypersensitive on certain frequencies was reported as worsened, and his vision since the shots was compromised/vision in the lower section had shrunk even more/gotten worse,&#34; while the outcome of the other event was unknown.

I was  dizzy, and I felt like I had been hit by a baseball bat, and I just couldn&#39;t out of bed. No fever. The next day it was the same thing, I got up to go to church. I was feeling unwell. After mass I went home. I couldn&#39;t do my usual Sunday activities.

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 27Jan2021 13:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Facility where the COVID-19 vaccine was administered: Other. The patient&#39;s medical history included stroke, blood pressure high (HBP), diabetes (Non-Insulin Dependent) and known allergies to medications, food, or other products: Lisinopril, Penicillin. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took lisinopril and experienced drug allergy. The reporter&#39;s husband (for whom she was reporting) had been having bouts, what she thought are slight hallucinations, since receiving the vaccine. The first (onset of bouts) was twenty-four hours later (28Jan2021) when he described a &#34;floaty&#34; feeling in the morning and was not wanting to get out of bed. Second was forty-eight hours later, on the 29Jan2021, in the morning when he had (as with routine), left his empty water pitcher out for refill (which was per normal), he proceeded to question her about what happened to it and was stating that something was not right with the time frame of events. Thirdly, he had a feeling of being &#34;trapped&#34; as he was trying to exit the latrine on the 31Jan2021 (early hours of the morning). He at that point referenced a specific &#34;disease&#34; where things in time-space was not adding up. Before the vaccine, he was doing fine. After receiving this first dose, it seems to the reporter that he was suffering a reaction contrary to the general side effects. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 17Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 75-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Type 1 diabetes mellitus from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (not controlled). The patient had no known allergies.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 75-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 24 Feb 2021 (at the time of 75-years-old), as first dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included unspecified product. The patient stated that he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 24Feb2021. Caller states he initially had no side effects the first fifteen minutes after receiving the vaccine. Caller states a few days later on that Saturday he experienced dizziness, nausea, major aches, weakness all over the body and pains and headache (27Feb2021). He did not feel safe driving and he just felt down for the day. Caller states on Sunday he felt a little better but still had some nausea, headache and aches. Caller states he read the paperwork and thinks his symptoms were in the realm of normal. Caller would like to know if he was correct. He read that after the second shot the side effects were more severe and he would like to know if this was correct. He was actually in bed all night, was afraid to drive and was afraid to do anything. He was actually in bed all night, was afraid to drive and was afraid to do anything so, just took a day off and stayed at bed mostly, following day the Sunday felt much better and the following week, which was basically this week feel better, feel fine. Also asking should expect that his second question was could possibly be contagious being around someone else. The patient stated that stopped having these problems. The outcome of the events was resolved on 2021. No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.
