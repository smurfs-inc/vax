                                                Client received her first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine (lot # EW0185 exp. 08/2021) at 11:28 AM. The client was brought to the EMT station by lead RN stating that the client was feeling &#34;dizzy? at 11:46 AM. The client was a 12-year-old female alert and tracking with her eyes and appeared anxious. The client had a chief complaint of lightheadedness. The client stated that she ?began to feel lightheaded? after her initial 15-minute observation had completed. This was the client&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and she stated reluctance to receive her first dose. The client denied any allergies and her parents stated that the client had a history of unspecified behavioral disturbances that require her to see a therapist. The assessment revealed no hives, swelling, discoloration, shortness of breath, or other signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. The client denied a headache or wanting to throw up. The client refused to have her vitals taken by EMTbut agreed at 1150 to remain lying down until she felt better. The client was encouraged to drink water while she waited. After 15 minutes and drinking a bottle of water, the client stated &#34;I feel all better&#34; but &#34;I think I&#39;m overthinking this&#34; and stated that she was now experiencing a ?headache?. RN asked the client?s parents? permission to speak to the client. RN came over to reassess the client and that client finally agreed to have her vitals taken at 1208: 148/84 blood pressure, Pulse 94, 100% O2 on room air, Respirations 16, alert and oriented to person, place, date, and event. The client revealed to RN that she was experiencing anxiety from her vaccination but became much calmer after discussing her concerns further. Client also revealed that she engages in acts of self-harm but has no intent to end her life. The client&#39;s last set of vitals at 1216 were 128/76 BP, HR 96, O2 100%, Resp. 16. The client then stated that she was ?ready to go? after her last set of vitals. Lead RN asked to speak to client?s mother in private. Lead RN provided mother with crisis hotline. Mother informed lead RN that client was in therapy and already seeking help. The client&#39;s parents were instructed to seek emergency care if a significant allergic reaction occurred later in the evening and were provided with all relevant vaccine-related information by RN. The client departed at 1220 in a positive disposition with her parents.

                                                My daughter is experiencing periodically nose bleeds, brain fog and bit distracted and losing herself in her thoughts after her first dose  Pfizer vaccine. This is new from the initial report. Her mother also states she feels fatigue and not active for a few days now.  At this time I have not been able to get an appointment to see her doctor and I am very concerned about her symptoms.   I would like more research or documentation to be released about this type of group to figure out why this happened to her. Also, I would like to see if they are going to be monitored after her vaccine. I do not know what other side effects will be coming after her vaccine and I am concerned.

                                                She was taking  Claritin for the few days before this event. She normally takes it every fall and every spring. She had seasonal allergy symptoms on the days leading up to this event- she had sore throat, runny nose, a little headache and congestion and developed a cough; on the day of this symptoms she spiked a low grade fever - 100.5. I did a rapid test for COVID at home which was negative for her. Sudden onset: A bunch of knives poking her on the inside of her stomach - pokey from hips to ribs.  She started to double over and bend over. Within 10 minutes, she couldn&#39;t stand up. She was telling me that something was really wrong. This isn&#39;t her character so I knew it was very wrong. I took her to ER. I was still concerned about appendicitis or COVID. This episode lasted for 90 minutes and then it came and went for the rest of the night and then after that - she had runny nose and congestion (normal allergies after that). She was better before they gave her the medication but it didn&#39;t seem like she really needed them. She was improving before she got either of the medications: Zofran; Levsin. They gave her a dosage of each there and  sent home with a prescription but we never had them filled as she was feeling better. - As it started to improve - it ( being the pokey pain) it was located closer to her ribs and breastbone.

                                                Beginning Thursday night, fever onset reached 101. Patient reported extreme fatigue but aches and sore arm made sleeping difficult. By 2 am on Friday, June 11th, vomiting and diarrhea began. Patient was given 200 mg of Tylenol and 25 mg of Benadryl. Arnaca gel was applied to the rash that formed on the vaccine site. The rash was approximately 3 cm wide and 5 cm tall oval shape. It was bright red and painful to touch (like a sunburn). Arm was also swollen from shoulder to elbow. Patient slept from 4 am - 8am on 6/11. All day on 6/11 patient had trouble keeping down fluids (tried water, juice, gatorade, and broth) and patient refused food (tried popsicles, rice, bananas, scrambled eggs, and plain noodles). Patient complained of throbbing pain in left arm. Patient refused to massage the area and would screen in pain and cry with tears if mom touched it at all. Cold packs and warm packs brought no relief. Patient continued to receive Tylenol every four hours. Fever would reach 102-102.5, break with sweats. Patient reported feeling very cold and then very hot. Fever break would last 30 min - 1 hour before climbing again.   Sunday 6/12 continued the same as 6/11. Patient began alternating Advil 200 mg with Tylenol every four hours. Advil didn&#39;t seem to help any more than the Tylenol did.  Parent called consulting nurse and was advised to take patient to urgent care where she received anti-nausea medication.  Monday 6/13 patient continues to have difficulty with food and drink. The phenergan meds help with nausea but make patient so tired, there&#39;s little chance to get patient to eat or drink. Vomiting has stopped but diarrhea continues.

An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

Her mother and I both tried to lean here back in the chair she was sitting in.  she jolted a few times and her eyes rolled backwards. I asked her mother if she has ever had seizures, she responded no.  Her mother stabilized her and I ran to get the NP next door, by the time we returned she had regained consciousness, but was a little confused and very pale.  The NP checked her out and found out she did not eat breakfast.  We gave her some apple juice.  After 15-20 minutes her color had come back, she felt fine, and she was able to leave.  Her mother told me later that both patient and her mother have had syncope events in the past.

She has never had delusions or hallucinations before, and is now one week after her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. She is scared now to walk down the hallway in the house sometimes and also to be alone in her room or another room in the house without people. She was in virtual school for the entire school year and never had a situation like this. She is scared she will never stop feeling this way. The only thing that has changed in her life and is different is that she got the vaccine.

She continued to complain about a headache every once in awhile. About a week later I noticed  her eyes seemed a little yellow but it didn&#39;t seem to get worse and thought maybe she just need to drink more water and get some sleep.  After second dose: Bad headache (3-4 days) dizzy and nauseous (3 days) gave ibuprofen for 2 days. Two days after the vaccine she was fully jaundice. Hadn&#39;t notice because she was feeling bad from the vaccine so I just let her sleep mostly. Next day we got into see her primary care dr who ordered stat bloodwork and stat ultrasound. That same day she got some blood work back and told us to go to the er because her platelets were really low. At the er they diagnosed her with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which explained the jaundice. She was admitted and put on steroids. Her hemoglobin got as low as 5 and they cross matched her incase they needed to do a blood transfusion. They were concerned that there was a possibility that her immune system would attack the donor blood since it seemed to be attacking her platelets as well. Luckily the steroids started working and he levels creeped up a little. She also recieved 3 vitamin k transfusions and pain meds. When she was switched to oral steroids and her numbers were still rise they released her. She is still taking steroids and has weekly follow ups with Dr. . We are also in the process of getting a rheumatology referral to see if there is an underlying condition we didnt know about.

She had pressure behind her eyes, muscle pain,she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills , sore throat, nauseous, caller states she was assuming hives, inflammation stayed around awhile , body aches / pain through her head and back down her neck, trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful , she was slumpy, swelling from the digging and scratching, her hands began to swell yesterday in Jun2021. she woke up and said her face felt funny on 09Jun202. she was just not feeling right and couldn&#39;t walk by herself on Jun2021, Caller relays her daughter will be (withheld) . HCP: Caller states she called the pediatrician office and 1 was by phone and she was seen by this provider yesterday and she encouraged her to reach out to us as well. Mom states she was aware of the possible symptoms to occur and her daughter came home Tuesday perfectly fine and went to bed and woke up with the typical symptoms, she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills, sore throat, nauseous and had all the symptoms pretty much. States she didn&#39;t have anything weird going on during the observation time the day of the vaccine. Caller relays her daughter didn&#39;t have anything weird after her 1st dose. Caller states she took a nap Wednesday about 24 hours after her 2nd dose and she woke up and her lips had begun to swell and she woke up and said her face felt funny and it was itchy. Caller states she was assuming hives. Caller states that there was nothing concerning as it wasn&#39;t in that initial 15minutes to 4 hour and that this occurs 24 hours after and that was a concern. Caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch and that was kind of along the same lines and said hives and she would itch itch itch and there was swelling from the digging and scratching. Caller states she has numbness in her lip with the swelling. Caller states the other symptoms that are bizarre is more yesterday and it started some on Wednesday she had a pressure in her chest and this was a child, her daughter was very strong, she got up yesterday and tried to do school and had a fever of 102 and Wednesday evening was so sick with symptoms and she still tried. Caller states the pressure in her chest is concerning and told them yesterday and she needed to be seen. States her daughter described it to the doctor that it felt like someone was sitting on her chest sort of pressure and on a scale of 1-10 she was a 7. Caller provides that not at any time did she experience trouble breathing and she never saw her lose or get weird coloring. Caller states she called her doctor Wednesday afternoon and talked to another doctor, that she called the help line after hours as they close 4:30 or 5pm. States she was told it was good news that she did not have trouble breathing but to have it at this point was weird and no one knows what to expect and everyone is different. States she was told to do Benadryl and continue with pain medication for fever and discomfort. Caller states her daughter was miserable the rest of the evening. Caller relays that the swelling subsided and the inflammation stayed around awhile and yesterday she woke up better with no nausea and the common symptoms are better and she still had the fever. Caller relays that at about 9:00 she began to have a problem where she said that behind her eyes she had significant pressure and that scared the caller what with the brain and swelling. Caller states her hands began to swell yesterday, like her lip and her fingers are itchy and swelling and it&#39;s constant itching and the pressure on her chest yesterday, that those 3 things freaked the caller out and she called the pediatrician and they said to have her checked out to make sure as nobody wanted to rush her to the ER as she was not struggling to breathe she was just not feeling right. Caller states the pediatrician did her research about heart inflammation and listened to her heart a couple of times and said her best observation for rubbing sounds was she did not hear any. Caller states when her daughter was younger she had meningitis and went through a whole lot with that and caller states she does not immediately rush to the hospital as that brings back emotions with that. Caller states the doctor said she didn&#39;t see any immediate distress and would do an EKG or they could wait and see, that she thought the pressure might be like body aches and her daughter had laid in bed all day the day before and had a time with it. Caller states she couldn&#39;t walk by herself and she was out of it. Caller states she could do the EKG or wait until today and they chose to wait. States that today she seems better and the only thing today is the continuing pressure behind her eyes that her daughter described as it felt like someone had 2 spoons and was trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful. Caller relays her daughter has been through meningitis pain and has pain through her head and back down her neck and the concern is swelling. Caller states it could be a weird reaction and the doctor thinks it is a weird headache she is having and is still doing ibuprofen. Caller relays that her chest is not nearly as heavy today and she has taken Benadryl again for itching and swelling. States the doctor says they don&#39;t know what did it because the risk was there and the benefit and don&#39;t want to get reactions. Caller states she had no problem with getting the shot, that weird things happen and the pediatrician is saying it can happen but doesn&#39;t know. States it is kind of scary. Caller states they checked her out and they checked her oxygen and blood pressure and that made the caller feel better. States that 9:30-10 last night after she got home she was slumpy and her head was hurting and she had chest pressure. Caller states with the hand swelling, that the caller herself went through reaction and hives and the doctor had asked if her daughter had anything new introduced and no nothing was and her daughter didn&#39;t seem concerned to share this but after her 1st dose her hands itched and she didn&#39;t pay it any mind. States she had no face swelling. Caller states she is wondering if those little hand itches after the 1st dose she didn&#39;t tell about till now was that a little bit of a sign that something else was there. States she didn&#39;t mention it after the 1st dose and was good to go. States after the 2nd dose she said mommy my hands itched after the 1st dose, her lip didn&#39;t swell and she told the doctor it&#39;s not conditions on the list of symptoms and she didn&#39;t have breathing issues. Caller states it&#39;s a non severe reaction and is assuming to dose and said yesterday if she gets a booster what does Pfizer advise. Caller states they have all intention of getting what she needs in the future. Caller states she wants to make sure she doesn&#39;t have worse and the lip swelling was freaky. Caller states she thought her daughter was out of the woods after the 20 minutes waiting and was home and then turned. Caller states it was pretty straight forward and knew what the expected symptoms were and they were fine and knew she was having the exact ones on the list and was not feeling well and had a fever. States she was thrown for a loop when others came up and the fact that they were 24 hours out, that she got the 2nd dose 4-4:15 on Tuesday and these evolved well after that time. Caller said they said to report this and her hope is that they can help if someone else has this issue. States when she said she was laying there my hands did itch after the 1st but not like this to this degree. States she never said anything and caller didn&#39;t know. States she knows as a parent there are certain questions to ask and warning signs of potential allergic reactions. Caller states she is assuming this is some sort of allergic reaction, not the worst kind but pressure in the chest and other concerns about her heart having some sort of issue she knows have been reported.Caller states that today she could have done the EKG for more information but based on her listening and what she wanted to thinking the body aches and extensive issues with that she is glad she waited. States she was laying in bed at 6:30 and asked her if she wanted to get the EKG and she said she was afraid of going to the hospital and it&#39;s not fun but would give answers if there is something else and she laid in bed until 9:30-10 and gave her more Benadryl and Ibuprofen and continued with that for the discomfort behind her eyes and the doctor is thinking it&#39;s body aches. States the fever subsided yesterday.Caller states she would like to share that her daughter is a tough kid and tough kids can be taken down too and may not pay attention. Caller states she doesn&#39;t over react but she is aware and if she had told her about her hands she would have thought allergic reaction, mild one and brought her to the doctor or at the 2nd vaccine and she didn&#39;t say anything until after the fact. Caller relays her daughter has never been through hives and the caller has and has a lot of seasonal and environmental allergies and the caller was that kid. Caller states with her daughter not having seen her lip swell and her eyes started hurting and she started thinking the worst. States the doctor pushed on her and checked her lymph nodes and did a thorough exam that lasted about 30 minutes and nobody knows. States she appreciates all that Pfizer and the other companies have done, that we need this.Caller states her daughter goes to the pediatrician in 2 weeks for her annual check up. States the doctor yesterday said her body responded and had a hard time with it. States she does the flu shot every year and this was weird and she wanted us to know and hopes this report can help. Caller states her daughter is a tough kid nobody knows and today she is better, she has a headache behind her eyes still there.Caller relays that Friday she had her annual eye check up and it&#39;s not a vision thing, that was fine until Wednesday and other other stuff and yesterday with pressure and she is sure it&#39;s residual and her body adjusting and if she can help with letting other people know.Caller relays if it comes back she is going to do the EKG, that she is not the parent to say it is nothing and will follow through with Pfizer also. Caller states she didn&#39;t have anything weird for heart beat and no rubbing sound and no signs and she thinks it was issues from body aches and hopefully she is on the up and up and nobody will have to leave and go to the doctor today. And didn&#39;t think because it was not an immediate issue with her breathing and nothing like that and didn&#39;t think it would be an issue with a booster. Caller states it could be that instead of sitting for 20 minutes they keep her longer and that when she fills out the sheet if was not an option, she knows there is severe reaction listed, she will make notes and make the person giving the dose aware that she had the delayed what they are believing to be allergic reaction and make sure, that she may never have it again and it could have been her system was so under attack. Caller states she doesn&#39;t understand vaccines and knows it&#39;s the body&#39;s job to do something and she is not reluctant helping her be immune and she understands what to do in the event and doesn&#39;t have an epi pen and her daughter has no allergies and no reactions to anything. Caller states she didn&#39;t have the worry, that there is always a chance and you worry when something foreign goes in the body that there is a chance to react. Investigations: Caller states they listened to her heart and took her vitals and tests with her fingers checking her eyes to make sure her pupils were dilating correctly and move her eyes with a moving finger. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know the medical term but the basics and let them know she was not in dire straights to rush to the hospital immediately. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 102 fahrenheit, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, vital signs measurement was unknown and unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lip swelling and numbness, itching on face, hands and feet / caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch, pressure on her chest , fever, swelling from the digging and scratching. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Pt fainted near immediately, regained consciousness in about 15-20 seconds, then seemed a bit dazed for several minutes. Pt stayed at the pharmacy for about 17-18 min and seemed to recover by the end and walked out with her parents. Parents noted that this is a normal reaction to vaccines, but this time did seem to be the most severe compared to past events.

She said she could not see out to the left side of her eye.  This went away after 2 minutes and within 20-30 minutes she developed a severe headache and was in tears from the pain. She has no history of headaches and this has never happened before. She did not report light or sound sensitivity. She did not have any vomiting, but did not want to eat. We consulted her Optometrist and Pediatrician. I gave her Naproxen and caffeine and within 3 hours her headache resolved.

                                                Patient received her 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine around 11:20am, and started feeling bad within about 5-7 minutes of administration.  Her grandmother came to the counter to alert me that she wasn&#39;t feeling well, patient was lightheaded and just &#34;felt bad&#34;.  She did say she was nauseous, but was very agitated and had trouble verbalizing what was wrong.  She was very hot and clammy, her mother reported that she looked very pale.  I went to get a cuff to take her blood pressure, but by the time I got it on her arm, she was slumping significantly in the chair, so we decided to move her back to the clinic room to lay her down and elevate her feet.  Her mother and I each took an arm to move her.  I thought she may have briefly lost consciousness, her legs were not holding any of her weight, but her head was down, so I couldn&#39;t tell if she was alert.  We moved her a few more feet into the room and her mother moved to set her down in a chair, she was talking and alert.  At this time, her bladder evacuated and she vomited, her mom moved her the rest of the way to the chair. I immediately went back to the room with them and dialed 911 at 11:34am.  She was more alert at this time, did not report any difficulty breathing or any swelling or itching of the mouth or throat.  She was very anxious/agitated, but she did say that she felt a little better after vomiting.   EMS arrived at 11:52, I believe she vomited again before they got here, she did take a few sips of water.  EMS left at 12:06pm, the patient and her mother left at 12:07, she was walking on her own, with support from mom.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

                                                That afternoon, she was lethargic, achy and her arm was sore, so I gave her Tylenol. She had trouble sleeping that night. On Sunday morning, I gave her two Ibuprofen around 9 because her arm was still hurting. Around 9:30, she came in saying she was having chest pains and her pulse rate was over 120. I took her to the ER. Her heart rate was 128 when they triaged her. They gave her an IV and a saline drip, an EKG and chest x-ray, all of which were fine. Due to her being on birth control, they also did a d-dimer test, which was elevated at 442. They then did a lung scan to rule out a pulmonary embolism. Those results were negative as well. The chest pains resolved around 11 am. Since they ruled out the blood clot and nothing was found to be wrong with her heart, she was sent home. They figured that she maybe had an anxiety attack or heart palpations. I took her to her pediatrician the next day and she was cleared there as well.

The headache (and fatigue) continued Monday and Tuesday as well. But by that Tuesday afternoon 6/8, she was complaining that her vision was impaired.  She couldn&#39;t see things out of the right corner of her right eye. Example, when she looked at my face she could only see the left half, not the right half. When she looked down at her phone, some numbers on the right side of the screen seemed to be missing from her field of view. Additionally, she said she was having a hard time spelling easy words (ex. &#34;because&#34;) and was processing information really slowly when reading -- she noticed she was going much slower than normal.

Docusate for constipation on Friday and she went twice but she told me yesterday that she hasn&#39;t gone again since that time. Has not received more than the one dosage of the Docusate. Dr. gave her sublingual med for throwing up but we haven&#39;t filled it as her nausea is gone. She says her stomach doesn&#39;t hurt and she doesn&#39;t feel nauseous - she just hasn&#39;t been able to have a BM again.

She said her throat felt swollen.  A couple hours after a double dose of benadryl and ice packs she began to improve.   4th day she was much better. We spoke with her allergist over the phone, and he said it was reasonable to chalk the reaction up to extra stress on her body due to the vaccine/her bodies response to the vaccine. We only did half her peanut dose. 5th day she was normal.

                                                Within 15-20 seconds of receiving the injection, my daughter who has NO history of seizures or health issues of any kind, , began having seizures. Her skin color becamee gray, her lips turned blue. The seizure last approximately 20 seconds and when she came out of it she was able to breathe but said her throat felt funny, scratchy, smaller - but she was still able to breathe. She was nauseous, head hurt and was very disoriented for approximately 20-30 minutes. The pharmacist called 911. 911 arrived and took her blood, did a multitude to tests which all came out ok. We opted not to take her to the hospital as she was breathing ok, and her color was returning.

Her eyes rolled into the back of her head; she then leaned over the right arm of the chair.  Her body stiffened next. I held her head and body with the help of a colleague.  This happened for about 10 seconds, then she woke up and snatched her mask off with a confused look on her face.  We asked her questions to see if she was aware. She was, then she went back out falling over to the side.  I called 911. When she awakened the second time after about 7-10 seconds her face turned pale.  We then moved her to the floor and propped her feet up.  Patient said she was nervous and felt like she had to use the restroom.  Her skin was clamy; patient said clamy skin is nothing new for her.  The fire truck and ambulance arrived on scene.  The workers began to assess patient.  Vitals were good. She did not go in the ambulance, but stated her vision were blurry.  She went home with grandparents.

                                                Patient while sitting in the post-vaccination are, fainted in her chair. Upon my immediate arrival, I tapped the patient and she was coming to consciousness. Patient upon awakening, felt nauseous and wanted to vomit, but barely did. I gave the patient water and sports drink and the patient was regaining normalcy. Both the patient and her guardian reported that she did not eat or drink anything prior to coming to the vaccine appointment and that she was very nervous and worried prior. Patient denied history of fainting. I recommended to have the patient sit for at least another 15-20 minutes, but the parent stated his daughter was fine and decided to leave.

She then alternated between feeling hot and cold and seeing &#34;blurry spots&#34;. I noticed her lips turning white and she said she needed to lie down. I got her water and ice packs since she was sweating. We sat on the floor for about 10 minutes, then she was able to move to a chair for another 5-10minutes and then left the facility. Mom reports that she has been lethargic and napping most of the day. Patient ate a few cheez-its for breakfast and reports that she did not get a good nights sleep last night.

She was sitting up in a chair during this time, with her mom holding her up.  She came to, the about 20 seconds later, she passed out again for another 10 seconds.  She came to, and was given some water to drink, but 20 seconds after that she threw up the water.  I took her blood pressure, and it was 60/40, with a pulse of 60.  She was very pale.  After resting in the chair and taking deep breaths, her color returned and she felt much better.  she also said her vision wasn&#39;t blurry anymore.  Ten minutes later, she left with her mom, feeling ok.  She was very anxious about getting the shot, and told me she had passed out in the pass after giving blood.

Her father said she was nervous/anxious to get this vaccine. Patient got the vaccine first, then sat in the observation chair while her father got his vaccine. While her father got the vaccine, I checked on her and she said she felt a little dizzy. Patient agreed to put paper towel on back of neck and wrists. As soon as her father finished his vaccine, we moved her to the immunization room to monitor her (such as blood pressure - readings given to paramedics.) Her heart rate was a little high (I believe 107), then  went back to normal. However then her blood pressure started getting lower (around 80/40s) and began feeling worse. Laid patient down with feet elevated and called 911. By the time ambulance arrived, her blood pressure was starting  to improve. Her father agreed with ambulance to bring her in to get checked out.

She was out for 2minutes at the most Mother got her up and made her drink a lot of water.  She continued to feel bad. Temp was close to 102.  Around 5pm that evening she was feeling better.  So this report is because of a syncopal episode about 19 1/2 hours after the Covid Pfizer vaccine #2.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced feeling kind of dizzy and shaky and it could be anxiety from actually getting it on 21May2021. Patient was feeling kind of dizzy and shaky. Reporter just noticed that this was not kind of listed under the severe allergies but patient does not seem to having allergic reaction.

Reporter said she gave patient food to see if she needed to eat. The outcome of events were unknown.

                                                Patient was nervous and teary eyed in the vaccination booth, prior to administrating.  She is a minor so her Father accompanied her.  We were in the booth for a few minutes where I was trying to get her to relax and breathe.  Her father was there the entire time. I gave the Pfizer vaccine and she stated &#34;that was it?&#34;  She seemed ok upon leaving the booth.  Her and her Father sat in the observation area directly in front of the pharmacy. About 5 minutes passed when her Father tapped on the window.  Went out to check on the patient and she was pale and little disoriented.  She ended up throwing up as well. We gave her a bag so she wouldn&#39;t have to stand up and could stay near her father, to prevent a fall. ?We gave her a cold compress and a water and had her stay for 30 minutes.  By the time she left, she had her color back and was able to say that she was feeling much better.  Her father was not surprised that she had a reaction like this and stated that she usually has form of reaction like to vaccines.  She was ok by the time she left and they both stated they&#39;d be back for the second vaccine.

                                                Experienced lump formed in middle to base of throat and right cheek became swollen. Lump in throat was the size of a quarter but did not block her airway passage. Doctor checked her airway passage, heart, and pulse. Took one Zyrtec administered by mom, because she is allergic to Benadryl. The Zyrtec was given around 2:45 PM. After 10 minutes the lump in middle to base of her throat and right cheek did not reduce in size. She was able to drink water and her mom,  and gave her another Zyrtec pill. This is an emergency plan for provided by her allergy doctor. This was an emergency event for her with all of her known allergies. After 20 minutes, she began to feel the lump in her throat slowly decrease in size. She was being monitored by Dr. and a Nurse, and additional nurses on staff. Dr. continued to check her heart, airway passage, and pulse. As the lump continued to reduce in size after 45 minutes to 1 hour after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, she was able to get up and walk around with a pulse monitor on her finger to monitor her heart rate and breathing. She did not have any concerns while walking nor while sitting in the office and was being watched by the staff. In the very beginning after giving her the Zyrtec she need to keep her mask off to ensure her breathing stayed under control. We were able to leave  and did not need the EpiPen administered by staff nor by her mother. We were able to leave around 3:45PM. We received follow up calls from the Nurse at 4:54 PM and from Dr. around 5:30 PM to check on her. At 11:00 PM I did give her 1 Zyrtec before bed. I woke her up on June 17th at 6:15 AM and asked her to drink some water. After drinking water she noticed she had a lump in her throat. Her mom gave her another Zyrtec. She was watched closely  throughout the remaining week and was in contact with her doctors office. Patient also experienced pain in her throat due to all the swelling/inflammation. Since receiving the vaccine, patient has noticed an increased difficulty in wearing her mask. This did occur prior to receiving the vaccine.

                                                After vaccination, patient stood up and walked around the room. She started bouncing and acting a little nervous. I asked if she was feeling light headed woozy, she said a little bit. I sat her back in the chair. After about 30 seconds she fell sideways to the arm of the chair then slouched forward. I caught her before she went all the way to the floor and leaned her back into the chair, she then seized for approximately 3-5 seconds. Grandpa (legal guardian) was in the room and helped me get her to the floor where she came out for a few seconds and opened her eyes for 5-10 seconds passed out again then seized again for 3-5 seconds. She then woke up on the floor and was alert and looking around.  She was very pale, I elevated her feet for a while and had her lay on the floor for 7-10 minutes.  I then had her sit up on the floor and provided a bottle of water and put cold compress on the back of her neck.  She stayed seated on the floor for about 5-7 minutes before I had her move to the chair to sit again with back against the back of the chair. She continued to sit there sipping water and talking for 7 minutes or so. Learned at this point that patient had not eaten breakfast and has passed out after a vaccination in the past (had not marked on the intake form). After 7 minutes or so, had the patient try to stand. She said her legs were wobbly, so I had her sit back down for several more minutes. Her coloring was much better at this point.  After another several minutes we tried standing again and she felt better at that point. Had her just stand in the room for about 3 minutes before walking to the waiting room. Had her then sit in the waiting room for 5 minutes then she walked out with grandpa. They were going to get breakfast. Grandpa was going to call MD to discuss the events and follow up as necessary as well as to discuss plan going forward concerning the second dose.

She was experiencing brain fog and not able to focus on her school work. She was worried about not being able to finish up the school year. We figured it was just &#34;burnout&#34;, but knew this was strange behavior for PT who is usually very focused and has no problem getting good grades. We let her get the 2nd vaccine on June 18th. About 10 days later, PT reported feeling like her mind was racing and she could not sleep for 5 nights. She was very anxious and having panic attacks. On July 4th, PT came to us and told us, &#34;the only way to stop the thoughts is to hurt myself.&#34; We immediately took PT to the  Hospital ER. We have NEVER seen PT like this and she has NEVER had thoughts like this. She was talking to herself, making strange body movements and this frightening behavior came out of nowhere. They kept her overnight and sent her home with referrals to other doctors. She is still having suicidal thoughts and cannot function. We have had to cancel all trips, summer camps and check her out of soccer for the next month. There is no way she is going to be able to go to anything.

She had no past experiences or allergies that would be a cause for concern. After administration she expressed confidence that she felt fine. She went to the waiting area to wait 15 minutes prior to exiting the pharmacy. Within 5 minutes her mother notified the pharmacist that she passed out. Upon examination, she indeed fainted while sitting in a chair. The pharmacist called 911 while an intern when to check her vitals. Within 30 seconds, the patient awoke and was a little confused but felt better. Paramedics came and she was checked out and sent home with her mother.

She said she has her menstrual cycle and it has never been this bad. She said she didn&#39;t get it last month at all. Prior to this, she said her cycles were normal. She also had pain in her thighs and trouble breathing which resulted in her needing her rescue inhaler.  At this time she has been given ibuprofen and is resting with a heating pad. I as pts. mom am concerned that this may be related to vaccine.

Symptoms have continued still, and not getting better.  We have been to urgent care, ED, pediatrician, and going to cardiologist soon.  Now has 2 inhalers and OTC pain meds.  I firmly believe the problems are connected to covid vaccine.

                                                First symptom was dizziness and nausea. Then, immediately began sweating profusely . Then began seeing spots that distorted her vision. Immediate pain in the ears, which felt as is the ears were very swollen and inflamed. It was difficult to talk because talking caused pain in the ears. Severe headache. Obviously her anxiety level escalated.   We immediately found wet paper towels to place on her forehead and back of the neck to cool her. I found a hair tie and tied her hair up off her neck to keep her as cool as possible. She was sweating so much she soaked her t-shirt and was pouring sweat down her face, neck and body. We also moved patient from the chair, and placed her on the floor of the pharmacy, leaning against the wall with her legs stretched out.  As a type 1 diabetic, the obvious concern was blood sugar during this reaction. Patient wears an insulin pump and Dexcom continuous glucose monitor. I was able to read her blood sugar levels during all the reaction time. Her blood sugar level spiked up. It then began to drop after a few minutes. I had an apple juice, and gave her the 15 carb apple juice.

Medical work up has been thorough and has resulted negatively, including blood work, UDS, CT Head. She has remained slightly tachycardic, though she has also been moving continuously for several hours. Her physical exam is notable for several indicators of psychogenic origin, including demonstrating variability in tremor frequency (head, legs and arms vacillating it variable rates over time), distractability from motor tasks (head or arms stop shaking when asked to focus on moving her legs, for example). Her speech has also been affected, but this is also variable and she is at times using only 1 word sentences and other times responding more completely. Certainly she may have suffered a psychological stress today as she is fearful of needles and has a history of vasovagal response and her mother notes recent overwhelm with school performance, though this is not unusual for her. If medical work up continues to be negative, it may be reasonable to conclude she is suffering a conversion disorder  &#34;FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Conversion reaction after a Covid 19 vaccine.

                                                acute pancreatitis ; Pt awoke at 4 AM day after her COVID vaccine with abdominal pain. Pain abided some and she was able to fall back asleep.  When she woke up in the morning she had crampy pain in the epigastric abdominal area.  Pain is constant, worsened some with laying down and improved with sitting up.  She feels like she has some mild difficulty breathing when she is lying flat.  She has not been able to eat much because eating makes her feel like her stomach is going to explode.  She is barely keeping down much water due to pain. She denies any nausea or vomiting.

Numbness similar to the numb feeling from Novacaine. By next morning, entire body was numb from toes to scalp. Full body numbness for 3-4 days, then both arms started to feel more normal, then in the next 2-3 days remaining body parts started to come back to normal, except for the scalp. After another week, the numbness faded and felt normal again. After the numbness subsided, started having difficulty falling asleep, taking up to 3-4 hours to fall asleep. Still having difficulty now falling asleep. Not sure if the sleep issues are vaccine related.

I check the neck area, no swelling, and asked if she was breathing fine, and patient was ok. I offered to give epi pen in case she is allergic to any, but refused. EMS showed 2 minutes later and took over.

                                                Client received dose 1 of the COVID19 Pfizer vaccine (Lot# EW0187 Exp 08/31/21) at 13:32 from RN1.  RN1 reported that within 5 seconds of receiving the vaccine, the client reported she felt dizzy and experienced a syncopal episode for 2-3 seconds.  As the syncopal episode was occurring, ancillary staff, requested RN2 radio for a Lead Nurse &amp; EMT.  At 13:34 Lead RN arrived at station 6, radioed for an EMT, and observed client sitting up in the vaccination chair being held by her mother and RN1.  Lead RN noted client?s head was down with her eyes open, exhibiting pallor and was diaphoretic.  Lead RN asked client her name and how she was feeling.  Client did not respond.  Co-Lead RN entered the room at 13:35. RN1, Lead RN, Co-Lead RN, and client?s mother guided client to the floor, laid her in a supine position, lifting her legs and feet on a chair.  Co-Lead RN removed client?s mask, continued to ask client her name.  Within 2-3 seconds of repositioning client, she became responsive and alert &amp; oriented to person, place, time, and event.  Client also immediately stated, ?I?m fine.?  EMT1, EMT2, and EMT3 came to the station at 13:36 with a zero-gravity chair.  The EMTs assisted client into the zero-gravity chair.  Client?s mother stated client has no underlying health conditions, no allergies, and that birth control is the only medication the client takes.  The client confirmed this by nodding her head in agreeance.  EMT2 gave client a bottle of water and the client immediately started drinking the water.  Lead RN asked client if she had eaten or drank anything today.  Client?s mother stated she did not realize her daughter had not eaten or drank anything prior to coming to get vaccinated.  Client stated she was given a granola bar downstairs at check-in and ate it before receiving the vaccine.  At 13:45 EMT1 took vitals.  Both EMT1 &amp; EMT2 were unable to obtain client?s blood pressure (HR:61, O2Sat:  97%).  Lead RN asked client and her mother what the client?s normal blood pressure is.  Client and her mother did not know, and client?s mother indicated that the client is an athlete in good shape.  At 13:48, EMT3 took client?s blood pressure, which was 100/60.  Client?s mother stated client was anxious about being vaccinated and has fainted when anxious in the past, but the last time was around 5 years ago.  Client stated she was feeling better and no longer feeling dizzy.  Client stated she just ?feels hot.?  Lead RN brought client an ice pack to put behind her neck and damp paper towels to wipe her face with.  At 13:59 EMT3 took client?s vitals (BP:  118/70, HR: 65, O2Sat 98%).  Lead RN observed that client?s color was returning to her face and client was less diaphoretic.  Client finished her bottled water and was given another by EMT2, which she started drinking.  Lead RN asked client if she felt she could stand up.  Client stood up and stated she was ?feeling fine.?  At 14:05 all 3 EMTs escorted client and her mother to the observation room where she was monitored for an additional 30 minutes.  At 14:30 Lead RN went to the observation room where EMT1was taking client?s vitals (BP:  110/70, HR: 60, SPO2 Sat 98%).  Lead RN observed that client?s color had fully returned, and client was no longer diaphoretic.  Client stated she ?felt fine? and was hungry.  Client?s mother stated she would take client to get something to eat and EMT2 gave client an additional snack that client took with her when she left.  Client and her mother left at 14:30. Client was walking with a steady gait when she exited the building.

I came to assist and saw the patient looked pale and disoriented. We had her sit down and then lie on the ground with her feet elevated. 911 was called. The patient began to recover and said she didn&#39;t remember the past few minutes. EMS arrived and took her blood pressure which was 110/80. Eventually the patient felt well enough to sit up and eat some chicken and drink cold water.

On July 10th, they found her disoriented, barefoot, wandering the neighborhood in middle of the night near my parent&#39;s home. She was staying with them this weekend. I was worried she took &#39;shrooms based on behavior, but they don&#39;t test for psylocybin in standard ER drug panels. She came up negative for drugs like THC, meth, and cocaine.

She was also sweating and pale. She said that she felt like she was about to pass out and that she couldn&#39;t see. She also said she couldn&#39;t focus, that she was seeing stars, and everything looked black. My husband and I told her to lay down on the couch. We gave her a rag to put on her head to cool her down and we got her some water to drink. She said she had a headache and we gave her some Tylenol.
