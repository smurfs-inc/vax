Patient was given 10 ml of Benadryl 12.5 mg /5 ml liquid immediately. After 5 minutes taking Benadryl, patient  complained that she felt that her physical condition is getting worse; she was anxious. I decided to call 911  based on her existing medical condition. The 911 team arrived within 10 minutes and checked her health condition. Patient recovered and went home safe.

Pt then reported that she lost her vision- everything turned black.  I had to rush to her to catch her- she had loss of consciousness for about a minute.  She was very pale- lips turned blue.  She had a pulse the whole time, BP was 117/60- when I checked it about 5 min later.  Her temperature on a ear thermometer was 99.7.   After she awoke,  she was still very dizzy and stayed in bed most of the day.  5/17/21 AM- she woke up for school 0600- and was feeling better.  No more dizziness, color was back in her cheeks, was able to eat and left for school.
