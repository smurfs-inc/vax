Over night contracted a fever, by the time I was able to get up to measure it (around 3:45 AM) it was 99.5 degrees, and broke by 5 AM. Had fever dreams prior to waking around 3 AM, and had chills for the remainder of the night. Felt  achy and a little unsteady for the rest of the day but was fully recovered by 12/31

                                                Had me wait for 15 minutes after vaccine and started having a redness in neck and was really itchy; whole body big time itchy. My chest - shortness of breath. Gave me a shot of benydryl  - 25 mg in my right arm and I went home and itching still didn&#39;t go away and I took pill of benydryl. Chills next day; super cold; headache; tired - and I couldn&#39;t think straight. Nothing was registering in my head with training at work - felt slow. Went home from took more benydryl. Next morning - pins and needles in back of my head. Went to urgent care (Riverside Urgent Care) and they gave me gave me Vexamethasone - shot it up in my butt and every symptom went away after that shot and I was okay after that.Itching went away after that. Felt weak for about a week afterwards. Went and had second shot yesterday 1/10/2021. They gave me medication with vaccine so I wouldn&#39;t get reaction this time. Gave me liquid 25 benydryl beforehand and had me wait 15 mintues and after 15 min they gave me the second dose of vaccine after the injection and they had me wait for 30 minutes. Right away I started getting itchy and they gave me pill form( 2 pills) of Vexamethsone and itching slowly stopped and they sent me home after an hour. Itching slowly went away - later that day. And today I&#39;m okay.

                                                12 hours after administration, woken up from sleep by tingling, throbbing in lower legs. Described as a nerve and muscle ache/throb, or &#34;growing pains&#34;/RLS symptoms. Put on compression socks which helped, but still too uncomfortable to sleep. Was able to sleep after taking ibuprofen 800mg and drinking water. 6 hours after the ibuprofen was administered, pain returned in lower legs as well as neck/ears  with body temperature swings (cold, teeth chattering to sweating uncontrollably in a few minutes). After 1 hour of trying to sleep but failing, put compression socks back on. Temperature rose to 100-100.2 F, chills causing whole body to shake under multiple blankets. Tingling/muscle pains extremely uncomfortable and unable to rest, took another ibuprofen 800mg and water and was able to sleep. Tingling and muscle pains have continued as soon as ibuprofen wears off and come back more intense each time, most notably in the lower legs and near ears/neck and elbow of arm administered in (similar to &#34;tennis elbow,&#34; assumed to be provoked by inflammation, happened with first dose).

This persisted throughout the night and I did not sleep. Took 1000 mg of Acetaminophen at 5:30 and slept until 7 AM. By 8 AM, my temperature was back down to 98 F. Took 500 mg of Acetaminophen at 10 AM with food. Headache, muscle pain, and joint pain persisted. Moderate to severe chest pain began 15 mins after eating at 4 PM. Waited 30 mins to see if it resolved; it did not. Went to the urgent care. Chest x-ray and EKG was performed, no issues found. Was diagnosed with costochondritis and was given a steroid shot and ibuprofen,  which reduced the pain significantly within 30 mins later.

Headache and body aches have worsened in severity. Unable to work for the morning but was able to go in the afternoon for a short time period. Lower body aches are particularly severe. Fatigue is noticeable. Mental health conditions have worsened but that may be due to lack of sleep.  30 hours following the vaccine: chills, nausea, and dizziness have dissipated completely. They were slowly improving throughout the day. Body aches and headache still severe but lessened with marijuana use.  48 hours following the vaccine: all symptom seemed to have subsided during the night. Sleep was much better quality. Only remaining symptom is an ache on the right side of my chest towards my ribs.

For about 36 hours, it ran 100-130&#39;s; Dehydration; Feeling fatigued/Excessive fatigue; Had some general arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ 1686, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 08Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ 1685, unknown expiration) via intramuscular in right arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as needed and unspecified birth control. The patient has no known allergies. The patient started feeling fatigued about 1900 hours (07:00 PM) on 08Jan2021 and only had some general arm soreness. She woke up on 09Jan2021, with serious chills to the point of physical shaking; nausea started soon after and around 0300, began vomiting and dry heaving. The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the event &#34;having sweats&#34; was unknown, while the patient is recovering for the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported serious chill was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

                                                Within 24 hours of getting my 2nd COVID vaccine, I began to feel weak and achy. My neck and face got really hot while the rest of my body stayed cold. A small headache began to turn into a migraine. During the night, my body began to hurt beyond achy causing me to toss and turn. When I woke up in the morning, I couldn&#39;t stand even the littlest of pressure placed on my body. For example, my cat jumped on my leg and it felt like someone wacked me with a baseball bat because of how sensitive my body was. The only treatment used for myself during this time was Tylenol. It helped with the head aches. Overall, it took me about three nights to actually feel ok again.

I did not improve when I woke up on 01/25.  The chills and myalgia worsened and were complicated by vomiting without blood.  I called off sick from work and took 3 Aleve tablets.  I went back to sleep with improvement in symptoms approximately 6 hours later, with only mild myalgias and a very sore L. arm.  Symptoms completely resolved by the morning of 01/26.

                                                About 2 minutes after injection, I had a sudden rush of warmth throughout my body starting in my abdomen then causing my pulse to feel like it was pounding out of my neck. Got light headed. EMS came and my blood pressure raised to 155/95 and my pulse was up in the 150s and I was shaking.  Started to go down but felt crappy for over 2 hours. Happened again 30seconds after the second injection. Pulse up to almost 160. 02 stats stayed normal. Post first injection had sore arm and lots of fatigue and brain fog. Following the second injection 12 hours post started having nausea, and diarrhea. Continued to have joint pain, muscle aches, headaches for days, and my lymph nodes swelled up and were extremely painful.

                                                I am a pharmacist for pharmacy and received my first dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine while at work by another pharmacist.  Vaccine given around 2:15 PM on 2/2/21  Less than 5 minutes after vaccine - arm tingling at site of injection, arm tingling spread from injection site to fingers, tingling and pins/needles traveled through underarm area and moved across left side of chest, slight chest pain on left side, whole body started tingling, dizziness, racing heart. While experiencing all of these symptoms, I sat on the ground, took two tablets of 25mg Benadryl, drank water, and tried to breath steady to make dizziness go away. Working in this healthcare setting, I was aware I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and was prepared with an epi-pen in case of any severe anaphylaxis shock - I did NOT have to use the epi-pen.    Less than 15 minutes after vaccine - the chest pain, arm pins/needles stopped, I felt lightheaded still, another co-worker checked my blood pressure which had risen to 178/120 and pulse of 120.   About 1 hour after vaccine - still felt light headed, blood pressure still elevated at 158/107, pulse of 107.   Around 5:45 PM - After consulting personal friend physicians, I was instructed to go to ER and have an EKG of my heart since my blood pressure and pulse had spiked so high and suddenly. I was able to find coverage at work so that I could leave my shift and get a ride to the emergency room.   After 6 PM (admitted into ER) - upon admission blood pressure of 176/117 and pulse of 113

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular in left deltoid on 20Jan2021 11:00 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunisation. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first dose yesterday at 11:00am. She was talking to someone and all of a sudden she got throat to neck pain that was intense that lasted two minutes on 21Jan2021. It has been about 10-15minutes since and if she hold her neck straight she is fine, but if she looks up it hurts. She can breathe fine. It hurts to swallow all of a sudden on 21Jan2021. Asking if it is normal to experience this. She had a low grade fever/low grade temp of 99.4, body aches, and a headache that started today 21Jan2021. She received Tylenol as treatment. States she is a nurse and she is tired. Her head feels fuzzy, she has not taken her temperature recently and it still hurts to swallow. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Relatedness of drug to events from reporter for throat and neck pain, hurts to swallow, low grade fever, headache, body aches was reported as related. Reporter seriousness for throat and neck pain and hurts to swallow was medically significant. Event outcome of throat and neck pain was recovered, of hurts to swallow was not recovered, of others was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were likely causally related to the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  However, it is worth noting that the reporter/user of the vaccine was nurse, and her tiredness from job could have confounded with the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 14:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the workplace clinic. Relevant medical history included COVID-19, which was diagnosed prior to vaccination and migraines (before). The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included melatonin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 30Dec2020 at 15:45 or 1 hour after the vaccine injection, the patient had an aura like a bad migraine and she had bright spotty vision in the peripheral right field for 15-20 minutes; the patient has had migraines before, but they&#39;re not common for her. Two hours after the vaccine, on 30Dec2020 at 16:45, the patient had mental confusion and an inability to speak; she tried to say things to her husband and it was a jumbled, meaningless string of words. She also felt very cold and she had tingling around the mouth. Her husband thought she was having a stroke and called 911 on 30Dec2020. All her vitals were stable, and within 10 minutes she could speak again. On 30Dec2020, the patient&#39;s electrocardiogram (EKG) showed peaked T waves, common with dehydration and high potassium. She was encouraged to go to the emergency room (ER). Instead of taking the ambulance, she drove herself several hours later. The patient wanted someone to tell her it wasn&#39;t a stroke. After a brief neurological exam on 30Dec2020, the doctor said it was likely a severe migraine and wrote the reason for her visit as a vaccine reaction. This took place in the late evening to early morning, and she missed one day of work. The events did result in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient did not receive any treatment for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from all the events on 31Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event stroke with BNt162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The following days after I was okay, with a sore throat only occurring in the evening after 4pm, along with vertigo and slight disorientation for approximately 8 days. Starting Saturday, 02/13 around 8pm I noticed a tingling sensation in my right middle finger, that continued to Sunday and through to today. As of this morning, 02/15, I still have the nerve pain in my finger that is now spreading to the palm of my hand.

It is still hurting.; Tenderness; Feeling faint/Felt dizzy; Some trouble breathing; disoriented; Fatigue; Chills; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information Team. A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 28Jan2021 at 16:55 (reported as 4:55 PM) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. It was given at a vaccination clinic. The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks and had no adverse events following prior vaccinations and that was why she thought she would be fine. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included anxiety, peanut allergy, tree nut allergy, and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. Family history included her dad has heart disease and her half sister has heart disease. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization. The patient stated, &#34;You kind of feel yucky after the flu vaccine, but she has never had this with a flu shot.&#34; The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t had a flu shot in years. The patient asked if arm swelling was a normal occurrence after vaccination and if side effects can last for 4 days. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan and afterwards experienced, arm swelling, and tenderness that has last for 4 days. She also reported experiencing feeling faint, high blood pressure of 150/100 and some trouble breathing on an unspecified date and nausea. The patient further reported that she was calling because she got her first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine and she was curious if this was normal and if she needs to go see her doctor and she wants to report the symptoms. After she got the injection she felt super faint and got really high blood pressure on an unspecified date. She was not sure if it was because she had anxiety, but she had trouble breathing on an unspecified date. She got nauseated afterwards. Her arm swelled up really big and the swelling has stayed there for four days. Her arm was still swollen on an unspecified date. She has allergies and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. She was still nauseated and feels super tired. The patient asked how long do the symptoms last. The patient&#39;s weight was reported between 122 to 123 pounds. The patient clarified that the nausea started 15 minutes after she got the shot on 28Jan2021. The nausea has lasted through this. She got chills the next day (29Jan2021) after the shot. She has felt super fatigue. The swelling has gone down, but it was still swollen. It was still hurting. She has no idea if that was normal. She also felt dizzy and disoriented after getting the shot. She was not sure if it was because her blood pressure was so high. It was high for her because her blood pressure was normally low. She thinks her blood pressure 150/100 after she got the vaccine. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

My column also hurted a lot and I had a severe headache. It?s been almost 3 weeks since vaccination and I?ve been to several doctors and the emergency room and right now they have me taking B12, Neurontin and Cortisone. During my second week after the vaccine both my legs started feeling heavy to the point where there are days where I can?t feel them or they feel extremely heavy to move, my column still hurts till this date. Tomorrow I have another doctors appointment in order to continue investigating what I have. I?m still waiting for an official diagnosis which is why I can?t give an official answer for item 21 (I still don?t know if the damages will be permanent). Due to this situation I haven?t been able to go to work.

                                                Stayed 30 minutes after vaccine at vaccination clinic to be safe in case of a reaction. About 5 minutes after leaving 11:30 I could taste the vaccine in my mouth. I immediately felt intense sharp tingling in my lower lip, it felt hot and swollen (upper lip never had a reaction). I instantly felt a lump in my throat and had a hard time swallowing. I started with chest pain that resolved itself in a minute or two. A few minutes later a family member noticed my face was red and flushed and said I looked like I had a sun burn. Swelling in throat resolved within an hour. Lip never visually looked swollen but I could feel the tightness, burning and tingling that resolved within the hour. Redness on face resolved within a couple hours. Had tiny blisters about 3 show up above upper lip I still have them the next day with a couple more but they aren&#39;t causing problems. My airway was never blocked I never had a hard time breathing. I did have a sore throat this morning March 25 day after vaccine. All other symptoms seem normal.

I went through several tampons in a day for about a week til my period abruptly stopped on April 26, 2020.  It started about 2 hours after the vaccination. I usually don&#39;t cramp but I was having problems sleeping because of how bad it got. I was also more bloated than my usual cycles. I dealt with extreme fatigue, I slept a lot that week and I did the bare minimum that week at work (which is unusual for me).  I also don&#39;t usually have mood swings but I felt like my hormones were a bit intense to the point I kept snapping at people even though I like to think of myself as level-headed.

A 26-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 05Feb2021 11:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Patient concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, patient has been extremely dizzy, lethargic, and has a headache to the back of her neck to her head, not able to think straight and not be able to move around. Reporter said that patient said that the dizziness is getting worse, and patient did try to work one day last week, then tried again, and couldn&#39;t, reporter would say it is getting worse. Reporter mentioned that she gave her daughter a 24 hours allergy pill, nasal spray, and some over the counter Bonine, but all it did was put her to sleep. 24 hours allergy pill was clarified to being generic Value Med Allergy Relief, the ingredient Cetirizine 10mg. UPC: 68925-3, LOT S200197, EXP Oct2021. Reporter also mentioned that Bonine was also over the counter, with LOT 173146C, EXP August 2019.

Reporter mentioned that the generic nasal spray is over the counter Mometasone furoate made by Apotex Corporation. LOT: RG4324, EXP: June 2021. Reporter mentioned that she doesn&#39;t know what to do for her, and she was supposed to see her doctor today, but due to the snowstorm her appointment was cancelled until tomorrow, the ENT. Reporter mentioned that the doctor said that there was nothing they could do for dizziness. Reporter also mentioned that her daughter got both doses of the vaccine, and it was the second one that really made her sick. Reporter thought that it is serious because her daughter was not getting better and she was in tears because patient does not feel good, and she did not know what was wrong with patient. Reporter wanted to know whether this is something that has been reported or that they had heard of happening before. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded. However, the concomitant medication of allergy pill may provide a plausible alternative explanation for the events.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

It wasa very scary experience for me. This lasted about 15 or 20 minutes I&#39;m guessing (hard to say for sure because I was too worked up to watch the clock) but I ended up making myself fall back asleep. The next day January 8th I had diarrhea multiple times in theafternoon and felt strange, somewhat lightheaded and some what felt like anxiety.

On 05Jan2021, she felt a lot better, but still with mild body aches. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. She was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The vaccine was received in a hospital. No other vaccines were given in four weeks. The outcome of the events was not recovered for body aches, and recovering for the other events.

I woke up in the middle of the night feeling achy and unwell. When I woke up in the morning I was extremely fatigued and my eyes were itchy and puffy.

                                                Received shot Wednesday night, developed arm soreness and mild flu like symptoms on left side of my body and facial paresthesias on the left side of my face. Twelve hours later, after waking up those same symptoms were only on the right side of my body. Friday morning, mostly normal physically just with some overall fatigue. Friday afternoon I started to get hives on my chest and overnight into Saturday they were on my lower back, sides, and legs. I took 50 mg of Benadryl every 6-12 hours until Monday mid-day when Benadryl was not helping reduce the hives and so I had full body hives. I did try an drugstore cortisone cream which did not help.  Sought treatment at an urgent care as I was feeling anxious and could not control the itching. I and was diagnosed with likely allergic reaction to the covid-19 vaccine.

                                                I was asymptomatic for about 6.5 hours after the vaccine was given. At about 6pm on the day I received the vaccine I noticed some injection site tenderness, minimal swelling; has been present since. Symptoms are very mild. I started having chills and hot flashes intermittently, more hot flashes than chills, have been present since 6pm yesterday. About 9pm I had a headache, muscle aches, joint pain as well. I felt feverish but temperature was 98.6F. I also noticed some axial lymph node swelling as well on the Left side where I received the vaccine. Tender to touch, not too painful though. Since received the vaccine I have had intermittent dizzy spells as well all throughout the day.  I decided to go to sleep at 10:30pm and all night I tossed and turned with a headache and hot flashes. I woke up at 7:30am and was so stiff I could barely get out of bed. I called into work as I could not stand up without have dizziness. All day so far I have had dizziness upon standing, headache, myalgia, arthralgias, hot flashes/felt feverish, swollen axial lymph nodes and all I have wanted to do today is sleep. I took a nap and when I woke up I had been sleeping for 6 hours. I finally was able to get up and drink a 32ounce cup of water and take some ibuprofen. Ate some cereal. I still have a headache and dizziness upon standing that limit my ability to do normal daily functions.

I tried to bear down at home to decrease my heart rate but it continued to climb to 164 so after an hour of sustained Hr 126-164 I went to the emergency room where I had SVT. They did a valsalva maneuver 3 times and that made my heart rate go down to the 130s. It was then sinus tachycardia and stayed 120s-130s until about noon. Upon discharge at 3:30pm my resting heart rate was still 105 but it was determined to be a vaccine reaction as all other tests were normal.

The subject is in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred.  A 27-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies (Mar2006 and ongoing not taking any medications to treat) who received the first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 1) on 14Aug2020 at 10:34, second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 2) on 04Sep2020 at 09:27. The first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) on 23Dec2020 at 09:25, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) on 11Jan2021 at 09:48. All intramuscularly in the left deltoid as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included ethinyl-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (LOESTRIN) for birth control from May2014 and ongoing. There was no family medical history relevant to AE and no concomitant vaccine administered on the same date of investigational vaccine or other prior vaccine within four weeks.  The subject experienced neuropraxia of left arm on 11Jan2021 at 09:51 considered an important medical event requiring a visit to physician office.  The clinical course was the following: At 9:51, 3 minutes after receiving the second dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid, the subject complained of left arm numbness and tingling starting at elbow and extending to fingers, weakness, and a weak grip in that hand. She also reported a decreased range of motion on the left side including her arm, shoulder joint, elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal. Subject was afebrile with a normal vascular exam, no bruising, capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. No antipyretic medication was administered. The investigator requested the subject to return to site the following day. On 12Jan2021, the investigator noted some improvement to symptoms but the subject was unable to return to work for several days after event. An appointment was scheduled with a neurologist for 13Jan2021. The action taken with BNT162B2 for the event was not applicable. The clinical outcome of the event was recovering.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event neuropraxia of left arm was related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) and clinical trial procedure (vaccination administration in the left deltoid, investigator did consider the location was appropriate), but unrelated to first and second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) or concomitant medications. Per investigator, it was not likely that the event was related to the investigational product (IP) itself, however, that could not be 100% determined until neurologist had evaluated the subject.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  There is a reasonable possibility for the event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; to be related to the procedure of vaccine (BNT162B2) administration (needle trauma) rather than to the product administered. The event would not be considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162B2). The case will be reassessed upon reception of neurological advice.  Pfizer&#39;s safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 31-DEC-2020 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Nerve injury. Review of the database for the PT Nerve injury had the following results: 0 serious clinical trial cases and 1 non-clinical trial case.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committee and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I developed a migraine the evening of Jan 20 and began to experience chills before bed around 8-9pm.  At that time, my temperature was 99.8. I took my daily PM and migraine medication as prescribed, with no relief. Approximately 2 hours later I took the second dose of my migraine medication and rechecked my temp, it read 101.2. Around 8am Jan 21 I felt fatigued, still had a migraine, and my temp was up to 101.8. I took 2 tablets of Tylenol to reduce my fever. I did not go into work. Around 12pm my fever reached 102.1 and remained there throughout the day and I took Tylenol as described on the bottle. My migraine was greatly diminished by the evening and I did not take more migraine medication. On Jan 22 I again did not go into work. At approximately 9am my fever was at 101.2 and I called my primary care&#39;s office to seek advice about a COVID test. I did not request additional care, but the nurse recorded my symptoms and advised I was able to get tested even with the slight fever. At 2pm both fever and migraine were gone. I was tested on Jan 22 at 10am at a site, my results were negative.

                                                Headache with intermittent nausea throughout the day (4am until asleep at 10pm) that limited my daily activities. The headache was severe enough to wake me from sleeping at 4am, kept me from going back to sleep, made me feel intermittently nauseous, and was not completely relieved by a 650 mg dose of Tylenol taken in the afternoon.  I didn&#39;t feel well enough for my daily tasks, and took a 2 hour nap without headache relief.  I was 22 weeks 4 days pregnant the day of the headache/nausea, estimated due date 06/13/2021.  This is my first pregnancy that is considered low-risk with a healthy course so far (and regular prenatal care).  I had nausea the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, followed by about 6 weeks of daily mild headaches (weeks 12-18).  This headache was more severe than I had experienced thus far during my pregnancy, but still manageable.  This event was unusual as I have been feeling well since week 19 of pregnancy.

                                                At 11:00 pm I had an extremely intense seizure that caused me to convulse on the floor while arching my back. My partner thought I was dying as it was much more intense and extreme then normal. I am still having increased seizures in both pain and severity daily. Typically my seizures last 20 minutes and are from 4-5 in discomfort in pain out of ten. Now they are around 7, even a week later. The first severe seizure was a 10 level pain and diabling.   I also got severe swelling in my arm of the site, extreme pain in the my arm lasting four days, and two large cold sores. Typically my cold sores small and last for two days. Mine are still active and gave me a fat lip. I also have extreme fatigue but could be caused by the increased seizures and pain of them.   I been unable to perform my normal duties and responsibilities, which my seizures typically do not interfere with.

                                                27 year old female comes in 3/27/21 at 4:15pm to get Pfizer COVID vaccine. She has no family doctor. On her VAR form she states no seizure or history of seizure but does have reaction to HPV vaccine where her throat swelled up and her MD had to give her oxygen year ago. I asked about any other reactions to any other vaccinations and she said no and was willing to get this vaccine.  I told her to wait 30 minutes after vaccination to make sure no reaction. At 4:25pm her sister and mom tell us that patient is feeling week and dizzy and ask for water, I go out and check and she is pale and is ready to faint. Mother asks for orange juice which she takes a sip. I ask her if she has any health conditions like diabetes, seizures and they say no, then patient has what looks like a petit mal (absence) seizure. While sitting in the chair her eyes flutter, roll back she tenses up and her body freezes for about 20-30 seconds. I tell staff to call 911 and her sister says she&#39;s having &#34;another&#34; seizure. We don&#39;t move her but make sure she doesn&#39;t fall, once the seizure passes we move her to the ground to lie down. She regains consciousness and is coherent but confused. I do not give EpiPen because I witnessed a seizure. The fire and ambulance arrive to assist her and then her family mentions she did have seizures years ago. After 20 minutes or around 4:50pm she feels better and does not want to go to the hospital and walks out assisted by fire/ambulance staff. The next day I call her and she says she feels better and just has a sore arm and will find new doctor check her out.

This 27-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 10Mar2021 10:15 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;one number on there is EN and then she does not know if it is a G or 6 and then 204&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing anxiety from 2020, ongoing acid problems from 2020, high cholesterol levels from 2020 (she was not prescribed any medication and the advice given was just for diet and exercise), and ongoing gallbladder problem for years. There were no concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 10Mar2021, patient had eye puffiness in her left eye. Patient asked if it is safe to take the second dose. Her eyelid got puffy which began 30 minutes after having the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and it is not ongoing but resolved completely after a few minutes. She did not require treatment for the eye puffiness and the puffiness was mostly on her upper eyelid of her left eye. Patient stated that she does not know in terms of causality if the Pfizer COVID vaccine is related to the reported events and was worried because a week after she got the vaccine, she had other symptoms and was not sure if they are connected with the vaccine. She also reported that she does not think the eye puffiness itself is that serious but it is medically significant and the other symptoms she had were chest pain, chest heaviness, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are not ongoing anymore and began around Friday, 19Mar2021 and resolved after a couple of hours of when they began. For the chest pain, chest heaviness and abdominal pain, she just took an antacid Prilosec for treatment. She thought about going to the emergency room but also thought she was having an anxiety attack and was close to having to go to the emergency room that night. She did get pretty anxious easily and that probably exacerbated it. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events had eye puffiness in her left eye and eyelid got puffy/puffiness mostly on her upper eyelid of her left eye was recovered on 10Mar2021, of the event &#34;anxiety attack/she did get pretty anxious easily and that probably exacerbated it&#34; was unknown, and of the other events was recovered in Mar2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the contributory role of the suspect bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to reported events is possible.

                                                Woke with up chest, arm and jaw pain on 03/21/2021. Presented to the ED. Her initial EKG was negative for any acute changes but her troponin was elevated. Cardiology was consulted. Her echo was negative for cardiomyopathy or hypertrophy. But after her troponin continued to rise she was taken to the cath lab to look for ischemia. Her cardiac angiography was negative for obstructive disease, and coronary arteries were completely normal. Had low magnesium and potassium- so started on oral supplementation. Discharged on 03/22/2021 with nitroglycerin (which was not helpful and made her feel worse/nauseated) and to follow up with outpatient cardiac MRI and cardiology. This imaging revealed significant myocardial edema consistent with myocarditis.   04/01/2021 Per Cardiology: -Given that the patient had covid 19 back in November 2019 I believe she may have had a low yield subacute myocardial infection at that time that was somehow exacerbated by her 1st covid vaccine. Therefore, after some consideration and careful discussion I am advising against the 2nd vaccine at this time.  -No physical exercise for 6 months given her current myocarditis and family hx of sudden cardiac death -May trial PRN NSAIDS for pain relief -Recommend birth control and no pregnancy until at least after her follow up cMRI  -Follow up in 6 months with cMRI prior

                                                Day of administration around 2100 I started feeling a little off, got a little bit of a headache and felt warm. While sleeping I could feel that I had chills and felt very warm. Woke up at about 0200 to take my temperature. Felt dizzy when I got up, still had a headache and a fever of 101.0 (taken orally). Contacted a nurse triage line to ensure I can take t=Tylenol to bring the fever down and get rid of the headache. She said yes, which is when I took 500mg Extra Strength Tylenol rapid release. Continued to feel not so well, and broke my fever around 0630 timeframe. Once I woke up around 0900 (day after administration) still felt a little warm  (99.5)  and a mild headache. Will keep an eye on any other adverse reactions.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after the vaccine administration, I started getting symptoms that started mild and became severe including: headache, dry cough with chest pressure, dizziness/lightheaded,  joint pain, body aches, fatigue, and chills. At 5:30 pm I started getting a fever, that started at 100.5 then increased to 103.3 by 8:30 pm. I was also nauseous and vomited once.  I was tested the next morning for influenza and COVID and was negative. My fever came back down to 98.8 around 12 pm the next day. Overall, symptoms lasted approximately 30 hours after the vaccine was administered.  I was out of work the following day after the vaccine. Now, 2 days after the vaccine I am just mildly fatigued with a dry cough left.

That night I woke up with moderate body aches and chills and a dull headache, no fever. The next morning, I awoke feeling very fatigued, severe muscle/body aches, headache and chills, still no fever. I slept most of the day. Extra strength Tylenol helped tremendously with the body aches. I was symptom free the morning of 1/15/2021. I was scheduled to work the day after my vaccination and was unable to due to the symptoms described.  I had no adverse reactions with my first dose.  I am a nursing mother and for the first and second doses, I noticed no side effects or any concerns with my child or milk supply.

She had proactively taken diphenhydramine following the reaction to her first dose.  Around 08:40 AM,  she began to feel tightening in her throat and some heaviness in her chest. She was evaluated by a nurse who took her blood pressure (normal), however, her heart rate was elevated (noted this could be that she was nervous following initial reaction and repeat tightness in throat).  Around 08:55AM, she began to feel like her tongue was swelling and that she had a &#34;bubble&#34; on the top of her throat. She was taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She was given hydroxyzine, famotidine, and dexamethasone in the ED and was discharged and felt stable.  She reported a continued odd sensation in her throat the evening of the second vaccination.  This feeling resolved the next day, and she reports no additional side effects from the vaccine.   Of note, patient had experienced a similar reaction following her first vaccination (E-number 261589)

                                                My arm started to hurt , tingled and then turned into feeling very heavy as soon as injection was admitted. I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

                                                After my 2nd dose administration, I sat in an observation tent with 4 resident doctors. This is protocol at my hospital to assess for any adverse reactios. About 10 minutes later, I started to feel both of my arms (from should all the way to tips of my fingers) start to get tingly with an intense vibrating sensation. I tried to calm myself down, however numbness began to occur to both BUE seconds after. Next thing that happened, bilateral fingers became visually contracted however numb and I could not move my fingers. I also got a tingly/prickly sensation to my cheeks all the way down to my chin after the hand numbess. The resident doctors quickly took me by wheelchair to a private room where they checked my vital signs. BP was elevated with systolic in 190&#39;s, HR around 120s, and my limbs were all cold. By this time it was around 6pm and they were trying to calm me down as I started to have a panic attack. My parents came to pick me up at 7pm when my vitals were stable. I rested at home, and the contraction to my fingers/numbess did not subside until 8:30pm.  The following day, my left arm (injection site) had a soreness level of 9/10. Tylenol was used to relieve pain.

When smiling one side trip the far far left the other side stay still. My job had me go to a doctors up where they diagnosed me with Bell?s palsy it and the doctor advised me to report this. My treatment plan is antiviral medication and steroids, Valacyclovir 1gm tid, methylprednisolone 4grams qid. I am very upset and heartbroken every time I look in the mirror I cry because I cannot recognize my face I did read online that Pfizer did have side effects of bells palsy but I never thought I would get it given my age and good medical history. I would love for someone to reach out to me I need to know what happens from here.   As a result I have been off of work for a couple days.

                                                3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt a sense of panic and a tingling on my lips, that then spread to my mouth, throat, and tongue. I asked the nurse if my lips were swollen, and she said no.  A few minutes later my heart rate increased and I felt really lightheaded. After 7-10 minutes I felt my tongue tingling and it had become swollen. I told the nurse that I think my tongue was swollen and she said it looked okay. I had a hard time talking because I wasn&#39;t used to be tongue being so large. The nurses stayed and talked to me for the rest of the 30 minute waiting period. I was able to talk and breath while making a conscious effort.  I wasn&#39;t sure whether the high heart rate and lightheadedness were associated with my condition, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. I kept checking my tongue to see how swollen it was.  After the 30 minutes, the nurses had me stand up to see if I could. Once I could, they said I was all set to go. They did not get an Epi-pen for the swollen tongue or give me instructions on how to treat it. They were insensitive and dismissive of my symptoms. they kept repeating &#34;I think your just nervous.&#34; Once I got home, I still had the swollen tongue and tingling, but was able to go up and down stairs and go about my day. It was a little difficult to swallow one of my pills when I got home, but I was able to. I checked my blood pressure around 4:30 p.m. and it was 121/84 and my pulse was 79 bpm sitting. I did not take anything to treat my swollen tongue. The swollen tongue and tingling feeling in my throat continued for another 2.5 hours, until 6:00 p.m. Once the swelling was down, my tongue felt like I burnt it on a hot beverage, almost a numb feeling. I also experienced more common side effects such as body aches, fatigue, and feeling feverish.   After this episode I had extremely high anxiety where it was difficult for me to sleep the following night. I called a 24/7 nurse line and she said to talk to my doctor. I had less than 4 hours sleep the night after I had my vaccine.  I called my doctor&#39;s office this morning and I spoke to a nurse who worked as a nurse on the COVID Vaccine hotline.  She relayed the message to the doctor who was covering for my doctor while she&#39;s on medical leave. I received a call around 9:30 a.m. saying that the doctor on leave recommend I should talk to my PCP but that she thought I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and that I should not get the second dose. She said they were not sure how I would react with the second dose, and they&#39;re afraid that my allergic response might be more severe and life threatening.  I hope this report helps other people who experience these symptoms.

A 28-year-old non-pregnant female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Feb2021 15:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, migraines, asthma, hay fever, acid reflux, hives when exercising outdoors in the cold, and allergies: latex, cats, dustmites, gluten and dairy intolerance; all from unknown dates. Concomitant medications included sumatriptan, bupropion, pepsin, calcium carbonate and unspecified herbs. The patient did not received other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took fluconazole (DIFLUCAN) and experienced allergies. A few minutes after taking the vaccine, the patient experienced a tingling feeling in lips, which then spread to mouth, throat and tongue. The patient told a nurse and she said that she looked fine. The patient asked if lips were swollen but they weren&#39;t. Then a few minutes later she felt very lightheaded and had an elevated heart rate. Then around this time, she saw her tongue was swollen to about double the size. The nurse said she looked fine, and monitored her for 30 minutes then let her go. This swollen tongue lasted for about 2.5 - 3 hours. After the swelling subsided, tongue felt like it was numb/burnt by drinking a hot liquid. 12 hours later, she woke up in the middle of the night with an elevated heart rate and had trouble sleeping. The patient spoke to her doctor and it sounds like she had an allergic reaction, even though she have no history of allergies for any of the vaccine ingredients. Onset date of all events were reported as 25Feb2021 15:30. Outcome of all events reported as recovered on an unspecified date. No treatment was given for all events. The patient was not diagnosed of covid prior vaccination and has not tested for covid post vaccination.

Body aches were really intense - I didn&#39;t sleep the whole night. I had swelling a little on my arm - at injection site. My arm was sore. In general, my body was really sore and I couldn&#39;t get up from bed for 24 hours. I still had a bit of a headache and chills after the 24 hours so I stayed home from work 48 hours. I have been seen by a doctor -after the second vaccine, I had a flare up with my rash on my face (had been experiencing a rash on face prior to vaccine but this was a flare). My face flare up was that I broke out in a rash after finishing doxycycline. Didn&#39;t put me on another antibiotic because they wanted to wait and see with the rash - and the tests. Flare up - I couldn&#39;t eat; painful to wear a mask to work; couldn&#39;t sleep on my face.  I was put on doxycycline again - on March 10th or 11th again because I couldn&#39;t handle the pain anymore. And it is getting refilled for another round.  I have had to take a leave a absence from work the last two weeks.

                                                3/18: Chest pain. It woke me up in the middle of the night with some dizziness. At first, I disregarded it, then I tried falling asleep again, but I was jolted awake again with worse symptoms - vertigo, palpitations. I measured my HR, it was all over the place and irregular. Went to the ER, they didnt find anything substantial on my EKG other than arrhythmia with short PR. No treatment was given, instructed to follow up with PCP. Left ER between 4AM-5AM. Was able to go back to sleep, but the chest pain woke me up around 7 AM. The chest pain remained fairly constant with severity changing throughout the day. Symptoms were worse at night and more: inability to sleep, sometimes restlessness - the need to move, increased chest pain/tightness/burning, palpitations. Saw PCP on 3/19, she didnt have any of the lab results, but prescribed metoprolol - this medication was misunderstood as to when I was supposed to take it, therefore didnt start it until another visit that I had with my PCP on 3/22. Over the weekend, I took some ibuprofen to try to lessen the chest pain, it helped a little bit but not for long. Began taking metoprolol 3/22. I didnt sleep more than 2-3 hrs from 3/18-3/22

A 28-year-old female patient (who was not pregnant at the time of vaccination), received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: ER8732 and expiry date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm left, on 26Mar2021, at 14:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history was not reported. She did not have any known allergies. Concomitant medications included estradiol valerate, progesterone and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12). Patient stated that she first experienced some feverish feelings, chills and hives 30 minutes following her vaccination. She drove home from the hospital and was feeling a bit off, but mostly okay. By the time she got back, she was feeling worse, around 4 PM. By 5 PM she had broken out in hives all over her body, especially on her face, swelling her eyes significantly and having her tongue go somewhat numb, starting to make it difficult to swallow. She also had significant chills, and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, and ended up being admitted to the ER. After being given antihistamines, the swelling went down and eventually the chills stopped after monitoring in the hospital. The patient was hospitalized for the events on an unknown date in Mar2021. Treatment received for the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks of vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date in Mar2021.

This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improve; brain fog; retroorbital headache/intermittent mild tension type frontal headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).  A 29-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (lot number EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 12:00 at 29 years old at single dose at Left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Mirena IUD, personal and family history of retinal migraines (without headache). The concomitant medications were magnesium citrate, melatonin, ademetionine (SAME) and fish oil. On 18Dec2020 in the AM, developed progressive severe soreness at injection site, worse than any other vaccine, hurt even just the touch. This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improved. There was no swelling, redness, or other local symptoms. In the afternoon on 18Dec2020, she developed significant loss of mental clarity (brain fog) while at work. In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM. The patient used naproxen 440 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg on 19Dec2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I was very fatigued and could not use my arm to work since the pain in the arm. I took some Ibuprofen and took a nap and then after that it got a little better, it still hurt but at least I could I use my arm. The next day it was fine.

Unable to lift my arm very far without pain. Worse than any other injection recieved in the past. Pain throught the night-causing lack of sleep. Severe pain for about 24 hours or so then completely gone. My muscle in my arm then felt tight as if there was inflammation of some sort or an injury to the muscle. Upon lifting my arm it felt as if my arm was pulling back. No pain during this action but more of a weakness. No relief from anti inflammatory medicaiton or ice. Sensation in arm noted to be gone on 01/09/2021.

                                                1 week history of significantly worsened (previously present &#34;low back strain&#34; lower back pain that had become radicular to both LE and associated with progressively worsening bilateral LE weakness, paresthesias since COVID vaccination last week. see continuation for HPI and assessment/plan from office note 1/13/21  HPI from OV dated 1/13/21  She had presented initially in December 2020 for her annual physical, and we evaluated some low back pain that that time, felt to be a sprain/strain resulting from a fall in the shower earlier December which was aggravated significantly by lifting/transferring a patient at the SNF she works for as a nurse. Presentation at that time was rather benign, no imaging obtained, pt was placed on leave from work for 1 week to avoid the heavy lifting and likely aggravation of back pain, and rx including diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine. She did not FU in the office, but returned to work at SNF a week after I saw her for the back pain. She states she had improved enough to feel like she could go back to work but wasn&#39;t 100% without back pain yet. At no time was comp mentioned at the visit in December. She did tell her employer about the injury and was off of work for a week and was encouraged to seek comp. We were never notified.    Yesterday 1/12 she followed up in the office for the back pain and was found to have much more severe pain, now radicular to both LE (pain intensity worse on right), with new neurologic impairment including objective weakness bilateral LE (R&gt;L), sensation disturbance bilateral LE (R&gt;L). Xray of lumbar spine obtained in clinic, this was essentially unremarkable, non-acute.  Pt was sent for stat MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI last night revealed no findings to explain her severe symptoms - she has mild symmetric disc bulging at L5-S1  nd mild bilateral facet arthropathy with patent canal and foramina, and a mild nonspecific  &#34;STIR signal abnormality&#34; within the soft tissues abutting the left lateral aspect of the L5 spinous processes felt to be small and nonspecific. I did discuss the case and the imaging with the radiologist and he feels this is unlikely to be the source of her back pain/radicular symptoms. No obvious signs of apparent discitis or any signficant soft tissue abnormality.    Pt contacted last night with initial &#34;normal&#34; results of MRI as formal results were pending - hydrocodone was sent to her pharmacy for pain relief overnight. Pt received 60mg toradol in the office yesterday during her visit. Pt noted significant improvement in her back pain, bilateral leg pain about 30 minuts after that injection. She continued to have pain in the evening but went to sleep. She woke at 3am unable to roll over due to weakness and pain - her sister gave her a hydrocodone and she went back to sleep&#39; she woke this morning feeling much better; today, she has less severe low back pain, less severe right lower leg radicular pain, NO pain radiating into the left LE, lessening of the weakness in her right LE, lessening of paresthesia reported in the right LE (now isolated just to the heel), resolution of the weakness in the left LE, resolution of the tingling of the left knee. Other than the toradol and one dose of hydrocodone, no other medications were given, no other treatments given since presentation yesterday.   Upon further questioning, patient does reveal that she received the 1st of 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (pfizer) last week. She received the vaccination at work at nursing home on 1/7/21. She had some relatively quick onset nausea and dizziness within an hour of the injection, but that resolved. She recalls feeling like her low back pain, bilateral lower leg pain, leg weakness and paresthesias all intensified sometime either Wednesday 1/6/21 or 1/7/21, but more obviously worsened over the weekend 1/9 and 1/10. Along with the lower extremity symptoms, she does admit today that she experienced soreness in bilateral upper arms starting the day following the vaccine administration, with left arm/shoulder still feeling sore and tender to the touch now. She also developed some altered sensation of the right thumb and index fingers the day following vaccination (1/8/21) and this has been persistent/unchanged. She is right handed. No prior issues with right hand/fingers. Other than the altered sensation, she denies pain, swelling, or notable weakness. She is right handed, and really hasn&#39;t done much with her right hand over the past week since she hasn&#39;t been working. Patient denies having significant headache, fever, chills, diaphoresis, fatigue, rashes/injection site erythema since the covid vaccination. She was not told to sign up for or told about the V-safe program and hadn&#39;t thought to report her symptoms to work or think to be concerned regarding possible vaccine SE. Pt denies prior hx of low back pain, neurologic symptoms including weakness/paresthesias, previous allergy to or adverse reaction to vaccination or injectable medications. She has a history of latent TB(fully treated) but is otherwise in good health.  After gathering much further detailed information/history today from patient, review of chart including the MRI results and xray results from yesterday, my prior OV note, and discussion with radiologist today regarding her MRI - I Discussed with patient and her sister that I believe what is becoming more apparent to me now is that she is likely suffering from an adverse event associated with the COVID-19 vaccination she received on 1/7/21 through her workplace. I&#39;m unable to define this for certain, but I suspect that she developed the progressive worsening of low back pain, development of radicular pain and bilateral LE weakness and paresthesias about 1-2 days following the vaccination administration. She has had notable and rather surprising improvement in both subjective and objective findings  Today as compared to yesterday. Only intervention was toradol 60mg IM and one dose of hydrocodone, she had already been taking diclofenac or ibuprofen so I believe the only explanation for the improvement over the past 24 hours is the fact that she is gradually having resolution of the temporary paraparesis, neuralgia, paresthesia brought on by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. I believe she truly had injury to the low back in December, initial injury at home but had improvmenet and then significant worsening/exacerbation when transferring a resident at work. Her presentation following that was consistent with a strain/sprain of the lumbar spine. This was treated appropriately with rest, activity modification, stretching, NSAID, and muscle relaxers. She returned to work w/o restriction likely earlier than she should have but I believe the covid vaccination is likely what caused her condition to so significantly decline; Its also possible that her physically demanding job requiring lifting/transferring/standing for prolonged periods of time on top of an only partially resolved low back strain had aggravated her low back condition.    plan from OV dated 1/13/21 Given the improvement since yesterday, I recommended obtaining some labs looking for any sign of alternative explanation including infectious etiology or autoimmune/inflammatory condition, however will hold on further imaging as would be the plan, specifically EMG of the bilateral LEs. Explained to patient that I&#39;m hopeful with continued rest and time, her symptoms (weakness, tingling/numbness, radicular back pain) will completely resolve. She may need some eventual PT for the disc bulge in the lumbar spine and lumbar strain that is likely still lingering. Will contact pt with any change in care plan based on the laboratory findings. I would like to closely follow her, and make sure her symptoms continue to slowly improve /resolve. If at any point she develops worsening symptoms again or any new neurologic signs/symptoms (and we discussed what emergency signs/symptoms would be) then she needs to be in touch with me right away. I will work on reporting this suspected adverse covid vaccine reaction to VAERS / possibly also CDC and see if they have any additional input/suggestions for monitoring/treatment.    For pain control, pt may continue with the diclofenac OR ibuprofen, and the hydrococone/APAP as needed for breakthrough severe pain uncontrolled with the NSAID. I have advised pt to remain off of work at this time, resting at home avoiding lots of physical activity as she continues to heal. Suspect will have her follow up in clinic sometime next week for repeat evaluation/examination depending on VAERS/CDC recommendations and of course the lab results and any updated condition reports from the patient in the interim. Will want to make sure she has full resolution of the paresis and adequate resolution of her back pain/radicular pain prior to returning to work, even in a limited capacity. I am informed today that there is light duty available and will keep that in mind. Pt to be contacted regarding follow up. Encouraged to call with questions/concerns/updates. Pt was very thankful for the care.

I could not sleep that night after I received my vaccine. I decided not to go the ER and slept it off I woke up much better next morning. I saw a Doctor a couple of days later because I had shortness of breathing and a high heart rate while I was at work. He just told me to take it slowly at work. No meds.

Rash developed all over body that is similar to the rash Kawasaki syndrome kids get.  Was taken to emergency room where I was given iv steroids and epi. 10-15 mins after my breathing was back to baseline and throat felt better. I have never had any trouble breathing or any allergic reactions to anything in the past.

                                                About 12 hours after the vaccine, I started having arm pain at the site and low back pain which is very unusual for me as well as a dull headache which is not uncommon for me. Around midnight I woke up with chills, and severe arthralgias in all joints down to the toes and fingers, and deep, boring pain in my long bones and neck. My skin and fingertips felt like they were burning. I was nauseated but didn?t vomit. I was up all night because I couldn?t find a position I wasn?t in pain in. Tmax 100.3 F. Took a gram of Tylenol with improvement of symptoms. Felt better in AM but when Tylenol wore off around 9 am, had another wave of the same pain all over. Tylenol improved. Felt almost completely normal by 4 pm with the exception of some lingering low back pain (central not muscular).

                                                Approximately 12/13 hours post-vaccine dose #2 I was woken from my sleep with severe body aches. Extremely uncomfortable, from neck to back to calves, without improvement with Tylenol or ibuprofen, causing me to be unable to sleep. Around hour 20 post-vaccine, I started to get chills. It wasn?t just feeling cold or shivering, it was full body convulsions that lasted approximately 15 minutes.  I became nauseas and dizzy after that for about an hour, unable to stand or walk anywhere. The severe body aches continued, with no improvement from Tylenol or ibuprofen or heating pad. Aches resolved around hour 30 post-vaccine and the only symptom left was pain at the injection site.

This continued for about 30 minutes, I was debating going to the ED for the SOB. I then became really cold and had such bad shaking I couldn&#39;t hold anything for another 20 minutes.  Today I continue to have some tingling. All of this on top of the expected side effects.

By that point I was in bed almost all day with muscle pain in my torso (back, ribs, abdominal). I also had a severe migrane and a fever that at it&#39;s worst was 102.3. It was brought down quickly with ice to 100.7 within an hour. After about 8 hours it subsided for about 20 minutes before the torso pain and migrane came back. The fever stayed around 100.3 when I last checked. I went back to sleep for the rest of the night and felt fine in the morning with no fever.

Almost immediatly afte,r I got a sharp shooting inside nerve pain from shoulder under the armpit area down to my wrist area.  The pain was bad and constant until 1/14, aleve, ibuprophen or tylenol made it better.  On 1/10-1/11 the pain was the worst and woke me up from sleeping it hurt so bad with a pain level of  a 8/10.  The pain was more nerve pain over muscle pain and the intensity never changed  whether I moved or not.

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after receiving my vaccine I felt warmth down injected arm. Approximately 20 minutes post injection, I experienced a drop in my blood pressure, heaviness in my legs (like walking through cement), and ringing in my ears. At approximately 12:30-12:45pm I experienced mental fog (I couldn&#39;t remember how to turn off my windshield wipers), increased heart rate, rapid onset of feelings of panic, minor shortness of breath, neck/clavicle tightness on side of injection, and sweating. Between approximately 1:30pm and 2:30pm I continued to have extreme sweating, as well as: increased pulse, fatigue, dry throat, muscle weakness/shakiness, brain fog, and headache. At approximately 3:30 I hit my knee on the bed frame and felt like the wind had been knocked out of me and immediately had a severe drop in blood pressure that felt similar to a vasovagal event. I called the vaccine clinic and my symptoms were noted and I was told to seek help if my symptoms worsened or I felt like I was going to pass out. My symptoms have not worsened but I am still experiencing extreme sweating along with shivering, shakiness, blood pressure changes with movement (orthostatic hypotension), and fatigue - time is currently 5:50pm

I didn&#39;t call my doctor at that point because I read that it was a side effect. Dull/always there pain at that point. On the 15th, shooting pains - this lasted two days. It started getting better again by the 17th. It was resolved by the 18th.  14-17th - Swelling that I could feel and see and that also went back to normal by the 18th. It was just tender to touch for a little while after that....after it didn&#39;t hurt to move I didn&#39;t pay as much attention to it. I was able to go to work but I had to modify what I could do at work. I could not do my normal swimming exercise until that next week.

                                                Dizziness, Lightheaded, Chills, the first time I had to stop because couldn&#39;t drive, I had spasm&#39;s around the injection site, Generalized Numbing, the symptoms of the fisrt dose lasted one week. I don&#39;t like to take medicine and I had no choice but take Panadol every 4 hours and apply ice to treat the muscular pain. I went to emergency and was told that I had an urine infection  (which is very rare on me), and was treated with antibiotics.   With the second dose I took acetaminophen 500 mg befor the vaccine, that helped because the day of the shot I didn&#39;t have pain, but the numbness was like if I couldn&#39;t connect my body to the brain. Couldn&#39;t talk properly, sleep 2 hours during the day, is funny that I applied ice on the injection site (Me thinking) but the pain doesn&#39;t go away, when the ice melts I notice that I applied the ice on the wrong arm. That&#39;s what I mean when I talk about numbness. Fever of 39.8F and Chills even today . Some cough and dry throat (Dryness can be because I&#39;m a teacher) and constant tiredness.

                                                minutes after administration, patient reports head feeling strange, so I asked her to remain seated so I can observe her prior to getting up to the observation room. Then she reports feeling nauseous and weak. I asked her what medical conditions she has and she told me she is diabetic and has kidney disease. I asked if she ate breakfast, she said she did not, only had something small before heading out in the morning. I gave her am ice pack to place on the back of her neck which helped relieve her symptoms of head feeling strange and the nausea. Once nurse arrived, we checked her pulse and blood pressure, at this time it was around 11:45 am and her pulse was low at 64 and blood pressure at 94/60, which patient states is her baseline normal blood pressure. We opened the windows so she could get some fresh air since the room was very hot and shortly after we took her pulse and blood pressure she seemed to be feeling better. By 11:50 am the ambulance arrived and paramedics asked if she would like to be taken to the hospital to get checked, she said even though she is feeling a lot better, she would prefer to go just in case.

It subsided after 36 hours. After the second dose I had flu like symptoms and brain fog for a day. I had bruising and a knot at the injection site that lasted for three weeks.

She was alert and oriented when I placed her in the sitting position on an exam table in the observation area. approximately 20 minutes later, she reported feeling itchiness in nose and lips.

Since then I have felt malaise and general soreness as well as intermittent headaches etc. none of this is uncommon in my body (as I have autoimmune issues). But I am concerned it?s triggered an autoimmune flare. I no longer have hives (so I will check recovered) but still feel unwell.

Makes working as a teacher extremely difficult. Feel like I can&#39;t think clearly, can&#39;t think deeply or critically, and feel like I am &#34;out of it&#34; or not speaking as coherently.  Can&#39;t find words or organize my thoughts properly. Have also had some light headed and dizziness a few times since then.

Monday 3/22: mid way through work shift, felt extremely dizzy, jittery and light headed. Difficult to stand and walk on my own and rash started to come back. Went to care.

                                                In the week following my vaccination, I presented no symptoms. After day 7, I developed soreness/tenderness in my left armpit and a series of neurological symptoms that are very concerning including depression, anxiety, insomnia (accompanied with heart racing, sweating, tingling in extremities, obsessive thoughts etc). Although, I have had sleep issues during the course of the pandemic, I do not deal with daily anxiety. I very rarely have to turn to any medication and especially have not had any  anxiety symptoms or sleep issues recently.   I do not believe the CDC has commented on the connection between vaccine safety and any relationship between vaccine immune response and neuropsychiatric disorders. Or how antibodies produced via vaccine react to other proteins.  My daily activities have been significantly impacted over the course of this week.  I would appreciate learning if there is possible cross-reactivity and if that has presented in other adults.

Hot flashes include tachycardia, excessive perspiration, reddening of skin, intense warmth of skin and were followed by chills and my color flushing. Also experiencing night sweats that results in insomnia. This has caused a general interruption to my daily life. The hot flashes continued to get more intense over the past several weeks. I have not had my menstrual cycle since my second injection.

                                                Everything started on January 24th at about 7pm exactly 20 days post first Pfizer vaccine. No other changes or vaccines given since October (flu vaccine) was scheduled for 1/25/21 for second Pfizer dose. It all started when I was working at ER when I started to feel cold like it was in an ice bath and numbness in both feet. I went to discharge my patients when I realized ascending numbness and coldness from the feet was traveling upward. Within 5 hours (around midnight) I went to hospital due to having severe weakness to where I couldn?t walk and loss of bladder control. I was rushed to MRI of brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. I also had blood work done and a lumbar puncture. I was admitted for a couple days to watching the ascending weakness and loss of feeling. My MRIs came back clear from any diseases such as transverse myelitis, MS, etc. My LP showed mild elevated protein at 54 (normal range 15-45), one tube elevated lymphocytes 100% (range 40-80%) and one tube elevated monocytes 50% (range 15-45%). Also CK-MB w/reflex was 352 (range 26-140). I was discharged on 2/26 at 5:30pm with a diagnosis of bilateral leg weakness and numbness. From this point on I was wheelchair bound at home and being cared for 24/7. After discharge some additional random symptoms started such as chills with no fever to where I slept in sweat pants and sweat shirts, leg spasms/ twitches, leg heaviness, severe lower back and hip pain, a loss of sensation while going pee or poo but not incontinent, and things like drop foot with the severe weakness and numbness . On 2/3/22 I started with double vision, blurry vision and pain behind my right eye. I went to ER and had repeat MRIs of brain, cervical, thoracic and lumbar with and without contrast and basic blood work and was sent home to follow up with Dr. on 2/9 and was discharged home. By 2/8 my strength started to get worse to where I couldn?t lift my kids. Finally saw Dr. neurology and MS specialist 2/9, he ran detailed neuro exams from head to toe, looked at both scans from both hospitals, all the blood work and LP results. He reported that I had severe hyper reflexes in both legs and Hoffman?s sign in both hands. My feet were completely numb and cold to where I couldn?t feel them or walk. Literally felt like everyday I was standing in a ice cold bath with no feeling of touch hot or cold sensation or pin pricks. He realized my loss of sensation was from my bra line down and included tingling in my hands and weakness in my arms. I was able to get up for the first time with a walker and take a few steps with assistance at this time. He then sent me to ER to be admitted and see their neuromuscular team to get further treatment. Upon arrival via wheelchair I was brought back to see the ER Doctor and re-did a neuro exam, some blood work and contacted the neurology team to come see me. I was then admitted to the hospital step down ICU under Dr with strict monitoring. On 2/10/21 The neuro team ordered another set of MRI of brain, cervical and thoracic with and without contrast due to a change in condition again since my last visit to hospital. They reviewed and compared studies with no changes. They scheduled me for MRI lumbar on 2/11/21 with and without contrast which came back no changes from previous MRI as well as another LP which everything that was off before was now normal. Everyday I would work with PT, OT and speech. I had no changes in speech and slowly got some strength back, and was able walk using a walker. I was then discharged home on 2/13 mid afternoon and was told I would do home health and follow up with their neurologist and Neuromusclar team once everything was resulted back. On 2/19/21 I saw my primary doctors office (nurse practitioner) where she checked up on the status of me, took me officially off work and on state disability, filled out paperwork for work and a handicapped pass. On 2/25/21 followed up with neurology, and discussed all my imaging and blood work. All CSF fluid came back normal, all labs were fine and wanted me to get an EMG to look for nerve damage. She also wanted a follow up with cardiology as my resting heart rate was 110-120 and would spike to 160s. On 3/1/21 Home health was started for physical therapy for strengthening and working on sensation for both legs. At this point I had almost full strength in my arms, still tingling in my hands and constant numbness and cold feeling in both feet and knees with severe sensitivity to cold, wind or touch on my legs. I had Home health twice a week every week for 2-3 weeks then started outpatient physical therapy which has been twice a week for 1.5 hours. On 3/5 I saw cardiology and was placed on a holt monitor for 48 hour monitoring. On 3/9 I had my EMG with Dr. and had a follow up with Dr. for 35 tubes of blood he had drawn for multiple diseases which both blood work and EMG came back negative. On 3/16 symptoms started to change from numbness to severe hypersensitivity to touch, severe shooting nerve pains, burning sensations, non stop tingling in hands, issues with temperatures either hot or cold, and swelling of both legs. On 3/17 I saw rheumatology that looked into everything said it was not lupus related as none of my inflammatory markers or lupus DNA strands were elevated and no lupus symptoms like rashes, ulcers in the mouth or tongue, hair loss or joint pain. He ordered more blood work and confirmed it was not a lupus flare up. He suggested doing a small nerve fiber biopsies. On 3/19/21 saw spinal orthopedics who reassured it has nothing to do with my spine, prescribed gabapentin for all the nerve pain and told me that neurology is who should be following me. On 3/26 I had an echocardiogram done due to the leg swelling and heart rates which came back negative for any heart problems and was told since the tachycardia is getting better to just continue watching it and was prescribed trazodone 25mg to help with sleep due to severe nerve pains, spasms and severe back and hip pains at night. On 4/1/21 was followed up again with neurology. Ordered small nerve fiber biopsy for may 18th, increased the gabapentin to 300 mg- 3 times a day and had me wean off cymbalta. I am still dealing with tingling, burning hot and cold sensitivities in both legs, still tingling in hands all day but strength is back to full. I am scheduled to hopefully return to work 5/30/2021 after being off since 1/24/2021.

A 29-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: PAA165969, expiry date not reported), intramuscular, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 10:30 as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if patient had known allergies or other medical history. It was unknown if patient had Covid prior vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the vaccination and report. It was unknown if patient received other vaccine in four weeks and other medications in two weeks. The patient received the vaccine at the doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient fainted five minutes after the vaccination on 07Apr2021 10:30. She was pale and diaphoretic. She became responsive within one minute. She was given water and a cold compress, and reported she felt better, but then vomited a small amount of emesis 15 minutes later (07Apr2021). She was evaluated by the physician who determined it was an emotional response to the vaccine. The patient had reported she was extremely anxious about receiving the vaccine (07Apr2021), and had fainted when she tried to give blood, and hadn&#39;t eaten anything that day. After sitting for 45 minutes, the doctor felt comfortable letting her leave. A call was placed to the patient at 4:00 pm to check on her. She reported she felt fine. The patient received no treatment for the event vomited, while therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the other reported events. It was unknown if patient was tested for Covid post vaccination. The patient recovered on an unspecified date in 2021 from the events reported.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available and a close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events of syncope. The case will be reassessed once new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate

This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

This A 30-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EH9899), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 22Dec2020 09:00 for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included reaction to pork, porsine and/or if she ever was exposed to exposed to heparin. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced syncope (medically significant), dizziness (medically significant), feeling faint; like going to pass out now and then (medically significant), overall achiness, severe headaches, fever. The outcome of the events syncope, dizziness, feeling faint; like going to pass out now was recovering and outcome of overall achiness, severe headaches, fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The patient ask: are there any animal products, pork gelatin or a lipid form of that contain in the vaccine?   The events were described as follows: She experienced a significant amount of syncope and dizziness, for greater than 4 or 5 days post-receiving the vaccination. Also feeling faint like she is going to pass out every now and then. Has a more important question, wondering along with the doctors if one of the ingredients may have an animal product, like pork gelatin or a lipid form of that. It looks like one of the ingredients may have an animal cell lipid and was wondering if she was having a reaction to that. Declines to provide primary care provider details. States she received this first dose at occupational health in her workplace. Received the vaccine on the 22Dec2020 at 9am. 24 hours post vaccination, 1 day after, the syncope, dizziness, feeling faint started. Also the other symptoms, overall achiness, severe headaches, and fever were also experienced, but they stopped after that 24 hours. Those were expected since it was listed as side effects that popped up, so she expected those and they stopped after 24 hours. The syncope, dizziness, and faint feeling are not any worse and are very slowly improving, but she still has it and had to call out of work today because of it. That&#39;s consistent. Mentions it takes her a while to get down the stairs when getting product details for the COVID-19 vaccine. Unable to provide the vaccine NDC or expiry, or dose. Did not have any other vaccines at time of this one and none 4 weeks prior. Had to call a (company withheld) doctor and has to go to occupational health tomorrow to be seen. Declines having COVID virus. No further details provided.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events syncope and dizziness are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

                                                Over night on 01/06 I experienced chills and was very cold. At times I was extremely warm. The next morning I had a fever and my joints, muscles, head and even my skin was hurting. My fever never came down to normal even with advil and I was extremely tired all day.  The arm that had the injection is extremely sore with splotches of red (which is expected.) Today, 01/08, I woke up in a pool of sweat. My head is still hurting and I still have a fever. My arm is still sore but my skin and joint pain has improved. I am still very cold. Have been wearing my winter coat in my house even with the heat and the fire place on. I had to take the last two days off work.

She walked to the main entrance and notified a clinic manager at the check-in desk that she was experiencing &#34;chest pain.&#34; Clinic RNs came to observe and assess the patient. The patient communicated with no displays of distress. When asked what type of chest pain, she stated &#34;heaviness pressing on her chest, localized on the left side and on the upper chest area.&#34; Patient denied pain radiating down arm and denied jaw pain.

                                                Wednesday 1/13/2021 I woke up feeling like nauseous, then later in the day I started to get itchy in my lower body that was coming and going (I believe I still had some allegra d in my system). On  Thursday 01/14/2021 by noon time the itching had become extreme and unbearable all over my body and felt like my skin was crawling/burning, my chest and parts of my arms were really red . I also developed a lump in my throat that kept getting bigger and felt itchy and couldn&#39;t stop clearing my throat. Around 3pm I took 10ml of Claritin. The Claritin had not really helped however the redness had gone down a lot and by 4:30 I was miserable. Informed by a provider I work with to go to urgent care. I arrived at urgent care at about 5:10 where I was treated for an allergy reaction. I was given  0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus 500mL, Methylprednisolone sod suc(PF) (SOLU-Medrol) 125mg Intravenous, Famotidine (Pepcid) 20mg/2ml injection 20mg intravenous, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50mg/ml injection 25mg intravenous.  The itching subsided within 30 minutes, the itchy throat/ lump was still present but was not getting worse and slowly improving.   I was discharged home and was told to pick up famotidine 20mg, otc benadryl and prednisone 50mg to take for 5 days.  got home a little after 7 and was able to eat dinner, let dog out, shower, rest  before going to bed. I did take another 10 ml of Benadryl at 10:30. Woke up without any itchy skin at 5:45 and was able to return to work this morning. I still have a slight itchy throat but it is tolerable. I took allegra d and famotidine this morning. I am holding off on the prednisone because of the immune response to vaccines from steroids. I don&#39;t want to lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine.

I tried to sleep under my usual schedule and routine. I kept waking up for no apparent reason. I felt like my body would rest but my brain never actually fell into sleep. I was not able to achieve REM sleep until around 7am. I woke up late around 11am feeling like I passed out from sleep deprivation. I woke feeling like I had a strange &#34;hang over&#34;. I felt dizzy and light headed. I had a general feeling of being unwell. I had a pressure in my head above my temples that circled my head to the back of my crown area.

                                                On Monday, January 25, 2021, at 11:40am I received the second dose of a series for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Over the course of the rest of that day, I began to develop a headache and mild neck soreness. That night, I slept poorly. When I awoke just before 5:00am the next day, Tuesday, January 26, I did not feel well. I was experiencing headache, malaise, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, and low-grade fever. I called my supervisor around 5:30am that day and we decided it was best that I stay home to recuperate. Throughout the day, I mostly rested and slept, took Tylenol, and began to feel better in the mid-afternoon. I did call and leave a voicemail for hospital Employee Health around 1:30pm on Tuesday the 26th, but did not hear back. Today, Wednesday, January 27, I am feeling much better, and well enough to come to work.

About 6 hrs after vaccine, I felt soreness at the injection site, very similar to the flu vaccine. About 12Hours post vaccine, my arm was so sore I could not lift it. That night I took two Tylenol and had to wrap my arm in a heating pad. I woke up around 3am that following morning with a fever of 104 F. I was so dizzy from the high fever. I felt extremely nauseated. My body ached mostly in my legs and lower back. It hurt to sit on the toilet, to put on clothes. My Fevers happened at night time ranging from 102-104F for 4 days. My injection site soreness lasted for 7 days. Body aches lasted around 2-3 days. Dizziness subsided after my fever broke, but was replaced with a severe headache lasting 2 days.

By 10 PM I had fever, chills, anxiety, dry mouth, headache, body aches, and I had a hard time staying asleep. I rarely wake during the night to pee but I woke 4 times for water and to use the bathroom.  I woke more than that, but 4 times specifically for that reason. My fever broke the next morning (1/31) around 6 or 7 AM. I still had a mild headache and felt tired and not like myself. I took ibuprofen and the headache subsided. Around 2 the headache came back as did the anxiety. I am not a typically anxious person. I took another dose of ibuprofen. Around 10 that evening (1/31) I felt back to normal.

Roughly 5 minutes after, I raised my hand in the waiting for for the male nurse to come over due to symptoms of dizziness, loss of consciousness, ?blacking out?, and confusion. The male nurse came over and started seeing signs of profuse sweating as water began dripping from all over my body. 5 minutes after that I started heaving and gasping for air unaroused next to the nurse as he took my blood pressure. Blood pressure dropped to 85/76. I started breathing heavy, sweating uncontrollably and couldn?t talk or stand. I remained hardly alert and almost passed out due to weakness.

                                                Incredible arm/shoulder/lymph node pain starting 10 hours post-vaccination lasting about 60 hours. About 12 hours post-vaccine, uncontrollable muscle spasms began and lasted approximately 2 hours. In this time, arm/shoulder/lymph node were extremely swollen. During the muscle spasms, I experienced my first or two &#34;attacks&#34;.  Speaking and thinking became difficult - at times I felt as though I was trapped in my own head unable to speak or move how I wanted (motor function was possible but sluggish and requiring assistance to become ambulatory). The worst of this lasted about 4 hours, though my brain remained some level of &#34;foggy&#34; 48 hours post-vaccination. 1-2 hours into these neurological issues, I lost the ability to feel throughout my whole body. I could tell there was a sensation on my skin, but I could not tell if it was hot/cold/pain/pressure.  I could not feel if I was swallowing, drinking water, or breathing, though I could move enough to perform these activities.  Vision was hazy during these attacks and for a while after. The worst of all these effects lasted 3-4 hours. It then took about 5-6 hours to regain all feeling, though my brain was still foggy/hazy. Heavy swelling lasted several hours, then became moderate swelling, and after 48 hours, there was little to no swelling. About 22 hours post-vaccination, I had another one of these &#34;attacks&#34;, not including the muscle spasms. This second attack was identical to the first in every way, except it was slightly less severe.  Recuperation time was again 5-6 hours. It is currently about 70 hours post-vaccination and most symptoms except moderate arm soreness are gone. During both attacks, BP and temperature were normal, heart rate slightly elevated (80-85 bpm).  Other non-severe effects included fatigue,  slight chills/flush.

A 30-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included steel rods in back from 2006 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was vaccinated and felt fine. She experienced arm soreness on 20Jan2021 originally. Then today, it was so bizarre, about an hour and a half ago, her back started to itch on 22Jan2021. There was irritation. She checked in the mirror, and her back was red on 22Jan2021. She was wondering if this was a reaction from the vaccine. She was getting nervous. A medical student gave her the vaccine. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. Twenty minutes after getting the vaccine, she noticed the arm soreness. It was worse yesterday, but today she thinks it is the same or maybe a little better. The irritation on her back seems a little better since she first noticed it. The outcome of the events back felt itchy and pinkish red and irritation was recovering. The outcome of the event arm soreness was not recovered. The outcome of the event nervous was unknown.

                                                The night after the second dose, I had difficulty sleeping, but that was not particularly unusual. By about 10 the next morning, I started getting joint aches in bilateral hip joints and sacral joints. By 10:30 I suddenly found myself lightheaded and had to sit down so as to not faint. Of note, I had just previous to this lightheadedness donned full PPE to work with a patient (gown, gloves, face shield, N95), not having yet worn it that morning. I did not faint, and was able to sit down for 15 minutes without a mask and drink ice water, but I was not safe to work with my patients (as a physical therapist). I left work and went home to sleep. I did not have a fever or chills. After a 3 hour nap, all of my symptoms resolved.  Additional information: I am pregnant, was 16 weeks pregnant at the time. All fetal imaging prior to the first vaccine and after the second vaccine have showed normal healthy development. I am due July 3

I was so tired and sleepy I slept almost all day for the first 48 hrs after. Developed fever between 100.5-101 which lasted about 18hrs which did require me to have to call into work the following day.  2/3 I developed swelling and pain in the lymph nodes under my right arm and breast.  The swelling subsided within 4days but I still have some tenderness to date.  I took tylenol and ibuprophen for the first 48 hours to help with all the symptoms.

Within 12 hours, the itching got much worse and my three toes started to swell. The itch was bad enough that I couldn&#39;t sleep, but I wouldn&#39;t say there was much pain. I noticed a cut in between a couple of my toes and a small blister. I thought it was Athlete&#39;s foot until a colleague told me about COVID toes. I&#39;ve been taking Benadyrl and using athlete&#39;s foot products (Lotrimin) that have been helping with the itch. Going on day 5 with some reduction in swelling.

                                                I am unsure if this is related but thought I should report it because it was highly unusual, but: My menstrual cycle began at around 12:30am on 03-19-2021. There was some bad cramping as is usual for me in the first 24 hours. I was able to function normally enough until about 9P (on 03-19-2021),  at which time I began experiencing debilitating cramps and muscle spasms that made it difficult to walk or move. I felt lightheaded and like I was going to pass out (which has never happened related to my period before). I got in bed and this persisted until moving at all brought me to tears. I have not been in this much pain from cramps and muscle spasms in over a decade.  And never this prolonged and intense. I was unable to sleep until about 4:30am, managed to sleep for a few hours, had to see, and now I&#39;m here filling this out before I attempt to go back to sleep.  My pain at the moment is high, but similar to what a normal &#34;first day of cycle and it&#39;s bad&#34; day would be for me.  Before this, though, was 8 hours straight of some of the worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt in my life.  I felt it important for me to make a formal report in the event that adverse effects surrounding menstruation were common for others and in case this does not subside. I am thinking it will like the initial muscle aches after receiving the shot.

                                                I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. After 10-15 minutes from receiving the vaccine, my face got itchy but it was mild so I left after 25 minutes of waiting. Over the next hour the itching got more noticeable (no rash) and my throat felt slightly swollen, although I had no difficulty breathing or talking. I called a pharmacy that advised I take Benadryl, which helped. The next morning my face was still itching and it felt like there was a lump in my throat. I went to urgent care and received a steroid shot and prescription for Atarax, although the pharmacy was closed, so I just ended up taking more Benadryl. Today, 2 days after the vaccine, my face no longer itches and my throat feels normal. Just feel moderately fatigued, although I think that is a normal side effect.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This is the second of two reports of the same patient receiving the second dose of BNT162B2.  A 30-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 17Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose (at the age of 30) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing asthma (diagnosed about 10 years ago), Basedow&#39;s disease from 01Mar2021 and ongoing, hypersensitivity, hyperthyroidism, anxiety. First dose of BNT162B2 was given on 22Feb2021 and she felt sick to her stomach, nausea, had no energy, 160 heart rate atrial fibrillation, hand tremors, shortness of breath, she felt exhausted, low grade fever, thyroid storm, felt tired, shaking, flu symptoms.  Concomitant medications included levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) taken for allergy from 2020 to 24Feb2021, guaifenesin (MUCINEX) taken for hypersensitivity from Dec2020 to 20Feb2021.  When she got the second vaccine, her heart rate was high again. She did have a thyroid storm the day after the second dose (18Mar2021) and she was in the emergency room again since her heart rate was so high. It was reported that the vaccine did cause her thyroid storm. She knows vaccinations have to do with the immune systems, and if she has an autoimmune disease, she is thinking it may have come from it. States two doctors are certain that it triggered an immune response and wanted her to report this. She could barely stand up or talk, she was so short of breath and is guessing that was from her heart. She had normal flu like symptoms from the vaccine but does not think it was related to her thyroid. She has always had little cold symptoms after getting a vaccination. First night she felt very exhausted, tired. She had a low grade fever that Tylenol took care of and it went away within a day. She felt run down and it was vaccination related. The second day (19Mar2021) she had really bad hand tremors that moved into her body. She thought the shaking was from the vaccination and she took a video of it. She did not really have any other symptoms yet, then started to get really fatigued. She went to ER and her heart was really elevated. Each time she went to the doctor or the ER, her heart rate would be 20 beats faster then 20 beats faster again.  The outcome of her heart rate was high again / heart elevated/her heart rate would be 20 beats faster then 20 beats faster again, short of breath was recovering. The outcome of guessing that was from her heart, exhausted/tired/ felt run down/ really fatigued was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Two days after receiving first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine started feeling generally unwell. On the third day, started feeling progressively worse: dizziness upon standing and while standing (to the point I thought I would fall over) nausea, dry heaving, headache bordering on migraine, abdominal pain and a short period of appetite loss. Today (fourth day post shot) I called out of work and feel as if I?m on a tilt table while laying down, and will feel dizzy and nauseated immediately upon standing up. This is is spite of staying hydrated and eating a bland diet in order to not upset my stomach.

A 31-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient stated she got the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Monday, 28Dec2020. She mentioned that she read the list of side effects and all the print outs and stated her events were not on there. She wanted to make sure and stated maybe it was not even from the vaccine. She reported she just came from the hair dresser, had hair colored before many times, but today (30Dec2020), when she put the dye on her hair, she broke out with what felt like a million bugs on her head and face, stated it is burning and itching, maybe it is her imagination. She knows there is a lot of paranoia. She reported that she has had hair colored before and this has never happened, it occurred during hair coloring treatment. She also mentioned that on 30Dec2020 (also reported as &#34;yesterday&#34;, pending clarification), she felt dizzy and nauseous; on 29Dec2020 (reported as &#34;yesterday&#34;), she felt bad and did not feel right all day, but says she knows those were listed symptoms. The outcome of the events dizziness, nausea, burning sensation and pruritus was recovering; the outcome of events paranoia and feeling abnormal was unknown.

About 12 hours after I got the vaccine (around 1 am), I woke up with a headache, chills, body aches and a low grade fever. During the night, my temp got up to 99.9 and continued to stay around mid to high 99s throughout the day on Sunday. I tried Tylenol without any success and kept going in and out of chills with body aches and headache persisting. Before I went to sleep Sunday (01/03/21) night, I switched to Ibuprofen and woke up Monday morning without a fever but still experiencing fatigue. Throughout the day on Monday, fever did not return. I stayed home from work on Sunday and Monday. On Tuesday 01/04/20, I was still tired but able to return to work.

She was given Benadryl, which she states improved her symptoms and she was able to sleep.  This morning (day after vaccine) she states that her tingling feeling has returned to her face, lips and tongue and she feels a globus sensation and constriction within her throat. She has taken a benadryl this morning with no improvement.  Patient was recommended to seek care in the ER.

                                                Right after the second dose less than 2 minutes my heart rate began to spike. I could feel my heart pumping fast. I couldn?t sit due to this so I began pacing the room. I didn?t know this was a side affect so I thought I was over thinking the second dose. I attributed this to all the worry and doubt the media and people around me try pumping in your head. I thought I was having a panic attack. I didn?t alert any of the medical team there because again, I thought I was over thinking it. A few hours later my heart rate had gone down. My Apple Watch helped me monitor this. The next day I felt pain at the injection site, not my normal self, groggy. Slightly feverish and chilled. I work in a cold environment so I couldn?t quite tell if the chilled feeling was a side effect, or the room. Later that evening around 9pm things took a turn. I began running a low grade fever and was shaking from being so cold. About another hour late my fever was up to 101 and I was still shaking from being so cold. I took about 600mg of ibuprofen. I couldn?t sleep, tossed and turned. Probably another hour later my temperature was 102, still shaking uncontrollably. Covered in about 5 blankets I kept waiting it out. And I?d say around 2-3am I could feel my fever breaking. By late morning my temp was back to normal but I felt achy still. Tired, sore. Definitely sore at my injection site. And I don?t know if this is worth mentioning or not but just haven?t been able to shake that panic attack feeling. Like a worry or a dread over me. I just don?t feel as clear-headed as I did before. This is my biggest concern. Just don?t feel myself yet.

A 31-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose in deltoid right for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on 03Jan2021 and within 15 minutes had a generalized headache. Later that night she had generalized muscle weakness and pain, but really didn&#39;t think too much about it. The next day at work (04Jan2021), she had numbness on the right upper side of her lip and a pins and needle feeling in the right upper quadrant of the face. Had a lot of pain in the area as well on the right upper side of the face as well as a dull aching pain that lasted for hours. Later that day when using the computer and she was trying to reach for her mouse she noticed her right hand wasn&#39;t able to feel anything and that lasted about 20-25 minutes. Kept slapping the mouse with her hand, but could not feel anything, her hand went numb. Yesterday (05Jan2021), she had the same pins and needle feeling in the same area of the face and that dull achy feeling and it occurred for hours and it was very kind of debilitating for her at work.  Later that night she had pain in her right leg and felt the same way, that very severe achiness, which was the pins and needles feeling up and down the leg and underneath the right foot. All these symptoms tend to be on her right side and it definitely lasted for hours. It started about 1 and didn&#39;t end until 6-7pm. It even hurts to move the right eye in one direction and hurts to speak, the pain was so bad. This morning (06Jan2021) she had to call out of work because at 3am the generalized headache, pain was unbearable. She was still experiencing the pain in right leg and bottom sole of right foot. She did not receive any vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. She had made an appointment with a neurologist and will have a MRI done on Friday, 08Jan2021. No further details provided. All events required a visit to physician office. All events were reported as serious per medically significant. The outcome of all events was not resolved. The reporter considered all events were related to the vaccine.   Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal relationship, causality between reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On  12/25 I was driving home and my left arm got numb, tingly and weak to the the point where I thought I was suffering from a stroke.  I  rushed to my moms and had her to drive me to the hospital where they did a neuro check to include a CT scan which ruled out the stroke but the symptoms lasted about 4 days which came and went with the pain and intensity varying each time which ended around 12/29.  I suffered from body aches and night chills one night.  Around the 12/29 I began to have pressure around the back of my head which felt as if I was laying on bricks when I laid down.  It got to the point to where I couldnt sleep which caused me to go back to the ER on  1/1 where I was given  toradol, decadron and sudafed which allowed me to sleep. I was released from the ER with Motrin 800 and contined to take that and Tylenol until the headaches ceased  which was about 3 or 4 days later. The headache went away but the pressure still remained.  My lymph glands were swollen so I was also given a prescription for amoloxicillin.

                                                1/12 0715: Received Pfizer covid-19 vaccine dose 2 at end of shift. Went home to sleep after waiting 15 min.  1630: Woke up. Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

Symptoms continued all through the day and next night. Fever resolved 1/15 in the am with highest fever that day being 99, muscle aches still persisted and headache persisted through the day. This day the headache was the worst symptom and it was very severe. The new thing that started on this second day post vaccination was nausea and abdominal pain which was not present as badly the day after.

Went back to sleep and woke up around 4 am with fever up to 100.6F, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, and extreme fatigue. My left axilla was swollen with arm pain to mid left chest and back, and my axillary lymph node was painful and swollen to about the size of a large grape. I took 440 mg of Aleve around 8:30 when the fever did not subside. The fever broke and did not return. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. My left axillary lymph node is still palpable as of today, 1/15.

No fever was ever noted, but I felt hot through most of the next day. The body aches impaired my ability to work on 1/12/2021 and as a result I called out sick. These symptoms resolved the morning of 1/13/2021 and I have felt fine since.

This was swiftly followed by a feeling of tightness in my throat, shortness of breath, and coughing. In addition I had a moderate to severe headache. The hospitals rapid response team was called and I was brought to the emergency department on-site. I was given a racemic epinephrine and albuterol neb treatment which resolved upper airway stridor and cough. I received PO Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone. A EKG was completed. I was observed in the emergency department for about 2 hours until discharge. I was discharged with prescriptions for an Epi-Pen, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The diagnosis on my after visit summary was: Allergic Reaction. I was unable to finish my scheduled shift as an RN.

Very fatigued. At night I threw up and about 2AM I woke up drenched in sweat and I did not take my temperature. I woke up around 7AM and I had a migraine for about 2/3 hours - pounding headache. I took Tylenol, My body was really achy and my arm was like it was dead. General malaise, fatigue, it felt like I had a hangover, from my pounding headache. I threw up once again in the afternoon. Not sure if pregnancy related or the vaccine. Sunday morning I started feeling a little better. Saturday I felt horrible.

                                                About an hour after getting the shot, I did get extremely light headed and pulled my car over to get gas. I then noticed a rash all down the arm I got the vaccine and all over my chest and up my neck. I felt extremely hot. I got back in my car and sat at the gas station waiting for the lightheadedness to pass. I did call my GP at that time to make sure everything was OK. The nurse said that it sounds like a reaction but as long as I do not feel like I can not breathe or that my throat was swelling I should be ok. They advised me to eat something and also take benadryl once I got home. Rash stayed for a total of 2 days and today (3rd day) I only have a rash at the injection site. Its very red and hot to touch. Other symptoms I have/still have was very bad headache, fever (highest was 102.8 and today 3 days later is still over 101). Body aches, chills and the first 24 hours I felt like my internal organs were hot (sounds really weird!)

Since then the pain has increased and is now worse on my right hand side-arms, feet; leg-up the glutes and face. I was seen on Urgent Care on 01/22/21 and was told to take OTC ibuprofen. Since symptoms worsened I went to ED on 01/24/21 and was told to keep taking ibuprofen and follow-up with my PCP. I saw my PCP on 01/25/21 and was told to continue monitoring symptoms, continue ibuprofen and f/u in week. I was also prescribed an Hydroxyzine to help with anxiety.

A 31-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient claimed that on the first dose, she felt part of the dose run down her arm or at least had that sensation. The inoculator thinks the complete dose was injected. The patient was upset and wants a recommendation on if she should need a repeat of her first dose. The patient asked if there was any data on repeating the first dose vs. no action and proceed with the second dose in 21 days. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                8 days after my  first vaccine shot, on Jan 19th night, I suddenly started having  pain in the chest. The pain was located in the left side of the lower end of the sternum, in the epigastric region. Pain lasted for 3-4 hours. Initially it was severe, pulsating, acute pain as if nerve pressing against chest. Unbearable pain. I was unable to lie down, turn on sides. Pain would aggravate on movements and if I would touch the specific spot in my chest. . Deep breaths reduced the pain to some extent. Pain severity decreased after 4 hours after which I started getting pain in my left arm, radiating to my pinky finger.  The pain also  radiates to left upper back on movements and exerting left arm for long time, especially typing computer keyboard, doing daily chores cooking, washing dirty dishes, sleeping on the side. ,I am unable to sleep on the left side, if I sleep on left side, I start getting tingling and numbness in my left arm. I did not take any pain medications until Jan 26th as the pain did not disappear. Once at night the pain also radiated to my left leg , I felt  numbness when I tried to sleep on my left side. Occasionally, I feel pain in my right arm and right back. The pain near the sternum area reduced significantly when I took two doses of Ibuprofen 600 on Jan 26th in the afternoon and night. The pain in left arm radiating towards left pinky still persists, with numbness and tingling  if I do daily task for longer duration. Ibuprofen helps to relieve pain temporarily.  Mild pain in right arm, neck and upper arm. I will continue to closely monitor my symptoms.

                                                I am reporting my symptoms through this avenue because the VAERS wouldn&#39;t let me complete my daily report on that day (no submit button found).  I had malaise a few hours after the shot. 12 hours after the shot, this turned into a fever that would peak at 103 within the next 12 hours. Fever was accompanied by severe chills, moderate headache, moderate muscle aches, mild joint aches, and mild nausea. I also had a swollen lymph node under my armpit ipsilateral to the injection, the diameter of a baseball. Discomfort from the lymph node was mild. The fever and chills were so bad that I couldn&#39;t do any daily activities and stayed in bed all day. I called a nurses line to ask them if I could take something for the discomfort and they advised Tylenol, so I took 1000 mg. Tylenol did bring down the fever to 101 and the fever rose back to 103, 9 hours after Tylenol. All the aforementioned symptoms lasted for 3 days, and the severe symptoms decreased in severity to &#34;moderate&#34; after about 36 hours.

I stated to have some facial swelling then my throat started to swell/tighten.  I was brought to the ED and an IV was started. They administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The throat swelling started to interfere with my speaking and vocals. They monitored me for 7 hours then I was discharged home. All symptoms returned within a few hours and persisted for a week following. My PCP took over care and prescribed me the following in replace of the medications the ER prescribed: Albuterol HFA, Dexamethasome, Pepcid, Benadryl, Z-Pak, Vitamin D 100,000iu, and Fish Oil. I missed a week of week then was released to work again on 1/25/21.

In the middle of the night, I developed a high grade fever (101.4), which was gone by the time I woke up. Later in the day a low grade fever returned and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck became enlarged. I called out of work for the next day, Monday, and completed the employee covid testing survey. Monday morning the lymph nodes in my neck were about the size of a golf ball and I was incredibly fatigued. Got tested for COVID (came back negative) and remained with an intermittent low grade fever, fatigue, headache, and sore throat for the remainder.

Medical history included having one thyroid and had a benign tumor removed from behind heart when she was young and birth control. Concomitant medication included benzalkonium chloride, sodium chloride (ALIVE) and desogestrel, ethinylestradiol (ISIBLOOM) for birth control. After taking the shot she got light headed as she was walking to her car on 20Jan2021 15:00. Didn&#39;t think nothing of it since she was nervous about taking the shot. Then once she got home, she got really tired. She only had one thyroid so the shot made me really sleepy and she had a few skipped heart beats while laying down. After she slept, she felt fine but weird then after being up for a few hours she would get restless again. She got light headed again the next day going to the grocery store then back restless. She didn&#39;t feel normal until this Tuesday, she was not feeling weird and she was not as tired as she had been since she took the shot. She had tried to get seen from her doctor but she was booked up. No treatment was received for the events. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was not pregnant. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No known allergies. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                At 10:35 I started feeling weird in my body like when I get either an asthma attack or flu type. It was an hour later when I first began to feel lightheaded, dizzy, chills, and then really cold. I started then coughing hard like my throat was closing up and hard to breathe. My chest got tight and had sharp pains right under my chest by my stomach side. My heart rate was fast to the point my watch alerted me at over 135. I took my rescue ProAir inhaler to help but it didn?t. I tried to settle down and not panic to make things worse on my asthma attack. I then had to lay down feel weak. Within the next 15-20 min I used my nebulizer at home to help me breathe. After one treatment it helped me tremendously but still felt tired, nauseous, fatigue, pounding headache, but no fever since I barely checked at 98.5.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine on Sunday, I had significant fatigue and sensitivity to light with watery eyes and a headache and was in bed all day. The next morning on Monday I woke with a pressure headache that was kept at bay with Advil. The headache stayed the same on Tuesday and Wednesday. By Thursday the headache was so uncomfortable I was having trouble working. It stopped responding to Advil and the pressure continued to increase on both sides of my head with sharp, shooting pains throughout that would come and go with the constant pressure. By Friday, I couldn?t co to use work and ended up calling into my PCP and advising them that I had a migraine that was very different from my normal migraines that I get (pain on left side behind eye, very nauseous, sensitive to light, always responds to OTC meds) and it wouldn?t respond to Advil and asked them to call in something. They called in generic version of Imitrex that evening; but since this migraine was so different than my normal pattern, I went to the ER on Saturday. They did a CT scan to make sure there were no  brain bleeds and gave me IV magnesium and steroids. I declined the torodol and Benadryl. The headache was still there, but bearable finally when I left. It got worse again that evening and I ended up taking the imitrex at 3am and falling asleep, only to wake up at 7am with a skull splitting feeling. That feeling stayed for the next 4 days, slowly getting less intense. I was unable to workout any of these days (I workout for about an hour daily for the past 3 years) because it was extremely exacerbated by activity. I was not hungry. Finally on Thursday I felt more like my normal self but the headache remained slightly and now on Sunday all that is left is the sharp, shooting pains that come every so often and light sensitivity.

After ER visit I was advised to take Zyrtec and Benadryl. I&#39;ve paired it with Mucinex to get rid of phlegm build-up and the doctor prescribed Prednisone which I&#39;m going to start today (03/15/2021). So far I have less tightness/less tingling in heart area (still occurs randomly but not as opten) but still get fatigued and breathless real quick. I&#39;ve also had sporadic headaches brain fog, body chills/aches/weakness/difficulty concentrating. Also had face numbness for 4 days.

Waited 30 minutes after vaccination and left the clinic and felt fine. About 15-30 minutes later she was driving around running errands and was drinking water in the car and she noticed that it was becoming hard to swallow. Felt dizzy and disoriented and called her allergist. She carries epi pen because she gets allergy shots due to dog and cat allergies. Epi pen is for potential reaction to allergy shot. Allergist advised her to call EMS. She called EMS and they told her to administer the epi pen. She administered epi pen and began to feel symptoms improve. EMS arrived and she felt better and was not transported to the hospital. She drove herself home and was fine the rest of the day. She also had a topical reaction to the band-aid on her arm, with blisters and ripping off her skin. She generally has allergy issues with adhesives.

                                                I received the first Pfizer vaccine on 3/16/21 in the afternoon. I am a young, healthy woman with no pre-existing health conditions: I don&#39;t smoke, am under 120 lbs., no allergies, etc. Two days after the vaccine, I started to experience an eye twitch, which progressed into Bells Palsy by the following week: by 3/23/2021.   I went to an urgent care clinic and was diagnosed as such, and they contributed to the vaccine and told me not to get the second shot. They also advised I get a CT scan to rule out a stroke, which I did,  on 3/24/21. I expect that they also reported this. I have facial paralysis on the left side of my face, and developed an ear infection a week after this...I don&#39;t have allergy issues, and have not had an ear infection since I was a small child. This has been traumatic, uncomfortable and very scary because I thought I was having a stroke.

My wrists, elbows, neck, and back hurt very very bad. I used all of my energy to get up and slide a window open and it hurt my wrist so bad it literally brought me to tears. I&#39;m dehydrated and hot, but no temperature. I&#39;m tired and in pain. I&#39;ve taken Ibuprofen and acetaminophen today. I&#39;m going to bed and hope it&#39;s better tomorrow.

A 31-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6201) at age of 31 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included spinal cord injury due to MVA in 2012, neurogenic (incontinent) bladder and bowel, bladder augmentation and mitrofanoff, chronic neuropathic pain, dependent of wheelchair. Patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included lavender oil (lavender, helichrysum, jasmine). Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 administered in Arm Left on 28Jan2021 01:45 PM (Lot Number: EL8982) at age of 31 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and no reaction on previous exposure to drug. With first menstrual period after receiving vaccine patient had vomiting, chills, sweating, muscle pain, and her head and heart were pounding. It felt bad enough to go to emergency room but she waited it out at home and it lasted a few hours. Patient had a spinal cord injury so the symptoms were similar to what she got with autonomic dysreflexia, but this was the worst case of it she had ever had. She hadn&#39;t vomited in 10 years (or before her spinal cord injury). Patient still had muscle pain in her shoulders and neck. Adverse event start date was on 25Apr2021 12:00. No treatment received. No covid prior vaccination. No covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Autonomic dysreflexia is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.  Medical history of spinal cord injury due to MVA in 2012 may provide a plausible explanation for the event. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 32-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(lot number EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at Arm Left on 21Dec2020 (from 16:30 to 17:00) at the age of 32 years old at single dose for doesn&#39;t want to bring COVID home to her family. The medical history included Migraine headaches. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had so many immunizations for international travel, had Yellow Fever vaccine, all of the Guardasil vaccines, had MMR vaccine four times because she never developed immunity to it until the fourth round, got a flu shot yearly,got TDap vaccine every five years because she was an HCP, did Emgality shots( not done it this month. Emgality had a protein inhibitor, was supposed to get Emgality shot on 21Dec2020). On 22Dec2020 the patient experienced severe serum sickness, high fever, body aches to the point that she was shaking uncontrollably, sore throat that was as painful as a strep infection; Caller mentioned she was taking tylenl and benadryl for her symptoms. The patient was a Nurse Midwife. She got the vaccine on Monday evening at 4:30PM. Feeling like she was having a weird serum sickness. Woke up in the middle of the night and she was full of shakes to the point the bed was shaking. She had a fever over 101. Felt like she was having an extreme immune response. She was taking Tylenol and Benadryl around the clock. Woke up this morning and her throat feels sore to the point of Strep. Wondering if she need to distance and get some kind of test. Has been wearing a mask all of the time and doesn&#39;t know of anyone people who have COVID that she has been in contact with. Feels congestion and sore throat. Shakes and chills: Began at 02:30. Hard core chills and shakes. High fever over 101: same time as chills and shakes. Woke up from a dead sleep. Didn&#39;t have a working thermometer but knows her temperature must have been over 101 by the way she felt. She didn&#39;t feel that crappy unless her fever is over 101. She can gauge her own temperature. She experienced throat soreness: Felt like sharp razor blades. The patient was taking numbing throat lozenges. Seriousness: Would say serious. Didn&#39;t require hospitalization. She self-treated. Had she not had to work, she would probably have stayed in bed. Has been taking round the clock medicine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported serious events including severe serum sickness, high fever, body aches, shaking uncontrollably, sore throat that was as painful as a strep infection, feels like having an extreme immune response, congestion, chills, woke up from a dead sleep and the administration of the COVID 19 immunization with BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.

                                                Recieved the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccination on Dec 26th 2020, and had no major adverse reaction to vaccine except for mild soreness and heat around injection site and intense fatigue for three days after. Symptoms went away after the 4th day. Two weeks later on Jan 5th 2021, i began to notice an intense itching, burning, and swelling at the injection site. Pain and soreness in arm made it difficult to do my job and seem to just get worse. Upon the next morning of Jan 6th 2021, pain remained but itching had gone down, but intense burning, soreness and massive redness around injection site remained and seemed to be getting worse. Pain remains and redness has not gone down, arm is very tender near site and lifting and moving arm is very stiff and sore. Feeling of lump or stiffness on injection site comes and goes and feeling of heavy and sore muscles move from upper left arm down to elbow and extend to hand; making movement and function slowed or slightly numb. Stiffness in arm and intense heat at injection site makes it uncomfortable to move or use arm. Cold tingling sensation on occasion and stiffness in elbow joint. Slight dizziness and fatigue follow with pain in arm. Was informed to see a physician on Jan 6th, 2021 who said to fill out vaccination adverse event report and to keep an eye on arm. If pain or symptoms become worse to return.

                                                As soon as I received my shot it was like an electric shot from the injection shot, up the back of my neck, into my brain. I was instantly woozy and disoriented. They moved me to observation. My hemiplegic migraine started within 10 minutes of the vaccine. I take a preventative every day, and to be honest after the vaccine it was like I had never, ever taken my preventatives. The migraine I got that day is the worst one I have experienced since the first one I ever got.   Now on top of the migraines, the vaccine gave me waves of new symptoms. I was having spells of intense heat flashes, with wooziness, and nausea. So the new symptoms were paired with the hemiplegic migraines that, if you aren?t familiar with, mimic strokes because my whole left side tends to go limp, and I struggle with speech, and cognitive issues. So it really wasn?t all too long before the nurse kindly suggested that I didn?t look great and we should head to the ED.  They treated the migraine, gave me a CT, everything came back fine. They reached out to my neurologist, gave me some fluids, really they wanted to keep me a little longer, but I know the migraine drill and just wanted to go home and sleep and eat. I promised to follow up with my neurologist and fill out my CDC form.  Over the next week the migraine and extra symptoms seemed to slowly but surely let up. The only note worthy thing was really that my left side would get extra tender at times. Not just my injection site, but it was almost like all my nerve endings all over my left side were on fire at times and a pinch on the thigh may as well have been a stab, or a pat on the back a punch. It was pretty intense at times.   And just when I thought it was all over my menses started, you see my hormones trigger my migraines. And once again it was like I wasn?t on a preventative. I had an intense Migraine start. I was able to take my bail out medication (sumatriptan) though and get to work. I moved forward with my day, and just when I thought all was normal, I got one of those brutal heat flashes, the room started moving, and I was nauseous. Unfortunately I was in full PPE, I almost passed out, I had to get a coworker to help, they had to get my supervisor. It was a big, unnecessary-necessary, pride-wounding scene.  Now I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I might speculate that people with neurological deficits, like myself, are going to have a harder time with this inactive Covid strand. I would much rather be immune to Covid then catch it though, so whatever I can do to help, and protect myself and family and friends and neighbors, I will absolutely do... But I imagine there is probably an adjustment to be made here for the neurologically impaired.  Thanks for your time, and let me know if you have any questions.

I could not change my own clothes my myalgias and joint pain were so severe. I was sobbing in my kitchen and my fiancé had to help me move around the house. I was slowing my speech and mentation. Severe headache. I made my fiancé wake me up every two hours to make sure I wasn?t decompensating.

I let the nurse know under observation and she took my vitals and my BP was high for me as well 146/85.  I waited for an hour and then had my husband pick me up.  The tingling continued for a week and a half and made it impossible to sleep.  It?s slowly gotten better, but I still feel almost a palpitation/flutter feeling.

                                                within 1 hr post-vaccine on 1/7 I had a mild headache that resolved with Tylenol. At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

                                                I work as an occupational therapist in acute care. On 12/28, I was helping a patient transfer from supine to sit. She required maximal assistance, and I was briefly in an awkward position with my trunk flexed and rotated towards the right during this transfer. I felt a pull in my left lower back. After this, I iced the area and took 400 mg ibuprofen and this relieved the mild pain I had.  The following two days, I made an effort to follow back precautions (avoid bending, lifting, twisting), avoided heavy lifting at work. On 12/29 in the morning, I felt only a mild soreness in my left lower back and was able to go on my workday without issue (avoiding heavy lifting) On 12/29 around 3 pm I received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. On 12/30 (day off work) from the time I woke up until around early afternoon I felt a mild weakness and heaviness in both of my legs. It was most notable when I was standing to cook for about  20-30 minutes that my legs felt shaky and I felt the need to sit. I was able to finish cooking without sitting, however, this sensation was abnormal for me as I normally am on my feet for most of the day with an active job without feeling shaky or weak.  Around 22:00 on 12/30 I had severe nausea for about an hour or so. I can&#39;t fully remember, but several days after 12/28 or 12/29 I started to feel a mild cold sensation in my lower back. I attributed this potentially to my mild back injury, but it was unclear.  The sensory change was intermittent and mild, and ongoing until recently. On 1/9 while at work, I started to feel a mild cold sensation below my belly button, in addition to the intermittent lumbar back cold sensation area. On 1/11 at work, the sensory changes to my lower abdomen and back were more apparent after assisting in a maximal assist transfer with a patient.  At this time, it was a combination of cold and burning sensations.

The chills resolved quickly (within 24 hours), but the headache, body aches, and fatigue have continued through today (one week after receiving the vaccine).  Ibuprofen has been the only treatment.  The symptoms temporarily improve after taking ibuprofen and then return.  I have not been able to exercise since receiving the vaccine and I missed one day of work (1/12/21). I have no history of adverse reactions to any other vaccines and I had no adverse reaction to the first dose. I work as a Clinical Nurse Leader on a Critical Care floor.  One of my directors suggested I submit a VAERS.

                                                24 weeks pregnant at time of 2nd shot. Shot given at 1430 on 1/27 in left deltoid. Felt great rest of day. @0500 on 1/28 woke up shivering uncontrollably. Mild fever of 100.5(highest recorded during this whole episode). Body aches, chills, sweats, headache rest of day. 1000 mg Tylenol helped with fever/chills but headache progressed to migraine w/nausea. Took 50 mg sumatriptan and 25 mg doxylamine in evening and this seemed to help with headache and allow me to get to sleep 1/28.  Woke up at 0300 1/29 with chills/cold sweats. Took 1000 mg Tylenol again (didn&#39;t check temp) and went back to sleep. Woke up at 0530 for work - checked temp since I&#39;m a healthcare worker and it was 100.4 (with tylenol). Waited until clinic opened up and called them at 0700 for recommendations on going to work or not (temp by then was 99.8, with tylenol). Was advised to stay home and if febrile tomorrow to get COVID tested on 1/30. As of right now (1300 on 1/29) headache has returned but mild. Body aches still. Temp 99.4 w/tylenol redosed at 1000.

Sunday January 24th: I started to feel just a general malaise and had some headaches, like I was coming down with something, but other than that felt fine.  Monday January 25th: I was at work and started developing a sore throat, chest tightness with some shortness of breath, myalgias, fatigue, nausea, and minor chills, although I never had a fever.   Tuesday: symptoms were slightly worse  Wednesday January 27th: I went to work thinking all these symptoms were still just from the vaccine as I hadn&#39;t felt any sickness symptoms before getting the vaccine and hadn&#39;t had an exposure I was aware of. While at work, I asked other coworkers if they had any similar symptoms to the vaccine and was told I should call employee health since I was still having such bad symptoms and really didn&#39;t feel too great. I called the employee health line and told them all my current symptoms which were all the same still. They told me that the sore throat and chest tightness with shortness of breath were definitely not from the vaccine and to leave work and get tested. I did this and my test came back negative. Because I was still having bothersome chest tightness, the employee health line also told me to go to the ER, thinking it could be something else significant.   I went to the ER the night of January 27th to get my symptoms all checked out as told to. Everything came back ok and the ER doctor wanted me tested for COVID again Friday around the 48 hour mark to verify it wasn&#39;t the virus. She also told me that if it came back negative, she was sure it must be my reaction to the vaccine.  Thursday January 28th: I stayed home per guidelines from employee health and still had all the symptoms listed on Monday. After a two hour afternoon nap, I finally felt like I was turning the corner. My sore throat felt better besides a huge lump still in my throat and my chest tightness with shortness of breath subsided. I still had bad myalgias, fatigue, headaches and a general sense of not feeling so great.  Friday, January 29th: Feeling slightly better again, main symptom is bad myalgias, especially my neck and small lump in throat. I got retested around 12:30 pm and it came back negative for COVID as well as negative for strep.   Saturday: Feeling almost 100% better besides sore neck still.

                                                After I got the vaccine, I started feeling warm and it felt like needle pricks in my muscles. Body was painful. I lost my appetite  but wasn&#39;t vomiting or having nausea. I had a migraine and fever and body aches and chills (I was either freezing or hot) - couldn&#39;t get warm enough - these symptoms I noticed about midnight - it woke me up after a couple hours of sleep and then I couldn&#39;t sleep. These symptoms lasted through to Monday. Tuesday, I wasn&#39;t feeling fantastic but I went back to work. Fever broke on Sunday morning. Migraine lasted five days. I took Tylenol for fever and ibuprofen for other symptoms. I had a virtual Dr appt on Friday, the 8th. I took migraine medicine but it wasn&#39;t really helping. I met again with Dr on 11th - virtual. I chose to go back work even though I wasn&#39;t better - felt fatigue and the headache on and off for a couple of weeks. Just since the beginning of February do I feel like fatigue has gone away.  When I work out, I do still notice that I get tired faster.

                                                On Sunday, 2/21 both forearms, wrists, and thumbs began swelling and experiencing stiffness, tension, and pain (6/10) that was both burning/nerve pain and achy muscle pain. Previously, my DeQuervein&#39;s had been steadily improving through occupational therapy, home exercise, reduced tech use (scrolling/typing), and splinting.  By Tuesday, 2/23, range of motion on the Left hand, wrist, and thumb was reduced to almost 0 and the pain reached an steady 9/10 on both arms. As of writing this, the stiffness, swelling, nerve pain, and tension remain at a level higher than the initial level that drove me to seek out occupational therapy back in January.  Basically, I went from being close to being discharged to worse than I started. Overall the left side was worse than the right but both sides were impacted.  Occupational therapy (ultrasound, fascial release, and assisted stretching) splinting, stretches, and ice were used as treatments. NSAIDs are contraindicated due to Crohn&#39;s disease.   As of writing this at 16:04 on Thursday, 2/25 none of this has resolved. Pain is a 7/10 on both sides. Range of motion and ability to complete daily care tasks (e.g. dressing, showering, cooking and eating) is nonexistent to minimal.

                                                Within 2 minutes of vaccine receipt the patient became agitated. She was noted to have erythematous macules on her upper back consistent with hives. Her heart rate and respiration rates were normal. She was observed initially as the family reported that she gets hives with all injections. However, about 2 minutes later she began to retch and stated that her throat was burning and she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was administered 0.3mg of epinephrine via an autoinjector. Her shortness of breath and throat burning symptoms resolved almost immediately. She was then given 10mg of Cetirizine PO and transported via local EMS for evaluation at the Hospital ED.

                                                I had excruciating pain during the injection, which progressively worsened afterward reaching 10/10 L shoulder pain within several hours of the injection. The L shoulder pain was so bad that I could not sleep that night, and the L shoulder pain was unrelieved with OTC Tylenol or Ibuprofen. I also noticed a new swollen lymph node under my left armpit the next morning. The L shoulder pain slightly decreased within 48 hours, but I have continued to have limited ROM of my left shoulder, a steady achey pain of my L shoulder, popping and crunching of my L shoulder with movement of my L shoulder, and difficulty abducting or flexing my L arm past 90 degrees since the injection. 2 weeks post-injection I saw an orthopedist who said my symptoms were caused from the vaccine injection and known as SIRVA (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration). He said I was injected too high, leading to injection of the vaccine material into my subacromial/subdeltoid bursa, causing persistent inflammation of the soft tissue leading to bursitis. He had to perform an US guided Toradol injection to attempt to calm down the inflammation caused from the injection.  I have a 4-week follow up with the orthopedist in April. He indicated that an MRI may be required to further evaluate my shoulder.

                                                The day after the second dose I felt sweaty hot and nauseous. I was still really sleepy on the third day. My eye started hurting and I could hear a buzzing sound in both ears. It got worse and worse by day six and I was having trouble seeing out of my right eye. It was really painful underneath my eye on the inside corner with swelling on the top lid. The Steroids seemed to help the problem with my eye. The doctor suspected Bells Palsy. On week two I was prescribed steroids from Lymphadenopathy. I still have the ringing in my ears which is increasing after it had subsided for a little time. I also felt pressure in my ears which is very uncomfortable. Whenever I stop taking the Steroids the ringing in my ears returns like Tinnitus. I plan to reach out to a doctor again because the ringing in my ears has returned after it had improved but was still present after 10 weeks. I did not have any of the same symptoms after the same dose. I have seen a lot of professionals.

Patient was sweating profusely, white to the face, and not speaking very much but would answer questions correctly. EMT was speaking with the PT before walking away to continue other monitor duties when he turned back to see patient limp in chair, head back, eyes rolled back, and some twitching movements of the body. EMT called for rapid response  because first thought of seizure and seizure like activity with the twitching movements. EMT got to patient, supported head up straight, and opened jaw to ensure airway was clear. Patient had no response to EMT trying to communicate. Sternum rub was performed where patient came back conscious nearly instantly. PT was unresponsive for roughly 10-15 seconds. Patient was told of what happened and vitals were taken on her, response team was cancelled with most them already on scene. PT was feeling better, sweating stopped, color to the face returned, and PT was speaking and understanding more clearly than before. PT was given a snack and water and was monitored by EMT for an additional 15mins before patient and staff were confident with her leaving.

I am having trouble walking straight and I bump into things or trip over them.  I have fallen because I was not steady.  If I get up too fast everything gets dark and it feels like I&#39;m going to pass out.  I&#39;m also experiencing brain fog: it&#39;s hard to think and I&#39;m really forgetful.  It also seemed to trigger a manic episode, like the first vaccine did.  I can&#39;t sleep my normal amount.  My initial effects, for the first 48 hours, were the typical pain, headache, and intense fatigue.  Those are mostly better, aside from fatigue and mild headache.

                                                Approx 9 hours after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I began having uncontrollable chills, could not get warm, spiked a fever of 100.4, severe body aches, barely could not move.  It was all I could do to finish my shift at work, drive home, get in the shower, and pass out in bed to sleep.  I slept a good solid 10 hours, woke up for work...fever was then gone and chills, but I had a severe headache, still had severe body aches/fatigue, but I also lost my sense of taste and smell.  I ate a waffle which tasted like cardboard, drank cranberry juice (my mouth puckered like it was tart, but I could not taste it at all).  I reported to work but was immediately sent home by my employee health nurse to be seen by a health care provider and to be tested for COVID-19.  I went home and slept an additional 5 hours, did not do anything at home but rest, and slept a solid 12 hours straight that night.  Still could not smell and taste.  The following day, I could smell things like Vicks vapor rub and I could taste things minimally like when I initially bit into them, or on the back end if that makes sense.  Still had body aches and fatigue, but nothing like that previous day or the night before that.  I was then told that evening my PCR test was negative, and I could report to work the following day.  1/14/2021, I felt almost completely back to normal, and I could smell and taste.

My left arm hurt really bad all day  12/22 By the afternoon felt more normal except my arm still hurting really bad.  12/26 was shoveling dirty and suddenly my arm where I got the injection started hurts and I got very nauseated again.  On 12/29 the cdc called me because I did the vsafe program.

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

Throbbing in temples, eye pressure, pressure on top of head, worsened when I would bend over. Did not take any medication, worried it would impact immune response. Drank a lot of water, slept, did some sled massage, and gentle yoga/stretches. By that evening pain level had dropped down to about a 4. Woke up the next morning with 2-3 level pain, was able to go to work without being distracted by pain. Still felt more pressure behind eyes and top of head when I bent over. Next day all symptoms resolved, except very minor tenderness at injection site only when palpated.

                                                The same night as the vaccine, I developed a fever greater than 101.5 and developed bad chills throughout entire  night. Could not sleep because of chills. Next morning, developed severe legs pains and deep muscle pain - both legs - both calves, both sides. Resulted in me having to miss that day of work. I called my Dr&#39;s office and they advised to go to ER for severe leg pain. I didn&#39;t because I had a pharmacist that I work with who had advised me that I could wait. Similar symptoms to when I got COVID (on Dec 28th). Did have the same moderate arm pain in location of vaccine. Fever stayed above 100 for 48 hours. And the chills went away after 12 hours.  Around the clock Tylenol that stated when I got the vaccine - 1000 mg every six hours scheduled. Fever resolved after 2 days. Chills after 12 hours. Leg pain from severe on 15th - to moderate pain next day and on 18th the pain is more mild. Pain in legs haven&#39;t resolved entirely but much better.

I took 650 mg Tylenol, fell back asleep, woke up at 330 am sweating and less achy. Awoke again at 7 am with terrible headache, nausea and upset stomach. Injection site swollen, reddened and painful to touch; took another 650 mg of Tylenol without much relief. Entire body was extremely sensitive to the slightest bit of touch or pressure. Had a hazy feeling in my head, felt mildly dizzy for hours. Around 230 pm on 1/19/21 I began sweating profusely for about 15 minutes and when that ceased  I felt almost back to normal immediately. By the following day I was feeling 100% OK other than injection site discomfort. Today, 1/23, is the first day since receiving my second dose that my arm Only slightly hurts and itches.

                                                Starting several hours after getting the second vaccination I started to experience systemic myalgias, arthrias, and chills.  It got to the point where it was difficult to type.  I left work early that day.  The following morning, 01/14/21, I woke around 06:30 with searing, shooting pains systemically.  There were severe nausea, chills, and fatigue.  I was unable to get out of bed for the better half of the day and took a sick day.  I was able to go into work, 01/15/21, but continued to experience extreme fatigue, cognitive blunting, chills, arthralgias, and myalgias.  Over that weekend I slept 12&#43; hours each day and into MLK day, 01/18/21.  I went into work on 01/19/20 and continued to experience ongoing fatigue (difficult to walk from my office to the bathroom down the hall), chills, the nausea appeared to return, and intermittent chills/arthralgias/myalgias.  I spoke with the physician at the hospital and he directed me to get tested for COVID.  Details below.  This was on 01/19/21.  I continues to experience these symptoms throughout this week: 01/20-01/22/12.  The interval between the chills/arthralgias/myalgias is increasing but the nausea appears to be lingering.  Chills have basically resolved.

My temperature  was 102, then  my fever rose to 104.5 for most of the night. I did not sleep because my body was shaking and shivering. My body ached all over, especially my lower back. It felt like a very bad flu. My fever continued onto the next day and stayed around 103.7. I slept most of the day- had to call out of work. Tuesday morning my fever was gone and I went to work then went home because my fever spiked again to 101 about mid day. I slept all day and took Tylenol. By Wednesday my Fever was gone but I was still very lethargic. Thursday I felt fine.

                                                Severe neck pain and lower back of the head pain that was debilitating. I could not move my head left or right without pain. I went to urgent care and told it was just muscle tension, but the pain was intense enough where I couldn?t go to work.  This was about 2 days after the first dose and lasted a few days before going away.   With the second dose I just received, it looks like my skin was scraped slightly. It burns.

                                                I had a mild anaphylactic reaction five minutes after getting the vaccine.  The hives and tight throat went away after several doses of medication. The redness and itching last 4-5 days. I had to stay on Benadryl and Zyrtec to help with the redness and itching.  My job sent me to the ER to be monitored after getting the shot until I went home. The fatigue lasted for a whole week.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine I felt a rush of numbness/tingling/cold starting from my feet that worked it&#39;s way up to my head. Once the feeling got to my chest my HR increased.  Some SOA, suspected due to feeling of panic.  Feeling passed after about 3 minutes but kept coming back in waves about every 10-15 minutes.  Took Benadryl 25 mg at about 2:30 to see if it would help, symptoms calmed down at about 4:00.  The following morning on 1/30, the immediate symptoms had gone away.   By 1/30 evening, starting developing  constant numbness to BLE below knee. As of today, 2/4.  The numbness is still present.

A 33-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 02Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the COVID vaccine a couple hours ago on 02Feb202 and was very lightheaded. When the patient was asked to provide her mailing address, she stated she was feeling really weird, the vaccine was really taking a big toll on her brain function, she was super dizzy and feels just weird, like everything is in slow motion. Lightheadedness started probably about 20 minutes after she had the shot, they made her wait for 15 minutes, now she just feels really weird. The patient was healthy, she just got blood tests back and everything said she is healthy. She thought they said to call if she was having a side effect of dizziness or weakness, as they are more serious, but she called her doctor and they said to call Pfizer. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: unknown results on unspecified date.

                                                Patient was being held for monitoring after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.  Within 1-2 minutes, patient developed facial redness and itching.  She then started to feel as if her throat was itchy and started coughing uncontrollably.  Denied lip or tongue swelling.  Was feeling normal prior to receiving the vaccine.  Was not recently seen/assessed for other medical care.  No similar symptoms previously.  Patient was taken to the Emergency Department.   Ptaient did have a few red splotches on her chest, but these did not appear consistent with urticaria per the ED physician&#39;s report.  ED physician felt patient&#39;s symptoms may be secondary to anxiety.  However, given history of anaphylaxis and feeling of throat itching it was felt necessary to treat for possible allergic reaction.  Patient was given epinephrine, Benadryl, famotidine, and Solu-Medrol.  She was then monitored in the ED for 4 hours.  During this time, she developed no new symptoms.  She continued to breathe easily with normal and stable vital signs.  She was discharged with instructions  to buy OTC Benadryl 25mg PO to take every 8 hours for 48 hours.  Prednisone 20mg, 3 tablets orally daily for 5 days weas prescribed.  An EpiPen was also prescribed.  Patient advised not to receive second dose of the vaccine and to follow up with her primary care provider.

A 33-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264 and Expiration Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 17:45 at 33-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; with no other vaccines administered within four weeks of the bnt162b2 administration.  Medical history included anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to 16Feb2021.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: Bell&#39;s palsy on left side of face (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, vision has been off/ vision is blurry (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, numbness and tingly/burning sensation in right leg (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, brain fog (medically significant) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which required a physician office visit. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, she began having symptoms on the following Saturday and was seen by her doctor and diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. The patient stated she has reported this via VSafe and the Pfizer website. The patient also reported other symptoms that have not been reported as follows: had tingling in both legs, brain fog, and vision has been off. The patient was not sure if it was related to the vaccine or steroids. The patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose. The patient had been on a steroid, so she did not know if she should wait to get the second dose. The patient just stopped the steroid on 16Feb2021, and the second dose was scheduled for 23Feb2021.  The patient also said she had other symptoms that she had not reported and she said she had tingling that started in one leg now in both legs, brain fog and her vision was off and she was not sure if that was related to the vaccine or the steroid (later clarified as prednisone). The patient was not taking the steroids at the time of diagnosis. &#34;Correct I mean it started after the vaccine, but I was also on medication (Clarified as Prednisone) so I am not really sure what the difference is at this time.&#34; Treatment in response to event: the patient stated, &#34;No I mean for the tingling in my leg I have been just putting heat and Ice on it but I have not done anything actual big treatment and then for my eyes no, my doctor is not sure what is related to the Bell&#39;s Palsy and what is to medication.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work: unknown result on an unspecified date (patient stated, &#34;Yes, I have many&#34;).  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of facial paralysis, hypoaesthesia, burning sensation, and paraesthesia; which included steroids and anti-viral and anti-nausea medicine.

I felt like I had taken adrenaline or steroids and couldn?t sleep that might. The next morning I did not want to get out of bed. My body, particular along my spine, was in so much pain that I began crying. On Monday I called in sick to work. I had almost total numbness in my left arm arm, hand, and upper body. Periodically my heart would race and feel as if was about to beat out of my chest. I started to black out in the grocery store and continue feel dizzy and weak. This is my second day off of work and I have only gotten out of bed to perform essential tasks. I am nauseated and am having trouble eating. I feel like I?ve been run over by several cars and can?t feel my left pinkie. I don?t remember ever feeling this bad for any past illness.

                                                The day after second injection, I started having sensitivity to temperature on hands and feet, left arm pain(not just at the injection site), and numbness of hands and feet on and off.  When cold air hit my legs I would get a bone chilling pain.  When washing my hands if the water got above warm it was was painful.  My hands and feet were falling asleep at night and waking me up due to being uncomfortable.. This lasted about two weeks.  A week in I called the vaccine clinic who contacted my doctor.  My doctor had me wait another week before setting up an appointment.  I want to urgent care in the mean time due to anxiety over the situation and the doctor there diagnosed a pinched nerve in my neck.  I met with my regular doctor a few days later and symptoms were at a minimal.  She told me to fill out this form and take Advil if the pain continued.

                                                Within 15 minutes - hot and flushed, headache. Dizzy.  Fever onset first night. Lowgrade, sub 100.4. General bad feeling. Exhaustion, sore, muscle aches. Felt very hot and flushed even though fever was only 100. These symptoms lasted for 7 days. On day 3, Tuesday, I developed a dull aching pain in both arms. The feeling was like that of a charlie horse in your leg. Dull, painful, like slowly being crushed. Also felt hot pinpoints that itched all over my hands. My hands felt like they were burning, and the itchy pinprick feelings were mostly on my palms and fingers, but would sometimes present up towards my elbows. My hands were somewhat shaky, and still are. Once or twice my hand would flick involuntarily.  The sore hurting arm feeling extends all the way up to my shoulder blades.  On day 7 I went they gave me a steroid shot and a round of antibiotics. They said it was likely a sinus infection.  The symptoms persisted one more day but then the fever resolved Wednesday night, Tylenol took it down and it didn&#39;t come back Thursday. The headache, sore back and neck, and arm pain persisted. It is now day 10. I am most concerned about the arm pain, tingling, and shaking. Please advise on whether I should get my second dose. I might go to a hospital for further testing if this doesn&#39;t resolve or if it progresses.

                                                Arm pain is pretty bad.  It began 30-60 minutes after the injection and had steadily gotten worse. Injection site shows no redness or bruising, but the pain has been so bad it has interrupted sleep and is preventing me from being able to lift my arm or carry weight. 800mg Motrin and a heating pad seem to help, but I still have limited range of motion.  This feels similar to the ache from a tetanus shot, just worse.

Patients history includes contracting COVID back in June of 2020 for which she spent 2 days in the hospital.  In November of 2020, she reports she ended up in the hospital for another 2 days and was diagnosed with post-COVID POTS.  She then went to medical facility and underwent 6 treatments of hyperbaric oxygen in February of 2021. Patient states that after these treatments, she felt great.  She has reportedly been out of work since November, I believe, and was given the OK to return on 3/10/21.  She was also advised by her neurologist that she should take the COVID vaccine which she did on 3/15/21.  Two days later, on 3/17/21, she states that her POTS was &#34;triggered&#34; and she begain to experience dizziness, fainting, fatigue, headaches, nausea and vomiting and various GI issues. Currently, she states these symptoms are getting worse, instead of better, and she has been unable to work, missing last Thursday and Friday, and will be going home early today.  She asks if she should get her second COVID vaccine.  I advised that is something she needs to discuss with her primary care provider.

I began experiencing brain fog and memory loss. Then i began experiencing vertigo that impaired my spacial reasoning. On Tuesday 3/9 I lost the ability to see objects far away. on 3/10 I woke up and was unable to read close up, or distinguish letters. The vision and vertigo has continued. I have to shut my eyes completely to walk without becoming sick. I can not be in a busy room with movement or my eyes will hurt. I can not read anything with font smaller then size 18. I can not watch TV because i can no longer see far away. I can not drive a car due to the motion., and i cant see the objects as they move.

                                                Received shot ~12:15pm on March 21st. Only symptom throughout the day was sore arm, but tolerable. Around 10:30 PM, I was in bed and noticed that I feel &#34;agitated&#34; and restless. Looked at my FitBit and noticed that my heartrate was unusually high and climbing. My normal resting heartrate is 60-70 bpm. Last night from 10 PM and onward, it rose from 75 pm up to 130  bpm while I was laying down in bed. Soreness in my arm became much worse and more uncomfortable. I focused on breathing slowly and deeply to try to relax myself but did not have any effect. Throughout the night I could feel my heart racing, fluttering and palpitating. Sometimes I could feel &#34;pinching&#34; like sensations too. Every time I was able to fall asleep, I was quickly jolted awake by those fluttering and racing sensations in my chest. I got up ~2 hours later to get a drink of water and had a low-grade panic attack (lost sense of hearing), felt very weak and light-headed, started sweating profusely. Those symptoms let up a bit around 4AM and I was able to sleep lightly. I continued to feel &#34;agitated&#34; and restless all morning until about noon today, a full 24 hours after the shot, 12 hours after symptoms started. My resting heart rate finally started to return to normal at about that time as well. Felt fine and pretty normal by about 1:30ish PM today.

                                                I ultimately suffered from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis and was hospitalized for 5 days due to brain and spine inflammation.  I had numbness in my feet 2 days after my vaccine, then suffered from dizziness and nausea 3 days after my vaccine, and had face paralysis 4 days after my vaccine. I went to the ER 4 days after the vaccine and was told I have Bell&#39;s Palsy and Vertigo. I was prescribed oral steroids and anti-nausea medicine. In the following weeks, I had more tingleness/numbness of the legs, brain fog and confusion, blurred vision, unsteady gait, loss of balance, blurred vision and leg muscle weakness, increased anxiety, hearing sensitivity, lethargy, sleeplessness, 6th cranial nerve palsy, tingles in the face, and headaches. I finally got an MRI and when doctor?s saw the MRI results 3 days later, I was told to go to the ER immediately because I had brain and spine inflammation that needed treatment, and was diagnosed with ADEM. I then spent 5 days in the hospital to receive intravenous steroids and monitoring. During this stay, I had more MRIs and a lumbar puncture. I was released on oral steroids for 25 days, as well as follow up appointments and monitoring progress in recovery. Inflammation has decreased. I continue to have tingleness in lower extremities, headaches, pain in legs, and sensitive hearing.

A 33-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Mar2021 12:00 (at the age of 33-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: asthma and lactose Intolerance- not allergy though (as reported). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included: fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR), loratadine, bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and vitamins (as reported), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EN6200), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 20Feb2021 12:00 (at the age of 33-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient stated that 24 hours after her second dose (14Mar2021 12:00), she felt the worst feeling about to faint, all color drained from her face. She got tunnel vision/hearing and felt a &#34;static&#34; feeling all over her body. Then started throwing up. She took a nap and woke up an hour later with 101.2 (degree) fever (14Mar2021) and fought that, along with migraine, aches, chills, hot sweats (14Mar2021). About 8 hours after initial fever (14Mar2021), it spiked to 102.4 (degree) for two hours. It came down quick. The next day, 15Mar2021, it felt like the back of her skull was fractured. And since then (unspecified date), the back (mostly left side) of her head gets so tight and sore especially when laying down. She has been sleeping on heating pad for 10 days now, and it got a little better but still super sore (head). The events involved a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment was received for the back (mostly left side) of her head gets so tight and sore. There was no treatment for the other events. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                After I received my first dose I started to experience my first symptom on March 30, 2021. I noticed that I had a small lump on the left side of my rib cage beside my left breast which was about the size of a sausage link. The area wasn&#39;t painful, slightly tender to the touch and soft. By 4/3/21 the area has expanded to the upper portion of the scapula and it was no longer located on the side of my rib. It was about the size a pear and it was inflamed and very tender to the touch. I couldn&#39;t raise my arm and it was pertruding from my clothing and preventing me from sleeping at night on that side. By 4/5/21 the mass had turned into a different shape and direction and it was no longer just primarily on my scapula.. This current shape favored a boomerang and it started on my lower scapula and wrapped around my arm going directly into the middle of my arm pit.. It was about an 1.5 inches wide, inflamed, painful and wouldn&#39;t allow me to fully lift my arm or lay on it.. The mass was hard and didn&#39;t move, I visited a prompt care and they couldn&#39;t decipher what it was. I began to take tylenol and use cold compress and over a few days the mass began to decrease in size and I was able to increase my range of motion obtaining full extension on 4/17/21. The mass is now smaller than a pencil on 4/22/21 and hardly noticable but it was quite an experience.

                                                About 7 hours after my vaccine, I started experiencing chills and body aches. 9 hours after the vaccine, I felt as if I?d taken cold medicine. I was slow to react, felt ?foggy?, I had trouble recalling words and the names of household objects I was staring at, my movements weren?t coordinated and I dropped a few things. During the night, I was tired but had trouble sleeping. The body aches worsened and really concentrated in my joints, especially my spine. I stayed either in bed or on the couch the whole day following my vaccine but my heart rate (as read by my smart watch) would go from the 70?s to as high as 129 just from sitting up higher in bed. My normal resting heart rate is in the upper 50?s/lower 60?s and I don?t see 120&#43; unless I?m working out for at least 20 minutes. I didn?t take Tylenol or Motrin until 7 PM on April 19th (I took 800mg of Motrin) about 34 hours after my vaccine. I had a low grade fever and my head ached so bad all my teeth were throbbing before I took the  Motrin. I started to feel better within a hour of taking Motrin and was fine from then on. I only took Motrin the one time.

                                                cardiac arrhythmia; mental disorientation; dizziness; loss of balance; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). This 33-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose on 07Jan2021 14:30 for COVID-19 immunisation. The first dose was on 10Dec2020, 02:30 PM in left arm. Medical history was not reported. There was no known allergies. There was no covid prior vaccination, no covid tested post vaccination. There was no concomitant medication taken. There was no other vaccine in four weeks, no other medications in two weeks. Patient was healthy with no medical issues. Within 2 weeks of second shot, patient developed a cardiac arrhythmia on 21Jan2021 10:30 when she was at work. Patient had continued symptoms of irregular heart beat since then. Patient had had to go to the ED 2 times. Patient was now following with EP cardiology, treated with beta blockers. About 3 weeks after vaccine (in 2021), patient also developed mental disorientation, dizziness and loss of balance. Patient had had MRI brain, Holter monitoring, event monitoring, stress test and cardiac MRI, all with unknown results. Finally patient was on medications and 3 months later beginning to feel a bit better. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care; assessed as life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. The outcome of events was resolved with sequel.

                                                On Tuesday 12/28 I started to have severe leg pain in my right leg.  The next morning the pain was still in the right leg and had moved up through my right side in my joints to my knee, hip then went to the with shoulder down that arm.  My forearm became very painful on 12/30 and started to swell then radiated into my wrist joint and finger joints.  12/31 the pain continued in all those areas and had moved to my left side of my body starting with the left arm following the same course as the right side.  On 1/1 the pain has persisted and I am unable to perform any ADL&#39;s.  I saw an urgent care physician who told me to take ibuprofen.  I have been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol with no relief. Now all my joints are swelling in bilateral hands, wrist.  On 1/2 my bilateral ankle joints and feet started to have similar pain.  Know all my extremities are difficult to use and it is hard to walk due to the pain.  Because of the pain in my hands things feel heavier than what they should.  I am a medical provider and this almost seems like polyarthralgia rheumatica, I am going to go see a physician on Monday

On evening of 12/29 had sudden onset of mild neck pain and significant weakness and numbness of left arm, weak hand grip, clumsiness in hand . Did not improve after trying to shake arm/move around , and took prednisone 40mg oral. Went to ER and had CT Cspine which did not show evidence of cervical pathology. Continued with corticosteroids, sought consultation with PMR and neurology specialists, and steroid dose increased to 60mg/day.   Some improvement in strength , but still have diminished sensation and strength in left hand/arm. Unable to perform full job tasks as I am left hand dominant.  Likely brachial neuritis / parsonage turner syndrome per both specialists seen. Continuing with corticosteroids at this time, pending bloodwork and OT evaluation

It lasted until about 24 hours after the vaccine. Over the last week, I?ve had horrible insomnia, waking up multiple times throughout the night with difficulty falling back asleep. I didn?t think much of it other than it?s very unlike me until a handful of other coworkers vaccinated around the same have also been experiencing this.

                                                I developed a headache about 1 hour after the vaccine was administered.  Two hours later I developed a 100.4 temperature and malaise and body aches.  The injection site was swollen, tender to touch and warm.  The injection site area remained tender to touch and I was unable to lie on my left side to sleep for over 48 hours.  I continued to feel foggy and fatigued for 48 hours.  All symptoms have since resolved.

                                                I started experiencing soreness to left arm about 1-2 hours after injection but nothing else. I went to bed around 11pm. Then I was woken up in the night around 3am violently shaking, teeth shattering and unable to even stand straight from shaking so bad. I felt like I was freezing but skin was hot to touch. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take temperature at that time because it was in another family member&#39;s room. I felt nauseated as well. I took 600mg ibuprofen and tried to lay back down. At 3:59am my aunt woke and brought the thermometer downstairs. I could tell the ibuprofen was working some and fever was less as the shaking had calmed. I was able to check my temperature and it was 100.8F (an hour after the ibuprofen). I still took 100mg tylenol at that time.  As of this morning (after 7am) I am sore all over, tired and have a headache, temp 99.2F.

                                                Vaccine was received at 4:55pm. 8:30pm, I started to feel fatigued and disoriented. By 9am I started to feel muscle aches and sharp joint pain, as expected. By 1200 noon, the pain intensity was increasing, coming in waves, lasting 10-15 minutes. The pain waves were 10/10, very severe, and was causing me to shake, cry, and be unable to function or sleep. I was also very disoriented, but I think due to the pain. It was mildly relieved with ibuprofen/Tylenol alternating every 3hrs, but continued until 6pm. It began to subside at 6pm.  I am an RN, and sought the advice of my employee health nurse, who advised me to seek medical care if it continued through the night. The pain began to subside, so I did not. However, if a  non-healthcare person experiences that, they will think they are dying.

They put ice on back of neck. Arm started to hurt. Took Tylenol and sat down. And felt better 15 minutes later. Intervention was ice on back of neck so I wouldn&#39;t faint and rest. Overnight, first night - chills. Woke up with a headache. Took ibuprofen and Tylenol and had body ache and joint pain, too. Five days consistently (positionally) - when I laid down I would get it for five days. I had the vertigo which started 2 days after vaccine. Had a migraine 7 days after vaccine and I had to miss work because it was so severe. Had a typical migraine. Had an aura and it was so bad I couldn&#39;t see to drive to work. I don&#39;t ever get vertigo with my migraines and so this was different. After 7 days all symptoms were resolved. I am currently breastfeeding.

Felt as if I was intoxicated, lasted the whole day. Woke up the next morning and still felt &#34;out of it&#34; and weak but thought it would get better, went to work (im a nurse). Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

                                                The evening of the day I got the shot, I began to get tired and started to have a sore arm.  Throughout the night, the arm soreness got worse and I got joint pain.  The whole next day, I experienced severe malaise, headache, chills, fever, and joint pain with the site soreness.    The arm pain got worse.  That night, I struggled to sleep.  The whole day after that, I had less malaise and the fever had gone down but the injection site reddened and grew even warmer and more tender.  That evening it was difficult to sleep as the soreness in my arm migrated to the shoulder, armpit and the right side of my chest, along where a bra band would go on the distal right side of the chest.  The next morning (today) the entire armpit area and upper distal right side of the chest were hot and tender.  This afternoon, I palpated the area and noticed at least one swollen lymph node.  My arm still hurts.

Gradually  felt it in my whole body by 8:30PM that night, next day I tried to go to work but I had to leave because of the intense numbness and tingling. I also developed left leg weakness and had to even pick up my leg to be able to walk. The NP at my neurologist office (talked over the phone) said it was a pseudo effect due to my MS. My symptoms are still intermittent up to my second dose.  It is all over the numbness and tingling, but as it is subsiding it is now flaring up my symptoms from 2 years ago and I feel it on my second side.

A 34-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EL3284), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing anxiety since she was 13 years old. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the vaccine on Monday at 12 o&#39;clock. She got it for work. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She developed the side effect Tuesday at 2 am. The left side of her face started tingling and had numbness, which is the same side she received the vaccine on. She doesn&#39;t have weakness. It is not resolving. It is from her lower eyelid to her bottom jaw bone. When asked if it was improving persisting or worsening, she said it depends. Sometimes it gets worse and affects her lips, and sometimes it is on and off. It won&#39;t be completely gone. It switched between her cheek and jaw and then her nose and mouth sometimes. If she bends over, it tingles worse. It is just very annoying. It felt like if she had Novocain on the top and bottom of her mouth. It is irritating. She got it because she doesn&#39;t want COVID and she works as a nurse. She does have really bad anxiety. She has nothing else medical. She is just really nervous. It is not going away. She is freaking out. She would like more information. The outcome of the event &#34;It is just very annoying/It is irritating&#34; was unknown, while for the other events was not recovered.

The following morning, I continued to have numbness in my hands but also in my face. By the evening , the day after I had received the vaccine, I felt like my swallowing was slightly impaired and I went to urgent care. I was able to complete all neurological tests and given a prescription for hydroxyzine, thinking that I may have had a slight histamine response.  I slept approximately 10 hours that night and then fell asleep again from 8:30-11:30 this morning due to high levels of fatigue. Today (~54 hours later), the numbness in my hands and face seems to be getting slightly worse.  I also feel some generalized weakness. I&#39;m still able to do normal day to day activities but it feels abnormal.

                                                Stiff, sore arm immediately lasting at least 48 hours. Hard and bruised at injection site. Developed low grade temp, flushed face, fatigue, muscle stiffness, body aches hours following vaccine. Aches and fatigue continues and it?s now day 8. The fatigue is constant but comes in waves. I?m taking unexpected naps which are abnormal for me. Caffeine and methylphenidate are ineffective. I?m still sore. I also have brain fog, maybe from the fatigue. I can?t think straight and it takes me longer to process and do tasks. I woke up 2 hours ago and I can?t wait to sleep again.

She awoke from sleep approximately 15 hours after receiving the vaccine with a temporal artery temperature of 102.9F with associated chills, myalgias, arthralgias. This continued until approximately 30 hours after vaccine administration. 30 hours after vaccination her temporal artery temperature was 100.9. She had a COVID PCR test 34 hours after vaccination that was negative. Severe fatigue and mildly elevated temperature continued, limiting her ability to report to work for a total of 4 days.

                                                Symptoms of nausea began day of, were moderate for several days.  Did not eat much the day of the vaccine due to these symptoms. Numb feeling, tingling in extremities for 2-3 days post vaccination.  Still some occasional numbness and tingling in nose, facial area, and back of head/neck.  Diarrhea for a couple of days.  Continue to experience mild nausea 1.5 weeks later.  Did not have problems with nausea previously.   Moderate fatigue for about a week following vaccination.  Still noticing mild fatigue, getting tired easily and earlier than usual.   Arm was sore from the day after vaccination until about 4-5 days had passed.  Still otice an occasional pain  when moving arm around a certain way.   For 4-5 days following vaccination noticed various body pains.  Pain in lower back- not muscle pain but something else.   Chest wall pain when breathing in from 1-2 days to about a week post vaccination. Headache for a day.  Brain fog feeling, forgetfulness beginning the day after vaccination and was noticeable for about a week.  Still noticing this mildly and feeling more lightheaded than usual.   Over the last few days, I&#39;ve noticed chest tightness and some mild coughing.  It&#39;s also below zero here, so this could be related to weather and dry air, or possibly related to the vaccine.   Generally, I recognize that the above symptoms are possible after this vaccination.  However, the existing literature seems to suggest these symptoms should last 1-3 days and be mild.  My experience has been that they were worse than mild, most lasted at least a week, and some seem to be continuing.   I am also breastfeeding a 19 month old.  He had a brief bout of redness on about half of his body (underarms, forearms, thighs, knees) for about 30 minutes a week after I received the vaccine.  He has never had that before for no apparent reason, and it did not continue, although he has reacted to lotions and certain brands of diaper wipes in this way previously.  We have also noticed that he&#39;s been more irritable lately- throwing tantrums easily, sleeping more often, and getting inconsolable.  We haven&#39;t tied this to any illness, although we do recognize that toddlers can through periods where they have more challenging behaviors.  This is unusual for him though, he&#39;s generally happy and agreeable.  I thought I&#39;d mention it just in case there&#39;s been some sort of pattern that other breastfeeding moms have noticed.

                                                Prior to the first dose , I felt completely healthy.  I received the first dose on a Saturday at 9am.  Felt fine most of that day other than my arm being sore, which improved with Ibuprofen.  The following day, I woke up a little achy, but felt better after taking more Ibuprofen.  Around 4-5pm on Sunday afternoon, I started feeling more achy with cold chills (highest temp was 99.5) and congestion.  I would take Ibuprofen and Tylenol, which would help.  On Monday, congestion continued, but the body aches and cold chills went away.   I did feel a little tired, but also did not sleep well due to the congestion.  Did not have any other symptoms other than the congestion and actually felt pretty good.  I worked from home on Monday to be on the safe side.   On Tuesday, I was still having congestion (still no other symptoms) and my work did not want me to return until I got checked by a doctor or get a negative covid test.  Went to an urgent care where I was seen by a doctor and tested for covid (rapid test), which came back positive.  The only other symptom that developed was loss of smell (but not sure if that was just due to the congestion -- it seemed to come and go.  Some things I could smell, some things I couldn&#39;t).  I did not lose my sense of test.  The congestion lasted less than a week.  My family quarantined for over 20 days.  We tried our best, but it was hard to isolate myself, especially from my younger kids.  No one else in the household ever developed any symptoms.  Not sure how/where I picked it up at --- We are very careful.  The only other people I saw the 2 weeks prior to testing positive were my parents and in laws at Christmas, all of which have been healthy.

                                                Approx 12 hours after receiving second dose of covid vaccine, I experienced what I can only describe as moderate-strong flu symptoms. I had previously had a mild reaction to the first vaccine (fatigue, mild headache) so I was shocked at how incapacitated I was after the second vaccine. 9:00pm (Wednesday)  (12 hours after vaccine) - after feeling ok all day, starting to feel sick, chills yet feeling hot (fever at 101.4), muscles and joints aching and headache; 9:00pm-4:00am - very intense flu like symptoms, muscle and joint aching extreme, burning and deep pain on arm at injection site, chills not going away.  I eventually fall asleep. 7:00am (Thursday) - call my mother to come pick me up because I am still feeling poorly.  Fever is gone but I have a major headache and body aches are persistent. I take Tylenol and some of the body aches are better. I continue to feel like this throughout the entire day off and on. 7:00am (Friday) - finally feeling better but I have a lingering sense of extreme nausea that won&#39;t go away. My stomach itself is &#34;fine&#34; but the nausea is persistent. I take dramamine and feel somewhat better. 7:00am (Saturday) - still feeling fatigued but almost feeling like myself again. Nausea is still present but has greatly diminished. 7:00am (Sunday) - finally feeling mostly &#34;ok&#34; again. No noticeable major effects that are interfering with my ability to go about my day.

A 34-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EL3247) at right arm on 04Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient received her first shot (lot number EL3247) at right arm on 04Jan2021. Patient&#39;s medical history included acid reflux. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Anxiety started three days after receiving the second shot (07Feb2021). Patient was shortness of breath. The patient had emergency room/department or urgent care and visited doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Per ER, she was hyperventilating which caused her to have panic attacks. Patient had medication for anxiety. Outcome of the events was resolving at the time of reporting. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

I sat down and the PA asked if I was ok and then I don&#39;t remember anything. I then fainted and my Heart rate was 30 and they called a code blue. They took me to the ER and ran test and gave me IV and everything came back normal.  After that incident, there was at least two other times I had to sit down because I was getting all the same symptoms again and thought it would happen again.  I did donate blood on January 8. I was feeling fine when prior and the following two days.

Checked temperature and it was 99.8 got back into bed and as I got into bed experienced sudden severe dizziness/spins. I covered my face and told my husband that I was dizzy, began to lay down - and woke to him yelling my name. I fainted in bed. He said I was mumbling and making strange noises but was unresponsive for a few seconds. When I woke, I felt extremely hot and was drenched in sweat. I was also extremely confused and had a very hard time speaking/explaining to my husband where the Tylenol was, where the thermometer was, etc. it was very scary.

                                                First vaccine I could feel the vaccine go into my body and down into my legs. It was a very strange sensation. I felt very fatigued 30 min after the vaccine but ignored it because it was not normal to have symptoms after the first vaccine. That night i did feel a litlle bit of swelling in my lips that continued into the next day but it was not severe. The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don&#39;t really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn&#39;t feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work. It is now 4 weeks since i had the vaccine and i am still experiencing  some symptoms that seem to be in relation to after i eat. That includes lip swelling, tightness in the muscles around my throat (feel as if they are strained), stomach burning, indigestion, heartburn.  Called PCP again who recommended I see an allergist/immunologist.

                                                On March 9, 2021 I received my first dose of Pfizer.About 4 hours later I bent my left knee for about thirty mins and stood up. I couldn&#39;t even put weight on my left leg. My muscles were so tight and strained in my left leg. It felt similar like bruising around my knee and all the way up to my quads. The following day, I rested and iced my leg all day. I couldn&#39;t go back to my regular routine of working out until Thursday. However, I was limping until Friday morning. March 13th, my leg is still tight and strained. It hasn&#39;t gone back to normal.

I will go from uncontrollably shaking to a fever.  This cycle repeats every 5-6 hrs. This has been on-going for 5 days now.  I am unable to care for my infant as I am too weak to walk without feeling like I will pass out.  Extreme body aches, my bones and joints are painful to move.

I could not think clearly. I went home and felt that my ear drum felt numb as well. Went to my PCP and she said it seems I was having an allergic reaction and she recommended Pepcid and Benadryl for 3 days. The next morning I noticed I slept for 16 hours. and I was very confused, I could not keep my legs underneath me, I went to ER and my BP was 153/33, my pulse was 120. They kept me there I am not sure for how long, they did some labs and gave me some IVs and told me to go home and rest. Next day I woke up and I was throwing up, shaking, I thought I was going to die and I returned to the ER. They gave me some nausea meds. I returned to my PCP and she put me under BP meds she believes all was caused due to anxiety. I am still taking BP meds.

A 34-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Jan2021 13:00 (Lot Number: EL3246) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation at age 34 years old. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. No concomitant medications. No other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (lot no: EJ1685) for COVID-19 immunization at 34 years old. After receiving the second dose of Pfizer vaccine on 08Jan2021, within 13 hours (09Jan2021 02:00) the patient was ill with flu like symptoms (woke up freezing, headache, neck pain, body aches, restless). Later that morning (09Jan2021), the patient had nausea, vomiting and fatigue. After 36 hours (09Jan2021), profound fatigue, intermittently dizzy, felt feverish but did not confirm; body aches had resolved. On 10Jan2021 01:00, slept most of the day and night, had a few scattered hives in the evening. On day 3 (11Jan2021), since this day the patient has had constant vertigo. She was hospitalized from 15Jan2021 to 16Jan2021, had extensive testing and saw different specialists, and was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis secondary to the vaccine. She never had CoVID before, healthy otherwise, and had negative CoVID antibody testing prior to receiving the vaccine. She was off work for 6 weeks, able to go back for 10 shifts but had worsening of vertigo symptoms and was unable to work x 3 weeks and ongoing; still working with vestibular rehab, still having daily significant vertigo. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, disability or permanent damage. Treatment received included medication and vestibular therapy. The patient underwent covid test (nasal swab) on 16Jan2021 with negative result. The patient recovered from body aches on an unspecified date in Jan2021; while not recovered from the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                AS REPORTED BY PATIENT:  Monday 12-28 evening I begun to get chills and body aches, the next morning when waking up I felt like a truck hit me. Starting Tuesday morning, for three days, I got calf/feet cramps that were non-stop. I did call my doctor and got lab work done on 12-31. This lab work showed some kidney values that were off. Starting Sunday my legs and feet swelled up. I had a routine MS appointment on Monday and they stated since there is no data for folks with MS and the vaccine that they cannot rule out the vaccine is playing a role in some of this along with the IVIG.  I did follow up with my primary care doctor on Tuesday and they re did lab work as well as did a ultrasound to rule out blood clots. She did state she felt like it was the perfect storm between the COVID vaccine and then the Immunoglobins that I am on.  She suggested I download the app for CDC and report those items as well.  The doctors are still suggesting I get the 2nd shot just have to do some things prior to the second shot.

                                                About 40 minutes after my vaccine, I felt sudden onset progressive weakness of my entire left arm with spasms/fasciculations of my forearm and hand  (while driving from hospital where I work as a physician to where I live). I pulled over, felt a bit dazed and was unable to use my left hand purposefully to call 911 on my cell phone, but was able to call 911 on my Watch using my right (dominant) hand. While talking to the dispatcher, my symptoms resolved (total duration a few minutes)  so I requested that they not send an ambulance but instead felt well enough to drive to my hospital ED. I discussed my case with the triage RN and ED attending who felt my symptoms were related to the vaccine, with no further work up needed, given then my symptoms resolved. My vitals were stable in triage.  No chest pain or shortness of breath, with normal neurological function and sensation of my left arm.  Note: I was not officially checked in or seen as a patient.     Sudden onset weakness and spasms of left arm (side of vaccine administration) about 40 minutes after vaccine

This was approx 16 hours post dose. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and felt more able to do normal home activities but still tired with a sore arm. 4.5 hours post ibuprofen dose I again had muscle aches, headache, fatigue, and nausea. I also had chills and joint pain. I napped for an hour, took another 600mg ibuprofen, and then napped for another 2.5 hours. After that I felt better at 27 hours post dose but still achy and fatigued. These symptoms had mostly resolved by 31 hours post dose.

                                                I received my second vaccine on Friday 1/8. I felt fine until that evening and then experienced the typical side effects that I had read about. Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Axillary lymph node is larger than a marble currently.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP with the above complaints who referred me to employee health.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes; blood pressure was 90/50; Chills; body aches; Fatigue; Joint pain; Bone pain; Headache; Swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site; Swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site; Swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site; Tachycardia / heart rate was 144-152; painful to breath and she was grunting; also said that the injection site itched a little bit.; Fever; First dose on 17Dec2020, second does on 04Jan2021; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting for herself.   A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded.

After waiting in the monitoring area for 45 minutes I drank some water and felt like my bilateral upper thighs were difficult to lift when I tried to walk to my car. I went home and was tachycardic 120-130bpm that continued throughout the night to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep my heart was pounding so hard and fast. I was extremely thirsty and dehydrated all night.  I continued to have tachycardia for several days despite hydrating. My thighs also continued to feel week for several weeks. I developed a 100.7 F temperature and had flu like symptoms the following days.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

                                                Felt okay upon awakening at 06:30am. Got a shower before work. Shortly after getting out of the shower I became weak, ears started blocking, and started to have tunnel vision. Progressively got worse and was able to sit with head between legs. Took about 1 minute before I didn&#39;t feel like I was going to pass out. Shaky and weak after. Pulse 78 and oxygen level ok. Completed virtual visit and no further medical treatment advised unless symptoms got worse, but advised it was likely a vaccine reaction.  Shortly after a bad headache and body aches developed (expected side effects).

                                                I started to feel rundown/fatigued in the evening on the day I got the vaccine and my arm was very sore.  I woke up very early the next morning with a fever of 101-102, body aches, severe headache, nausea, chills, severe fatigue, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, I would get tunnel vision, my eyes ached and felt very strained, sinus congestion and pressure.  My fever spiked at 103.6 that evening and then stayed below 100 after that.  For the following 7 days I still had the severe fatigue, nausea, headaches, chills, dizziness, difficult concentrating, tunnel vision that was especially  bad when I had to drive, eye aches, sinus congestion and pressure, and my head felt very strange.  The best way to describe it is that I felt like someone had drugged me.  The only time I would leave my house was to take my daughter to school and when I would drive my head would feel super tight, my eye ache would intensify and they would feel super strained, I would get the tunnel vision and I would have trouble making it to the school and back home.  Then I would go back to sleep for several hours, get up and drink some fluids and go back to bed.  On day 7 or 8 I was able to stay up for periods of time and either watch movies or just lay in bed.  I went back to work on 1/20 and am doing desk work.  I am doing a lot better but still have daily headaches, moderate fatigue that is worse in the morning, mild intermittent nausea, my head still feels weird like I&#39;ve been taking some kind of pain med or mild sedative, and I&#39;m easily exhausted.  I have trouble going grocery shopping because I get exhausted.  I had a rapid COVID test done on 1/06/20 due to a headache and temp of 99.6-100.2, it was negative and we thought the temp was due to the Trokendi as that is a side effect of it.  I also had a PCR done on 1/12 that came back negative.

                                                Patient reported all energy and strength was wiped out of her.  She slowly regained over a few days.  She has numbness and loss of sensation in whole left side of body, limp and sluggish.  Went to ER 01/18/20 and they thought was overload of immune system.  They suggested her to report.  Symptoms did not subside until 01/22/21, gradually the feeling came back, with rest.  She was off work the last week to rest up.

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

Then I felt like I had been hit in the head with a bat, but the pain migrated from side to side in my head. It was a very strange feeling. The hot, tingly numbness lasted about 45 minutes to an hour, the headache began to subside after 2 hours. The next day I had a little raised redness and the injection site and a bad headache, but was otherwise fine. At the vaccination site they strongly advised I go to the ER, which I did. I have no history of vaccine reaction.

CDC Vsafe called and asked me to report as an adverse event though I wouldn&#39;t consider more serious than most. Had low grade fever (99-100) on tylenol, chills, rigors, myalgias and joint pains starting about 12 hours after vaccination.  Went to work the following day (I am an physician) and by about 10 am had a presyncopal event and was unable to stand/continue working. Was unable to stand without feeling faint for about the next 6 hours.  Was febrile until about 8pm 1/9, never over 100 while taking tylenol. Symptoms completely resolved by 1/10 AM except fatigue for the next 4 days or so, though I developed axillary lymphadenophathy on the side of vaccination starting 1/12 for about 5 days.  No effect whatsoever on the fetus.

                                                Similar events to the first vaccine. I got chills and bad body aches Monday evening. Got really restless and in pain overnight. Begun getting deep muscle cramps in my upper legs, calf?s and arms, still continuing off and on, little out of breath off and on. Went to the cardiologist for a check because of the water retention from the first vaccine and beginning again after second and he noted I had a little fluid at the bottom of my lungs. Swelling beginning to affect the lower legs again. Labs continued to being checked and continued doctor appointments.

There was light headed sensation w/ movement and position, pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode and my eyes were burning.  Because so severe, I took 1000mg tylenol, lathered by entire body in eucalyptus oil and peppermint on my hands, I was able to fall asleep at 3am but it was restless sleep I kept waking up because any movement I made in bed I&#39;d have severe pain.  6am I felt moderately better all symptoms 50% improved, applied eucalyptus oil on again, started work at 730am I could barely function at work I have brain fog, just thinking focusing eyes concentrating makes migraine worse, &#43;photopphobia, phonophobia, just typing is very hard to do because it hurts my joints, the vertigo worsened and the slightest looking down to the keyboard while typing causes lightheaded sensation.  No improvement and it&#39;s now almost 1pm.  I didn&#39;t take any pain medication or apply any essential oils.

I should have gone to the hospital but I have an extreme medical phobia so I stayed up and made sure my tounge didn&#39;t swell any further.  The next morning my tounge was normal ish, the red rash was gone and my hands and wrists were back to normal.  5 days later and I am still experiencing headaches, my throat feels sore and a little bit of a hard time swallowing, extreme exhaustion, dizziness, nausea, a feeling of being completely out of it, otherworldly.

My skin has since been very sensitive to touch, this includes skin on my face, arms, hands, and chest. I am very sensitive to temperature changes, especially cold. My nervous systems feels very sensitive, especially my hands. Touching cold items (refrigerator, outside, etc.) makes me shiver. I have also been experiencing a covid fog. I do not feel like myself and am not experiencing joy. I cry daily for no reason.

                                                Within a minute of the injection, I began to feel a cold sensation that traveled across my shoulder blades beginning at my left shoulder blade.  The healthcare worker came back with my vaccination card within a couple minutes.  I left her know about it.  I had began to feel, but the sensation then spread to the back of my head and down to my lower back.  I felt a little uneasy and had the thought that I probably couldn&#39;t drive.  Before the 15 minute observation period was over, I felt better but still had the cool sensation in the back of my head.

                                                About 8PM (so roughly 8,5 hours) after the 2nd Pfizer dose, I started to experience chills, body aches, and a fever. It kept me up all night. At 7AM, I had 100.4 degree fever and took a 500 mg Tylenol and the symptoms subsided for about 5 hours. Around 12PM, had chills again and fever and took another 500 mg Tylenol.  Fever went up to 101 at 7PM (almost 24 hours since first onset) and took another 500 mg Tylenol. Since Sunday night, I have been waking up in the middle of the night with weird, vivid dreams/images. The other symptoms don&#39;t worry me but this certainly does. The first night (Sunday) I woke up at 2AM and last night 12:50AM. I am hoping it doesn&#39;t continue but I have not done anything differently since the second Pfizer vaccine. No added stress nothing.

I woke up Thursday 02/11 morning not feeling well at all, it felt like i had been hit by a train. I had a fever that has got up to  as high as 101.3 (my normal temperature is 96 or low 97&#39;s so this is very unusual for me even when i get sick)  fevers  lasted until Saturday 02/13/21 in the morning, at which point I had been taking Tylenol and ibuprofen consistently so i stopped taking my temperature (If i were to stop taking those medications i feel i would maybe still have a temperature).  I was so sore it hurt to move and walk, today (Tue 02/16) it doesn&#39;t hurt to walk finally. My arm pits hurt very bad and still slightly hurt. I have been very tired and weak as well. My eyes have hurt or felt different and appear glossy throughout all of this and still do.

She said after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine, she has had multiple symptoms. Patient is now due for her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose today 02Feb2021. Patient did not know if she should get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and if her side effects were from the first COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient works in a doctor&#39;s office where there is a medical doctor, nurse practitioner, and several other registered medical assistants. Approximately 12 hours later after vaccine, at 2:30AM (13Jan2021), her left arm was extremely sore. She said she went to work on Wednesday, 13Jan2021, and her left arm was still really sore, but she was fine, otherwise. She said approximately 22 hours after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection site. She said her COVID-19 Vaccine was given a lot higher than she thinks the vaccine should have been given. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy. Her heart rate and blood pressure shot up, and she had pretty bad shortness of breath. Patient said that the medical doctor and nurse practitioner (where she works) told her she gave herself a panic attack. She said that the medical doctor, who she works for, told her to go home, and to contact her primary care doctor if she doesn&#39;t feel better. Patient left work and went home. Patient clarified her heart rate was in the 120s, and she usually has a heart rate in the 80s. She said she was pale and clammy, too. Patient stated that she went to bed when she got home from work on 13Jan2021, and woke up the next morning (Thursday, 14Jan2021), and got ready for work. She said as she was getting dressed for work, she felt her pulse rate go up, and she became sweaty, and clammy. She said she called her work, and her boss (medical doctor) told her to take some Tylenol and rest, and to call her primary care doctor if she was not feeling better. Patient said that her primary care doctor said she was having anxiety, and started her on medicine. She said the medicine helped, but her heart rate was still 112-115. She said she noticed on Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Friday morning (15Jan2021) the lymph nodes in her left axillary (or armpit area) were swollen, and super tender. She said all the muscles in her left arm were tender, as well. She said her left arm muscles were still aching. She said she had bruising on her left arm, and noticed she had bruising (more than usual) throughout the rest of her body. She said she has no idea if the bruising is a coincidence, or if the bruising is related to receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient mentioned that her left axillary lymph nodes were swollen for a good week and a half, but the swelling improved and was gone now. She said her heart rate was still elevated at 106-110 when she last checked her heart rate an hour and half ago. She said her heart rate was elevated, even though she was sitting down doing tele-work, and she has been taking anxiety medicine. She said she was still having breathing discomfort, clarifying she could not take a big enough breath. Patient will take a big breath, and will be good for a while, but then she needs to take another big breath. She said her doctor has checked her lungs, and her lungs were clear. She said she has to take multiple, deep breaths throughout the day. Patient&#39;s last blood work was in Oct2020. She said everything was good with her blood work. She said her hormones were good, but she had a Vitamin D deficiency. For treatment, patient stated that her primary care doctor prescribed Buspar 7.5mg, twice a day. She said the Buspar 7.5mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle and did not have the NCD, Lot, and Expiration Date. She said it will be 3 weeks from tomorrow (03Feb2021) she has been taking the Buspar 7.5mg and reported everyone seems to think she has anxiety, or she was crazy. Events did not require emergency room visit but patient visited physician office. There were no relevant tests. Outcome of muscles in her left arm were tender/aching, was not recovered, for axillary lymph nodes swelling and tender was recovered in 2021, for heart rate was elevated, Shortness of breath/breathing discomfort was recovering while for other events was unknown.

By day 9-10 I have had to leave work because I can?t go more than an hour without having to run to the restroom, and now there is also sharp bowel pain which radiates to my back.  My nausea is extreme and I?m barely eating.  My fatigue is such that I can barely keep my eyes open- not sure if it is related to the diarrhea and lack of eating out the vaccine, and my migraine which I usually get once a week have been more like every other day for the past week.

                                                Six days after receiving vaccine, began feeling unwell. Symptoms are extreme fatigue, red eyes, sore eyes, body aches, joint pain, pain around back/ribs, shortness of breath on exertion. Unable to do usual household tasks and requiring bedrest for much of the day.   The symptoms are very similar to the waves of symptoms I experienced early on in Post-Acute Covid-19 syndrome. I got sick in March and was experiencing waves like this through November. Since November, my physical symptoms had abated and I had not suffered a major relapse like this, besides a mild relapse at end of January. My shortness of breath issues, back pain/rib pain, eye soreness are very specific symptoms that I associate with early on in my long covid experience. The vaccine seems to have triggered a major relapse in my long covid symptoms.

                                                Experienced moderate headaches everyday for 7 days following first series of vaccine. (NDC el9263) On day 7, woke up in the middle of the night with intense nausea and headache. First thought to have food poisoning because husband who received the same vaccine also had similar symptoms. Both vomited multiple times and experienced severe headaches. After second series of vaccine (NDC en 6201), experienced headaches everyday again which required in taking multiple doses of ibuprofen. On day 7, woke up in the middle of the night with intense headache. Developed intense nausea, headache, neck pain, stiffness, light sensitivity, watery eyes, congestion and could not continue to work. Took multiple doses of advil and had to take off work. No vomiting occurred. Did not see a physician but consulted a coworker/neurologist friend who thought I fit the description of aseptic meningitis. No lumbar puncture or laboratory evaluation was done. Rechallenge was positive.

I had chills, nausea, lost of appetite, and muscular aches. I felt tired and fatigued. I got sweaty hands and experienced reduced amount of saliva in my mouth. Ten hours after the injection I also had diarrhea and cramps. Today is day 2 and I am still experiencing tiredness and anxiety. I didn&#39;t take anything, just waited for the side effects to pass.

These symptoms continued along with blurry vision, dizziness, waking at night to ?buzzing? in head, hypoglycemic symptoms. Multiple doctors visits over the past two months, blood tests, BP and heart rate assessments - only to assume it?s  a reaction to the vaccine. Extreme diet change, elimination of the two prescribed meds and detox- feeling much better however still experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms throughout the day and sometimes at night.

                                                On March 2nd I received the first dose of the vaccine.  On March 5th I began to feel poorly and run low grade fever.  On March 6th, I suddenly developed double vision.  The low grade fever and feeling poorly (other than fatigue) subsided around March 7-8; however, the double vision persists.  It is very difficult to focus at times and drive and perform some other activities that require visual focus at medium to far distances.

                                                Before going to bed the day of vaccine, I noticed my left shoulder/collarbone area was hurting and did not sleep well that night even though I was tired. When I woke up the next day, I was in some discomfort around my collarbone and felts a small lump. I waited until Wednesday and did a virtual visit with a doctor and they said it is probably the lymph nodes. There has been no change in the size of the lump nor has it moved to a new spot.

                                                I immediately felt a strange sensation in my head, and the hearing in my left ear dulled as if I were listening under the ocean. My left ear has a constant feeling of fullness. I have experienced tinnitus and a persistent need to &#34;pop&#34; my ears in my left ear since, as well as bouts of vertigo. I am very sensitive to sound in my left ear, and background noise is amplified and sounds &#34;spotlighted.&#34; I have intermittently been experiencing pain in both of my calves since the injection, as well as joint pain in my hands. I have been experiencing a flushed feeling in the evening, though it is not accompanied by a fever. My muscles in my hands, feet, and legs have been cramping often, which is not a usual occurrence. I have experienced intense chest pain in what feels to be my heart. I have also experienced very vivid dreams.

A 35-year-old female patient received 1st dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, LOT/Batch number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 at age of 35-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 18MAR 2021. She stated ten minutes after the vaccine on 18Mar2021 she became dizzy, hot, almost passed out, couldn&#39;t hear everything sounded really far away. Patient stated this lasted for 20 minutes. Patient stated she also had impaired thinking, couldn&#39;t think straight and no concentration for two days straight. She stated she also had buzzing in her ears and heightened sounds for three days. She stated she had pins and needles sensation in her feet that went up to her legs. She stated on day 9 the pins and needles sensation seems to be in her hands and arms as well. Patient stated yesterday (26Mar2021) her right ear was burning and today (27Mar2021) she has pressure in her ears in addition to the pins and needles sensation. Events were reported as non-serious. Patient would like to know if her symptoms have been reported or are normal. She would like to know how long will her symptoms last and if they are permanent. She would like to know if she should receive the second dose of the vaccine. She would like to know what treatment she should have for her symptoms. She would like to know if there were any reports of autoimmune diseases being diagnosed after receiving the vaccine. She would like for someone to notify her if any information or data becomes available regarding the side effects she has mentioned that were not mentioned in the FactSheet. No information in PI regarding impaired thinking, loss of hearing, heightened hearing, pins and needles in extremities, and burning and pressure in ears. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

Medical history included mixed connective tissue disease diagnosed in 2019, autoimmune disorder and anxiety from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included diazepam (VALIUM) taken for anxiety, start and stop date were not reported; paracetamol (TYLENOL A) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; ibuprofen (ADVIL [IBUPROFEN]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps (arrhythmia) on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered  sob and dates for getting really winded (dyspnoea)  on Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, her heart was racing on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really winded on 22Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, for the 4-5 days after receiving her covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30am since it started on 20mar2021 with outcome of unknown, extremely thirsty on 20Mar2021 with outcome of unknown,  low grade fevers  on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, severe allergic reaction on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Additional details were provided as: &#34;I started having a reaction within 12 hours of the shot that persisted. Four (4) days after I was at urgent care and was sent to see a cardiologist due to SOB and heart rate jumps that were happening.&#34; In the past two weeks the patient has seen the cardiologist, had ekgs and echos completed and and now is being sent to see an electrophysiologist. The cardiologist wants her to postpone the second dose until she sees the electrophysiologist since he doesn&#39;t know if this is exacerbation of something or was caused by the vaccine. She had her first dose on 19Mar2021 around 12:45PM-1:00PM in the afternoon. After her vaccine she was ok. She had actually taken a Valium before she went to get the Covid 19 vaccine because she was nervous. She doesn&#39;t know if taking the Valium before getting the Covid 19 vaccine had anything to do with her delayed reaction. She does not take the Valium every day. She woke up around 1:30AM Saturday morning, 20Mar2021 and her heart was racing. Her mother is a nurse and her mother came over the next day to monitor her. Her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps. Even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s. (beats per minute) She and her mother monitored her heart for a while and she called the clinic where she received the Covid 19 vaccine and the nurse told her to go to an Urgent Care. She does report she has an autoimmune disease and she was wondering if she was having a flare up that the Covid 19 vaccine had caused. She could not find a doctor to talk to her about it. Even her primary care doctor wouldn&#39;t help her. Everyone told her to go to an Urgent Care or the emergency room. On Monday, 22Mar2021, she tried to get up and move around but she was getting really winded. She was trying to do things she normally does like walking in her backyard or walking down the hallway. On Tuesday, 23Mar2021 she went to the urgent care. The urgent care did an EKG and told her she needed to see a cardiologist. She was able to see a cardiologist the next day on Tuesday, 24Mar2021. The cardiologist had her wear a Holter monitor to monitor her heart rate for 24 hours. The results showed that she was having arrhythmias, heart rate jumps. The cardiologist did more EKG&#39;s and an echocardiogram. The cardiologist wants her to see an electrophysiologist because of what he saw on the Holter monitor. She is asking if it&#39;s possible that she had a heart issue before and the Covid 19 vaccine brought it to the surface. She&#39;s read things online where people have had similar symptoms. Is it a side effect? She would also like to report that for the 4-5 days after receiving her Covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30AM since it started on 20Mar2021. She&#39;s unsure if she should get the second Covid 19 vaccine. Her second appointment is scheduled for this Friday, 09Apr2021. When she woke up that morning of 20Mar2021 she was extremely thirsty. She reports she does not drink alcohol because of her autoimmune disease, but the thirst she experienced felt like she had been drinking alcohol and was experiencing the extreme thirst that comes with a hangover. The first 5 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine were the worst and that&#39;s why she decided to go to the urgent care. Her heartrate hasn&#39;t improved. Her windedness had improved by the tenth or eleventh day. She can go on a walk and jump up and down with her daughter now. The windedness is lingering a little but is definitely improved. Her autoimmune disease is called Mixed Connective Tissue. She takes no medications for it. She manages it with her diet. Her mother had called her rheumatologist on call on Monday night, 22Mar2021 and asked him is there anything the caller can do or anything she can take. The rheumatologist on call told her to take Aleve.  She didn&#39;t take Aleve but she did take Tylenol and then hours later she took Advil. She does normally run low grade fevers with her autoimmune disease. The fevers are never high, usually around 99.8F never going over 100F. The low grade fevers have been occurring prior to the Covid 19 vaccine for years. She reports that after she took the Tylenol (Tylenol Extra Strength 500mg, she took 2 tablets) and then the Advil (Advil 200mg, she took 1 tablet), she felt drugged, like totally out of it. So tired she couldn&#39;t move. And she&#39;s taken those medications before and never felt like that. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: arrhythmias, heart rate jumps   on 23Mar2021. No follow-up attempts are possible; no further information expected.

I was taken to a separate area and felt warm and flush in my chest. They laid me down on the cot and said I looked pale. My hands were cold and within minutes I was shaking uncontrollably. I think it was an anxiety related to my research I&#39;ve done at my job related to COVID. I don&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction, but I do have an appt on Thursday. I was monitored for about an hour. Symptoms went away but I wasn&#39;t totally ok until the next day besides soreness in next arm.

                                                I worked the night of 18th and 19th (night shift nurse) -  night of 18th  - arm very sore (dominant arm where shot was taken) by end of night arm was sore; continued for several days. (Got my period either the night of 18th or morning of 19th). About 36 hours after vaccine; stood up to attend an alarm and felt very ill at patient&#39;s bedside and had to sit down: nauseous (felt similar to co-vid) - took Motrin an hour later; the day of 20th - slept all day; 21st - no appetite; mild headache - nauseous - period at same time of vaccine; 22nd - felt bleh; didn&#39;t eat much food - period going away but I  was feeling worse; feel like I have the return of internal vibrations (can sit in my hands when I&#39;m trying to do something for a patient that needs done quickly)  back in July when I had Co-Vid (when I was out of work out of month - and had to see a cardiologist - two months until normal (neural and cardiac symptoms that went away with time) - so was returning of buzzing/etc. 23rd: could feel like I had internal vibrations sensations; nauseous - increased - got a refill from an old dental prescription - started Zofran; headache pressure (head pressure); a vertigo-ish feeling - felt like I just walked off a boat; at that point - called out of work - COVID hotline hospital call - did a rapid test that was negative (on 24th) and on 24th: had still all the same symptoms - nausea was worse and felt a bit more dizzy occasionally and called out of work again but could take care of myself (laid around) - &#34; it felt like baby covid&#34; 25th - work wanted me to get tested again; 26th - Panther Co-vid test - which was also negative. 27th and 28th - dizziness better; still taking Zofran one time /day (for nausea); was able to go to work on 29th - still had some nausea but didn&#39;t have to lie down all day anymore - still had internal vibrations - feels like I should be having a tremor but can&#39;t see it externally; 30th finally able to see primary care Dr and she ordered lab work: Dr wasn&#39;t certain it was an adverse effect vs. me feeling my own immune response to spike protein; Initial covid symptoms in July were similar to this; and she will see how things go; SED Rate was 1 so not concerning; CBC was fine and B12 was fine. Not much as changed since then: returned to work; can go about things in every day; stopped taking Zofran on 31st; I still had nausea but it was mild enough that I didn&#39;t need to take it and Dr said it would be best to stop due to it&#39;s on effects. Yesterday, was first day with no nausea (1/4/2021); still have internal vibrations sensation but it has gone down quite a bit - now more of a mild buzzing electric current sensation - like insides are buzzing super fast ; when I noticed when not occupied with other things which is how it faded out with original illness.

This has continued every night.  I am unable to fall asleep despite being exhausted.  Once asleep I am waking up  within an hour and a half to two hours and not able to go back to sleep.  Over the past 5 nights I have averaged 2 hours a sleep night and no day time naps.

Felt slightly light-headed. Drank water and ate some food to closely monitor.  Very sore Left deltoid starting about 8 PM on 12/31/20 (same day as the vaccine administration).  It was so sore that it woke me up a few times at night and 1/1/21 I had to take Ibuprofen 400 mg to alleviate the pain. Had a dull headache all day 1/1/21 and very tired. Slept that night from 9 pm - 8 am next day.  No symptoms since 1/3/21.

Reported feeling poorly to nurse monitoring people waiting at 30 minute mark, who encouraged waiting longer but did no further assessment. Waited another 15 minutes with no resolution or improvement. Decided to leave and monitoring staff said they could not keep patients if they wanted to leave.   - Approximately 15 minutes later (1hr after injection), took one 25mg Benadryl liquid gel as nausea/headache/fast heart rate were consistent with prior allergic reaction and not with prior vaccine response. Those symptoms resolved after 1-2 hours; the feeling of mild illness lingered for approx. 3 days more.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 from Mar2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced body aches, dry mouth, can&#39;t sleep, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and pain at the injection site, temp was 38.1 Celsius, head feels weird in Jan2021. The patient got her first dose and was looking online to see the symptoms. She said that she saw that during the trials, people were experiencing the symptoms she was experiencing after the second dose and she was concerned. She said that she wanted to make sure her symptoms are ok and to make sure that the symptoms are not just caused from the booster, but also from the first dose. The caller said that her mom told her that someone died from the Pfizer vaccine. No further details provided. The patient was having body aches, could not sleep, her mouth is really dry, her temp was 38.1 Celsius, her head feels weird, she has generalized weakness, pain at the injection site, and decreased appetite. She said that it was like having Covid again. She said that she had Covid back in Mar2020. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 38.1 centigrade.  The outcome of all the events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the suspected COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test is needed for full medical assessment.

I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

Horrible headache that did improve with tylenol and ibuprofen taken at the same time. Body shakes and can&#39;t control body temperature.  Felt freezing cold but skin was very hot to the touch (according to my husband). Then, I started sweating and felt really hot and couldn&#39;t cool down.  Felt nauseous but no vomiting.    Could not sleep but felt very tired.  Today is now 48 hours after vaccine and body aches are gone but I am still extremely fatigued.

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine (approximately 17 hours post-dose), I got up to use the restroom.  While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

Later I got really weak and shaky, fatigued, that night I woke up with night sweats, and chills, woke up completely drenched, I had to change the sheets and pajamas. 5 days after the vaccine I was really exhausted, the fatigue was awful. There was also an itching sensation but no hives.

This has continued and worsened - I have constant &#34;pins and needles&#34; sensations in both feet and it is extending up to my knees. It&#39;s also in both hands and extending up my arms. Last night it was up to elbows, now it&#39;s going above my elbows. It doesn&#39;t go away. I was unable to sleep well because of the sensations. I&#39;m also starting to feel tingling in my back and shoulders. I called my doctor and he said to fill out this form and report the ER if my symptoms don&#39;t improve over the weekend.

After like an hour, she felt better. From then on, she had no side effects besides just being tired and sore, but she had no fever or anything like that. She does have hypertension in her history, but she hasn&#39;t been taking her pill because her BP has been stable. She felt like when she took the Pfizer Vaccine, some people can feel their BP shooting up, like it felt like a sensation in the back of head that her BP went up, but she did not think it was her BP because she has not needed to take her pill because her BP has been good. She did not take her BP, so she doesn&#39;t know what her BP was at the time. It was a pressure in the back of her like how she feels if her blood pressure is elevated. Investigation Assessment: No. Relatedness of drug to all the events was related per source of assessment: primary source reporter, method of assessment: global introspection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the event depressed level of consciousness is possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) , via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 17:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient received the first Pfizer vaccine on 23Dec2020 at approximately 5:15 PM. The patient felt fine until about 11 PM at night, the patient stated, &#34;when I began experiencing intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; on 23Dec2020. I took a Benadryl and went to bed. At approximately 1 AM (24Dec2020) I woke up feeling like I was 500 lbs (I am about 175 lbs). I also had swollen lymph nodes in my neck, a stiff neck, a severely dry throat, and severe shivering. I attempted to navigate to the bathroom and felt like I needed assistance to walk safely to avoid falling. I felt like an impending sense of doom, and called my mom who is a nurse. She told me to contact the Pfizer #, but nobody was answering the phone at that time. I then started looking up on the internet if anyone else had experience what I was feeling after the vaccine and if the feeling passed, as I was not sure if I should go to the ER. I ended up falling asleep.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient took Benadryl for events &#34;intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; as treatment. No treatment was given to the patient from the remaining events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

I was extremely nauseous. Then I felt my pulse pounding through my chest and so forceful I felt it in my tongue. I had my Fitbit watch on and looked at my pulse: it was 168 BPM. I called for help. The nurses took my Blood pressure and HR. My normal BP is low - usuall 110/68. When they took my vitals it was 180 BPM &amp; 149/98. I was taken to the ER and monitored. My vitamins returned to normal within a few hours .

She screamed.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

Very weak - if that was a 10th of what COVID felt like, I didn&#39;t want it! Those symptoms lasted about three to five days. By the5th day - I was mostly back to myself. I took Motrin - which helped slightly for headache.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

I was lethargic with full body aches, headache and chills for the remainder of the day. I checked my temperature throughout the day, but I never had a fever. My symptoms prevented me from working that day, but I did not take pain medication and I was able to eat meals normally. At some point during the night, I woke up in a sweat. The following morning, Feb 12th, the symptoms were gone. The injection site was sore for a few days more.

At 15 minutes I talked with the nurse, she looked at and we talked for quite a bit what I should do but I was feeling just fine and left to go home and take benedryl. I had just left the hospital (25 mins post shot) and my throat and tongue started swell rapidly. I called 911 and the county rescue responded. My breathing was normal by then. My body has been itchy all over since then and my throat remains minor swollen. I did not get an epi shot since I was mostly okay and the EMTs were convinced I had a panic attack so I just went home.

                                                I had my first COVID vaccine on 1/16/21. I had my second one on 2/5/21. On 2/9/21 I started experiencing a sharp pain in my left breast. On 2/10/21 I had sharp pain in between my shoulder blades. On 2/11/21 I noticed a small red rash-like spot in between my breast. I woke up on 2/12/21 in incredible pain on my back, so I lifted my shirt to look in the mirror and that is when I noticed a blister type rash from the middle of my back wrapping around the front of my body covering my left breast. I went to see the PA at my PCP&#39;s office. She diagnosed me with shingles. She placed me on an anti-viral medication for a week, and gabapentin (nerve medication) for a month. It has been 3 weeks today since I first began treatment and I have not fully recovered yet. My blisters dried up about a week ago, but ever since then I have been incredibly itchy, which has kept me up every night for over a week now. On 3/3/21 I called my PCP&#39;s office and they started me on Prednisone for 6 days. I am 2 days into treatment and I still have not had relief from the itching.

                                                Within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I experienced extreme dizziness. This dizziness lasted for 2 days. The following day I felt extreme fatigue, body aches and arm soreness at the injection site in addition to the dizziness.  Exactly 7 days later on 3/13/21 (after my initial side effects had resolved), my left arm began to itch painfully and intensely. The itch began on my left wrist and by the end of the day, the itchy spot on my wrist had progressed to itchiness on the majority of my left arm. It&#39;s not very visibly red, but it&#39;s incredibly itchy and painful, like fiberglass under my skin. The itch is not obviously localized to the injection site but is on the same arm as the injection and nowhere else on my body. It has lasted for 24 hours, and I currently still have it today (3/14/21). I have taken antihistamines and NSAIDs and applied cortisone cream, but it is still very, very uncomfortable. It kept waking me up while I slept during the night. I am wondering if this could be &#34;COVID arm.&#34;

A person on site took my blood pressure which was higher than normal. I was advised to wait longer than 15mins, but after 30mins waiting I still was not okay to leave. I had to call family to come for me, at which point the people on site told me to eat food. I was given water and licorice by the facility, my mother brought me tacos but I still felt very weak. (Weakness was not food related). I was in the waiting area for 1 1/2hrs, advised not to drive myself home, my mother had to drive me home and stayed with me. I also had trouble walking, and was helped to the car. I did not go to a hospital for these adverse reactions as I did not get a fever at any point, and wasn&#39;t exactly sure what could be done for me.  Days following the vaccine I still felt very weak, slept a lot, and felt very out of it. It took 4-5 days to return to normal.

                                                I developed a fever, muscle aches, and chills about 26 hours after the vaccine administration in my lt upper arm. My first temperature taken was notated to be 100.5 degrees. I took two ibuprofen, drank some cold water, then laid down for about 1 hour. I retook my temperature and it was about 99.8 degrees. I laid back down for another 2 hours and took my temperature again, reading was 99.2 degrees. I texted my boss to say I needed to work at home due to fever, muscle aches, and chills the next day to make sure it wasn&#39;t actually covid. I was granted permission to work from home. On Monday morning (wake time was 7 am), my temperature upon waking was 99.2 degrees but the muscle aches and chills had gone away. I took two more ibuprofen with cold compresses on my forehead and temperature finally broke about 9 am.

This consumer (patient) reported for herself that a 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP7533) at the age of 36-years, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included had a pregnancy (a while ago, not ongoing). No other products. The patient stated that she experienced shortness of breath on 08Apr2021 (4 days after receiving the first dose), it got so severe on day 7 that she went to the ER on 11Apr2021. She started getting progressively more shortness of breath. Twice, she called the nurse line for her doctor and was advised to go to the emergency room. Added she could not catch her breath, and it was worse at night, could not sleep, so she went to the emergency room, she was in emergency room for 2 and a half hours and then went home. She wanted to know if the second dose could cause issues or if she should get it, added that the paperwork said that people should not get the vaccine if they received an adverse reaction to the first dose or any vaccination. She did not know if this was normal for it to get progressively worse and 2 to 14 days later. Patient wanted to know if the shortness of breath was something that can get worse, if this was a reaction to the vaccine even though it happened so many days later. Patient added it was the only thing she could think of and that her heart rate, oxygen levels, and everything was good minus she felt like she could not catch her breath. The doctor in the ER gave her anti-anxiety medicine, something with an L, but the doctor gave her that and it really seemed to help. It was kind of like, she did not know, it made her feel calm enough to fall asleep. Caller added that she has that and an salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. She was not sure whether progressively worsening shortness of breath had gotten any better or was still going on, added that yesterday was the day she did not need either treatment medication. The day before, she took just the anxiety medicine and not the albuterol. Yesterday, she took none. During the day on 11Apr2021 (Sunday), she had called because she was feeling uncomfortable constantly. She has two children and all day she did not feel well. She told her husband she did not feel well at all. Sunday when she went to lay down, she could not sleep. Patient reported that as her shortness of breath subsided, her arm started hurting again, thought this began on 19Apr2021 and was not sure, it went away completely and was just at the injection site, probably lasting half a day or so and then it went away, clarified as left arm, same as injection. Caller added that 15Apr2021 was after the ER visit, was that she was standing up doing things and from her knee down felt tingly. Stated that knee down felt tingly on 15Apr2021, which was after her ER visit occurred, she was standing up and doing things. She had not been doing things for long periods but her knee down felt tingly. Added not like numb, but like her legs were falling asleep. She was preparing dinner and moving around and felt tingling in both legs. This probably lasted about three hours. She just kind of took it easy and it started to subside and then it was gone. While mentioned investigations, patient stated the ER did an EKG, where they put stickers and monitor her heart. They did a chest x-ray, and they took blood. She believed they checked for blood clot tests and anemia. Patient did not know any results but stated the doctor came into the room and told her everything was clear and nothing came back with anything on it. She stated the date was either the night of 11Apr2021 or the morning of 12Apr2021 for the tests.

I had to fully lay down and couldn?t carry my 15lb son. I also had marked breast tenderness greater on the side of the injection. My son seemed to have trouble staying latched (?due to tiredness from my direct warmth), and had increased fussiness.

                                                Parasthesias began in my lower extremities intermittently about 36 hours following administration. These spread to my upper extremities and became consistent. Occasionally will appear in lips and trunk. These are associated with sensation of numbness and some discomfort in my extremities. I&#39;m also experiencing significant brain fog, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Headaches are occurring about every other day.  Symptoms are present currently and have remained relatively consistent in severity.  Was evaluated by urgent care on December 28 and encouraged to observe. Was evaluated in the ER by neurology on January 4. There leading hypothesis is vaccine related immune response. Neurologic exam was largely normal, being evaluated by a specialist in the coming days.

A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EH9899) via intramuscular on 19Dec2020 09:00 on left deltoid at a single dose for COVID-19 prophylaxis. The patient medical history, family history and relevant tests were reported as none. Current concomitant medications included multivitamin took 2 chewable gummies sporadically for years as supplementation therapy. The patient previously took Flu shots she got a sore arm. It was not bad. Tetanus gives her a sore arm, but that was all. Caller wanted to know what she should do for preparation to safely get second dose of Covid vaccine and how to fix what she was feeling right now, making sure it doesn&#39;t get worse, considering she is still having symptoms. Caller stated that she had side effects of tongue felt swollen and globus sensation in her throat. The transferring agent stated that he has a caller on the line that was calling about the Covid-19 Vaccine and reported that the patient got the shot on the 19Dec2020 and was inquiring about to proceed with her weird side effects. Caller had not told her physician about her symptoms yet. Caller clarified that she said a half an hour after the dose on 19Dec2020 09:30 she said that she had a Globus sensation or like a lump in her throat. Caller also reported that the back of her tongue felt swollen. Caller said that the Globus sensation was intermittent and it was not as prominent now as it was. Caller said that it was medically significant, but she has not sought medical treatment yet. Caller said that she still had a bruise or ecchymosis at the injection site. She said that the injection was high but reported that she did not have a lot of injection site pain, it very minimal. No emergency room or physician office required. The outcome of the event tongue felt swollen and globus sensation in her throat was recovering and the outcome of the event a bruise or ecchymosis at the injection site was not recovered and the outcome of the event minimal injection site pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible chronological association between vaccine administration and onset of the events. Causality cannot be completely excluded.

I took tylenol and motrin twice during the 12 hour shift at the scheduled times. I was working night shift when this happen and came home and went to bed 24 hours after receiving the vaccine. The time I went to bed had fatigue, headache, body aches with neck and back pain. Took tylenol and motrin before going to sleep. When I woke up at 4pm, 31 hours after receiving the vaccine I had, sore throat, head congestion, severe body aches and headache. I attempted to get up since I was scheduled to work at 7pm and then got dizzy. I took tylenol and motrin, put a heating pad on my back, drank some hot tea and went back to bed for the night. Woke up at 7:30am almost 2 days after receiving the vaccine still with headache, body aches and fatigue. The sore throat and head congestion seem to have subsided. Took more tylenol and motrin and went back to bed. Still at this time feel just tired and body aches, mostly in the neck and back.

                                                At 2000 on 1/13/21, I started to experience intense ache at the injection site, which by 2200 progressed to myalgias in my back, especially lower back, neck, and right arm. At 2300,  I started to have fever/chills, up to 39 C orally. This only partially responded to Tylenol. I was not able to sleep.  At 2:30 am I noticed an unusual headache, 8/10, as well as bilateral eye pain on Moving eyes side to side as well as sensitivity to light. Headache was mostly frontal, which came and went every few minutes  until exactly 11:38 am on 1/14/2021, when the fever and myalgias very suddenly got significantly better. Almost exactly 24 hrs to the minute after injection. On 1/15/2021, I still have significant pain in my left arm, swelling, redness and, now, itching at the injection site. My lower back still hurts.

I had facial flushing, felt hot and turned red, I took pepcid and benydryl, I went to sleep because that was the end of my shift . The rash stuck around for 1.5 weeks for the rash to go away . I woke up 6 hours after and  felt fine I only had the rash and I went to occumed to document my symptoms and everything was fine after that

                                                Within 2 minutes post vaccination i started feeling loss of sense of myself. I could not pinpoint if i felt dizzy or vertiginous. Felt like i was off balance and i was super vernous to walk. Vertiginous episodes come and go with peaks for at least 10 times. The whole episode lasted 4 hours until i felt going back to myself.   I was provided water, 1 L and orange juice, there was epi available. No anaphylactic symptoms, no shortness of breath.   I drank 1,5 L of fluids and then my BP was checked 120/80, HR 80s.  I note that i never felt syncopal,  no diaphoresis, nausea, nor darkened vision and i was fully interactive with the bystanders.  Note, i am a critical care intensivist so i had full grasp of the issue but i could now quite describe the sensation of this acute loss of instability. The best way to describe this was vertigo. Similar episode occured at the first vaccine with COVID, occured after 10 minutes and lasted no more than 30 seconds. I didnt report that then because i thought it was just dehydration.

A 37-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Ek5730), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 28Dec2020 12:00PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at hospital facility. Medical history included Hashimotos disease. The patient had no known allergies and has not had COVID prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she felt tired and confused and unwell on day of injection, 28Dec2020. After three days (31Dec2020), she developed hives on her stomach and arm and seven days later (04Jan2021), she was diagnosed with pneumonia and continued to have hives all over her legs and arms to this day.

                                                I developed the expected side effects of fever, chills, and body aches.  The body aches were mostly in my neck and hips.  They slowly improved but lingered in my neck.  Then on Sunday 1/9 I developed severe 10/10 pain in my neck and shooting down my left arm and down my shoulders and back.  It was unrelieved by ibuprofen, norco, heat, essential oils, and changing of positions.  I was unable to sleep.  I went to my chiropractor and she was unable to adjust me due to severe pain.  She applied icy hot, did some gentle massage, and gave me curcumin for the inflammation . She believed it was an inflammatory response in my cervical spine.  It slowly improved to a 8/10 pain, but I was still unable to sleep laying down. I was unable to work for 3 schedule shifts.   I saw my chiropractor 4 times total that week. On 1/16 I went to urgent care because the pain was not getting better.  She said I had torticollis and gave me naproxen and a stretching exercise.  It is still lingering muscle pain, but I am able to finally sleep and function normally.   I had never experienced pain like that before and I hope I never do again.

                                                About 12-13 minutes into my wait after getting the vaccination... my throat had a tickle in it... like I needed to clear my throat.  So I did... and then again.... and again.    Then I felt dizzy and disoriented... foggy headed kind of drunk feeling.    Then within what seemed like seconds... my mouth felt full so I opened my mouth and looked in the mirror.   My tongue seemed bigger than usual and lighter in color.  But what was most noticeable was that I had Ripples along the whole outer edge and side of my tongue.    pulse ox reading was an 89 so they administered a prescription strength Benadryl shot and told me they would need to monitor me and keep an eye on me.  Another woman drove me from the vaccination site to the clinic where they checked my oxygen levels again and i was already back up to 99.  They monitored me and checked on me for about 15-20 minutes before releasing me.  My tongue finally felt normal again about 2 hours later while resting at home.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11am on Wednesday morning, and by about 830pm Wednesday night, I could sense something was off.  I couldn&#39;t focus on work, and I felt my eyesight starting to get fuzzy.  I realized there was an issue, and decided to go to bed.  As soon as I laid in bed, the chills started, and for the next hour I couldn&#39;t stop shaking.  I couldn&#39;t get comfortable, hot/cold, hot/cold, the chills were incessant and I couldn&#39;t will myself to sleep.  I finally fell asleep and proceeded to toss and turn.  I woke up at 5am on Thursday and could barely move.  My body was so sore and my head was pounding with a migraine.  I was trying to take care of the kids, unsuccessfully, while battling all the symptoms.  The day progressed slowly, and I started to feel better mid day after a few more hours of sleep.  Around 6pm is when the fever kicked in, hovering right about 99.5.  I drank Pedialyte and went to bed not long after I got the kids in bed.  At 2am I woke up with another headache and took more Tylenol.  By 6am today, Friday, the fever broke and I am back to normal.

It increased through the day at work (1-handed work) to the point of being unable to use 3 fingers without excruciating pain.  On 1/21, saw a neurologist who diagnosed parsonage turner&#39;s syndrome due to the covid vaccine.

                                                I had received the 1st dose of the vaccine on 12/22/2020. I tested positive for COVID 12/27/2020 and experienced mild symptoms such as mild fatigue and congestion. Thinking I had recovered from COVID I returned back to work as a RN on 1/9/2021.  I was told I could still get the 2nd dose of the vaccine if I still wanted to and that I should expect side effects of possible fevers, chills, fatigue and that they can last up to 3 days. I went ahead and got my 2nd dose on 1/13/2021. By the next day I had chills and extreme fatigue. I was expecting it and thought it would go away by the next two days. By day 4 I was feeling just as bad and actually felt worse than I did when first testing positive for COVID. On 1/17/2021 I experienced shortness of breath and palpitations while getting dressed. I went to ED and was sent home. On 1/19/2021 I experienced similar symptoms while driving home from DR appointment. Went to ER again and was sent home and was told it was all post covid symptoms.

Moved to observation chair for further assessment and vitals check. Upon getting up to go to the new chair, was lightheaded. Vital signs taken and revealed tachycardia and increased BP beyond normal values. Prior symptoms persist. Healthcare workers continue to monitor me while sitting on chair.  Oral Tylenol for headache was given. Approximately 30-45 minutes in I feel chest palpitations and an uneasy &#39;anxious&#39; type of feeling even though I am just sitting down and staying calm. Due to all these symptoms plus the BP and HR remaining high they gave me  Benadryl 25mg IM to the right arm as well. The BP started to slowly go down after about 2 hrs as well as HR. Allowed to leave hospital vaccination clinic, while BP and HR still high, was better than the first 2 hours.   New symptoms on day 2, pain left arm at injection site and muscles, fatigue and some intermittent nausea. The symptoms continued for 3-4 days post vaccination. I monitored Vitals at home.  BP finally stabilized to my normal range around the 4th day.

                                                Roughly 45 minutes after receiving dose 2 of the Pfizer vaccine, my face began to feel funny and then became itchy. This is the same thing that happens when I eat shellfish. It didn&#39;t last for more than 45 minutes, and I didn&#39;t need to take anything for it.   I also woke up in the middle of the night with horrible pain throughout my entire left arm, from my shoulder down through my hand. This lasted a couple hours and then returned to just moderate soreness at the injection site only.

                                                Had second dose on Saturday; headache and body aches the rest of Saturday and Sunday. Monday just body aches. Tuesday around 12:30pm during lunch break felt like I had something in my eye. Pulling out white stringy stuff and about 20 mins after initial feeling my eyes were nearly swollen shut, felt like lots of sand in my eyes, and a headache. I do not have any food or seasonal allergies, only allergy to sulfa.

                                                After 30 min post vaccination my hands started itching like crazy - skin was red and blotchy appearance but no rashy appearance.  Lasted about 2 hours still after medicating myself with antihistamines.  About 3 days after the vaccine I noticed a different vaginal discharge that has a different odor, almost like a  metallic one.  I am not sexually active at the moment  but this happened after the vaccine. I have never smelled something like this. It does not smell like an STD odor. I got body aches and severe headaches, congestion and runny nose, I felt terrible, I had a low grade fever (99.1F) I am usually on the 97F range) , general malaise and fatigue, I could not get out of the bed, just to go out to the bathroom. Went to the PCP who tested me for flu and covid and both were negative.  The symptoms lasted about 48 to 72 hours.  Except the discharge/vaginal odor all symptoms subsided.

                                                This is a 37 y.o. woman who developed an episode of acute self-limited hemolysis just over a week following her second injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine immediately prior to the episode for a urinary tract infection.  She had no history of hemolysis prior to this episode.  She was in her usual state of health and received COVID-19 vaccines on 12/24 and 1/14 with the Pfizer vaccine and had no serious side effects at that time.  She then developed dysuria and was seen by telehleath by her primary care physician who prescribed ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine for her for 3 days ending 1/22.  She took these and her dysuria resolved, however the day after developed what appeared to be blood in her urine.  Then in the following 2 days which were a weekend this worsened and she started feeling poorly.  She also noted that she appeared yellow.  On Monday 1/25 her boyfriend took her to urgent care and she was subsequently sent to an ER at the hospital that referred her to our hospital.  There she was evaluated for gross hematuria with no evidence of urinary bleeding and found to be anemic due to hemolysis.  Her hemoglobin was in the 5&#39;s and she received 2 units of PRBCs.  She was transferred here to Medical Center for further management.  After the initial transfusion she did not require blood transfusion and her hemoglobin continued to increase until it was 10.4 on 2/1 which was the day of discharge.  At a follow up appointment on 2/8/2021 she was recovering and feeling well.   Her jaundice had resolved.   No treatment was given from the hemolysis aside from the blood transfusion and it was self-limited.  It is most likely that her acute hemolysis was due to the phenazopyridine as this agent is known to cause hemolysis and she took it for 3 days prior to the onset of hemolysis.  She has no prior history of drug induced hemolysis and had not taken this medication previously.  As this occurred just over a week following her second vaccination I cannot exclude that is could be related to the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the second shot at approximately 1030AM, I returned home and felt fairly normal. In the evening, I started to feel very weak and developed a fever of 101.9 and took 500mg tylenol and continued to hydrate with water and powerade. Throughout the evening, I checked my temperature, it ranged from 101.9-102.8. I also developed strong chills, which caused me to shiver to the point where my significant other thought I may be seizing. (this also happened with the first shot - fevers and chills). I went to bed, waking up 3 hours later and I had to change my pajamas as I was soaked in sweat. I became nauseous and vomited a decent amount of what appeared to be red blood - but did not want to go to the ER as I was cold and exhausted and extremely feverish. Throughout the next 36 hours I continued to run a fever and struggled to do basic household chores (wash a dish, walk up and down the stairs, change shirts, etc) without assistance - normally not things I would need help with. Having had COVID nearly 90 days ago, the aftermath of the vaccination was worse than the actual illness for me.

Went to bed cold and then woke up several times very hot and sweaty, but don&#39;t know if this was related to vaccine, since this happens on occasion without the vaccine.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 01-13-2021 at 8:30am in my left upper arm.  By 3pm that day, my left arm was very tender to the point I couldn?t lift it up and I began having whole body chills and shivering along with extreme fatigue. I went to bed at 5:30pm that night and woke up around 11:30pm to my whole body shaking and shivering and my teeth where chattering together. My husband said I was confused at that time and kept repeating that I was freezing. I must have had 5 blankets piled on top of me to try to get me to warm up.  By the next morning, I soaked through the bedsheets and had extreme fatigue (like I had a hard time keeping my eyes open) all over body aches, fever and chills.  I remained this way for the next week.  At the end of the 1st week I still had chills, extreme fatigue, nausea and horrible headaches and my left arm pain turned into left elbow joint pain. By the end of the 2nd week, I still had extreme fatigue, headaches and left elbow pain along with body tremors. On 1-28-2021, I went to the hospital due to having two episodes where I felt so dizzy I had to lay down on the ground until the dizzy spells subsided. I was given IV fluids and sent home with orders to rest. By the end of the 3rd week I no longer had body tremors or dizzy spells but I still had extreme fatigue needing multiple naps a day along with headaches at which time my primary doctor prescribed me Imitrex to help alleviate the headaches and I still had left elbow joint pain. I also developed bronchitis. It is now February 25, 2021 and I am still having fatigue and mild to moderate headaches along with the left elbow joint pain along with some right elbow joint pain. I have been out of work for over a month now due to my fatigue and joint pain.

                                                Immediately after vaccine felt flushed with high heart rate and lightheaded. An hour after, developed chronic mild headache, chronic mild lightheadedness, and chronic moderate fatigue which are expected symptoms with the immune response. HOWEVER, symptoms did not improve in 3 days and actually very slowly worsened until I couldn?t function for work about 2.5 weeks after the vaccine. At this point, the lightheadedness and fatigue were severe and headaches varied between moderate to severe, resulting in me being out of work for 9 consecutive  work days. Had multiple MD visits with tons of tests. During the time I was out, I developed severe lower abdominal pain for two days and severe lightheadedness/nausea/mild vomitting due to being nauseated with chronic headaches. OTC meds did not help much for the headaches nor other symptoms. I have never dealt with symptoms like these before and am very healthy.  At the 4.5 week mark post vaccine, these symptoms finally started to very slowly improve, VERY slowly. Tests at MD were inconclusive. I?m still dealing with chronic mild headaches, lightheadedness, and this past Friday now unusual chest pains that move location and severity.

                                                Within 12-14 hours from receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine, I began to have symptoms that initially started as general malaise, fatigue, and muscle and aches and pains. By 2am On 2/09/21, I began having chills and by 6am, I had a fever of 101. F. Pain at the injection site started to develop , which I understood is a normal side effect of vaccines in general, but then over the course of hours to days, the pain began to radiate up my arm to my shoulder, and up my neck, to my head where a severe headache would ensue and render me unable to perform my daily activities. For days I was feeling unwell causing me to call out sick from my job as a nurse more than once. I also feel pain in my axilla and breast tissue adjacent to my arm pit, directly beneath the injection site. I also experienced nausea when the headache and muscle aches were at their worst. The fever eventually subsided after a few days, but the headache has persisted despite taking Ibuprofen as directed by my physician via a telehealth visit on day 3. (I called for an appointment on day 2, but they only had the next day available.) The headache pain is heavy, sharp, piercing, and throbbing, definitely interrupting with my daily activities. I have to go lay down and apply an ice pack to my head and neck area several times a day. These symptoms had been persisting for several days in a row and after being seen by my doctor again on the 8th day because of the symptoms, she recommended I go to the emergency room to address the persisting headaches and rule out any head bleeding and report the symptoms related to the vaccine. I was also advised by my physician to consider skipping the 2nd dose of the vaccine because of my severe reaction to the first one.

I also have the normal symptoms like headache and sore arm. Tops of my hands seem puffy and red.  Extreme thirst and hunger.

I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s related, but I couldn&#39;t really focus on work-related tasks - I don&#39;t know if it was just the nervousness of waiting for side effects or what.  Day after vaccine (Wed 3/10): Mild headache that came and went through the day (I took acetaminophen in the early evening), tiredness, injection site soreness (noticed bruise forming), and felt &#34;off&#34; - not quite nauseated, but not normal self.  Same lack of focus/productivity.  Two days after vaccine (Thur 3/11): No headache, injection site soreness waning (but bruise is bigger), not as tired, better focus, but in the evening, I felt a hard rounded node above my collarbone (about two fingers wide).  Freaked out, Googled it, saw swollen lymph nodes on side of vaccine site is somewhat typical.  Appears to be my left supraclavicular lymph node and if you look hard enough, you can visibly see the left side is slightly swollen.  I cannot feel any other swollen lymph nodes.  Today (Fri 3/12):  Bruised injection site, and this swollen, hard lymph node is quite sore.  Other than that, I feel fine at the moment.

                                                Scenario: Pharmacist administered immunization and patient  had immediate reaction to imz. The patient has multiple health conditions such as lupus, cerebral palsy, and is currently on dialysis. She indicated on the PQCF that she had never had an adverse reaction after a vaccine but after the incident, her husband indicated this was normal and not uncommon.    SIG: Pharmacist Administered Immunization   What happened (Describe in detail, what occurred)? * The patient came in for a covid vaccine; this was the first of a 2 series of Pfizer. * The pharmacist injected the immunization and a few minutes afterwards the husband called for the pharmacist to come because his wife didn&#39;t feel well. She immediately became unresponsive and her eyes rolled back into her head but she came to. She was responding somewhat to questions but she was also slightly mentally impaired at baseline due to her co-morbidities. She never fell to the ground or wanted to lie down, so not a true faint. * The pharmacist offered to call 911 but they both declined. The patient was given water and a banana and taken to a private area to recover until she fell well enough to leave.  How did it happen? * The Pharmacist administered an appropriate, routine vaccine per protocol. *Patient had an somewhat immediate reaction (~4 minutes) after the vaccine. *The pharmacist followed the adverse event protocol. CPR was not administered nor benadryl.  Why did it happen (Root Causes)? * Unknown; patient has no known allergy to the vaccine but has had adverse reactions to different procedures in the past.  Plan of Action * Make sure all pharmacists are refreshed and aware of the adverse reaction protocol. *Document reaction as a SCRT and with VAERS. What specific task will take place to prevent future recurrence? *N/A. Who: * Pharmacist Where: * clinic When: *All pharmacists at location must review by 3/20.

About  01:00, I woke up and I was in a lot of pain. I had hives all over me. Hives were spreading all over my body: hair; arm with the injection; we called 9-1-1 I went to the hospital. They gave me some meds through IV. By that time, I had taken Bendryl and I was there about 4 hours with IV. I felt better but hives didn&#39;t subside. That Sunday afternoon they started getting worse again and I went back to the hospital  (16th)and they gave me rounds of something through IV.  On 17th, I went back to hospital - they gave me another shot for the hives. I worked on the 18th - but was they said I should go home because I didn&#39;t look well. My lip started swelling that night. On the 19th, I went to my doctor and the Dr, used an epi-pen on me and gave me a shot of something for the  welts still on my body. They still didn&#39;t go away.  Symptoms have calmed down - but I still have spots on me. I am on Prilosec and anti-itch - Atarax and some others.

                                                I felt great and had no left home the week prior to vaccine as I work from home and my husband was off. My son was home with us as well. None of us had a cold/virus. I went to the vaccine clinic, received first pfizer and 6 hours later the dizziness, nausea, severe headaches started. After 5 days I had to go to ER because I was still so sick. They did blood work and gave me fluids. Thursday, 9 days after vaccine, I went to PCP as I was still so sick. I could barely work part-time at work 4 hours a day due to severe dizziness and headaches. Today is Saturday, day 10 and I still have dizziness, nausea and severe headaches.

Quickly became short of breath, cough, nauseous and dizzy. I reported my symptoms to the RN in the observation room and took Benadryl. My HR was in the 130s at that time. I then used my EpiPen. They gave me 2 puffs of an albuterol inhaler and a 2nd EpiPen before taking me to the ER where IV allergic reaction protocol was initiated ( famotidine, iv fluids, solumedrol) and a 3rd EpiPen was given along with a duoneb and iv lorazepam. My symptoms improved after the 3rd EpiPen and seems to slowly resolve over the next 48 hours. &#34;  Per ED note Patient is a 37 y.o. female presenting to the ED with shortness of breath and throat tightness. Immediately after getting a COVID vaccine today, patient developed sudden onset of shortness of breath, voice hoarseness and throat tightness. She gave herself IM epinephrine, Benadryl, and albuterol puffs through the inhaler prior to arrival. She was in her normal state of health prior to today. Patient has hx of vocal cord dysfunction, mast cell activation syndrome, and anaphylaxis, and has required epinephrine drips in the past with ICU hospitalizations. Has also needed intubation in the past.  Initial evaluation reveals patient to be tachypneic, tachycardic and anxious. &#43;stridor and hoarse voice. Patient gave herself IM epinephrine prior to arrival along w Benadryl and albuterol puffs. Says her symptoms feel similar to what she has had before w anaphylaxis. Patient was given additional IV methyprednisolone, pepcid, Duonebs, and ativan. She was monitored and her work of breathing improved. No additional epinephrine was needed and patient was monitored in the ED for a few hours.&#34;

Breathing worse, 2 more puffs. Breathing not improving enough, tongue started to feel weird. Went to ER. 3:45 went to ER. By 4:45 I was in a room, saw physician at 5:45. I had a heart rate in 140s in triage, and a low BP around 90/60. My tongue continued to feel funny and started to get hard to talk. It felt heavy, but medical staff didn&#39;t think swollen. I was given a breathing treatment, Benadryl, Pepcid, IV fluids and monitored. 8:15 I was asked to walk a bit to make sure oxygen was staying up. My chest tightness was getting worse but since my oxygen stayed at 95 when walking, was discharged. As of today, I still struggle to control my breathing and have an appointment with my allergist for tomorrow. I&#39;m scheduling albuterol treatments every 4 hours around the clock and continue to take Pepcid and Benadryl in addition to my normal meds. 3/20 I developed uterine cramping, felt like I was having back labor as the result. Uterine cramping resolved 3/21 but severe soreness in back remained.

                                                I have had persistent headaches since the vaccination date. I developed a headache (HA) within 30 minutes of receiving the dose, and for 14 days straight I was so fatigued and had a persistent HA, it was hard to go to work. Ever since then, I have headaches almost daily. About half of them turn into migraines and the other half are just general HAs, and I continue to feel somewhat more fatigues than I did prior to vaccination. I have not felt ?right? since vaccination. I don?t remember a day where I did not have a headache- even if I wake up feeling well the HA develops within a few hours. It cannot be attributed to medication overuse because I rarely take medications to treat them for fear of causing medication-overuse-headaches.  I am a healthcare provider.

                                                Within one hour of the shot administration I became tachycardia, hypertensive, and with chills. Over the next 48 hours my symptoms worsened to include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and near syncope requiring an emergent visit to the ER.  My symptoms persisted and two weeks  later I required another visit to the ER and was admitted to the hospital overnight due to tachycardia, hypertension, diarrhea, chest pressure, headaches, fatigue, weakness, chills, and near syncope.  Since the onset of events post the Pfizer vaccine, I have required multiple visits with MDs/specialist for management of symptoms and course of treatment.  My local physician suspected postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) of which I seeked medical opinion and met with a world expert and after meeting with him, he concluded my symptoms were in fact in line with POTS.  Since then I have continued to experience flare-ups and episodes of tachycardia, most recently 4/14/2021.  It has now been over 3 months since the onset of symptoms post vaccine and I continue to require treatment and management of above symptoms.  I have not returned back to previous level of function nor have I been able to return to work.  I do not have any prior medical history of this condition or set of symptoms.

A 37-year-old patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 around 5 pm (at 37-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included migraine. Concomitant medication included amitriptyline since 2018 at 10 mg nightly, 20 mg and 30 mg for migraine and stopped after COVID, and she was feeling tired/ sleepy and that made it worse; riboflavin sodium phosphate (VITAMIN B), and magnesium. The next day on 07Jan2021 about 7:59 am (around 13 hours after receiving the vaccine), all of a sudden she was driving and her jaw was paralyzed, it&#39;s became hard, she couldn&#39;t move it and it was very painful. she never had that and she was driving with her two little kids and it freaked her out and she tried to park and she finally parked being it lasted for a couple of minutes. When she looked at the time again it was 8:03 am, it was gone. She needed to get her kids to safety because she was driving but then it went away. On 09Jan2021, she started to have all of a sudden this tension on her neck that felt like a neck injury, it was hard to move her neck to a certain side and started while she was working. It was progressing and she thought she hurt herself. The pain began to lead to a severe headache. The neck pain felt like an injury lasted for a couple of days, but headache persisted and was intense, it lasted for 2 weeks and her coworkers thought she had COVID. She worked on 09Jan2021 and 10Jan2021 and then called out after that. On 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 the pain was not just in her head but in the left eye, it was throbbing and severe pain deep inside. It lasted for a couple of days lasted for over a week, it was not as bad as the first couple of days, the pain was the most severe on the 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 and couldn&#39;t do anything and stayed in bed. It felt like it was nerve pain and she never had that before, it was definitely different. She took daily anti migraine medicine and as long as she took it she doesn&#39;t have migraine headaches. For her Sumatriptan 50 mg, she took it twice on 12Jan2021, but because of the side effects it makes her nauseous and she couldn&#39;t take it anymore, she just has the prescription. She was only allowed to have 10 a month. It is sumatriptan and it didn&#39;t work either and she was supposed to take it to reverse the headache and it didn&#39;t work. For the amitriptyline, its 10 mg and had to triple to 30 mg. She took it at nighttime, but one of the side effects is that it made her sleepy but she didn&#39;t sleep. She has a 3 month supply and had plenty, if she needed to adjust but that was her first time she was taking that much, her doctor said she could up her dose to 20 mg, her gave her permission before because it can be used at higher doses if needed, she did try the 20 mg but that did not work so she had to triple to 30 mg. Once she realized that was not helping she just said forget it. She had to triple the dose of her migraine medicine and she was taking 3000-4000 mg of paracetamol (TYLENOL) even that couldn&#39;t take it down and even did cold compresses. The headaches lasted for a couple of weeks and then she finally got COVID. The headache after that was different, not as intense, and even taking paracetamol a couple times per day was dealing with this headache, the fever the body aches. It is not like the headache she got from the vaccine. It lasted for another week with COVID and was different and managing the headache. So currently she was good. She stopped taking amitriptyline, she was taking it for 3 years and was switched to Vitamin B2 and magnesium in the last month and had no headaches. She had to switch after getting COVID because she felt more tired and sleepy and felt that the amitriptyline would make it worse so she had to find something else. She was good with the new medications. She was cleared to go back to work on 03Feb2021. She was pretty much good by 03Feb2021. She was told by her MD not to get a second dose but her employer stated she could be terminated if she was not fully vaccinated. She was concerned and scared of having this reaction again. Her arm pain hurt for a few hours but because she has other pain she thought it was her left arm but she really couldn&#39;t recall. she did have pain in her arm, it was normal pain nothing significant. It started at 11 pm on 06Jan2021 and lasted until Saturday 09Jan2021 and remembered that she had a hard time helping at work because she has to used the arm but the arm soreness was just like with any other vaccine, nothing abnormal. From 10Jan2021 to 13Jan2021 she kept feeling she like had something in her throat in the morning, and when she would start drinking she couldn&#39;t swallow like her body forgot how to do it. She would hold it in her mouth and then 30 seconds later she would start swallowing and then it went away. It was just in the morning for like 4 days. It cleared by 14Jan2021, clarifies it ended then. Caller stated her husband took a test on 11Jan2021 and didn&#39;t get his results until 14Jan2021 and showed he was positive and he was already isolating and she was at home with the kids. States her husband was the one that brought it in. She did start to have COVID symptoms until 23Jan2021, she had fever, chills, body ache, runny nose, shortness of breath and diarrhea. She was prescribed a z pack, azithromycin, and it helped with cough, the congestive cough and nasal spray for her runny nose. It was water coming out of her nose, most runny she has ever felt. She got testing and kept going for testing because she felt so sick and it was negative (on 13Jan2021 and 18Jan2021). She finally tested positive on 25Jan2021. No additional therapies for COVID-19. No other test performed, they see patients that keep testing positive 3 months later after no symptoms and just want to wait for symptoms to go down.

A contactable 38-year-old female Nurse (patient)  reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021) at single dose since 22Dec2020.  Relevant history and concomitant drug was none. The patient excepted Covid 19 vaccine could decrease the chance of contacting Covid 19 virus, while she stated she was getting a red patchy hives and itchy waves of red rashes all over the body just after received the vaccine. The patient (nurse) stated, &#34;I would if I can explain a little more, the day after I received the Covid vaccine I had noticed a big like what I would explain it like a red hives, like a raised red rash on my left hip it last like a day its subsided and next morning I woke up and I had a different flares that was the same on my other side of my body again went away. After a day when I woke up and I had two new spot on my knee that was the other thing, those went away on that day. This morning I woke up and I had another one on my shoulder and on my lower back. I am also thinking I am getting one may be on my ear like I said they pop up and they itch a little and they go away. I never ever experienced anything like it and I see the only thing that I have changed in my life or regimen or added to my body so I just wanted to make sure it was reported. I am nervous and curious if it is a potential side effect added if I should be careful before getting second one all those things.&#34;  No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of events was unknown. When probed for the Causality, the nurse stated, &#34;I have no idea, if it is something going on with me that is completely unrelated its just occurred right after I got the vaccine so I have no idea if this is a separate issue or not. I going to see dermatologist and physician but until then I just thought to report it to you all to see if anybody is experiencing this and to know if it is safe to go for second dose.&#34;

                                                I felt weak and with muscle fatigue the day after the shot. Also had a headache and neck muscle tension and mid back muscle tension. Joint pains as well. These subsided after 48 hours except for the neck and upper back muscle fatigue and mild soreness. This gave me a low grade headaches almost daily since the vaccine. I took ibuprofen a few times which helped. On the 6th I awoke at night and felt weak all over. I felt like I was falling in my bed. Mild dizziness.  I went to work and felt extremely fatigued with muscle weakness but no neuro deficits. I feared some terrible autoimmune illness and took Decadron that day- 4mg tab BID. This helped my muscle weakness but left me with insomnia. The decadron is now wearing off after 4 days and I still have muscle weakness/fatigue. It takes considerable effort walking up the stairs. Yesterday my masseter muscles became fatigued with little chewing. My arms feel heavy when I lift them. The strange thing is that at night when I lie down I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is being triggered. I will get palpitations and feel just strange- I can&#39;t describe it.  I took valium to sleep last night -5 mg tablets that my doctor gave me Saturday as there seems to be an anxiety panic component going on. I have no history of diagnosed anxiety or panic attacks- I have never felt this way before. Today I feel a little better but still have considerable muscle fatigue and neck and upper back muscle soreness and overall muscle tightness in my arms and legs- feels good to stretch kind of feeling. I have mild dizziness when standing up and turning too abruptly. But no considerable focal neuro deficits.

                                                That evening I started getting a sore arm. The next morning I woke up w/ a slight headache and just did not feel right. As the day progressed I started having body aches, chills, extreme fatigue, still sore arm. I could not stand for long periods of time or I would start to fell like I was going fall right there in the floor.

I had a temperature of 99.1. I went to an urgent care and my BP was elevated (very unusual for me) 140/100 and HR 110 and temp still 99.1.  They did a rapid swab on me that was negative. I continued to feel awful the rest of the day. On Sunday the next morning I awoke because I had a very swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit. I took tylenol and did warm compresses. I had continued fatigue on Sunday and slept the whole day. I also continued with a high heart rate 110-130 with activity. My Bp was 117/70I had a pulse oximeter at home. My temp stayed 99.  Monday morning I woke up feeling better. My HR was in the 80 and temp 98.3 and fatigue is gone. I still have mild soreness in my left arm but the redness is fine and warmth is gone. My left armpit is still sore

I fell asleep. I woke up around 0200 on 1/13/21 with extreme muscle and joint aches, a sensation of pins, needles, and tingling all over my body I felt very jittery and was actually shaking slightly throughout the ordeal. I felt like my nervous system was overloaded and my perception of pain was extremely heightened. At one point during this 4 hour period I had a visual hallucination. By 0600 I was feeling better- more relaxed. Muscle aches and sore joints are still present today. Also have a slight increase in temp 99.6 and injection site pain.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart began to race and I became very warm and sweaty. I was brought into another room for monitoring and my heart rate was above 100. After some breathing exercises, it came back down to the high 70s for a few minutes but then increased again into the 90s, at one point it was 113. My chest and throat then began to feel tight and I began sweating again. My face also felt funny on my right cheek. At that point I was first given 25 mg of benedryl then epinephrine. I was then taken to the emergency room via ambulance and was observed for approximately an hour. I was given an additional 25 mg of benedryl and discharged at 4:55pm. I was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and prescribed 25 mg of benedryl every 6 hours over the next 24 hours. The following morning, I experienced a hot flash with profuse sweating followed by chills. I was very tired and felt feverish throughout the day on 1/12 and stayed home from work. On 1/13 I still felt tired but was able to work. Today I feel mostly normal but still occasionally have had heart palpitations.

                                                When I got up at 0530 yesterday (1/19) my right arm was so sore I couldn&#39;t lift it. I got to work at 0700 and felt really drained and tired. I fell asleep without realizing it at some point and a coworker saw me and woke me up at 0930. I attended a lecture at 1000 and started feeling chills, aches, and was sweating. I tried to take notes but couldn&#39;t remember how to spell a lot of basic words and couldn&#39;t get my brain to focus.  My boss sent me home at 1145. I was driving home and when I got off the interstate I couldn&#39;t remember which way to turn at the light off the exit. I had to pull up a navigation app on my phone to remember how to get home.  When I got home I took my temperature and it was 98.5F. I slept for 3 hours, picked my kids up from school, and then slept for another 2 hours. I took my temperature at 1900 and it was 98.5F still. My chills and aches had lessened but not disappeared by the time I went to bed at 2100, but by the time my alarm went off at 0530 this morning I felt completely back to normal.

A 38-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot EL1283, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 07:00 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID 19 immunization. Medical history included GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), migraines, and indoor allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the vaccination. The patient had no Covid prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included mometasone furoate (FLONASE), taken within two week prior to vaccination. The patient previously took codeine and was allergic to it; and flu vaccine and experienced intolerance and short term dizziness. Patient had first dose of Pfizer COVID 19 bnt162b2 as COVID 19 immunization on 19Dec2020 at 07:30 AM, intramuscularly on the left arm. No other vaccines were taken in the four weeks. Patient received second Pfizer dose on Saturday (09Jan2021) at approximately 7:00am. Consistent with prior history of dizziness following flu vaccines, patient started to develop mild dizziness and mild brain fog mid afternoon (reported as 09Jan2021 11:30). Flu-like symptoms and headache started around 8:00pm and resolved around 6:00pm on Sunday (the following day; 10Jan2021). Mild nausea also experienced Sunday morning (10Jan2021). Unfortunately, patient was still experiencing dizziness and brain fog that comes and goes and was worse midafternoon.

                                                Upon walking to the 15 minute observation area I felt a burning sensation that came over my entire body like alcohol in my veins.  I felt it in my stomach, head, hands, all over.   I told the workers that I didnt feel well.  They moved me to the bathroom and propped me up over the sink sitting in a chair.  I felt very lightheaded at that point and somewhat responsive but was feeling very bad.  I looked at my iwatch and my heart rate was 198.  I felt lightheaded like I was going to pass out.  They had me move to the floor to prop my feet above my head.  They checked my blood pressure and it was normal.  I had them get my purse with my Xanax.  I took 1.5 tablets of .25mg Xanax.  My heart rate slowly went back to normal around 80BPM after about 15 minutes.  The rest of the day I felt very tired.  I felt normal again at 8pm with bo further side effects.

I slept fairly well on Thursday evening. When I woke up on Friday morning, I had a pounding headache and my body ached. I was still sluggish and tired. Later that morning I also felt very nauseous. Pain relievers did not seem to help relieve any of my symptoms. I also had chills throughout the day. My arm and armpit hurt very bad throughout the day as well. Friday evening I did not sleep well. I was sweating and my body ached all over. Nothing seemed to provide relief. When I woke up on Saturday morning, I still had chills, body aches and a headache.  Pain relievers did seem to help. By about 2pm I started feeling better and like myself again.   Today is Monday and I do still have a sore arm and armpit. My armpit is swollen.

                                                The day following the 2nd vaccination dose, I had zero symptoms other than a slightly sore injection site.  Around hour 30 following the vaccination I began to feel warm, and I got up to brush my teeth and cool off in the bathroom.  As I was brushing my teeth, I started experiencing an increasing ringing noise in both my ears that I thought was strange and somewhat alarming, but I didn&#39;t feel any signs of dizziness or dysphoria.  The next thing I remember is waking up the bathroom floor with my husband standing over me.  Apparently I experienced a complete lose of consciousness and feel to the floor, hitting my chin on the bathroom vanity as I feel and splitting my chin open, which I have zero recollection of.  My husband states that when he found me, that my eyes were open, but I was staring blankly at him with a glazed over look and my whole body was limp and diaphoretic.  I came too in about 30 seconds after he found me, but I was very confused, not making a lot of sense, and felt very disoriented and weak.  It took about 20 mins for my fever to break, and to have the strength and power to get up and walk to bed.  We changed all my clothes because I had soaked through them, and he got me into bed after cleaning/bandaging up my chin.  I then slept solidly until noon the next day, which is very unlike me, but since then I have felt relatively fine with no other experiences of fever/chills/disorientation, just some continued mild fatigue off and on.  After discussing with my nursing colleagues, they all had similar experiences around hour 24-30 post 2nd vaccine with fevers, chills, restless sleep, or just general malaise, but no one experienced a complete loose of consciousness, so I reached out to my PCP yesterday, and she confirmed today that I should report this to VAERS.  I have never experienced any form of loss of consciousness/fainting/black-out/syncope prior to this, which is another reason I thought it was important for me to report this.

Wasn&#39;t any better and lost my taste and smell for 3 days. Went to the Clinic, was tested for Covid-19 and the flu both negative. Went back to the Clinic and had chest x-ray, diagnosed with right middle lobe pneumonia.  Sent home with doxycycline and zofran. Took the Medication as directed. Still feeling dizzy and lightheaded, and still winded and extremely tired after doing the slightest bit of house work, whether it would be sweeping the floor, doing dishes, or laundry. I get extremely after doing one activity. I still have not driven.

                                                I had terrible insomnia and the worst headache Wednesday night. When I finally went to sleep I tossed and turned and was cold and hot. I woke up with barely any strength. I slept from 8am-1:30pm Thursday. I had body aches, an upset stomach, muscle aches, and overall felt yucky. Friday I went to work for a presentation and was feeling awful. I had a fever and took some ibuprofen. My injection site was swollen and warm to the touch. I was dripping sweat last night Friday night. My lymph nodes are still swollen under my arm where I got the vaccine and my neck.

At 1:00am the next morning I started having chills and shaking which continued until 4am when I started having back cramps and arm cramps where I had my shot. I also felt feverish and had a very bad headache, so I took 600mg  of ibuprofen. I went in to work that morning and had chills and my skin hurt when my clothes touched my skin. I continued to have a headache also. I was sent home by my boss at 12pm on 1/5/21 because I looked and felt so bad and slept through the afternoon and for 10 hours that night. The next day, I continued to take 6oomg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and still had a lot of fatigue. The day after I was tired but them remained symptom free.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID). On 11Jan2021, within about 10 minutes of getting the vaccine she reported that her heart began to race and she became sweaty and uncomfortable. After another 5 minutes or so she began to have difficulty breathing as her chest and throat felt very tight and restricted. She also became lightheaded. Her heart rate was over 100, then dropped into the 70s, then shot back up over 100. Her face had a weird sensation as well. She was given Benadryl first and then epinephrine and had to go to the emergency room via ambulance for observation. She was released after an hour and had to take Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 24 hrs and diagnosed with an allergic reaction. On 12Jan2021,  she had a hot flash upon waking up and felt generally under the weather all day. Her arm was very sore at the injection site. She missed a day of work due to the whole ordeal. On 13Jan2021, she felt more normal but still have some tightness in her chest with a fluttering feeling. The outcome of event diagnosed with an allergic reaction was not recovered; for other events was recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known product safety profile, causality between event allergic reaction to vaccine and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 10 mins after receiving the first dose of Pfizer vaccine - I experienced chest pounding tachycardia. They had me lay on the gurney and checked my pulse ox. My heart rate was 147 but my Sp02 100%.  After about 30 mins or so it naturally came down with no medical interventions.  Otherwise for the first dose my only other reaction was expected fatigue, injection site soreness and mild headache.   Of note - I did go ahead and get my second COVID19 vaccine after consulting with medical professionals on 1/24 and did not experience any chest pounding tachycardia. Maybe mild tachycardia but I was also nervous due to the previous first inject reaction.

A 38-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 14Jan2021 15:30 to 14Jan2021 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing pernicious anaemia, a B12 deficiency diagnosed 2-3 years ago (she gave herself B12 shots and she cannot convert B12 through her food), and myomectomy (15 cm uterine fibroid, removed this past summer). Concomitant medication included ongoing cyanocobalamin (B12) for pernicious anemia. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 28Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and a flu shot (the MA gave it in the back of her arm, it was pretty significant). The patient was a nurse and informed that she received the second COVID vaccine the day before report (14Jan2021). She woke up on the day of report on 15Jan2021 03:00 with a nasty headache, she felt hot, had the creepy crawly shivers, was achy and when she talked, she felt like she had to close her eyes because of pressure, and she was nauseous. She figured this was probably normal but she couldn&#39;t get a hold of her doctor and the hospital she worked at did not know what to tell her. She was wondering if she can take Tylenol or ibuprofen and has even thought about drinking caffeine, that it might help her headache. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor as she got it at work. The first round of the vaccine she only had a super mild sore arm and a slight headache. She received the second vaccine at 3:30pm and then went to bed when she got home. She woke herself up at 3 am because her arm was hurting really bad. She started feeling like she couldn&#39;t keep her legs still. She felt hot, achy, and was shivering. She hasn&#39;t taken her temperature. When she woke up at 3 am she got on her phone, and her eyesight felt like she couldn&#39;t quite focus. It wasn&#39;t bad, but she felt like she was straining. Then her head started hurting at 5-7 am. She was very sensitive to light. She woke up and couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She had cold sweats, and was shivering. Every time she stood up, she was chattering. She felt achy almost like growing pains. She woke up with the arm pain, and then 10-15 minutes later, she started feeling that creepy crawly feeling. She got up and the cool fan hit her, and she realized how bad she was shivering. The shivering intensified at times but hasn&#39;t gotten worse. She had just called employee health and realized that when her eyes were open when she was talking was when she felt nauseated. She has noticed the nausea in the past half hour. She did not know if it was related to the headache or what. She had to cover her eyes, her eyeballs felt sore. When she talked with her eyes open, she felt a little queasy. She was just straining to see. Her vision was not blurry but she can tell she was straining. She did not know if it was because of the headache and nausea. When she got out of bed, the cold fan did not feel cold but it made her shiver. She was a nurse was trying to be socially responsible as she did not want to get COVID. She was a little suspicious because of the headache after the first one. She hasn&#39;t been around anyone in a couple of weeks and had been working from home. She has not been exposed to people. She kept feeling like she needed to stretch because she was sore. The patient was tested for COVID pre-surgery (myomectomy) and was negative. She was also tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any. She was vaccinated at a hospital facility. Patient received no other vaccines on that day. The adverse events did not require any visit to the emergency room or physician office. Patient did not receive prior vaccines in the previous 4 weeks. Outcome of the events cold sweat and &#34;tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any&#34; was unknown, nasty headache was reported as worsened (not recovered), and the remaining events was not recovered. The reporter considered the events serious due to medically significant events and related to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine in the development of the events cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                With the second dose my symptoms started late evening on 01/13/2021. I started feeling bad, but finished my shift. Felt drained, headache to start. By next morning (01/14) I had fever (101.5F) and the whose body aches, nausea, diarrhea, horrible horrible headache, like a migraine, severe congestion, runny nose and some days later I started having an earache on my right ear. I would like to mention I also had a vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor that started with the first dose and had not resolved by the time I received the second dose and this time the odor is much stronger, it is awful, I already made an appt with my GYN. The odor got much stronger about a week after the second dose. I kept self medicating at home with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, but the fever would return as soon as the dose was weaning off. The 101.5F fever lasted for about 9 days.  I also experienced shortness of breath from 01/14 until the 22nd and I never had to use my rescue inhaler before. I had to use it and had to even call for a second one. I am very athletic and active and never need it even after my runs and workout activities. I consulted with my PCP on the 19th and again she gave me a covid test. Negative. She diagnosed me with inner ear infection (right ear). Prescribed me Levaquin and in 2 days I was much better. On the 22nd I finally started seeing the symptoms subside and started feeling better.  Also, I wanted to tell that I had a gas pain episode that almost sent me to the ER. My chest, my left shoulder hurt really really bad. I called a friend who is a physician and he told me to take some gasex first and if that did not work to go to the ER. Fortunately it worked. But the pain was excruciating.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I started to have a very mild headache. It felt like a pressure headache. I took Motrin. About 6 hours later that was gone. That night, about 8 hours after vaccine, I began to have muscle aches - whole body. I was very sore. I went to bed. Next day, I had severe joint and muscle aches and pains. The Motrin did not help that. Ice did not help, heat did not help and rest did not help. No headache. I wasn&#39;t red in face etc. Over the next week, I the muscle aches and joint aches were varying between moderate to severe. Some days it did restrict my activity completely. It started to get better week two - but still moderate to severe. I had some abdominal pain on upper left side and my right side (upper, as well) The upper right side pain would go away with ice but the upper left side wasn&#39;t helped with that. The only thing in those two weeks that helped was Celebrex (Motrin stopped helping). After two weeks - around 2/5/2021, I saw my Dr - a virtual visit. He told me to double up on the dose of Celebrex to help with muscle aches, joint aches and right side abdominal pain. Heart palpitations - irregular heartbeat. On 2/7/2021, I took a test for COVID and it was negative.  The joint and muscle aches were moderate to mild the third week. There was no more abdominal pain in third week. Week 4 - mild joint and muscle aches - only a few days that week and that was it. Last week was the first week where I had a few days that were fine. And this week, I have been completely fine. Had general malaise for three weeks solid. And now it&#39;s gone.

She received second dose 1/13/2021 at 0813 and had no side effects. Around 1500, she developed chest pain and wheezing. She used her albuterol inhaler (pt has asthma), which helped. That night, she developed a sore arm.  She woke 1/14/2021 around 0100-0200 from pain and was unable to go to back to sleep. She had aching in her left arm, as well as shooting pains through her arm and into palm. She took APAP 1000 mg PO x 1 and doxylamine which helped, but she was still unable to go back to sleep d/t pain. The pain expanded into her chest (especially with deep breaths), and upper back. She developed headache, sore throat, sweats and chills, shooting pain in her ear, painful and swollen left axillary lymph node, and the right side of her tongue became numb (numbness subsided after 1-2 hours). 1/14/21 morning, pt has persistent left hand pain, as well as joint pain in her feet, hips, and knees. She took another 1000 mg of APAP, which helped her pain. by 1/14 evening, she took 1000 mg APAP again and was able to sleep, although pt still endorsed sweats/chills.  1/15: Pt reports her pain is better, less severe, though now she is very fatigued and feels like she has been &#34;hit by a truck&#34;. Her left axillary lymph node is still painful and swollen, but less painful than before.

Within 10 minutes of the vaccine she became ill dizziness nausea throwing up vertigo and it persisted for about a week heavily. The nurses were unequipped to handle possible side effects from the vaccine putting her in a corner and having her vomit in a box. They ignored her when suffering from obvious effect from the vaccine.  One nurse on our way out even told her to put on her mask as I dragged her out of terrible situation.She was unable to work drive or function somewhat normally for 4-5 days then it began to diminish. She is still having instances of vertigo and dizziness however much less.

She also experienced difficulty swallowing and went to the ER at 9pm.  At the ER she received solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and was discharged with hydroxyzine, Pepcid, solumedrol dosepak, zofran and epi-pen. At this time she was diagnosed with angioedema.  Swelling persisted and she contacted an allergist who prescribed additional antihistamines.  The allergist advised to her take Zyrtec or Claritin in addition to hydroxyzine day and night. The swelling continued to persist and two weeks later after returning to work for one day, she experienced feeling hot and flushed on right side, increased swelling and difficulty swallowing again and returned to ER on 1/25/21 and was treated with solumedrol and hydroxyzine and was discharged with solumedrol dosepak in addition to continuing antihistamines.  Upon returning to allergist, she was advised to take 4 zyrtec, 4 Claritin, Pepcid 40mg bid and hydroxyzine 10mg at bedtime.  PCP referred her to oncologist. After CT, oncologist diagnosed condition as bilateral lymphadenopathy and to return in 3 months for follow up.  PMH significant for ALL as a child (8 yrs), went into remission at 13yrs.

                                                I got my first Vaccination of the Pfizer shot on Wednesday, with no immediate symptoms. Gradually muscle soreness and fatigue kicked in, but nothing concerning. The next day, my stomach had a burning and unsettling feeling. I tried a couple of Tums, thinking I was having some pregnancy issues, but that didn&#39;t help. I was having waves of nausea. I didn&#39;t have much appetite, and could only manage to eat some potato soup for dinner. I was feeling very weak, lethargic, and needed to lay down the majority of the evening.  I finally had some uncontrollable vomiting by around 9pm, followed by the chills. I slept all night, struggled the next day at work, and left early to sleep the rest of the day since I was just too weak and lethargic to do anything. I consider myself to be very healthy, I exercise every morning, and the pregnancy has been normal. I am in the early 3rd trimester, and my due date is June 14 - this is my second pregnancy. I am an onsite teacher, thus I have built up a strong immune system and never get sick, so this caught me by surprise. I am feeling much better today, and I will absolutely get the second Pfizer shot later this month. I will try to better prepare myself as I hear the symptoms may be worse on the second shot. My sister, a pharmacist, insisted that I should share this information, in case it is helpful for data.

By the time I went to bed it was feeling strange up to my  right elbow.  I woke up (3/12/21 about 6a) with both hands (mostly all my fingers) looking very white (like Raynaud phenomenon).  My right hand to elbow still feels strange and seems most affected (shot was administered on Left deltoid).  My right hand almost feels like I have a glove on (wetsuit material).. I&#39;ve been trying to keep circulation to them by taking hot showers and rubbing them.  They now seem more reddish and almost like chilblains might occur.   They feel tingling.   I have previously had chilblains in my feet when they were cold, but I&#39;ve been good at managing and don&#39;t get that anymore.  Never had it in my hands previously..

                                                Pt received her vaccination around 11.58am and advised to stay for observation by RPh for 30minutes due to history of her throat closing up due to Aleve allergy years ago. Patient started reporting fast heartbeat about 10minutes after and we concluded that it might be because she was anxious and continued to observe pt. However, she started feeling foggy, tongue felt numb, and throat started to hurt as well. Pt was not able to clarify whether her throat was closing up. Due RPh professional  judgement, she gave pt EpiPen 0.3mg injection on Left thigh considering pt history and called paramedics. Pt was seen by paramedics at the pharmacy and brought to ER/urgent care for treatment. Called patient several hours after, and she is currently fine at home.

I let the staff know and they hoked me up to blood pressure monitor and monitored heart rate. My pulse was high at about 103bpm. My blood pressure got as high as 155/84, I believe. I was feeling very uneasy and not like myself. Luckily about twenty minutes later, these symptoms went away. I did not check these two things again, but I felt better. My arm was sore, but I know that was to be expected. I also felt like I could taste a medicine taste for about 24 hours.

                                                I started feeling groggy after the shot, which seemed normal. By Sunday afternoon, i felt foggy and off like i was in a brain fog. And, Monday, I started feeling vertigo and like I was rocking with a headache. By Wednesday, i was worried because it was impacting my day to day so i went to urgent care. They told me to go to the emergency room, which i did on  Thursday. They did a cat scan, which was clear, tested me for COVID ( negative) and ran bloodwork. I am planning to go to the ENT doctor on Monday, but still feel off and am concerned about getting the second shot next week. My second dose is scheduled for Thursday, March 25th. I have never had vertigo before and I just feel off all day and it started after my vaccine.

It last about 45 minutes and then subsided. My tounge also felt funny and I felt dizzy for a little bit.  I was woken up out of dead sleep a little after midnight the night I received the vaccine and my heart was racing again and lasted about an hour. The next day I just felt off but nothing specific. By 3 PM the next day I felt fine. I tried to stay as hydrated as possible and used cold compresses while my heart was racing.

I work in the health care field so I was able to get my vaccine early. I do not have any redness or lumps now. It is slightly warm to touch, but when pressed it seems to sink in some. It is a dull ache which keeps me sleeping on my back. It has not gotten any better. I will reach out to my primary soon.

                                                (note: I had no reaction to the first dose)  13 hours after receiving my second dose I had been in bed for a couple of hours unable to get comfortable because I felt weird. That?s when my ankles and feet began to itch. I checked for mosquito bites, none were there but I noticed that my ankles and feet were swollen. I applied a lotion recommended eczema  thinking my skin might be dry. Over the next hour the itching got worse and spread up my calves. That?s when I noticed that my tongue felt weird and kinda poofy. I?m used to occasional dry mouth due to my meds, but this was nothing like that. It freaked me out so I got up took Allegra hoping that on top of the Zyrtec I?d taken hours before would help. Since I was restless and desperately needed sleep  I took 1/2 of a 15mg trazadone tablet. That did the trip. No itching and I was able to sleep. Now I?ve been in bed all day with flu-like symptoms, I?m miserable and I?ve missed work. Unless I awake tomorrow morning feeling magically better I?ll miss work again.  The itching and swollen tongue  really freaked me out, hence my report today.

Joints, muscles etc. The next 3-4 days I could barely get out of bed. Moving was agony. I treated with Advil as I was told to.

                                                For 2 weeks following the second dose of Pfizer I experienced severe adverse reactions: dizziness, vertigo, headaches, Paresthesia (tingling and numbness in hands, feet, arms, and legs),  nausea, slow digestion, loss of appetite, extreme fatigue (I could not perform any kind of daily activity for several days). I have been admitted to the ER twice over the 2 weeks. After undergoing multiple exams (ultrasound, detailed blood tests, MRI, CT scan), nothing major was found. My doctor prescribed antisthamine for dizziness and nausea. The symptoms have subsided since then.

Still dry next morning and a couple hrs later it switched to increased salivation.  The evening after injection I had a headache and  just felt general malaise and fatigue, &#34;run down&#34;. Difficulty sleeping that night due to body aches. HEadache, neck and lower back pain. Skin sensitivity when touched, bed sheets kinda hurt my skin. The bodyaches and malaise persisted through out day 2. Tylenol seemed to help.  I slept better that night but woke up with night sweats, completely drenched.  Arm pain at injection site on day 2 that resolved by mid day.  Now 1 week later I have extreme fatigue yesterday and today. I do have hypersomnia but not even my adderall is helping. Not sure if this is related or not.

                                                I developed immediate flushing, sweating, rapid heartbeat (was around 110bpm, is normally around 75bpm), and lightheadedness.  I sat down and had a few sips of water.  Within a few minutes, I felt like I was having a difficult time getting a good breath in.   I raised my hands over my head and took slow deep breaths to try and keep my breathing  under control.  I stayed at the hospital for about 45 minutes, over which time I had a few bites to eat and some water.   The flushing and sweating resolved within that time.  The lightheadedness and &#34;feeling of doom&#34; lasted about 3 hours.  I had no anxiety going into this vaccine, nor have I had a reaction like this before.

                                                Severe anterior right shoulder pain associated with very limited ROM due to pain. No pain at injection site. No swelling or erythema at injection site. Pain is in anterior shoulder and radiates down right arm. Pain is constant but worse with movement. Pain started the night that vaccine was given 1/2/2021 and has been persistent since then making it difficult to work. Pain not relieved with tylenol or ibuprofen. Pain is more severe that what would be expected from needle trauma. Of note, vaccine was given particularly high near subdeltoid bursa.

A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 24Dec2020 at 08:00 AM in the hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, has no known allergies, had no other medications in two weeks, and did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. At 3:00 PM of 24Dec2020, the patient developed a severe tachycardia with no other symptoms. She walked herself to the ER (Emergency room/department or urgent care), was nervous and kind of shaking. By the time they got to her, her heart rate was stable and was at 88. Transient tachycardia was at around 120-140 for 7 minutes and resolved with no intervention. Basic labs came back normal. She got discharged from the ER. The patient didn&#39;t think they reported it but she was willing to cooperate in any way. The patient was not treated for the adverse events. As per the patient, she reported her adverse reaction (after the 1st dose) on the website as recommended. She experienced &#34;very fast heart beat 8 hours after receiving the vaccine&#34;. The patient was inquiring if she would be contacted after. The patient also asked if the very fast heartbeat was related to the vaccine because the reaction did not happen right away like usual, she was not sure if it was an allergic reaction since it happened 8 hours later. Outcome of the event &#39;Tachycardia&#39; was recovered in Dec2020, while for the other events was unknown. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

After about 20 minutes, I felt better. Later that day, I came home and slept for 2 hours. The next day, (today) I came home early from work because I feel very tired and having difficulty concentrating. But the other symptoms have gone away.

I tried to read my email and the words were there but didn&#39;t have meaning.  I had to drive home after my 15 minute observation and plugged my home address into my gps so I wouldn&#39;t get lost even though I drove home from Medical Center for years.  I got home and laid down and slept for a couple hours and woke up fine.  I felt ok the following day and was doing laundry around 6 pm and my arm stopped being sore and I got really dizzy and nauseated and my vision had shadows (reminded me of an ocular migraine) and drank 2 x 16 oz glasses of water and laid down and felt better in about 20-30 minutes.

                                                I had a slight headache while at work but was fine. I was home and was a little cold and my throat was scratchy. . Then about 9pm all of a sudden I started to get waves of chills. My hand were cold and my feet were frozen. I layered up with sweater and sweatpants to go to bed with a heavy comforter. I just could not get warm. About 1am, I woke up and put on my thick winter socks on because my feet were still frozen. I kept reminding myself to breathe in deeply.  I checked my BPM and it was 80-82 and normally its about low  70s. I woke up about 5:30am and had a really bad headache, injection area and arm hurt, my  body hurt and felt like I weighed several tons making me so slow. I didn&#39;t go to work the next day. My husband took my son to school and I took ibuprofen and went back to bed. Woke up again about 12:30 and felt better.

I didn&#39;t take any meds since I&#39;m pregnant. Symptoms peaked around 26 hours after vaccine. I slept almost all day. A very deep sleep. I started to feel a little better gradually. At 36 hours, I was completely back to normal. I am currently 31 weeks. I was 29 when I received the vaccine.  Even with everything I experienced, I would do it again.

                                                Hearing loss; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse Anesthetist (patient).  A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL0140) on 18Dec2020 at single dose in the left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization.Medical history included ongoing anaemia. There were no concomitant medications. On 06Jan2021 at 16:00 the patient experienced hearing loss, serious as medically significant. Patient had no problems with her ears before hand. On 06Jan2021 around 4 PM, she was just walking in the store, with no loud music or anything, and all of a sudden her hearing in her left ear went lost and muffled. On 07Jan2021 she went to the Otolaryngologist (ENT doctor) to get her ears checked. They said no it looked perfectly fine. They did an audiogram and hearing test on 07Jan2021 and there was a 20% hearing loss. She had no idea what it was from. She took no other medications. She had anemia but that was it. She was wondering if hearing loss has been reported with the vaccine either in the studies or recently. She researched it, and with the COVID virus itself, back in Jul2020 and Oct2020, people reported hearing loss. So she went and had a COVID test in Jan2021 and it was negative. Patient stated it was very scary and weird. Event treatment included high dose oral steroids to see if it can be treated and the ENT doctor was also giving her steroid shots in the ear. She was due to see him again in Jan2021. The outcome of the event Hearing loss was not recovered.  Patient also clarified that she did continue with her second dose of the vaccine on 08Jan2021. She had asked the ENT doctor his opinions on still getting the second dose, and he recommended it. The second dose of the vaccine was given on 08Jan2021 (lot EL3302, EXP: May2021) at single dose in the left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported hearing loss cannot be excluded.

This 39-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 18Dec2020 14:30 at single dose (lot number: EJ1685) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. The patient experienced internal brain bleeding and brain damage on 30Dec2020 07:30 after 1st dose covid vaccine. Brain surgery received on 29Dec2020. Events were still recovering. Patient was confused and suffering memory loss on 30Dec2020 07:30. Events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Prolongation of existing hospitalization (vaccine received during existing hospitalization), Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. Days for hospitalization was 16. The patient received treatment for events as brain surgery due to internal brain bleeding. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination, no COVID tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported internal brain bleeding and brain damage with confused and memory loss more likely represented intercurrent disease, and less likely causally related to 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).

                                                The day of the shot about an hour and half I started feeling achy pain in my knee to my toes and my leg went numb. I had a headache and felt confused, I couldn&#39;t remember what to do. The site was sore, I was dizzy, nausea and tired.  This lasted for about 2-3 days .I took the next day off.  The Dr. at my work said it should go away.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

                                                The next morning after my vaccine I went into work feeling a little achy and a slight headache then by 8:00am I felt like a train hit me, my body was chilling, shaking despite being in front of a heater, I had a low grade fever, my right side of my head hurt so incredibly bad like my right eye was going to explode, I then started vomiting. My boss came to help walk me outside because I didn?t even feel like it was me walking. I don?t remember walking out of work.  I was there but ?not there?. I was not myself. I didn?t feel like i was in my body. I had to have my husband come get me from work, I slept most the rest of the day and night. Now I?m on day 2 and my joints still ache, my head hurts so bad, I am so tired I either am asleep on the couch or in bed. I have no energy. It takes everything I have to move just to go to the bathroom.

She couldn&#39;t eat and couldn&#39;t sleep. She called her PCP who referred her to the ED. She received ibuprofen and Zofran in the ED. Symptoms have improved some, but she is still having hip and back pain and hot and cold chills.

                                                10 hrs after I received 1st dose of Pfizer I started feeling my heart beating rapidly and hard.  I was short of breath and had nausea and a headache.  This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Healthcare Professional (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 16:15 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included GERD, sciatica, allergies, asthma, allergies to some foods (non anaphylactic). Concomitant medication included curcuma longa (TURMERIC [CURCUMA LONGA]), metaxalone, mometasone furoate (NASONEX), famotidine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Dec2020 01:00 PM at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. About 8 hours after the shot, on 15Jan2021 01:30 AM, patient woke up very cold, checked temp it was 95.9. Remained that way though the night (96F), could not sleep much b/c of chills. In the AM, temp gradually increased back to baseline 97.9. She doesn&#39;t think it was thermometer malfunction bc sx (symptoms) correlated with the temperature and she took the value repeated times. No treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered on 15Jan2021. The patient was not pregnant. Facility type vaccine was Workplace clinic. No other vaccine in four weeks. Not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. Not tested for COVID post vaccination.

                                                Fever, delirium, total body aches, chills, nausea.  The onset of delirium came with the temp as we were on a road trip in the car headed to a hockey tournament.  It was noticed by my spouse who is a physician and several other hockey parents. I looked up delirium as a side effect but could not find anything related with the exception of elderly or with COVID itself.  So I thought I should report it to see if it had been reported by anyone else. It lasted until I went to bed and fever came down that night.

On 11Jan2021, 5 minutes after the 2nd dose (at 11:05), the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, that required Emergency room visit. Patient was not hospitalized and was treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLUMEDROL) and &#34;Pepcid&#34;: she was prescribed 3-day course of oral prednisone and H2 antihistamine oral &#34;Pepcid&#34;. After finished it, she felt it was coming back therefore she took diphenhydramine hydrochloride for 2 nights in a row. She did not experience any respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological or gastrointestinal manifestation. She completely recovered in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of anaphylactic reaction  due to temporal relationship.

I had no issues after that. I received the 2nd shot on  1/15/21, I had the exact same reaction however it only lasted 20 min. I then went to my car and started driving home, about 10 minutes later and while on the freeway I had dizziness, flushing, tachycardia, , shakiness, and facial numbness. I took an exit and was able to pull over in a parking lot. It lasted about 20 minutes. Since that time I have had frequent episodes of dizziness, facial flushing, tremulousness,  facial numbness/tingling, and presyncope. The worst episodes were on 2/1/21 and 2/3/21. I was unable to work because of these symptoms.

I remained in the ER until approx. 2220 until my symptoms were managed with medication and I felt well enough to leave.The lightheaded and dizziness lasted a few days while the headaches lasted about a week.

                                                Something stuck in my throat; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EJ1685; Expiration date was not reported) on 22Dec2020 (12:30) at a single dose on the left deltoid, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital. Medical history included allergy to lobster, and had used steroids. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 24Dec2020, the patient had something stuck in the throat; and had nausea. The patient had an emergency room visit due to the reported events; and had received a three-day course of oral prednisone and antihistamine, and then diphenhydramine (BENADRYL). The patient had no respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological or gastrointestinal manifestations. The outcome of the events, &#39;something stuck in the throat&#39; and &#39;nausea&#39;, was recovered on an unspecified date. The reporter had considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the events were related to the suspect vaccine.

I had to call off work for the following 2 days as I barely ate or slept during that time. Seventy-two hrs post vaccination, I was able to return to work with only one remaining side effect: lingering stomach cramps.  Self treated with alternating doses of OTC Extra-strength Tylenol and Excedrin Migraine while I was experiencing migraine, fever, myalgia and joint pain. Also took Ultra-strength Rolaids as needed for bloating and stomach cramps.

Monday through Sunday, February 28th I was so fatigued that I missed five days of work and could barely move.  I was dehydrated with intermittent headaches and deep joint pain.

About 2.5 hours later I got a red rash on both arms and hands ( looks and feels like sunburn but it?s not). Rash persists off and on since ( even today).  I?ve had a temperature of  about 99 off and on for several days. Only my head and face are flushed and hot, but rest of me cold. I have soreness in both breasts. My left shoulder and breast had small sores ( looks like small scrape but no injury occurred). Those areas sting internally  with some pain and redness. Feels like bruise but nothing visible.  I?ve had fatigue almost every day. I have brain fog ( can?t spell simple words, forgetting words, lack of focus).

                                                Since the beginning of February, 1 week post vaccine, I have had 3 separate instances where I awake in the middle of the night out of a dead sleep with a racing heart and feel like I&#39;m going to vomit or pass out. It usually subsides within 10 minutes.  I have also been having spells of dizziness during the day, usually 3-5 days each week. I have seen my primary care MD, that diagnosed me with vertigo. I have also been to the ER, who then diagnosed me with anxiety and explained my waking up in the middle of the night as a panic attack. I have never had these feelings with physical symptoms prior to my vaccine. I have never had the COVID-19 virus to my knowledge.

                                                When the injection was placed I experienced deep pain inside my shoulder. Within 3 hours my shoulder was frozen in pain and unable to move. I used ice and anti-inflammatory medication with no relief. I was unable to move my shoulder and could not complete daily self care tasks like brushing hair, changing clothes, cooking or driving. I could not drive to work the next day and had to use sick leave. I was in a high level of pain. I woke up crying throughout the night for three nights due to pain. I sought care at unspecified Urgent Care and was told that it was just sore and I need to keep moving the shoulder and apply heat. I was given an RX for Cephalexin, an antibiotic. Dr. indicated the injection site was warm to the touch. By Wednesday morning, there has been a slight improvement in pain and mobility. I am able to hold my arm straight down as opposed to keeping the elbow bent and tucked in. Still cannot raise my arm at all from the shoulder joint.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the vaccine (I was on the phone at the time and noted that my left inner wrist felt internally hot). My left arm from injection to fingertips felt internally as if I was injected with peppermint oil. A hot/overly cold prickly feeling started and then proceeded to feel hotter and my arm felt tingly, numb, as if an epidural was put on my left arm or it fell asleep. These feelings were internal (no rash or external redness). I also felt a bit of this same on my lower left jaw (again no outside rash or redness just inside feeling). I reported it immediately to the pharmacist who administered the shot and he said there looks to be no redness and that after my 15 minutes was up it was ok to go home. It is 5 hours now after the shot and it feels as if a nerve has been hit - my arm feels very internally cold. Fingers and arm functions fine, but it feels like its slightly detached from myself (none of this occurs anywhere other than the injection site down to fingertips and left jaw bone).

                                                Lead RN was notified about a patient being ill in the parking lot after her vaccination. 3 RN&#39;s met the patient in the parking. The Site Officer was with the patient and called EMS. The patient stated she was nauseous and dizzy. She stated she &#34;threw up&#34; and she had a smoothie for breakfast. The patient vitals were stable but her B/P was elevated. Vital Signs: B/P 146/102, Pulse 88, Temp 97, RR 16. The EMS suggested to take her to the ER, but the patient refused. After assessing the patient, she refused to go to the ER and stated she is fine now. Also, she stated she became anxious and now she&#39;s calm now. No anaphylaxis was noted and no respiratory distress. EMS had the patient sign a &#34;Against Medical Advice&#34; refusal because she did not want to go to the ER.

                                                The first abnormal effect I experienced was numbness in my inner upper lip. This was intermittent and lasted roughly 24-48 hours after vaccine administration. Then on 3/25, I had muscle cramping/soreness in my lower leg muscles (calves). The next day (3/26), the muscle soreness continued, and my lower leg muscles began to feel tight when walking. On 3/27, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my right 5th digit, which then spread to all my fingers and toes.  That morning, the muscle soreness had also spread into my thighs and bilateral upper extremities. I also noted mild swelling in my hands and feet and could not put my rings on or wear socks or shoes. By that evening, walking became more difficult as the muscle soreness had now turned into muscle weakness. This prompted me to go the ER for evaluation. A CT scan of my head and lab work was done. I was given IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return to the ER the following day for a MRI of my brain. Overnight, the weakness and swelling in my hands and feet progressed . I became unable to walk, go to the bathroom, or feed my self without assistance. The numbness and tingling I first experienced in my inner upper lip returned, and these symptoms were also now noted in the rest of my face as well. I also began having muscle soreness in my neck, my jaw felt sore when chewing food, and I began seeing some floaters. I returned to the ER the morning of 3/28.  They did more blood work, imaging, as well as a lumbar puncture, and I was admitted to hospital. Once admitted, the hospitalist consulted with another hospital and recommended transfer by EMS there where I was admitted under a neurologist&#39;s care. When I arrived at that hospital, I began to feel somewhat better as the soreness and swelling appeared to be improving, and I could walk without assistance. They did a full neurological workup and kept me overnight for observation. Overnight, I did experience a mild headache that was relieved with Tylenol and rest.  I woke up the next morning  (3/29) with nausea and did have a few episodes of vomiting that turned into dry heaving and was given Zofran with relief. The swelling in my hand went down enough that I was able to make a fist and grasp objects with my fingers again. After the neurologist reviewed my labs and work up the morning of 3/29, I was allowed to return home to await final test results as all my tests were looking normal, my symptoms were continuing to improve, and PT had cleared me to be able to return home. Upon discharge, I was instructed  to not get my 2nd COVID vaccination as it was possible that my symptoms were an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccination as no  other diagnosis was found with testing. I was instructed to follow up with my PCP in one week. Since returning home, I have continued to be very easily fatigued and have had some headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I continue to feel weak when walking and have some muscle stiffness when first waking from sleep. I also continue to have some intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling.

A 39 year old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201,Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in right deltoid on 01Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in left deltoid on 01Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing lung cancer from 03Jul2017, metastatic disease from lung cancer from: Dec 2018 and hypertension from: 2007. Concomitant medication included Losartan at 100 mg once a day tablet for blood pressure, Atorvastatin at 80 mg a day tablet for cholesterol, Lorbrena from 26Jun2019 at 100 mg once a day tablet for lung cancer, vitamin D3 at 3000 IU once a day gel cap and coq10 supplement at 100mg and all the drugs were ongoing. The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021. As a treatment therapy the patient received some CBD and went to sleep, and this lasted about 2 days and after that it got a little better. The patient was improved but had slight lasting effects. The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I immediately felt dizzy, like I was drunk. At around 4pm, I started feeling wheezy. It felt like there was a mastiff sitting on my chest. I took some benadryl, which helped. The next day, the feeling persisted and I had a mild cough, especially while lying down. More benadryl. Same on the third day. I did not seek medical attention because I didn&#39;t think it was an extraordinary reaction and I have had much worse reactions to other things in the past that have been managed with benadryl. I thought what I was experiencing was an expected side effect based on the information I had been given. The feeling started to ease by the 4th day, but then the insomnia, mood swings, exhaustion and body aches set in. The cough was sporadic, but still present. Today, I still get the heavy chest feeling intermittently, activity doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect or cause. My arm still itches at the injection site and hurts when touched.  I went back to get my second dose on 4/9. When the nurse asked me if I had had any adverse reactions to the first one, I told her about the chest heaviness and coughing and the other symptoms. She stopped what she was doing and called her medical director. They both decided that the first response was enough of an anaphylactic reaction to be a caution for the second. They refused to give me the second dose because they thought the second would elicit a much worse reaction - possibly to the point of intubation. They told me that I would have to be evaluated by a physician and that I would need a &#34;doctor&#39;s note&#34; in order to get the second vaccine.

Worsening POTS/Dysautonomia Sx with severe flushing episodes that left me unable to work as a physician for 6wks. The episodes got progressively worse. I eventually ended up on steroids which did improve my symptoms. I was diagnosed officially with POTS and small fiber neuropathy. I attempted to go back to work but became too fatigued and weak to be able to walk, my husband had to come get me and I was taken to his care in a wheelchair. I could not get out of bed for 5 days. I saw rheumatology and am back on steroids. I am now showing lab evidence of lupus. I have polyarthritis and polymyalgia on exam as well as muscle weakness in the quads. I continue to have neuropathy.

A 39-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 20Apr2021 at 19:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and pregabalin (LYRICA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at 100 mg, 3x/day for neuropathy. Medical history included neuropathy from 2020 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient got the vaccine and she was taking pregabalin as well and after vaccination, she experienced an adverse event, her legs were heavy and numb and also her bladder was now the problem she was actually now at the emergency room. Patient was a little nervous. The patient was still in the hospital and she was not getting any care. What happened at the beginning was that she totally became paralyzed from the waist down, when your foot fall asleep you get painful tingling feeling she have that kind of feeling in her legs not able to move any part of her anywhere from her waist down later on that night, after she took pregabalin, went to sleep about an hour she was able to move her left toes and able to drag one leg a little bit. She was supposed to take pregabalin 3 times a day and they were giving her a difficult time about it, she took one at 12 O&#39; clock on Wednesday and the hospital they did not give another one until 11 o clock that evening because she was supposed to take 3 times a day. After she no longer feel from the waist down, she took a pregabalin and it didn&#39;t help her it didn&#39;t work and her physician told her to take 3 times a day and then at 10 O&#39; clock yesterday morning she was still asking the hospital to give her another one. When asked to repeat the concern, patient stated &#34;weakness in her legs that felt very heavy like she was dragging. The date of hospitalization was reported as 21Apr2021. The reason for hospitalization was reported as numbness in her legs and weakness in legs, became paralyzed from the waist down, and her kidneys.

The patient underwent lab test in the hospital. The action taken with pregabalin in response to the events was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.
