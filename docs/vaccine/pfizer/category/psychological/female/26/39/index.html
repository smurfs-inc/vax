Over night contracted a fever, by the time I was able to get up to measure it (around 3:45 AM) it was 99.5 degrees, and broke by 5 AM. Had fever dreams prior to waking around 3 AM, and had chills for the remainder of the night. Felt  achy and a little unsteady for the rest of the day but was fully recovered by 12/31

                                                Had me wait for 15 minutes after vaccine and started having a redness in neck and was really itchy; whole body big time itchy. My chest - shortness of breath. Gave me a shot of benydryl  - 25 mg in my right arm and I went home and itching still didn&#39;t go away and I took pill of benydryl. Chills next day; super cold; headache; tired - and I couldn&#39;t think straight. Nothing was registering in my head with training at work - felt slow. Went home from took more benydryl. Next morning - pins and needles in back of my head. Went to urgent care (Riverside Urgent Care) and they gave me gave me Vexamethasone - shot it up in my butt and every symptom went away after that shot and I was okay after that.Itching went away after that. Felt weak for about a week afterwards. Went and had second shot yesterday 1/10/2021. They gave me medication with vaccine so I wouldn&#39;t get reaction this time. Gave me liquid 25 benydryl beforehand and had me wait 15 mintues and after 15 min they gave me the second dose of vaccine after the injection and they had me wait for 30 minutes. Right away I started getting itchy and they gave me pill form( 2 pills) of Vexamethsone and itching slowly stopped and they sent me home after an hour. Itching slowly went away - later that day. And today I&#39;m okay.

                                                12 hours after administration, woken up from sleep by tingling, throbbing in lower legs. Described as a nerve and muscle ache/throb, or &#34;growing pains&#34;/RLS symptoms. Put on compression socks which helped, but still too uncomfortable to sleep. Was able to sleep after taking ibuprofen 800mg and drinking water. 6 hours after the ibuprofen was administered, pain returned in lower legs as well as neck/ears  with body temperature swings (cold, teeth chattering to sweating uncontrollably in a few minutes). After 1 hour of trying to sleep but failing, put compression socks back on. Temperature rose to 100-100.2 F, chills causing whole body to shake under multiple blankets. Tingling/muscle pains extremely uncomfortable and unable to rest, took another ibuprofen 800mg and water and was able to sleep. Tingling and muscle pains have continued as soon as ibuprofen wears off and come back more intense each time, most notably in the lower legs and near ears/neck and elbow of arm administered in (similar to &#34;tennis elbow,&#34; assumed to be provoked by inflammation, happened with first dose).

                                                At 1 AM on 1/19/21, I awoke with chills, a fever of 101, neck pain, muscle pain, joint pain, and a severe headache. This persisted throughout the night and I did not sleep. Took 1000 mg of Acetaminophen at 5:30 and slept until 7 AM. By 8 AM, my temperature was back down to 98 F. Took 500 mg of Acetaminophen at 10 AM with food. Headache, muscle pain, and joint pain persisted. Moderate to severe chest pain began 15 mins after eating at 4 PM. Waited 30 mins to see if it resolved; it did not. Went to the urgent care. Chest x-ray and EKG was performed, no issues found. Was diagnosed with costochondritis and was given a steroid shot and ibuprofen,  which reduced the pain significantly within 30 mins later.

Headache and body aches have worsened in severity. Unable to work for the morning but was able to go in the afternoon for a short time period. Lower body aches are particularly severe. Fatigue is noticeable. Mental health conditions have worsened but that may be due to lack of sleep.  30 hours following the vaccine: chills, nausea, and dizziness have dissipated completely. They were slowly improving throughout the day. Body aches and headache still severe but lessened with marijuana use.  48 hours following the vaccine: all symptom seemed to have subsided during the night. Sleep was much better quality. Only remaining symptom is an ache on the right side of my chest towards my ribs.

For about 36 hours, it ran 100-130&#39;s; Dehydration; Feeling fatigued/Excessive fatigue; Had some general arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ 1686, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 08Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ 1685, unknown expiration) via intramuscular in right arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as needed and unspecified birth control. The patient has no known allergies. The patient started feeling fatigued about 1900 hours (07:00 PM) on 08Jan2021 and only had some general arm soreness. She woke up on 09Jan2021, with serious chills to the point of physical shaking; nausea started soon after and around 0300, began vomiting and dry heaving. The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the event &#34;having sweats&#34; was unknown, while the patient is recovering for the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported serious chill was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

                                                Within 24 hours of getting my 2nd COVID vaccine, I began to feel weak and achy. My neck and face got really hot while the rest of my body stayed cold. A small headache began to turn into a migraine. During the night, my body began to hurt beyond achy causing me to toss and turn. When I woke up in the morning, I couldn&#39;t stand even the littlest of pressure placed on my body. For example, my cat jumped on my leg and it felt like someone wacked me with a baseball bat because of how sensitive my body was. The only treatment used for myself during this time was Tylenol. It helped with the head aches. Overall, it took me about three nights to actually feel ok again.

I did not improve when I woke up on 01/25.  The chills and myalgia worsened and were complicated by vomiting without blood.  I called off sick from work and took 3 Aleve tablets.  I went back to sleep with improvement in symptoms approximately 6 hours later, with only mild myalgias and a very sore L. arm.  Symptoms completely resolved by the morning of 01/26.

                                                About 2 minutes after injection, I had a sudden rush of warmth throughout my body starting in my abdomen then causing my pulse to feel like it was pounding out of my neck. Got light headed. EMS came and my blood pressure raised to 155/95 and my pulse was up in the 150s and I was shaking.  Started to go down but felt crappy for over 2 hours. Happened again 30seconds after the second injection. Pulse up to almost 160. 02 stats stayed normal. Post first injection had sore arm and lots of fatigue and brain fog. Following the second injection 12 hours post started having nausea, and diarrhea. Continued to have joint pain, muscle aches, headaches for days, and my lymph nodes swelled up and were extremely painful.

                                                I am a pharmacist for pharmacy and received my first dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine while at work by another pharmacist.  Vaccine given around 2:15 PM on 2/2/21  Less than 5 minutes after vaccine - arm tingling at site of injection, arm tingling spread from injection site to fingers, tingling and pins/needles traveled through underarm area and moved across left side of chest, slight chest pain on left side, whole body started tingling, dizziness, racing heart. While experiencing all of these symptoms, I sat on the ground, took two tablets of 25mg Benadryl, drank water, and tried to breath steady to make dizziness go away. Working in this healthcare setting, I was aware I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and was prepared with an epi-pen in case of any severe anaphylaxis shock - I did NOT have to use the epi-pen.    Less than 15 minutes after vaccine - the chest pain, arm pins/needles stopped, I felt lightheaded still, another co-worker checked my blood pressure which had risen to 178/120 and pulse of 120.   About 1 hour after vaccine - still felt light headed, blood pressure still elevated at 158/107, pulse of 107.   Around 5:45 PM - After consulting personal friend physicians, I was instructed to go to ER and have an EKG of my heart since my blood pressure and pulse had spiked so high and suddenly. I was able to find coverage at work so that I could leave my shift and get a ride to the emergency room.   After 6 PM (admitted into ER) - upon admission blood pressure of 176/117 and pulse of 113

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular in left deltoid on 20Jan2021 11:00 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunisation. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first dose yesterday at 11:00am. She was talking to someone and all of a sudden she got throat to neck pain that was intense that lasted two minutes on 21Jan2021. It has been about 10-15minutes since and if she hold her neck straight she is fine, but if she looks up it hurts. She can breathe fine. It hurts to swallow all of a sudden on 21Jan2021. Asking if it is normal to experience this. She had a low grade fever/low grade temp of 99.4, body aches, and a headache that started today 21Jan2021. She received Tylenol as treatment. States she is a nurse and she is tired. Her head feels fuzzy, she has not taken her temperature recently and it still hurts to swallow. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Relatedness of drug to events from reporter for throat and neck pain, hurts to swallow, low grade fever, headache, body aches was reported as related. Reporter seriousness for throat and neck pain and hurts to swallow was medically significant. Event outcome of throat and neck pain was recovered, of hurts to swallow was not recovered, of others was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were likely causally related to the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  However, it is worth noting that the reporter/user of the vaccine was nurse, and her tiredness from job could have confounded with the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 14:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the workplace clinic. Relevant medical history included COVID-19, which was diagnosed prior to vaccination and migraines (before). The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included melatonin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 30Dec2020 at 15:45 or 1 hour after the vaccine injection, the patient had an aura like a bad migraine and she had bright spotty vision in the peripheral right field for 15-20 minutes; the patient has had migraines before, but they&#39;re not common for her. Two hours after the vaccine, on 30Dec2020 at 16:45, the patient had mental confusion and an inability to speak; she tried to say things to her husband and it was a jumbled, meaningless string of words. She also felt very cold and she had tingling around the mouth. Her husband thought she was having a stroke and called 911 on 30Dec2020. All her vitals were stable, and within 10 minutes she could speak again. On 30Dec2020, the patient&#39;s electrocardiogram (EKG) showed peaked T waves, common with dehydration and high potassium. She was encouraged to go to the emergency room (ER). Instead of taking the ambulance, she drove herself several hours later. The patient wanted someone to tell her it wasn&#39;t a stroke. After a brief neurological exam on 30Dec2020, the doctor said it was likely a severe migraine and wrote the reason for her visit as a vaccine reaction. This took place in the late evening to early morning, and she missed one day of work. The events did result in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient did not receive any treatment for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from all the events on 31Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event stroke with BNt162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Persistent migraine. My headache began about 3 hours after and stayed mild until about 30 hours later where it grew to a migraine. It is not day 8 since the vaccine and it has not gone away.  In addition to the migraine I am experiencing light sensitivity, blurred vision, and yesterday I experienced some heart palpitations. I went to urgent care on 2/8 and was prescribed IC Butalb-Acetamin-Caff for the migraine symptom. In addition I have been taking tylenol and advil which are not helping. My injection site pain and brain fog have resolved while the headache has persisted.

The following days after I was okay, with a sore throat only occurring in the evening after 4pm, along with vertigo and slight disorientation for approximately 8 days. Starting Saturday, 02/13 around 8pm I noticed a tingling sensation in my right middle finger, that continued to Sunday and through to today. As of this morning, 02/15, I still have the nerve pain in my finger that is now spreading to the palm of my hand.

It was given at a vaccination clinic. The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks and had no adverse events following prior vaccinations and that was why she thought she would be fine.

Family history included her dad has heart disease and her half sister has heart disease. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization. The patient stated, &#34;You kind of feel yucky after the flu vaccine, but she has never had this with a flu shot.&#34; The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t had a flu shot in years. The patient asked if arm swelling was a normal occurrence after vaccination and if side effects can last for 4 days. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan and afterwards experienced, arm swelling, and tenderness that has last for 4 days. She also reported experiencing feeling faint, high blood pressure of 150/100 and some trouble breathing on an unspecified date and nausea. The patient further reported that she was calling because she got her first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine and she was curious if this was normal and if she needs to go see her doctor and she wants to report the symptoms. After she got the injection she felt super faint and got really high blood pressure on an unspecified date. She was not sure if it was because she had anxiety, but she had trouble breathing on an unspecified date. She got nauseated afterwards. Her arm swelled up really big and the swelling has stayed there for four days. Her arm was still swollen on an unspecified date. She has allergies and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. She was still nauseated and feels super tired. The patient asked how long do the symptoms last. The patient&#39;s weight was reported between 122 to 123 pounds. The patient clarified that the nausea started 15 minutes after she got the shot on 28Jan2021. The nausea has lasted through this. She got chills the next day (29Jan2021) after the shot. She has felt super fatigue. The swelling has gone down, but it was still swollen. It was still hurting. She has no idea if that was normal. She also felt dizzy and disoriented after getting the shot. She was not sure if it was because her blood pressure was so high. It was high for her because her blood pressure was normally low. She thinks her blood pressure 150/100 after she got the vaccine. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

                                                Unexplained dizziness, feeling very disoriented, almost vertigo like symptoms but it has affected my entire body not just my head. I?ll be functioning normally and then a wave of dizziness runs through me. This has persisted for nearly 4 weeks with only minor improvement. It feels like I?m ?off?, not debilitating enough to cancel work/plans, but persistent enough to know something isn?t normal. Had no symptoms prior to receiving the shot.

                                                The day of vaccination I started feeling the  left side of my body heavy (starting from my face to my leg). My column also hurted a lot and I had a severe headache. It?s been almost 3 weeks since vaccination and I?ve been to several doctors and the emergency room and right now they have me taking B12, Neurontin and Cortisone. During my second week after the vaccine both my legs started feeling heavy to the point where there are days where I can?t feel them or they feel extremely heavy to move, my column still hurts till this date. Tomorrow I have another doctors appointment in order to continue investigating what I have. I?m still waiting for an official diagnosis which is why I can?t give an official answer for item 21 (I still don?t know if the damages will be permanent). Due to this situation I haven?t been able to go to work.

About 5 minutes after leaving 11:30 I could taste the vaccine in my mouth. I immediately felt intense sharp tingling in my lower lip, it felt hot and swollen (upper lip never had a reaction). I instantly felt a lump in my throat and had a hard time swallowing. I started with chest pain that resolved itself in a minute or two. A few minutes later a family member noticed my face was red and flushed and said I looked like I had a sun burn. Swelling in throat resolved within an hour. Lip never visually looked swollen but I could feel the tightness, burning and tingling that resolved within the hour. Redness on face resolved within a couple hours. Had tiny blisters about 3 show up above upper lip I still have them the next day with a couple more but they aren&#39;t causing problems. My airway was never blocked I never had a hard time breathing. I did have a sore throat this morning March 25 day after vaccine. All other symptoms seem normal.

Heat is still present but has died down; pain and fatigue are about the same as when I woke up in the morning.

RN and EMT personnel noticed that individual appeared to lean in chair and then leaned forward as if experiencing dizziness.  RN approached individual at which time she appeared to be on verge of fainting, and sounded incoherent, her pulse was at 45, and she was dizzy, at which time an Epinephrine pen was utilized. As patient became more coherent she indicated she felt nauseous and proceeded to vomit. She was monitored by EMT and RN for about 30 minutes and was offered further medical assistance which she declined. Patient indicated that she had history of experiencing dizziness after a previous TB immunization.

                                                After receiving the second dose of the vaccine on Wednesday I started experiencing a myriad of symptoms starting that night during sleep. I had body aches, nausea and diarrhea starting earlier the next day then once I threw up once I started feeling better then broke a couple of fevers. By Friday, however, I was feeling much better. I went through the weekend feeling totally fine, then Monday came and I was really achy throughout my body in my joints. Then that night when I went to sleep the joint pain worsened drastically and I started feeling a pins and needles sensation throughout my extremities only.   I got no sleep that night from the pain. These body aches felt wildly different from those from the first immediate reaction.  From there, I got a COVID test, Flu, and strep test taken all of which came back negative. The pain continued to worsen unbearably so I went to the ER. There, they tried a few pain medicines to ease the pain. It was the most uncomfortable time I&#39;ve ever spent in my body. The doctor said the vaccine essentially attacked my nervous system and I had no idea what was happening to me because it isn&#39;t being mentioned as a possible side effect. However, both doctors I visited said they have been seeing neurological adverse effects in the hospital following the vaccine rollout. The pain lasted for a full week, and as of this past Saturday I&#39;ve been feeling much better. I am still dealing with the lasting effects, the pins and needles are very faint but still active every now and then and my calf muscles are extremely tight in the morning making it still hard to walk, and my knees ache often. I&#39;ve been stretching to combat the issues in my legs and it&#39;s been helping. I&#39;m hopeful the pins and needles sensation will completely go away very soon. It has been 9 days since the second adverse reaction started.

                                                Woke up at 1:30am the following morning shaking, freezing, and all of my joints throbbing. I layed there for an hour not knowing what was going on, crying in pain because I literally never get fevers. It finally occurred to me at 2:30am that I was sick and asked my husband to get me a thermometer. He did and it was 100.6 degrees. I called out of work. My fever got higher and higher and I felt worse and worse. My fever got over 104 degrees when my fever reducers were wearing off. I had a fever for 2 days and my knees felt like they were broken, my husband had to physically carry me to the toilet because of my knee pain and weakness from the fever. I had no fever on Thursday, but I had the worst neck pain and migraine of my life for the next 3 days going from a sitting to standing position made me feel like my head was going to split into 2 and I verbally screamed a couple times from the head pain because it was such a searing pain that I have never experienced. My neck was so swollen and sore that I felt like I couldn&#39;t hold my head up.  I never feel like I fully recovered from getting sick. I have not experienced fatigue like this since I got mono when I was 19, I take 3-4 hour naps after work everyday because I barely have enough energy to stay up for my shifts let alone get through a whole day.  I am running shorter distances and slower miles and I can not run without napping first and my knees hurt when I walk/run/ and when on my feet at work. I have never experienced knee pain before I got sick from the vaccine and now it won&#39;t go away.

Second dose has resulted in severe swelling at injection site. Pain was comparable to the first dose until about 12 hours later. Before bed I took one standard strength ibuprofen and drank plenty of fluids, with more at my nightstand. Woke up several times throughout the night due to arm pain. The following morning woke up with severe arm pain and swelling, nausea, fatigue, extreme thirst, and chills. No fever. Shoulder region at injection site was red and warm to the touch, with the swollen region about 3.5 inches in diameter. Arm pain continues but is not hindering movement or normal activities. Swollen region has not decreased in size and remains red, warm to touch.

I also had chills and soreness &amp; swelling at the injection site. I went to bed at 10:30pm. At 1:45 AM (13 hours after vaccination) I woke up with low grade fever, chills, muscle/body aches, fatigue, headache, earache, and sore throat. I could not go back to sleep all night and by 3:00 AM (14 hours after vaccination) I also had nausea and light, dry cough. I had sharp headache and earache pangs. These symptoms persisted. At 11:00 AM the following day (22 hours after vaccination) I took Nyquil containing acetominophen. At around 4:00 AM the next night (39 hours after vaccination) my fever was gone and the other symptoms started to slowly get better the following day.

Patient thought it wasn&#39;t as bad afterwards and indicated they felt fine. Patient had a seat in front of the pharmacy, started to feel dizzy but didn&#39;t tell anyone. Put her head between her knees, that didn&#39;t help and she figured she&#39;d splash some water on her face, went to the bathroom and felt like she maybe needed to throw up, knelt over the toilet and next thing she knew she woke up on the floor.

                                                Shot received at 7pm on the 23rd (Fri). I felt a little giddy, likely due to the emotional impact of excitement for treatment (this happened to me with my first shot, and both times with my partner). Experienced what I felt was like feeling mentally a little &#39;out of it&#39; a few hours in, maybe late that night 10-12pm. I did not have notable physical symptoms until exactly 12 hours after injection. Around 7-8AM I was woken up with body aches. I spent most of that day (Sat) taking ibuprofen and hydrating a lot. I had a small fever that peaked at 100.00 F after chills, etc, once this broke I mostly felt better. Sunday I had some minor aches. It is now Tuesday and here is the reason I am writing this report: I have had very low appetite since getting the shot, but I have pre-existing GI issues. This also happened on the first shot. Both times I have also had slight lymph swelling (mostly on first shot, and it was on the side of my body where injection was given, notably in the armpit, but possibly groin or shoulder). The only thing that has honestly caused me concern is my mental health: I have pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses and some extenuating circumstances (recent death in the family, needing to travel, job loss, pandemic, on top of major depression and PTSD) however I felt that my threshold for coping with day to day stuff has been blunted since getting the vaccine. It is manageable and I do think that it will go away as it did with the first shot. I felt like the last few days have been akin to &#34;PMSing&#34;, ie; irritable, crying a lot. Contextually, there are reasons for me to be having emotional fluctuations, but I have therapy and have been off/on medications safely and usually have this fairly under control. The reason it was bothering me is I felt that if this happened to other people who had less support or managed diagnoses or other circumstances, it could be worse for them. My partner (who is BP2) has also felt a little more emotionally unstable than usual. We do not think this is from the psychological toll solely of vaccination, the pandemic, or reopening, as it seems to be unrelated to this. Sure, this is anecdotal, but I think it may be important, especially in the event of someone who could have psychotic or mood swing issues (ie: BP1 or schizophrenia, etc). Again, anecdotal, but on some online forums a lot of people have reported having similar mood instability when theirs was otherwise manageable (and these were people who were pro-vax, pro-science, etc). I am worried that if there is not a warning in the future, more people could pre-emptively have mental health adverse effects and not know why. I think it is very seriously from the vaccine. For me this mostly included appetite issues, insomnia (especially the night after I got the shot), crying more, irritability, feeling kind of &#34;flat&#34;, etc. Perhaps this is just due to the body fighting and doing it&#39;s job. I felt however it would be irresponsible of me not to report it.  I have spoken with my mental health provider about this and do not find that I need further treatment but that I wanted them to know, and that I wanted to file a VAERS report additionally to help the study of the vaccine in case this happens to others.

                                                Ever since I got the COVID vaccine I have been having blurry wavy vision that makes my head hurt. My first dose was 4/5 and second was recently on 4/26. It has happened 4 times since the beginning of the month.  It starts off with waves and blurs and then gives me a massive migraine. I cant see straight when this happens and get bad brain fog. I have to chug water and take 800&#43; mg tablets of migraine relief to make it better, but it takes a good 2 hours to feel any better at all.  I have NEVER had this issue before or have a history of migraines.

                                                I ended up starting my period April 20, 2020 (same day I got the vaccine) and it was the heaviest cycle I&#39;ve had in years. I went through several tampons in a day for about a week til my period abruptly stopped on April 26, 2020.  It started about 2 hours after the vaccination. I usually don&#39;t cramp but I was having problems sleeping because of how bad it got. I was also more bloated than my usual cycles. I dealt with extreme fatigue, I slept a lot that week and I did the bare minimum that week at work (which is unusual for me).  I also don&#39;t usually have mood swings but I felt like my hormones were a bit intense to the point I kept snapping at people even though I like to think of myself as level-headed.

Continued pain in left arm for another 2 days and continued feeling of weakness and fatigue until today.  Have suffered shortness of breath and randomly increased heartbeat and feeling hot last week.

                                                Four hours after my second dose, I started to grow light-headed. I got up from my desk and stumbled over as I couldn&#39;t see quite straight. The rest of the evening I rested and stayed hydrated with fluids. From Thursday morning until Saturday morning I was unable to focus, concentrate, see straight, and got &#34;foggy&#34; every time I tried to stand and walk. I had a hard time keeping my eyes open and was very weak. It felt like I was under the influence of something as I felt extremely disoriented. It has been 9 days since my second dose and I am still not &#34;100%&#34; back to my normal self. These side effects were very scary to deal with.

A 26-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 05Feb2021 11:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Medical history included high functioning autism; reporter mentioned that this was diagnosed when her daughter was 16, but she suspected it since she was a child, polio; reporter mentioned that her daughter had polio as a baby, she was adopted from out of the country and got polio, high cholesterol; reporter mentioned that this was diagnosed when she was a baby, she came to this country when she was 16 months old and had it then and ADD; reporter mentioned that this was diagnosed when she was 16, but started before that somewhere in her teenager years. Patient concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, patient has been extremely dizzy, lethargic, and has a headache to the back of her neck to her head, not able to think straight and not be able to move around. Reporter said that patient said that the dizziness is getting worse, and patient did try to work one day last week, then tried again, and couldn&#39;t, reporter would say it is getting worse. Reporter mentioned that she gave her daughter a 24 hours allergy pill, nasal spray, and some over the counter Bonine, but all it did was put her to sleep. 24 hours allergy pill was clarified to being generic Value Med Allergy Relief, the ingredient Cetirizine 10mg. UPC: 68925-3, LOT S200197, EXP Oct2021. Reporter also mentioned that Bonine was also over the counter, with LOT 173146C, EXP August 2019.

Reporter mentioned that she doesn&#39;t know what to do for her, and she was supposed to see her doctor today, but due to the snowstorm her appointment was cancelled until tomorrow, the ENT. Reporter mentioned that the doctor said that there was nothing they could do for dizziness. Reporter also mentioned that her daughter got both doses of the vaccine, and it was the second one that really made her sick. Reporter thought that it is serious because her daughter was not getting better and she was in tears because patient does not feel good, and she did not know what was wrong with patient. Reporter wanted to know whether this is something that has been reported or that they had heard of happening before. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded. However, the concomitant medication of allergy pill may provide a plausible alternative explanation for the events.

                                                Significant left ear pain that woke me up from sleep 3x last night when I would lay on that side; left ear pain; Right ear pain; Outer ear pain on rest and highly tender on palpation, most severe around the tragus area; left unilateral left axillary lymphadenopathy; Moderate systemic symptoms; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient).

                                                It started with back of knee pain that made it difficult for me to walk. I went to an urgent care on 4/12 and I was given a steroid for my leg inflammation. When the pain didn&#39;t subside two days later, I went to the ER and was admitted. It did not feel like I had muscle weakness. It felt like there were long rubber bands in my legs that felt tight and were about to snap. I also began to develop sensitivity to light touch (loose sweatpants moving against my legs while walking would cause pain up and down my legs). It has gotten easier to walk as time has gone on, and now instead of two large rubber bands feeling tight in my legs, it feels like there are many tiny, tight strings running up and down my legs.Sometimes if I walk too much or overextend my legs, these strings feel like they&#39;re on fire. Recently, my arms and different parts of my body have felt light burning intermittently throughout the day. My hands also felt like they were very hot yesterday (5/8) evening. When I looked at my hands, they looked a bit red/swollen with a tinge of blue/purple coloring. Fingers felt tender when typing, though I saw no sign of bruising. A few days ago, when I would hold up my phone to text, within a few seconds, my arms and hands felt like they were falling asleep. My right arm appeared to be worse that my left (it would fall asleep faster). The feeling in my arms would return when I would put my hands to my sides. This has never happened to me before. I have tried using my hands less and tried being more gentle with them. As a result, my arms and hands feel better after periods of rest/light use, but if I start using my arms/hands more regularly, the falling asleep sensation returns. I have also noticed more skin sensitivity as of late. I stopped wearing pants to prevent from feeling the leg pain I had mentioned earlier in this message. However, I was walking around the house yesterday (5/8) only wearing underwear, and I started to feel some light pain around the band of my underwear. I removed it and the pain went away. In addition, I normally wear loose t-shirts, but recently I had been experiencing a burning in my back/spine area. Once I removed my shirt, the burning sensation stopped. Wrists have also been feeling a bit stiff/achy as of late. Today (5/9) I was typing for about 30 to 45 minutes while working on this document. My fingertips felt tender, but I thought that I could use my hands for a bit without issue. I positioned myself so that my hands were below my body for constant blood supply. However, my right hand ring finger started to hurt and made it hard for me to type, so I have been resting on and off while working on this. It was a sharp string pain running along my finger. I checked both hands and they were red/swollen. Similar to this, on 5/2, I felt left middle finger pain that came and went over the span of a few days. I have not felt this left middle finger pain as of late. When I was in the ER (around 4/17), I felt left foot toe pain in the toe that&#39;s next to the pinky. The toe pain and finger pain were similar to each other in the sense that it was a sharp string pain. The working theory from the ER is that the vaccine might be causing flare ups for different ailments that I have had or am currently experiencing. I had injured the back of my left knee while in college, I had twisted the toe that started to feel pain while in the ER a few years back, I&#39;ve had hemorrhoids before, but they&#39;ve usually been painless and not noticeable. However, around the same time that it became harder for me to walk, my hemorrhoid pain became excruciating and now I have multiple hemorrhoids. I was tentatively diagnosed with potential reactive rheumatoid arthritis as a result of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. The latest development in this string of occurrences is that as of this morning (5/16/2021), I&#39;ve had some brain fog that has lasted me the entire day. In addition, I have a dull, achy pain stemming from my right shoulder-blade to my right elbow that I&#39;ve been experiencing for a few hours now. My hearing has also been feeling more sensitive for this past week now. I noticed this starting from about 5/8. One of my friends was talking to me, and whenever she spoke, her voice sounded a bit fuzzy from my right ear and I could feel the vibrations in my right ear when she talked. The next day, my phone pinged, and similar to my experience with my friend, it sounded fuzzy in my right ear, plus I could feel my eardrum vibrating. Usually, I&#39;m quite hard of hearing and putting things on the highest volume isn&#39;t enough for me, but now, putting things at regular volume can seem a little too loud for me at times.

                                                Only had arm pain and then was tired up to 27 hrs after shot. After that though, I got extreme pain in my head like an severe migraine and I felt like my head was going to explode, dizziness, shaking of my hands and legs (not like cold sweat shaking or something), nausea, and concussion symptoms like the light was too bright and noises were too loud and I was in pain trying to think to say one word and I could not formulate a sentence.  The symptoms were not like sick/flu ones like a fever or running nose, I was not sick but in pain like my organs felt like they were shutting shut. Very odd, could not function so I had to go to sleep. Woke up better but not sure if it will occur again. Unknown what was affected from those symptoms. I was at dinner ordering food when this all occurred. I had to then ask right after ordering it to have it to go because I could not stay there with all the noises and light. I felt I was in extreme pain.

                                                Immediate numbness following injection. Later that evening ~7:00 p.m. joints and muscles in left arm/shoulder curled and seized-up. Tingling pins and needles with loss of sensation and dexterity. At bed time May 20th - continued pain, stiffness and swelling accompanied by high fever, chills, excessive sweating, and muscle convulsions. Intense ringing in ears. Next morning (May 21st) I had to miss work. Continued fever, chills, loss of appetite, mild nausea, nerve spasms and locked joints throughout entire body. I felt as though my body was poisoned. The weekend consisted of major fatigue and falling asleep during the day intermittently. Numb arms, weakened grip - could barely make a fist, and had a loss of coordination. Brain fog, delayed thoughts and physical responses. CONTINUED MUSCLE WEAKNESS AND NERVE SPASMS. I contacted doctor for help since my PCP&#39;s office was not open until Monday. I began taking Magnesium and B vitamins. I was drinking 1.5 gallons of water daily and still feeling thirsty. Called Doctor on the 24th to report involuntary muscle spasms in neck shoulders and lower back, joint stiffness, numbness, slowed circulation (pins and needles), and a vertigo-like falling sensation at bedtime. Cannot get to sleep comfortably without the spasms and my head rolling. He recommended Benadryl and Tylenol which I began taking which helped the numbness but not the shakiness and nerve spasms. He also offered a muscle relaxer, but I was concerned about waking up and driving to work in the early mornings so I declined since having trouble waking up with all the fatigue. It didn&#39;t matter anyway because since then I have missed work due to the sudden weakness, head fog, indigestion, and nerve tremors. Wednesday, I needed assistance going up and down stairs because my limbs felt limp like rubber bands. My joints are unusually cracking while my breathing is more labored. My resting heart rate was elevated and I could feel it beating harder than normal. Thursday, I drove myself to the E.R. because I feel as if I have aged 30 years in under a week. Their blood tests, EKG, and x-rays found nothing abnormal and I received fluids through an IV. However my nervous system feels absolutely shot. THIS IS NOT NORMAL. I WAS INCREDIBLY HEALTHY BEFORE THE SHOT. I WAS NOT INFORMED OF THESE RISKS. I LIVE A CLEAN, ACTIVE LIFESTYLE WITH REGULAR DIET AND EXERCISE. I HAVE NEVER NOT BEEN ABLE TO ARTICULATE MY BODY MOVEMENTS FLUIDLY AND PRECISELY. my doctor suspected I previously had an asymptomatic case of Covid, and that I had an allergic reaction directly related to the vaccine that attacked my nervous system. I FEEL SO MISERABLE AND WRONG. I worry about my quality of life from here on out even though I&#39;m told these symptoms will pass. Today, over a week post my first shot, I have loss of sensation in my arms, tingling in my extremities and base of skull, neck, and lower back (worse at night and when resting). My nerves are still randomly firing and I feel shaky. My body feels as if it has slowed down its automatic  functions.

I want to document my experience as I had some pretty severe reactions to my second dose.   Evening of the 26th I got chills and a fever of 102.9F. I took one ibuprofen and the fever went away.   The next morning I had a slight headache. Around noon I got intense chest pains/pressure that lasted 30 minutes. I could not take a full breath as it was very painful.    On the 28th, I woke up with a terrible headache for no apparent reason. Some ibuprofen helped. After a few hours it was gone.   At 2am on the 29th, I woke up with very intense stomach cramps. I went to the bathroom and was able to pass out some stool over the course of about 30 minutes in the bathroom, and the cramps went away.   On May 31st, I got what seemed to be a blood clot in my left index finger. It went away after about 20 minutes but still felt sore the rest of the day.

                                                After I received my first Pfizer vaccine I had a sore arm. What followed has been a nightmare. I started experiencing severe shoulder pain in my left arm and numbness/constant tingling in my arm. The tingling started in my shoulder and went all the way down to the tips of my fingers. I began to not be able to sleep at night because of my shoulder pain and the numbness in my entire arm I was experiencing. After going to the doctor I was prescribed a muscle relaxer to help manage my pain. It&#39;s been 3 weeks since I got the vaccine and I&#39;m still having strange sensations through my body, the pain in my left arm/shoulder has gone away but it moved to the right side of my neck. When I try to turn my head I get this weird &#34;electric&#34;/tingling feeling that shoots up the back of my head and shoots down my arm at the same time. I can not function the pain is so horrible. I was a healthy 26 year old woman before this vaccine. I&#39;m afraid I will never return to normal.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

It wasa very scary experience for me. This lasted about 15 or 20 minutes I&#39;m guessing (hard to say for sure because I was too worked up to watch the clock) but I ended up making myself fall back asleep. The next day January 8th I had diarrhea multiple times in theafternoon and felt strange, somewhat lightheaded and some what felt like anxiety.

A 27-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number ek9231/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 14:15 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included migraines. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was fine the day she got the vaccine, but when it came to the night of 03Jan2021, she wasn&#39;t able to sleep due to the pain throughout her arm. On 04Jan2021 04:00, she woke up with a headache that was intense, fever, and body chills. The injection site was extremely sore to the point where she took some Tylenol and slept it off. On 05Jan2021, she felt a lot better, but still with mild body aches. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. She was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The vaccine was received in a hospital. No other vaccines were given in four weeks. The outcome of the events was not recovered for body aches, and recovering for the other events.

I got my vaccine at around 3, and didn&#39;t have any immediate reaction. I have an exercise bike at home, and tried to work out but had to stop after only half an hour of very low effort biking because I couldn&#39;t get a deep breathe. usually I can bike for an hour at high intensity no problem and have never had to stop because I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe.  I woke up in the middle of the night feeling achy and unwell. When I woke up in the morning I was extremely fatigued and my eyes were itchy and puffy.

Twelve hours later, after waking up those same symptoms were only on the right side of my body. Friday morning, mostly normal physically just with some overall fatigue. Friday afternoon I started to get hives on my chest and overnight into Saturday they were on my lower back, sides, and legs. I took 50 mg of Benadryl every 6-12 hours until Monday mid-day when Benadryl was not helping reduce the hives and so I had full body hives. I did try an drugstore cortisone cream which did not help.  Sought treatment at an urgent care as I was feeling anxious and could not control the itching. I and was diagnosed with likely allergic reaction to the covid-19 vaccine.

Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine taken from an unspecified date for an unspecified indication. On the second day of the vaccine (21Dec2020 10:00), the patient had a low grade fever of 99.4 (no unit reported), had sore joint pain on her knuckles and her wrist, felt kind of off and weak, her arm was a bit sore for 3 days and she also had a mild headache that would come and go. No treatment was received for the reported events. The outcome of the events was recovered.

                                                I was asymptomatic for about 6.5 hours after the vaccine was given. At about 6pm on the day I received the vaccine I noticed some injection site tenderness, minimal swelling; has been present since. Symptoms are very mild. I started having chills and hot flashes intermittently, more hot flashes than chills, have been present since 6pm yesterday. About 9pm I had a headache, muscle aches, joint pain as well. I felt feverish but temperature was 98.6F. I also noticed some axial lymph node swelling as well on the Left side where I received the vaccine. Tender to touch, not too painful though. Since received the vaccine I have had intermittent dizzy spells as well all throughout the day.  I decided to go to sleep at 10:30pm and all night I tossed and turned with a headache and hot flashes. I woke up at 7:30am and was so stiff I could barely get out of bed. I called into work as I could not stand up without have dizziness. All day so far I have had dizziness upon standing, headache, myalgia, arthralgias, hot flashes/felt feverish, swollen axial lymph nodes and all I have wanted to do today is sleep. I took a nap and when I woke up I had been sleeping for 6 hours. I finally was able to get up and drink a 32ounce cup of water and take some ibuprofen. Ate some cereal. I still have a headache and dizziness upon standing that limit my ability to do normal daily functions.

I tried to bear down at home to decrease my heart rate but it continued to climb to 164 so after an hour of sustained Hr 126-164 I went to the emergency room where I had SVT. They did a valsalva maneuver 3 times and that made my heart rate go down to the 130s. It was then sinus tachycardia and stayed 120s-130s until about noon. Upon discharge at 3:30pm my resting heart rate was still 105 but it was determined to be a vaccine reaction as all other tests were normal.

The subject is in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred.  A 27-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies (Mar2006 and ongoing not taking any medications to treat) who received the first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 1) on 14Aug2020 at 10:34, second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 2) on 04Sep2020 at 09:27. The first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) on 23Dec2020 at 09:25, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) on 11Jan2021 at 09:48. All intramuscularly in the left deltoid as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included ethinyl-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (LOESTRIN) for birth control from May2014 and ongoing. There was no family medical history relevant to AE and no concomitant vaccine administered on the same date of investigational vaccine or other prior vaccine within four weeks.  The subject experienced neuropraxia of left arm on 11Jan2021 at 09:51 considered an important medical event requiring a visit to physician office.  The clinical course was the following: At 9:51, 3 minutes after receiving the second dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid, the subject complained of left arm numbness and tingling starting at elbow and extending to fingers, weakness, and a weak grip in that hand. She also reported a decreased range of motion on the left side including her arm, shoulder joint, elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal. Subject was afebrile with a normal vascular exam, no bruising, capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. No antipyretic medication was administered. The investigator requested the subject to return to site the following day. On 12Jan2021, the investigator noted some improvement to symptoms but the subject was unable to return to work for several days after event. An appointment was scheduled with a neurologist for 13Jan2021. The action taken with BNT162B2 for the event was not applicable. The clinical outcome of the event was recovering.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event neuropraxia of left arm was related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) and clinical trial procedure (vaccination administration in the left deltoid, investigator did consider the location was appropriate), but unrelated to first and second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) or concomitant medications. Per investigator, it was not likely that the event was related to the investigational product (IP) itself, however, that could not be 100% determined until neurologist had evaluated the subject.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  There is a reasonable possibility for the event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; to be related to the procedure of vaccine (BNT162B2) administration (needle trauma) rather than to the product administered. The event would not be considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162B2). The case will be reassessed upon reception of neurological advice.  Pfizer&#39;s safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 31-DEC-2020 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Nerve injury. Review of the database for the PT Nerve injury had the following results: 0 serious clinical trial cases and 1 non-clinical trial case.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committee and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I developed a migraine the evening of Jan 20 and began to experience chills before bed around 8-9pm.  At that time, my temperature was 99.8. I took my daily PM and migraine medication as prescribed, with no relief. Approximately 2 hours later I took the second dose of my migraine medication and rechecked my temp, it read 101.2. Around 8am Jan 21 I felt fatigued, still had a migraine, and my temp was up to 101.8. I took 2 tablets of Tylenol to reduce my fever. I did not go into work. Around 12pm my fever reached 102.1 and remained there throughout the day and I took Tylenol as described on the bottle. My migraine was greatly diminished by the evening and I did not take more migraine medication. On Jan 22 I again did not go into work. At approximately 9am my fever was at 101.2 and I called my primary care&#39;s office to seek advice about a COVID test. I did not request additional care, but the nurse recorded my symptoms and advised I was able to get tested even with the slight fever. At 2pm both fever and migraine were gone. I was tested on Jan 22 at 10am at a site, my results were negative.

                                                Headache with intermittent nausea throughout the day (4am until asleep at 10pm) that limited my daily activities. The headache was severe enough to wake me from sleeping at 4am, kept me from going back to sleep, made me feel intermittently nauseous, and was not completely relieved by a 650 mg dose of Tylenol taken in the afternoon.  I didn&#39;t feel well enough for my daily tasks, and took a 2 hour nap without headache relief.  I was 22 weeks 4 days pregnant the day of the headache/nausea, estimated due date 06/13/2021.  This is my first pregnancy that is considered low-risk with a healthy course so far (and regular prenatal care).  I had nausea the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, followed by about 6 weeks of daily mild headaches (weeks 12-18).  This headache was more severe than I had experienced thus far during my pregnancy, but still manageable.  This event was unusual as I have been feeling well since week 19 of pregnancy.

                                                Around 1 am I woke up having to sneeze and blow my nose over and over again. It got better for a few hours while I slept and then worse again around 9:30 am. I had to call in from work. I?ve been blowing my nose and having watery eyes all day. I took my usual allergy pill but it did not help. I?m reporting this because runny nose isn?t listed as a common symptom.  I have soreness in my arm but no other symptoms other than maybe a slight headache and fatigue.  I?m worried I might actually be sick but I?ve hardly left my house for months so that seems unlikely.

Also experienced severe pain at the injection site, that worsened over the evening. All symptoms continued through the evening. Also experienced night sweats.

                                                At 11:00 pm I had an extremely intense seizure that caused me to convulse on the floor while arching my back. My partner thought I was dying as it was much more intense and extreme then normal. I am still having increased seizures in both pain and severity daily. Typically my seizures last 20 minutes and are from 4-5 in discomfort in pain out of ten. Now they are around 7, even a week later. The first severe seizure was a 10 level pain and diabling.   I also got severe swelling in my arm of the site, extreme pain in the my arm lasting four days, and two large cold sores. Typically my cold sores small and last for two days. Mine are still active and gave me a fat lip. I also have extreme fatigue but could be caused by the increased seizures and pain of them.   I been unable to perform my normal duties and responsibilities, which my seizures typically do not interfere with.

                                                27 year old female comes in 3/27/21 at 4:15pm to get Pfizer COVID vaccine. She has no family doctor. On her VAR form she states no seizure or history of seizure but does have reaction to HPV vaccine where her throat swelled up and her MD had to give her oxygen year ago. I asked about any other reactions to any other vaccinations and she said no and was willing to get this vaccine.  I told her to wait 30 minutes after vaccination to make sure no reaction. At 4:25pm her sister and mom tell us that patient is feeling week and dizzy and ask for water, I go out and check and she is pale and is ready to faint. Mother asks for orange juice which she takes a sip. I ask her if she has any health conditions like diabetes, seizures and they say no, then patient has what looks like a petit mal (absence) seizure. While sitting in the chair her eyes flutter, roll back she tenses up and her body freezes for about 20-30 seconds. I tell staff to call 911 and her sister says she&#39;s having &#34;another&#34; seizure. We don&#39;t move her but make sure she doesn&#39;t fall, once the seizure passes we move her to the ground to lie down. She regains consciousness and is coherent but confused. I do not give EpiPen because I witnessed a seizure. The fire and ambulance arrive to assist her and then her family mentions she did have seizures years ago. After 20 minutes or around 4:50pm she feels better and does not want to go to the hospital and walks out assisted by fire/ambulance staff. The next day I call her and she says she feels better and just has a sore arm and will find new doctor check her out.

This caller is highly concerned and we are hoping a site supervisor can call her back and give her some insight and guidance on what happened in this instance. Thank you in advance, Leads. Note from call taker:  Caller stated she received her Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination yesterday, 4/3/21, at Clinic. Caller stated vaccinator&#39;s name tag said &#34;MD&#34;, stated with the first dose the vaccinator inserted the unlabeled syringe, then took it out, caller not sure if any of the contents were injected. Caller stated vaccinator removed the syringe and then injected her with another syringe which was labeled. Vaccinator would not give caller a reason why she received two injections. Caller states she has two injection marks on her arm. Caller stated she wants to know what happened, what could have happened, and if there is any danger to her. A runner had dropped off more syringes between the first and second injection. Caller expressed she is anxious, concerned she might have been injected with a used syringe. Caller concerned vaccinator did not wear gloves. Caller denied any other concerns about the vaccination sites on her arms. Caller stated the time on her vaccination card was originally 2:10pm and then written over as 2:16pm.

This 27-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 10Mar2021 10:15 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;one number on there is EN and then she does not know if it is a G or 6 and then 204&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing anxiety from 2020, ongoing acid problems from 2020, high cholesterol levels from 2020 (she was not prescribed any medication and the advice given was just for diet and exercise), and ongoing gallbladder problem for years. There were no concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 10Mar2021, patient had eye puffiness in her left eye. Patient asked if it is safe to take the second dose. Her eyelid got puffy which began 30 minutes after having the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and it is not ongoing but resolved completely after a few minutes. She did not require treatment for the eye puffiness and the puffiness was mostly on her upper eyelid of her left eye. Patient stated that she does not know in terms of causality if the Pfizer COVID vaccine is related to the reported events and was worried because a week after she got the vaccine, she had other symptoms and was not sure if they are connected with the vaccine. She also reported that she does not think the eye puffiness itself is that serious but it is medically significant and the other symptoms she had were chest pain, chest heaviness, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are not ongoing anymore and began around Friday, 19Mar2021 and resolved after a couple of hours of when they began. For the chest pain, chest heaviness and abdominal pain, she just took an antacid Prilosec for treatment. She thought about going to the emergency room but also thought she was having an anxiety attack and was close to having to go to the emergency room that night. She did get pretty anxious easily and that probably exacerbated it. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events had eye puffiness in her left eye and eyelid got puffy/puffiness mostly on her upper eyelid of her left eye was recovered on 10Mar2021, of the event &#34;anxiety attack/she did get pretty anxious easily and that probably exacerbated it&#34; was unknown, and of the other events was recovered in Mar2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the contributory role of the suspect bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to reported events is possible.

                                                Within 5 minutes of receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I had terrible hot flashes and was unable to focus. This subsided within 15 minutes. Within an hour of the vaccine, my tongue went numb and mildly swelled, my face grew hot, and my throat swelled. It was difficult to swallow saliva and water. Within two hours, I grew progressively weaker, light-headed/dizzy, and experienced mild confusion (unable to understand what folks were saying on the onset). I also had quite low blood pressure when observed by the EMTs. My swelling subsided within 5 hours, both through time and the eventually emergency room treatment of Benadryl, Prednisone, and saline.

                                                I received my first Covid Vaccine dose last Friday April 2nd. Just soreness from the shot and feeling tired. Saturday morning I felt nauseous as well but drank water and was fine. On Thursday4/8 early morning around 2am, I woke up in a panic. My heart was racing and I was very dizzy and could not sit still. It lasted for two hours but improved after drinking tons of water. Yesterday,  4/8, while I was working, around 4pm I finished eating in the cafeteria and as I&#39;m walking to the elevator, I lost focus and felt as if I was going to pass out. My heart began to race as it did that early morning and I could not stand still. I was able to make it on the elevator and when I got to my nurses station I began to lose focus again. I alerted my charge nurse, she escorted me to the waiting area and sat me down and began to check my vitals. My temperature was 98, blood pressure was 139/88 and sugar was fine as well since I just ate. I sat for the next hour drinking water and I eventually was able to get up and I was fine.

                                                Woke with up chest, arm and jaw pain on 03/21/2021. Presented to the ED. Her initial EKG was negative for any acute changes but her troponin was elevated. Cardiology was consulted. Her echo was negative for cardiomyopathy or hypertrophy. But after her troponin continued to rise she was taken to the cath lab to look for ischemia. Her cardiac angiography was negative for obstructive disease, and coronary arteries were completely normal. Had low magnesium and potassium- so started on oral supplementation. Discharged on 03/22/2021 with nitroglycerin (which was not helpful and made her feel worse/nauseated) and to follow up with outpatient cardiac MRI and cardiology. This imaging revealed significant myocardial edema consistent with myocarditis.   04/01/2021 Per Cardiology: -Given that the patient had covid 19 back in November 2019 I believe she may have had a low yield subacute myocardial infection at that time that was somehow exacerbated by her 1st covid vaccine. Therefore, after some consideration and careful discussion I am advising against the 2nd vaccine at this time.  -No physical exercise for 6 months given her current myocarditis and family hx of sudden cardiac death -May trial PRN NSAIDS for pain relief -Recommend birth control and no pregnancy until at least after her follow up cMRI  -Follow up in 6 months with cMRI prior

                                                After shot felt increasingly nauseous and dizzy and tired. I went to the bathroom and threw up.  Upon return to the observation area, I lost consciousness, fainted, and woke up on the floor.  My blood pressure was low but within normal range and my blood sugar was normal.  I was not nervous about receiving the shot or possible symptoms and do not have a history of fainting not relating to medication side effects (meds I am no longer on) and over exertion ( ie. likely not psychosomatic).  Fainting on a hard surface led to a serious concussion with effects (brain fog, fatuige, headache, and dizziness primarily) continue to persist.   I saw doctors at an urgent care and them the ER where they performed a pregnancy test (negative), blood sugar test (normal). EKG (normal), and a concussion screening that led to a CT scan (normal).  I left with no explanation as to why I felt sick and fainted after the vaccine and was only told later by my psychiatrist to report.   The only clear side effect was pain in the arm of the injection site.  Other possible vaccine symptoms overlap with concussion symptoms.

I had the general pain near the injection site, but that went away after 24hrs.  I am still feeling shooting pains through the right side of my body, mainly from my elbow to my fingers.  It has made me unable to work a full day since scrolling, typing, and clicking all aggravate this pain. If I am using my right arm/fingers too often it turns into a debilitating headache.

                                                Right when I received the shot I had a shooting pain from my elbow to my thumb, pointer, and middle finger.  I experienced some pain at injection site for about 24hrs, but the pain through my fingers has not gone away and continues to interfere with work.  I went to the ER on Wednesday, 4/14/21. The pain was giving me an intense headache and shooting down my back and legs on the right side.  They prescribed muscle relaxers, anti-inflammatory, and pain meds to ease the pain.  Even with the meds, I still experience high levels of pain when I use my right arm/hand. I am trying to work the best I can, but scrolling, clicking, and typing aggravate the pain.

I had not had any depressed or or suicidal thoughts the previous day or months before receiving the second dose of the vaccine. These thoughts persisted for about 8 hours, before I started feeling like myself again. I was very concerned and confused.

                                                This is about my left arm and hands and fingers, the side I received my vaccine. The second night after I got my shot I was laying in bed and I could not move my arm really and it was having weird spasms like zaps going down my arm.  My arm had and dead weight feeling to it and I could barely move it I started panicking. I tried to calm down but I couldn&#39;t stop thinking how abnormal it felt. I have tried to relax it because I was theorizing it could be from inflammation (sort of like a trigger finger affect). It&#39;s very upsetting because the feeling hasn&#39;t gone away. I can move my arm and hands and fingers better now but I still have this tingly feeling in my funny bone radiating to my armpit and down to my finger tips especially my pinky and ring finger. My muscles keep tightening in my forearm. I will see a doctor as soon as possible.  To go into more detail: It feels like there is a rubber band around my funny bone area, like my funny bone is constantly being hit. A constant buzz. It is hard for me to move my pinky and ring finger on my hand, the best way to describe it is sort of like a numbness and those two fingers move together more now. My coordination is off. It&#39;s in pain especially because of the tightening feeling and the palm of my hand has a clenching going on.   When you wake up and find you have been sleeping on your arm and at first it feels normals and then as the blood rushes to it it starts to tingle - it sort of feels like that but all the time right now. It&#39;s got a dead weight feeling.  It has been ten days since my vaccine.  Thanks for reading.

                                                Once my period started, (somewhat on schedule) I had terrible period cramps. Worse than I&#39;ve ever had before. I very rarely get cramps at all, and these were certainly the worse I&#39;ve ever had. Pain was bad enough to prevent my ability to work and to some extent move at times. This is not something I have ever experienced before. Reporting because I have heard anecdotally from  close friends about changes in their periods after the vaccine as well. I had not heard of this until after I was already done with my period, so it wasn&#39;t something I was expecting  or in my opinion not placebo related since I did not hear about possible period-related side effects until afterwards.

I took Tylenol -  it didn&#39;t go down and in 30 minutes it was 102. I was treated that Wednesday after the second dose in ER. They gave me IV fluids and super strengthen Ibuprofen because I had already taken extra strength Tylenol. They were able to bring the fever down after treating me with fluid intake and the ibuprofen. I was released after the fever went down. I was given two days off work to make sure I didn&#39;t spike any more fever.

Vitals stable.  Called 911 for transport/observation at Emergency Department as precaution.  Pt did not receive any emergency medications.  ? The attending physician has indicated that patient had a mild allergic reaction to the vaccine, which then transitioned to a heightened episode of anxiety about how her body was reacting to the shot. The physical reactions she exhibited could have been a direct response to either, or a combination of both of those situations, so he cannot directly pinpoint one main cause. He did advise her NOT to get the second shot. ? She is feeling much better, and the symptoms have all subsided, but she is very tired. The physician recommended she rest for the remainder of the day, so she is going home.

                                                I woke up on Jan. 22nd and felt off. I developed a bad headache throughout the day and was sensitive to touch. I didn&#39;t sleep well that night and threw up in the middle of the night. I was very tired. I slept for most of the day Jan. 23rd and my parents stopped by that evening and noticed I wasn&#39;t feeling well. I had a fever and an altered mental status. My dad took me to the ER and I was admitted to the hospital that night. I had an EEG that showed I was having subclinical seizures and a spinal tap concluded that I had aseptic meningitis (which the doctors think is what caused the seizure). I regained my mental status Jan. 25th  after being put on seizure medicine. The doctors thought the meningitis was most likely viral and I had an exhaustive infectious disease workup done which came back negative. The only thing that stood out was an abnormal ANA test. I was released from the hospital the evening of Jan 27th.

                                                Right after I got the vaccine they had us wait and sit for 15 minutes I grabbed some of the chips they had on the site. In less than 15 minutes I started to feel really dizzy and I had a flare of heat behind my neck. I called over one of the Dr.s and explained to him that I felt dizzy and if that was normal. He told me if I was dizzy that I needed to wait longer until the dizziness when away. I stayed longer because the dizziness went away. I was fine Friday and Saturday and Sunday I went to work and while I was working my head felt like it was spinning and spinning I felt like I was going to tip over. I left home that day thought I would just sleep it off and tried going into work the next day. Same thing was still feeling dizzy I got sent home . I proceeded and went to the urgent care on 5-31-21 where they told me that I had Vertigo . I have never had Vertigo in my life.  The only other time I had felt like this way was after the vaccine. So the Dr.said he&#39;s not for sure if it was the Vaccine but chances are if I&#39;ve never had Vertigo than it probably was the Vaccine. I Went to the drs again this wed 6-2-21 they told me I had vertigo and again they said they don&#39;t know if its the vaccine but it possibly could be. Ive now had vertigo for 6 days and I need proof for my work that this Vertigo is being caused by the vaccine.

                                                Day of administration around 2100 I started feeling a little off, got a little bit of a headache and felt warm. While sleeping I could feel that I had chills and felt very warm. Woke up at about 0200 to take my temperature. Felt dizzy when I got up, still had a headache and a fever of 101.0 (taken orally). Contacted a nurse triage line to ensure I can take t=Tylenol to bring the fever down and get rid of the headache. She said yes, which is when I took 500mg Extra Strength Tylenol rapid release. Continued to feel not so well, and broke my fever around 0630 timeframe. Once I woke up around 0900 (day after administration) still felt a little warm  (99.5)  and a mild headache. Will keep an eye on any other adverse reactions.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after the vaccine administration, I started getting symptoms that started mild and became severe including: headache, dry cough with chest pressure, dizziness/lightheaded,  joint pain, body aches, fatigue, and chills. At 5:30 pm I started getting a fever, that started at 100.5 then increased to 103.3 by 8:30 pm. I was also nauseous and vomited once.  I was tested the next morning for influenza and COVID and was negative. My fever came back down to 98.8 around 12 pm the next day. Overall, symptoms lasted approximately 30 hours after the vaccine was administered.  I was out of work the following day after the vaccine. Now, 2 days after the vaccine I am just mildly fatigued with a dry cough left.

That night I woke up with moderate body aches and chills and a dull headache, no fever. The next morning, I awoke feeling very fatigued, severe muscle/body aches, headache and chills, still no fever. I slept most of the day. Extra strength Tylenol helped tremendously with the body aches. I was symptom free the morning of 1/15/2021. I was scheduled to work the day after my vaccination and was unable to due to the symptoms described.  I had no adverse reactions with my first dose.  I am a nursing mother and for the first and second doses, I noticed no side effects or any concerns with my child or milk supply.

A 28-year-old female patient received BNT162b2 (lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 09Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient got the COVID 19 vaccine on 09Jan2021, and symptoms started shortly right after, with headache, flu type symptoms with sinus pressure, all on 09Jan2021; and this morning (13Jan2021) she woke up with no sense of smell. She is so sick right now (13Jan2021), said she can&#39;t even think right now (13Jan2021). The patient stated the only thing that improved was the headache went away, and in the first two days (Jan2021), she had a sore throat, and that has gone away, but everything else has stayed constant. The patient had brain fog in Jan2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included weight: 125 pound range. The outcome of the event headache was recovered on 09Jan2021, the sore throat was recovered in Jan2021, other events was not recovered.

                                                Reporter received the second COVID-19 vaccine on 1/20/2021 at 08:25 AM.  She had proactively taken diphenhydramine following the reaction to her first dose.  Around 08:40 AM,  she began to feel tightening in her throat and some heaviness in her chest. She was evaluated by a nurse who took her blood pressure (normal), however, her heart rate was elevated (noted this could be that she was nervous following initial reaction and repeat tightness in throat).  Around 08:55AM, she began to feel like her tongue was swelling and that she had a &#34;bubble&#34; on the top of her throat. She was taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She was given hydroxyzine, famotidine, and dexamethasone in the ED and was discharged and felt stable.  She reported a continued odd sensation in her throat the evening of the second vaccination.  This feeling resolved the next day, and she reports no additional side effects from the vaccine.   Of note, patient had experienced a similar reaction following her first vaccination (E-number 261589)

I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

                                                After my 2nd dose administration, I sat in an observation tent with 4 resident doctors. This is protocol at my hospital to assess for any adverse reactios. About 10 minutes later, I started to feel both of my arms (from should all the way to tips of my fingers) start to get tingly with an intense vibrating sensation. I tried to calm myself down, however numbness began to occur to both BUE seconds after. Next thing that happened, bilateral fingers became visually contracted however numb and I could not move my fingers. I also got a tingly/prickly sensation to my cheeks all the way down to my chin after the hand numbess. The resident doctors quickly took me by wheelchair to a private room where they checked my vital signs. BP was elevated with systolic in 190&#39;s, HR around 120s, and my limbs were all cold. By this time it was around 6pm and they were trying to calm me down as I started to have a panic attack. My parents came to pick me up at 7pm when my vitals were stable. I rested at home, and the contraction to my fingers/numbess did not subside until 8:30pm.  The following day, my left arm (injection site) had a soreness level of 9/10. Tylenol was used to relieve pain.

When smiling one side trip the far far left the other side stay still. My job had me go to a doctors up where they diagnosed me with Bell?s palsy it and the doctor advised me to report this. My treatment plan is antiviral medication and steroids, Valacyclovir 1gm tid, methylprednisolone 4grams qid. I am very upset and heartbroken every time I look in the mirror I cry because I cannot recognize my face I did read online that Pfizer did have side effects of bells palsy but I never thought I would get it given my age and good medical history. I would love for someone to reach out to me I need to know what happens from here.   As a result I have been off of work for a couple days.

                                                3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt a sense of panic and a tingling on my lips, that then spread to my mouth, throat, and tongue. I asked the nurse if my lips were swollen, and she said no.  A few minutes later my heart rate increased and I felt really lightheaded. After 7-10 minutes I felt my tongue tingling and it had become swollen. I told the nurse that I think my tongue was swollen and she said it looked okay. I had a hard time talking because I wasn&#39;t used to be tongue being so large. The nurses stayed and talked to me for the rest of the 30 minute waiting period. I was able to talk and breath while making a conscious effort.  I wasn&#39;t sure whether the high heart rate and lightheadedness were associated with my condition, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. I kept checking my tongue to see how swollen it was.  After the 30 minutes, the nurses had me stand up to see if I could. Once I could, they said I was all set to go. They did not get an Epi-pen for the swollen tongue or give me instructions on how to treat it. They were insensitive and dismissive of my symptoms. they kept repeating &#34;I think your just nervous.&#34; Once I got home, I still had the swollen tongue and tingling, but was able to go up and down stairs and go about my day. It was a little difficult to swallow one of my pills when I got home, but I was able to. I checked my blood pressure around 4:30 p.m. and it was 121/84 and my pulse was 79 bpm sitting. I did not take anything to treat my swollen tongue. The swollen tongue and tingling feeling in my throat continued for another 2.5 hours, until 6:00 p.m. Once the swelling was down, my tongue felt like I burnt it on a hot beverage, almost a numb feeling. I also experienced more common side effects such as body aches, fatigue, and feeling feverish.   After this episode I had extremely high anxiety where it was difficult for me to sleep the following night. I called a 24/7 nurse line and she said to talk to my doctor. I had less than 4 hours sleep the night after I had my vaccine.  I called my doctor&#39;s office this morning and I spoke to a nurse who worked as a nurse on the COVID Vaccine hotline.  She relayed the message to the doctor who was covering for my doctor while she&#39;s on medical leave. I received a call around 9:30 a.m. saying that the doctor on leave recommend I should talk to my PCP but that she thought I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and that I should not get the second dose. She said they were not sure how I would react with the second dose, and they&#39;re afraid that my allergic response might be more severe and life threatening.  I hope this report helps other people who experience these symptoms.

A 28-year-old non-pregnant female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Feb2021 15:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, migraines, asthma, hay fever, acid reflux, hives when exercising outdoors in the cold, and allergies: latex, cats, dustmites, gluten and dairy intolerance; all from unknown dates. Concomitant medications included sumatriptan, bupropion, pepsin, calcium carbonate and unspecified herbs. The patient did not received other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took fluconazole (DIFLUCAN) and experienced allergies. A few minutes after taking the vaccine, the patient experienced a tingling feeling in lips, which then spread to mouth, throat and tongue. The patient told a nurse and she said that she looked fine. The patient asked if lips were swollen but they weren&#39;t. Then a few minutes later she felt very lightheaded and had an elevated heart rate. Then around this time, she saw her tongue was swollen to about double the size. The nurse said she looked fine, and monitored her for 30 minutes then let her go. This swollen tongue lasted for about 2.5 - 3 hours. After the swelling subsided, tongue felt like it was numb/burnt by drinking a hot liquid. 12 hours later, she woke up in the middle of the night with an elevated heart rate and had trouble sleeping. The patient spoke to her doctor and it sounds like she had an allergic reaction, even though she have no history of allergies for any of the vaccine ingredients. Onset date of all events were reported as 25Feb2021 15:30. Outcome of all events reported as recovered on an unspecified date. No treatment was given for all events. The patient was not diagnosed of covid prior vaccination and has not tested for covid post vaccination.

                                                I had chills, body aches; headaches; I felt feverish but I don&#39; t know if I had a fever. Body aches were really intense - I didn&#39;t sleep the whole night. I had swelling a little on my arm - at injection site. My arm was sore. In general, my body was really sore and I couldn&#39;t get up from bed for 24 hours. I still had a bit of a headache and chills after the 24 hours so I stayed home from work 48 hours. I have been seen by a doctor -after the second vaccine, I had a flare up with my rash on my face (had been experiencing a rash on face prior to vaccine but this was a flare). My face flare up was that I broke out in a rash after finishing doxycycline. Didn&#39;t put me on another antibiotic because they wanted to wait and see with the rash - and the tests. Flare up - I couldn&#39;t eat; painful to wear a mask to work; couldn&#39;t sleep on my face.  I was put on doxycycline again - on March 10th or 11th again because I couldn&#39;t handle the pain anymore. And it is getting refilled for another round.  I have had to take a leave a absence from work the last two weeks.

                                                I had sore for three days days, then on Monday afternoon I started having difficult breathing, I can?t really work because I?m not breathing properly. It?s been like this for 4 days. I?m not sure if this is a an allergic reaction like it says or something serious. I?m going to the doctor tomorrow and see if something is wrong with my lungs because I get panic attacks cause I can?t breath.

                                                3/18: Chest pain. It woke me up in the middle of the night with some dizziness. At first, I disregarded it, then I tried falling asleep again, but I was jolted awake again with worse symptoms - vertigo, palpitations. I measured my HR, it was all over the place and irregular. Went to the ER, they didnt find anything substantial on my EKG other than arrhythmia with short PR. No treatment was given, instructed to follow up with PCP. Left ER between 4AM-5AM. Was able to go back to sleep, but the chest pain woke me up around 7 AM. The chest pain remained fairly constant with severity changing throughout the day. Symptoms were worse at night and more: inability to sleep, sometimes restlessness - the need to move, increased chest pain/tightness/burning, palpitations. Saw PCP on 3/19, she didnt have any of the lab results, but prescribed metoprolol - this medication was misunderstood as to when I was supposed to take it, therefore didnt start it until another visit that I had with my PCP on 3/22. Over the weekend, I took some ibuprofen to try to lessen the chest pain, it helped a little bit but not for long. Began taking metoprolol 3/22. I didnt sleep more than 2-3 hrs from 3/18-3/22

I also had a slight lump in my throat 15-30 minutes after receipt. I never felt like I was in danger or needed immediate medical attention, and the symptoms subsided without medication.

She was sweating and really anxious initially she said it was itchy but then she said no itching . Looks like panic attack. she was worried and embarrassed by the situation and started worrying about it. I put her some ice on the back, gave her some water and she was really weak and she want to ear some pretzel. gave her some pretzel to eat. she was ok. EMT came and observed her she had normal BP and heart rate. No allergic reaction she said she want to go home after 30 mins of observation. she walked out with  EMT. she was good just little embarrassed by the situation. More like Panic attack. I called and followed up with her she is just doing fine and happy. she actually doing great by 4:30 pm today.

                                                I received the first dose of my COVID19 vaccine at 6:15PM, and felt fine immediately after. At 8:00PM, my left arm went numb, followed by my left leg and face. I was driving, so drove to the ER. I was initially admitted as a pre-stroke patient, but my CT scan and MRI came back normal, as well as my bloodwork. The numbness continued for 4&#43; hours, but eventually subsided. The next two weeks were spent with brain fog so severe that it was difficult to work? I had trouble remembering what was discussed in meetings I had just attended, and had extreme fatigue. For reference, I am a healthy and active 28 year old with no pre-existing conditions.  In my followups with both my Primary Care Physician and my Neurologist, both are adamant that it had to have been a reaction from the vaccine, as all of my bloodwork and scanning have been completely fine, and I am healthy otherwise. Both advised that I not get the second vaccine.

Patient wanted to keep her head down because she experienced light sensitivity; I placed cold compresses on her neck. Patient worsened over the next 10 minutes, complaining of feeling dizzy, anxious, intense headache. At this time, 15 minutes after being vaccinated, I (the vaccinating pharmacist) moved the patient to a private booth to have her lie down on the floor with her feet elevated. The patient was able to communicate the entire time and called her relatives to come pick her up from work. Emergency services were called as the patient was not experiencing anaphylaxis, but was increasingly more anxious and was afraid she&#39;d fall or faint. Emergency medical services arrived after the patient had been laying down with feet elevated for almost 30 minutes. Patient did not complain of trouble breathing but did request use of her inhaler. Patient did not state on her patient questionnaire and consent form that she has asthma; she mentioned this during her episode. Patient was taking to a local hospital.

                                                A few hours after getting my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine, my left arm started to hurt.  It was hard to move without intense muscular pain.   Later that night, I woke up with severe upper back pain.   After taking a Tylenol and putting a heating pad on my back, I tried to go back to sleep but couldn&#39;t.  The pain lasted until a little after 5 am.   On the day after my injection, I started to get a fever around noon.  I accidentally broke my thermometer while washing it.  My last reading (around 3 PM) was 100 degrees.  I definitely felt feverish throughout the rest of the day and into the evening.  My muscles throughout my body also felt tired/sore.  My husband said that my forehead was really warm.  Later in the evening (around 7 PM), my legs began to have intense pain.  The muscular pain was centralized behind both thighs and calves.  I put a heated massage pillow against the areas to try to relieve the pain.  It helped for small intervals, but did not cure it.  I also used a heating pad and Tylenol to try to fight the pain.  I also tried to drink lots of water.   At 10:30 PM, the pain was unbearably intense, causing me to have a panic attack (which of course made things worse).  After another Tylenol and session with the heating pad, I was finally able to fall asleep (over an hour later).  I woke up around 3:00 AM drenched in sweat from breaking my fever.   Since breaking my fever, I have had almost no further adverse symptoms (besides my muscles feeling &#34;slightly&#34; sore).  I feel it should be noted that I had COVID-19 twice before getting the vaccine and am considered a &#34;long-hauler.&#34;  The first time was last March (2020) and the second time was in October (2020).  With these illnesses, I have had many ill effects.  My hair began thinning a lot, I lost over 30 pounds (now considered underweight), was diagnosed with POTS, struggle with gastrointestinal problems (was put on low-FODMAP diet), and my extreme fatigue never really went away.

I mentioned to the pharmacist today that a few days after the first shot, I had cramps in both my calf muscles (worse in right) that felt a little like a charley horse but nothing helped - I exercised (I&#39;m a fitness instructor), stayed hydrated and had electrolytes,  took ibuprofen and rolled out the muscle and nothing changed it. I woke up three days later and it was gone. No warmness or swelling, just felt like my muscle had been shortened.

The rest of the morning/day I had a headache, was very tired, and weak.  I had a slight headache for the following 3 days.

After the first week, I developed knee pain, a cough, and extreme fatigue. I had to miss a day of work on Monday, April 12th due to my symptoms. I slept for 48 hours (Sunday, April 11th 9pm-Tuesday, April 13th 9am) due to my extreme fatigue.

                                                On about April 8th, 2021 I began to experience a sharp stabbing pain in my lower left shoulder blade that would throb persistently. My upper back and my left underarm area on my torso towards my back began to hurt and become extremely sensitive to touch. My lymph nodes in my left armpit, left collarbone, and on the left side of my neck were and still are very swollen. I initially went to the doctor on April 14th, 2021 after dealing with this pain that was getting progressively worse. I feared that I was having a pulmonary embolism or a cardiac event, and maybe even a problem with my spleen. After examination, my doctor believed the culprit to be my inflamed lymph nodes causing inflammation in the surrounding areas. My doctor sent me home with Meloxicam and Flexeril to help with my pain. On the night of April 14th, 2021 I noticed a rash under my left breast beginning to form. Over the course of the next 3 days, the rash became a cluster of blisters, I developed severe shooting pains from my left breast into my under arm area and around my back along the left side. My spine in my upper back began to feel bruised, along with my sternum which feels bruised and inflamed internally. I&#39;ve been so uncomfortable that I&#39;ve been having trouble sleeping. The pain also worsens after I eat, which makes eating really difficult. I made a second doctor&#39;s appointment for today, April 17th, 2021 (I was unable to get a sooner appointment) . My doctor confirmed that the rash is in fact Shingles and she prescribed me Valtrex and Percocet for the pain. I am currently taking these medications. Because I just found out my diagnosis today, I am still in severe pain and it&#39;s been 14 days since my second Pfizer vaccine. I do not have any known autoimmune disorders.

About 6:30pm (7 hours after vaccination) I developed severe vertigo and nausea with dry heaving. 7pm my lips and face felt strange, tingling and dry mouth. I don&#39;t know when my lips became swollen, but a friend saw and pointed it out to me at about 11pm. They remained slightly swollen and tingling at least 3:30am when I fell asleep. When I woke the tingling and swollen lips were completely back to normal, but the vertigo and other symptoms lasted until about 10pm on 4/17/2021. I am still fatigued and experiencing joint and muscle pain and injection site soreness, but I&#39;m aware those are normal, expected side effects from this vaccine.

A 28-year-old female patient (who was not pregnant at the time of vaccination), received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: ER8732 and expiry date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm left, on 26Mar2021, at 14:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history was not reported. She did not have any known allergies. Concomitant medications included estradiol valerate, progesterone and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12). Patient stated that she first experienced some feverish feelings, chills and hives 30 minutes following her vaccination. She drove home from the hospital and was feeling a bit off, but mostly okay. By the time she got back, she was feeling worse, around 4 PM. By 5 PM she had broken out in hives all over her body, especially on her face, swelling her eyes significantly and having her tongue go somewhat numb, starting to make it difficult to swallow. She also had significant chills, and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, and ended up being admitted to the ER. After being given antihistamines, the swelling went down and eventually the chills stopped after monitoring in the hospital. The patient was hospitalized for the events on an unknown date in Mar2021. Treatment received for the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks of vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date in Mar2021.

                                                I began noticing increasing pain beginning in my right arm, migrating up to my traps, base of my skull, sternocleidomastoid muscle, jaw joint (a lot of jaw popping) my neck (a lot popping, unusual), ears, and pecs. As well as this migrating to the left side of my upper body as well.   Have been treating with heat, stretching, Ibuprofen, and Tylenol. As well as a lot of water.  4/16/21 - at around 7:00 pm I started noticing muscle stiffness on the right side of my body (shot was in R arm). However, the initial predicted side effects at this point were more noticeable than the pain in my neck.   4/17/21 - neck was basically immobile and both sides of neck seemed inflamed. around 9:00pm that night shoulders began to hurt more.  4/18/21 -  had a little relief but was in pain. Noticed pain migrating to shoulder blade/trap area  4/19/21 - Pain had migrated to all places listed at the top. Heated, medicated, stretched, and massaged with little relief.  Noticed on 04/20 that this pain was almost too much too handle. Had incredibly sensitive ears/pecs/sternocleidomastoid muscle. Went to work while at work I began sweating profusely, my equilibrium felt off, and I was at about a 9/10 in pain (unusual to the previous days.) My work environment is loud so I went to put in headphones which only made the symptoms worse. Could not focus, head feels &#39;full&#39; and tired. I then was in so much pain that I did vomit. I called a dr and he did let me know that this is a heard of side effect. If things get worse or the vomiting doesn&#39;t subside to call again.

                                                Side effects started with very painful left arm in muscles and joints and feeling drained of energy. Also had a fever of just under 100 F by oral thermometer. Later the first evening, muscle and joint aches spread to the rest of my upper body and headache started. Also had sinus congestion. Tried to sleep but could not get into a comfortable position and had fever dreams when I could drift off. Took 500mg Tylenol in the middle of the night and it didn&#39;t seem to help. Nauseous the following morning, no vomiting or diarrhea. Very painful aches in joints and muscles the next day including neck, upper back, jaw, shoulders, elbows, and knuckles. Couldn&#39;t focus. Slept most of that day. Sunday I started feeling better around 10am, but still had muscle fatigue. Pain in shoulders, neck, elbows, and knuckles came back around 9pm and could not find a comfortable position to sleep even with taking 1000mg Tylenol. Monday I had less joint pain but maintained muscle pain and had muscle cramps in my thighs and calves. Today I feel like I have no energy and am still having problems concentrating and remembering details from work meetings from last week.

The symptoms occurred less than ten minutes from the time I received the vaccine. The body aches and the mild fever lasted two days, and the sore arm lasted three days. I could not sleep on my left side because the arm was tender. These symptoms only occurred for the first vaccine; I did not experience any of the symptoms mentioned above with the second dose.

                                                The week of 3/28/21 I began to feel numbness on the right side of my body, in my genital area.  By 4/18/21, the numbness had spread into my right glute, which was completely numb.  On Sunday, 4/25, I had a sudden onset of all of the following:, the numbness had spread upward and downward and the right side of my body was partially numb; vision in my right eye was blurry; my right eye hurt, and felt swollen; my pupils were unequal; my neck was stiff; I was dizzy; and I could not speak properly.   I felt very floaty.  These symptoms waxed and waned, together, for several hours at a time, getting progressively worse each time.  My lucid periods also got progressively worse.  I went to my PCP who ran bloodwork and referred me to a neurologist, who I could not get an appointment with until July.    On 5/3/21, I was admitted to the ER based on the recommendation of the triage nurse who heard my symptoms and their duration.  The ER ran a bunch of tests and found nothing.  I went home and over the next few days entered again into several nonlucid states.  I believe my body was getting closer and closer to death.  I began taking my temperature with a reliable thermometer, and found it was dropping to 93-95 during my symptomatic periods.    I found help from alternative doctors who immediately intervened, and continue to monitor me.   The doctor I listed on this form was my ER doctor.

However, roughly 15 hours after the vaccine, my fever spiked high, I was shaking uncontrollably, I had several episodes of hyperventilating, I was nauseous, weak, clammy, off and on chills and hot flashes and had a small panic attack after feeling like I couldn?t breathe two different times.  I had zero appetite for the following day and remained nauseous with a slight fever off and on for the following 18 hours or so.

This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improve; brain fog; retroorbital headache/intermittent mild tension type frontal headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).  A 29-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (lot number EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 12:00 at 29 years old at single dose at Left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Mirena IUD, personal and family history of retinal migraines (without headache). The concomitant medications were magnesium citrate, melatonin, ademetionine (SAME) and fish oil. On 18Dec2020 in the AM, developed progressive severe soreness at injection site, worse than any other vaccine, hurt even just the touch. This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improved. There was no swelling, redness, or other local symptoms. In the afternoon on 18Dec2020, she developed significant loss of mental clarity (brain fog) while at work. In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM. The patient used naproxen 440 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg on 19Dec2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I was very fatigued and could not use my arm to work since the pain in the arm. I took some Ibuprofen and took a nap and then after that it got a little better, it still hurt but at least I could I use my arm. The next day it was fine.

                                                1 week history of significantly worsened (previously present &#34;low back strain&#34; lower back pain that had become radicular to both LE and associated with progressively worsening bilateral LE weakness, paresthesias since COVID vaccination last week. see continuation for HPI and assessment/plan from office note 1/13/21  HPI from OV dated 1/13/21  She had presented initially in December 2020 for her annual physical, and we evaluated some low back pain that that time, felt to be a sprain/strain resulting from a fall in the shower earlier December which was aggravated significantly by lifting/transferring a patient at the SNF she works for as a nurse. Presentation at that time was rather benign, no imaging obtained, pt was placed on leave from work for 1 week to avoid the heavy lifting and likely aggravation of back pain, and rx including diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine. She did not FU in the office, but returned to work at SNF a week after I saw her for the back pain. She states she had improved enough to feel like she could go back to work but wasn&#39;t 100% without back pain yet. At no time was comp mentioned at the visit in December. She did tell her employer about the injury and was off of work for a week and was encouraged to seek comp. We were never notified.    Yesterday 1/12 she followed up in the office for the back pain and was found to have much more severe pain, now radicular to both LE (pain intensity worse on right), with new neurologic impairment including objective weakness bilateral LE (R&gt;L), sensation disturbance bilateral LE (R&gt;L). Xray of lumbar spine obtained in clinic, this was essentially unremarkable, non-acute.  Pt was sent for stat MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI last night revealed no findings to explain her severe symptoms - she has mild symmetric disc bulging at L5-S1  nd mild bilateral facet arthropathy with patent canal and foramina, and a mild nonspecific  &#34;STIR signal abnormality&#34; within the soft tissues abutting the left lateral aspect of the L5 spinous processes felt to be small and nonspecific. I did discuss the case and the imaging with the radiologist and he feels this is unlikely to be the source of her back pain/radicular symptoms. No obvious signs of apparent discitis or any signficant soft tissue abnormality.    Pt contacted last night with initial &#34;normal&#34; results of MRI as formal results were pending - hydrocodone was sent to her pharmacy for pain relief overnight. Pt received 60mg toradol in the office yesterday during her visit. Pt noted significant improvement in her back pain, bilateral leg pain about 30 minuts after that injection. She continued to have pain in the evening but went to sleep. She woke at 3am unable to roll over due to weakness and pain - her sister gave her a hydrocodone and she went back to sleep&#39; she woke this morning feeling much better; today, she has less severe low back pain, less severe right lower leg radicular pain, NO pain radiating into the left LE, lessening of the weakness in her right LE, lessening of paresthesia reported in the right LE (now isolated just to the heel), resolution of the weakness in the left LE, resolution of the tingling of the left knee. Other than the toradol and one dose of hydrocodone, no other medications were given, no other treatments given since presentation yesterday.   Upon further questioning, patient does reveal that she received the 1st of 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (pfizer) last week. She received the vaccination at work at nursing home on 1/7/21. She had some relatively quick onset nausea and dizziness within an hour of the injection, but that resolved. She recalls feeling like her low back pain, bilateral lower leg pain, leg weakness and paresthesias all intensified sometime either Wednesday 1/6/21 or 1/7/21, but more obviously worsened over the weekend 1/9 and 1/10. Along with the lower extremity symptoms, she does admit today that she experienced soreness in bilateral upper arms starting the day following the vaccine administration, with left arm/shoulder still feeling sore and tender to the touch now. She also developed some altered sensation of the right thumb and index fingers the day following vaccination (1/8/21) and this has been persistent/unchanged. She is right handed. No prior issues with right hand/fingers. Other than the altered sensation, she denies pain, swelling, or notable weakness. She is right handed, and really hasn&#39;t done much with her right hand over the past week since she hasn&#39;t been working. Patient denies having significant headache, fever, chills, diaphoresis, fatigue, rashes/injection site erythema since the covid vaccination. She was not told to sign up for or told about the V-safe program and hadn&#39;t thought to report her symptoms to work or think to be concerned regarding possible vaccine SE. Pt denies prior hx of low back pain, neurologic symptoms including weakness/paresthesias, previous allergy to or adverse reaction to vaccination or injectable medications. She has a history of latent TB(fully treated) but is otherwise in good health.  After gathering much further detailed information/history today from patient, review of chart including the MRI results and xray results from yesterday, my prior OV note, and discussion with radiologist today regarding her MRI - I Discussed with patient and her sister that I believe what is becoming more apparent to me now is that she is likely suffering from an adverse event associated with the COVID-19 vaccination she received on 1/7/21 through her workplace. I&#39;m unable to define this for certain, but I suspect that she developed the progressive worsening of low back pain, development of radicular pain and bilateral LE weakness and paresthesias about 1-2 days following the vaccination administration. She has had notable and rather surprising improvement in both subjective and objective findings  Today as compared to yesterday. Only intervention was toradol 60mg IM and one dose of hydrocodone, she had already been taking diclofenac or ibuprofen so I believe the only explanation for the improvement over the past 24 hours is the fact that she is gradually having resolution of the temporary paraparesis, neuralgia, paresthesia brought on by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. I believe she truly had injury to the low back in December, initial injury at home but had improvmenet and then significant worsening/exacerbation when transferring a resident at work. Her presentation following that was consistent with a strain/sprain of the lumbar spine. This was treated appropriately with rest, activity modification, stretching, NSAID, and muscle relaxers. She returned to work w/o restriction likely earlier than she should have but I believe the covid vaccination is likely what caused her condition to so significantly decline; Its also possible that her physically demanding job requiring lifting/transferring/standing for prolonged periods of time on top of an only partially resolved low back strain had aggravated her low back condition.    plan from OV dated 1/13/21 Given the improvement since yesterday, I recommended obtaining some labs looking for any sign of alternative explanation including infectious etiology or autoimmune/inflammatory condition, however will hold on further imaging as would be the plan, specifically EMG of the bilateral LEs. Explained to patient that I&#39;m hopeful with continued rest and time, her symptoms (weakness, tingling/numbness, radicular back pain) will completely resolve. She may need some eventual PT for the disc bulge in the lumbar spine and lumbar strain that is likely still lingering. Will contact pt with any change in care plan based on the laboratory findings. I would like to closely follow her, and make sure her symptoms continue to slowly improve /resolve. If at any point she develops worsening symptoms again or any new neurologic signs/symptoms (and we discussed what emergency signs/symptoms would be) then she needs to be in touch with me right away. I will work on reporting this suspected adverse covid vaccine reaction to VAERS / possibly also CDC and see if they have any additional input/suggestions for monitoring/treatment.    For pain control, pt may continue with the diclofenac OR ibuprofen, and the hydrococone/APAP as needed for breakthrough severe pain uncontrolled with the NSAID. I have advised pt to remain off of work at this time, resting at home avoiding lots of physical activity as she continues to heal. Suspect will have her follow up in clinic sometime next week for repeat evaluation/examination depending on VAERS/CDC recommendations and of course the lab results and any updated condition reports from the patient in the interim. Will want to make sure she has full resolution of the paresis and adequate resolution of her back pain/radicular pain prior to returning to work, even in a limited capacity. I am informed today that there is light duty available and will keep that in mind. Pt to be contacted regarding follow up. Encouraged to call with questions/concerns/updates. Pt was very thankful for the care.

Rash developed all over body that is similar to the rash Kawasaki syndrome kids get.  Was taken to emergency room where I was given iv steroids and epi. 10-15 mins after my breathing was back to baseline and throat felt better. I have never had any trouble breathing or any allergic reactions to anything in the past.

                                                About 12 hours after the vaccine, I started having arm pain at the site and low back pain which is very unusual for me as well as a dull headache which is not uncommon for me. Around midnight I woke up with chills, and severe arthralgias in all joints down to the toes and fingers, and deep, boring pain in my long bones and neck. My skin and fingertips felt like they were burning. I was nauseated but didn?t vomit. I was up all night because I couldn?t find a position I wasn?t in pain in. Tmax 100.3 F. Took a gram of Tylenol with improvement of symptoms. Felt better in AM but when Tylenol wore off around 9 am, had another wave of the same pain all over. Tylenol improved. Felt almost completely normal by 4 pm with the exception of some lingering low back pain (central not muscular).

                                                Approximately 12/13 hours post-vaccine dose #2 I was woken from my sleep with severe body aches. Extremely uncomfortable, from neck to back to calves, without improvement with Tylenol or ibuprofen, causing me to be unable to sleep. Around hour 20 post-vaccine, I started to get chills. It wasn?t just feeling cold or shivering, it was full body convulsions that lasted approximately 15 minutes.  I became nauseas and dizzy after that for about an hour, unable to stand or walk anywhere. The severe body aches continued, with no improvement from Tylenol or ibuprofen or heating pad. Aches resolved around hour 30 post-vaccine and the only symptom left was pain at the injection site.

This continued for about 30 minutes, I was debating going to the ED for the SOB. I then became really cold and had such bad shaking I couldn&#39;t hold anything for another 20 minutes.  Today I continue to have some tingling. All of this on top of the expected side effects.

By that point I was in bed almost all day with muscle pain in my torso (back, ribs, abdominal). I also had a severe migrane and a fever that at it&#39;s worst was 102.3. It was brought down quickly with ice to 100.7 within an hour. After about 8 hours it subsided for about 20 minutes before the torso pain and migrane came back. The fever stayed around 100.3 when I last checked. I went back to sleep for the rest of the night and felt fine in the morning with no fever.

Almost immediatly afte,r I got a sharp shooting inside nerve pain from shoulder under the armpit area down to my wrist area.  The pain was bad and constant until 1/14, aleve, ibuprophen or tylenol made it better.  On 1/10-1/11 the pain was the worst and woke me up from sleeping it hurt so bad with a pain level of  a 8/10.  The pain was more nerve pain over muscle pain and the intensity never changed  whether I moved or not.

I didn&#39;t call my doctor at that point because I read that it was a side effect. Dull/always there pain at that point. On the 15th, shooting pains - this lasted two days. It started getting better again by the 17th. It was resolved by the 18th.  14-17th - Swelling that I could feel and see and that also went back to normal by the 18th. It was just tender to touch for a little while after that....after it didn&#39;t hurt to move I didn&#39;t pay as much attention to it. I was able to go to work but I had to modify what I could do at work. I could not do my normal swimming exercise until that next week.

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after receiving my vaccine I felt warmth down injected arm. Approximately 20 minutes post injection, I experienced a drop in my blood pressure, heaviness in my legs (like walking through cement), and ringing in my ears. At approximately 12:30-12:45pm I experienced mental fog (I couldn&#39;t remember how to turn off my windshield wipers), increased heart rate, rapid onset of feelings of panic, minor shortness of breath, neck/clavicle tightness on side of injection, and sweating. Between approximately 1:30pm and 2:30pm I continued to have extreme sweating, as well as: increased pulse, fatigue, dry throat, muscle weakness/shakiness, brain fog, and headache. At approximately 3:30 I hit my knee on the bed frame and felt like the wind had been knocked out of me and immediately had a severe drop in blood pressure that felt similar to a vasovagal event. I called the vaccine clinic and my symptoms were noted and I was told to seek help if my symptoms worsened or I felt like I was going to pass out. My symptoms have not worsened but I am still experiencing extreme sweating along with shivering, shakiness, blood pressure changes with movement (orthostatic hypotension), and fatigue - time is currently 5:50pm

                                                When I woke up in the morning I was sweaty and cold even though I had blankets on. I had body aches, joint pain, nausea, extreme fatigue to the point that I pretty much sat on my couch all day long zoning out, chills, and fever. Also pain at the injection site and couldn?t lift my arm.  The next day I was fatigued and my arm was sore at the injection site.

I don&#39;t like to take medicine and I had no choice but take Panadol every 4 hours and apply ice to treat the muscular pain. I went to emergency and was told that I had an urine infection  (which is very rare on me), and was treated with antibiotics.   With the second dose I took acetaminophen 500 mg befor the vaccine, that helped because the day of the shot I didn&#39;t have pain, but the numbness was like if I couldn&#39;t connect my body to the brain. Couldn&#39;t talk properly, sleep 2 hours during the day, is funny that I applied ice on the injection site (Me thinking) but the pain doesn&#39;t go away, when the ice melts I notice that I applied the ice on the wrong arm. That&#39;s what I mean when I talk about numbness. Fever of 39.8F and Chills even today . Some cough and dry throat (Dryness can be because I&#39;m a teacher) and constant tiredness.

                                                minutes after administration, patient reports head feeling strange, so I asked her to remain seated so I can observe her prior to getting up to the observation room. Then she reports feeling nauseous and weak. I asked her what medical conditions she has and she told me she is diabetic and has kidney disease. I asked if she ate breakfast, she said she did not, only had something small before heading out in the morning. I gave her am ice pack to place on the back of her neck which helped relieve her symptoms of head feeling strange and the nausea. Once nurse arrived, we checked her pulse and blood pressure, at this time it was around 11:45 am and her pulse was low at 64 and blood pressure at 94/60, which patient states is her baseline normal blood pressure. We opened the windows so she could get some fresh air since the room was very hot and shortly after we took her pulse and blood pressure she seemed to be feeling better. By 11:50 am the ambulance arrived and paramedics asked if she would like to be taken to the hospital to get checked, she said even though she is feeling a lot better, she would prefer to go just in case.

                                                Severe brain fog, and has continued from within 24 hours on and off.  Today is day 6 and it is still continuing on and off. Makes working as a teacher extremely difficult. Feel like I can&#39;t think clearly, can&#39;t think deeply or critically, and feel like I am &#34;out of it&#34; or not speaking as coherently.  Can&#39;t find words or organize my thoughts properly. Have also had some light headed and dizziness a few times since then.

Following morning, there was sharp pain at the injection site and I was unable to lift my arm at all. In the evening I can lift it half way. Still experiencing 32 hours later: headache and brain fog and dissociated feeling, fatigue, and body aches. Neck remains stiff. Never had any adverse or allergic reaction to anything before and didn&#39;t become fully aware that something wasn&#39;t right until after I left the facility yesterday.

                                                In the week following my vaccination, I presented no symptoms. After day 7, I developed soreness/tenderness in my left armpit and a series of neurological symptoms that are very concerning including depression, anxiety, insomnia (accompanied with heart racing, sweating, tingling in extremities, obsessive thoughts etc). Although, I have had sleep issues during the course of the pandemic, I do not deal with daily anxiety. I very rarely have to turn to any medication and especially have not had any  anxiety symptoms or sleep issues recently.   I do not believe the CDC has commented on the connection between vaccine safety and any relationship between vaccine immune response and neuropsychiatric disorders. Or how antibodies produced via vaccine react to other proteins.  My daily activities have been significantly impacted over the course of this week.  I would appreciate learning if there is possible cross-reactivity and if that has presented in other adults.

I felt actually cold, but hot to touch. My blood pressure would be very low about to passout to very high. I had to stay laying down to keep blood pressure normal. For my skin burning I started taking benadryl right away, since this didn&#39;t help I was prescribed Clobetasol Propionate external steroid, to add zyrtec and continue benadryl as needed. My blood pressure normalized from rest and my skin is no longer burning, it went back down to an itch, and is gone now, unless I introduce cold or heat  to my skin I then start burning itching all over and have to take benadryl. Before this delayed long lasting allergic reaction, immediately after the vaccine I had these symptoms; Back of Head buzz, Headache, Hot Flashes, Chills, Mental confusion , Rage/crying/tight chest(panic attack), went away with fresh air, Fever, Joint pain, Itchy face. The symptoms that lasted the full 72 hrs were on and off fever, elevated blood pressure, chills, and my burning/skin.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine  Shot was given at 4:05 pm Wed 3/31. From then, injection site pain (by touch only) and arm stiffness increased that night. Thurs 4/1, pain and stiffness were worse, and it was difficult to completely move my left arm even though I was massaging the site and stretching my arm periodically. By Friday morning, the stiffness completely went away and it barely hurts to touch my left arm. When I went to go to sleep around 2 am Thurs, I had a fast heartbeat while laying down. I knew that was a possible severe allergic reaction but I had no other symptoms at the time other than the injection site pain and stiffness, so I went to bed. On Thurs morning around 11 am, I woke up in a sweat, so I&#39;m not sure if I had a fever at all during the night. I did not think to check my temperature until that night around 10 pm. At that time it was 99.9 F. My head was fuzzy throughout the day similar to the flu, so it is possible that I had a low fewer or slightly elevated temperature. I do not have fever as of Friday morning when I woke up. My head is also not fuzzy anymore. Starting on Thurs morning and continuing throughout the day, I was extremely tired. I had two events to go to but did not have enough energy to get anything else done. This may have included slight muscle pain. This all disappeared by Friday morning when I woke up.

                                                About 1 to 2 minutes after injection, I got extremely lightheaded and dizzy. I felt myself becoming hot and over the next few minutes became extremely sweaty. There was a loud ringing / buzzing in my ears. I sat down in the chair near the pharmacy for observation and the lightheadedness, mental fogginess, ear ringing and excessive physical sweating lasted for approximately 10 - 12 minutes post injection.

                                                Approximately one week after injection I began to experience intense hot flashes. Hot flashes include tachycardia, excessive perspiration, reddening of skin, intense warmth of skin and were followed by chills and my color flushing. Also experiencing night sweats that results in insomnia. This has caused a general interruption to my daily life. The hot flashes continued to get more intense over the past several weeks. I have not had my menstrual cycle since my second injection.

The nauseating feeling got so bad I began to vomit.  Then I took my mother prescription strength 12.5mg of nausea medication.  I vomited a little more after the medication, then I started dry heaving,  A few minutes later the nausea went away, but I now had stomach that was not caused by my vomiting. However the prescription strength medication took my stomach pain away.

I?ve been taking NSAIDs to help with the inflammation and pain and soaking in salt baths but it is mildly helpful. I felt this pain about 5 minutes after the vaccine and it has not gone away since.

                                                In the evening of the 5th I felt like I had the flu (malaise, fatigue, chills, headache, nausea  &#43; mild arm pain). Went to bed early. Next day didn&#39;t feel well in the morning but continued daily responsibilities. By Tuesday the initial symptoms had gone. Felt almost normal in AM. By Tuesday evening I had a new throng of symptoms that were different than the initial ones. My left breast and underarm were extremely sore. I was having trouble breathing (it felt labored, and like I needed to focus to be able to breath, full breaths were impossible, never felt like I was getting enough oxygen), general feeling of just being very unwell, dizzy, weak, clumsy, exhaustion/fatigue, on-off headache, tingling in limbs, unusual heart rate fluctuation with activity and high sometimes when resting without effort, trouble concentrating, very shakey. I have been resting but it has continued. Lots of sleep and fluids.

                                                Left eye started twitching a day or two after the first dose. Seems to correspond with headache, issues thinking, reading, etc. My left eye has been twitching every day since the first dose. I have a headache bad headache every day, and the headache seems to be worse on the left side of my head since the vaccine (although it&#39;s all over) Also, I have post covid syndrome, so I have a lot of other symptoms (that I am seeing specialists to diagnose and fix), and the vaccine seemed to make them all much worse after the first dose.

                                                48 hours after the vaccine my mouth began itching after eating. It happened during breakfast and lunch this day, and then the next morning at breakfast, which is when I became worried. My throat began feeling tight, felt like it had mucus in it and I needed to clear it. My mouth was itching and my tongue felt tingly. Four days after the vaccine my tongue started to swell so I called my doctor.   I saw him the Tuesday, 3/2 after the vaccine and he said my thyroid was swollen and felt I was having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He did an allergy panel and lab work for my thyroid, all tests came back within normal limits. He referred me to an allergist and said to take benadryl every six hours. A few days later my  bottom lip started to swell and my tongue ached. I was also having intermittent chest pains for about five weeks. Then my lymph nodes in my throat started throbbing.   I saw the allergist on 4/6 and he advised to cancel the second dose. He did lab work to check for autoimmune disorders and inflammation but tests came back normal. He advised on 4/19 to take allegra two times a day for three weeks and we will follow up.   Ongoing symptoms are mouth itching after eating, tingling in throat, and itching on throat and neck, and on and off swelling of my bottom lip. I have also experienced lightheadedness and ocular migraines.

Within seconds, my body temperature increased, my limbs started to tingle, and my forehead began dripping with sweat.  I called the facility worker in the area and asked &#34;Is it normal to get this hot and tingly?&#34;. As my body seemed to lose strength, she told me to put my head down and flagged down a paramedic.  I was wheeled to the back (as symptoms were increasing), and was laid on a bed. They measured my vitals and provided me with water. I was so weak that I couldn&#39;t open my eyes and was told that I was clinically hyperventilating (I personally felt calm prior to laying on the bed).  I was monitored for about 45 minutes until I was picked up by a family member. I returned home and slept for almost 18 hours straight, and could hardly move for almost 3 days (as I continued to sleep the following day).

It is now 10:50 AM and I&#39;m starting to feel itchy again.

Prevented me from sleeping for more than 2-3 hours at a time for 3-4 days. Also prevented me from resting my arm at my side comfortably for 3-4 days. Today (4/23/2021) the lymph node is still enlarged, closer to the size of a grape.

After getting home I started getting chills and fever.   4/16  Chills, fever, muscle aches the whole day and dizzy when standing. But it was all manageable.   4/17  Chills, fever, muscle aches the whole day and dizzy when standing, nauseas, head ache. Not manageable   I did no physical activities that day as well, my fitness watched  showed my heart rate was up &#43;10 beats. This lasted for about a week as well as my stress levels and body energy depleting faster then usual.  My period cycle happened earlier  then what is what I consider normal. That was worrying to me. I am a very active person I bike a lot and hike a lot. After taking an Tylenol to try and get my self together. Biking was very difficult for the same amount of miles I usually have no problem biking.

                                                Beginning around midnight the evening after getting the 2nd COVID vaccine, I started having severe body aches and chills/signs of fever. After taking Tylenol around 3am, I was able to sleep until about 8am, when I woke up covered in sweat and shivering. I checked my temperature at that time, with a reading of 100.5°F. I was too sore to get out of bed (body aches, headache) and was extremely light headed when I tried to sit up, so I had no choice but to call off my scheduled work shift for the day. Throughout the morning, my fever continued to increase despite taking Tylenol regularly (2-3 tablets every 4 hours), up to 101.8°F. I was too nauseous to eat, or really to even drink much, despite several spells of feverish sweating followed by chills/uncontrollable shivering. I stayed in bed nearly all day miserable and all but completely incapacitated. I took Xyrem at night (as normal, I take this every night) so was able to sleep most of the night, but woke once again drenched in sweat and shivering, with painful bodyaches and a headache. I took more Tylenol, but was once again forced to call off work in the morning due to my temperature still being high, 101.5°F, and not feeling well enough to stand or work. The body aches, headache, and nausea have continued throughout today as well (two full days after receiving the 2nd vaccine... No adverse reaction to the 1st vaccine)

So far its been 7 days of it. I had an eye exam and they said everything looked good and normal and my glasses prescription had not changed. But they have seen about 5 other patients with similar symptoms after they had got their vaccines too. They are wondering if its linked to the vaccine, I have not had eye issues or symptoms like this ever!  My eye Dr. had called another local eye doctor in our area asking if he had also seen this happening too and he said yes, and is taking 2-3 months to resolve.

She was given water and a cold compress, and reported she felt better, but then vomited a small amount of emesis 15 minutes later (07Apr2021). She was evaluated by the physician who determined it was an emotional response to the vaccine. The patient had reported she was extremely anxious about receiving the vaccine (07Apr2021), and had fainted when she tried to give blood, and hadn&#39;t eaten anything that day. After sitting for 45 minutes, the doctor felt comfortable letting her leave. A call was placed to the patient at 4:00 pm to check on her. She reported she felt fine. The patient received no treatment for the event vomited, while therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the other reported events. It was unknown if patient was tested for Covid post vaccination. The patient recovered on an unspecified date in 2021 from the events reported.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available and a close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events of syncope.

I took ibuprofen to alleviate the pain and my headache came back later that afternoon. I started feeling nauseous in the evening before going to bed.  The following morning (5/19/2021), I woke up with the same headache and was feeling nauseous still. After about an hour, I got out of bed thinking I was going to vomit. I was sitting on the bathroom floor and became lightheaded and my stomach started hurting worse. I got tunnel vision  and passed out. My boyfriend was there and said that I started seizing for about 10 seconds and was cold. He said that I started to urinate and then regained consciousness after about 15 seconds. He called 911. I felt shaky and dizzy for about 15 min after. The ambulance showed up. My blood pressure was low, blood sugar was good, heart rate was good. I was able to walk to the ambulance and they took me to the ER. They gave me anti-nausea medication and fluids via IV. At the hospital, I received a CT scan for my head and another to check for clots in my lungs. Both tests came back negative. I had chills and body aches and was extremely tired.  After about a couple of hours, I started feeling nauseous again and they gave me more anti-nausea medication. They did a urine sample and said I had a UTI, but other than that there was nothing wrong. They referred me to a neurologist to follow up about the seizure. They prescribed an antibiotic for the UTI and anti-nausea medication and I was discharged after about 5 hours.

                                                I started to have tunnel vision and dizzy spells. I felt like I was losing focus and had bad headaches. I went to the ER. I had a CT and blood work done. I had a lumbar puncture and the opening pressure was 29, which was above normal. I needed a blood patch four days later because I had a migraine that would not cease. On June 1st, I got another Lumbar puncture because I was having the same symptoms.

                                                Three hours after my first shot I felt extremely tired and had a strange headache.  For the next 3-4 days, I felt the same.  I was achey all over my body and had chills but no fever.  I didn?t feel terrible, just off.   by Monday, I felt slightly better.  Sunday I started feeling uncomfortable in my legs (achey/crampy), but no different than I felt the first few days, just a little more achey in my legs.  My upper thighs also started itchy my, but nothing out of control.  Tuesday was when my legs really started bothering me.  My shins/calves were sore (almost like shin splint pain), along with my right ankle.  Today is Thursday 6-3-21, and my shins are really sore. I can?t tell it it feels like my shin bones or just my shins in general. My knees are also really bothering me.  It almost feels like restless leg syndrome. Sitting down they bother me, but standing/walking feels like I just ran 6 miles/worked out. I have a doctors appointment today (4-3-21).  I was really on social media that a lot of people were having the same symptoms in their legs/ankles, specifically the right leg.

Approximately 7-8 days after my vaccination, my left armpit started feeling sore. This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

This A 30-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EH9899), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 22Dec2020 09:00 for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included reaction to pork, porsine and/or if she ever was exposed to exposed to heparin. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced syncope (medically significant), dizziness (medically significant), feeling faint; like going to pass out now and then (medically significant), overall achiness, severe headaches, fever. The outcome of the events syncope, dizziness, feeling faint; like going to pass out now was recovering and outcome of overall achiness, severe headaches, fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The patient ask: are there any animal products, pork gelatin or a lipid form of that contain in the vaccine?   The events were described as follows: She experienced a significant amount of syncope and dizziness, for greater than 4 or 5 days post-receiving the vaccination. Also feeling faint like she is going to pass out every now and then. Has a more important question, wondering along with the doctors if one of the ingredients may have an animal product, like pork gelatin or a lipid form of that. It looks like one of the ingredients may have an animal cell lipid and was wondering if she was having a reaction to that. Declines to provide primary care provider details. States she received this first dose at occupational health in her workplace. Received the vaccine on the 22Dec2020 at 9am. 24 hours post vaccination, 1 day after, the syncope, dizziness, feeling faint started. Also the other symptoms, overall achiness, severe headaches, and fever were also experienced, but they stopped after that 24 hours. Those were expected since it was listed as side effects that popped up, so she expected those and they stopped after 24 hours. The syncope, dizziness, and faint feeling are not any worse and are very slowly improving, but she still has it and had to call out of work today because of it. That&#39;s consistent. Mentions it takes her a while to get down the stairs when getting product details for the COVID-19 vaccine. Unable to provide the vaccine NDC or expiry, or dose. Did not have any other vaccines at time of this one and none 4 weeks prior. Had to call a (company withheld) doctor and has to go to occupational health tomorrow to be seen. Declines having COVID virus. No further details provided.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events syncope and dizziness are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

A 30-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EH9899, via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included history of reaction to mango (like face swelling and just a rash) and then gluten intolerant: if she eat it she doesn&#39;t have difficulty breathing. She never had problems with asthma in the past. The patient previously took BENADRYL for shortened like when she had a reaction with mango many years ago.

                                                Over night on 01/06 I experienced chills and was very cold. At times I was extremely warm. The next morning I had a fever and my joints, muscles, head and even my skin was hurting. My fever never came down to normal even with advil and I was extremely tired all day.  The arm that had the injection is extremely sore with splotches of red (which is expected.) Today, 01/08, I woke up in a pool of sweat. My head is still hurting and I still have a fever. My arm is still sore but my skin and joint pain has improved. I am still very cold. Have been wearing my winter coat in my house even with the heat and the fire place on. I had to take the last two days off work.

                                                Wednesday 1/13/2021 I woke up feeling like nauseous, then later in the day I started to get itchy in my lower body that was coming and going (I believe I still had some allegra d in my system). On  Thursday 01/14/2021 by noon time the itching had become extreme and unbearable all over my body and felt like my skin was crawling/burning, my chest and parts of my arms were really red . I also developed a lump in my throat that kept getting bigger and felt itchy and couldn&#39;t stop clearing my throat. Around 3pm I took 10ml of Claritin. The Claritin had not really helped however the redness had gone down a lot and by 4:30 I was miserable. Informed by a provider I work with to go to urgent care. I arrived at urgent care at about 5:10 where I was treated for an allergy reaction. I was given  0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus 500mL, Methylprednisolone sod suc(PF) (SOLU-Medrol) 125mg Intravenous, Famotidine (Pepcid) 20mg/2ml injection 20mg intravenous, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50mg/ml injection 25mg intravenous.  The itching subsided within 30 minutes, the itchy throat/ lump was still present but was not getting worse and slowly improving.   I was discharged home and was told to pick up famotidine 20mg, otc benadryl and prednisone 50mg to take for 5 days.  got home a little after 7 and was able to eat dinner, let dog out, shower, rest  before going to bed. I did take another 10 ml of Benadryl at 10:30. Woke up without any itchy skin at 5:45 and was able to return to work this morning. I still have a slight itchy throat but it is tolerable. I took allegra d and famotidine this morning. I am holding off on the prednisone because of the immune response to vaccines from steroids. I don&#39;t want to lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine.

                                                On Monday, January 25, 2021, at 11:40am I received the second dose of a series for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Over the course of the rest of that day, I began to develop a headache and mild neck soreness. That night, I slept poorly. When I awoke just before 5:00am the next day, Tuesday, January 26, I did not feel well. I was experiencing headache, malaise, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, and low-grade fever. I called my supervisor around 5:30am that day and we decided it was best that I stay home to recuperate. Throughout the day, I mostly rested and slept, took Tylenol, and began to feel better in the mid-afternoon. I did call and leave a voicemail for hospital Employee Health around 1:30pm on Tuesday the 26th, but did not hear back. Today, Wednesday, January 27, I am feeling much better, and well enough to come to work.

About 6 hrs after vaccine, I felt soreness at the injection site, very similar to the flu vaccine. About 12Hours post vaccine, my arm was so sore I could not lift it. That night I took two Tylenol and had to wrap my arm in a heating pad. I woke up around 3am that following morning with a fever of 104 F. I was so dizzy from the high fever. I felt extremely nauseated. My body ached mostly in my legs and lower back. It hurt to sit on the toilet, to put on clothes. My Fevers happened at night time ranging from 102-104F for 4 days. My injection site soreness lasted for 7 days. Body aches lasted around 2-3 days. Dizziness subsided after my fever broke, but was replaced with a severe headache lasting 2 days.

                                                Started feeling poorly around 9:30 PM on 1/30. By 10 PM I had fever, chills, anxiety, dry mouth, headache, body aches, and I had a hard time staying asleep. I rarely wake during the night to pee but I woke 4 times for water and to use the bathroom.  I woke more than that, but 4 times specifically for that reason. My fever broke the next morning (1/31) around 6 or 7 AM. I still had a mild headache and felt tired and not like myself. I took ibuprofen and the headache subsided. Around 2 the headache came back as did the anxiety. I am not a typically anxious person. I took another dose of ibuprofen. Around 10 that evening (1/31) I felt back to normal.

Roughly 5 minutes after, I raised my hand in the waiting for for the male nurse to come over due to symptoms of dizziness, loss of consciousness, ?blacking out?, and confusion. The male nurse came over and started seeing signs of profuse sweating as water began dripping from all over my body. 5 minutes after that I started heaving and gasping for air unaroused next to the nurse as he took my blood pressure. Blood pressure dropped to 85/76. I started breathing heavy, sweating uncontrollably and couldn?t talk or stand. I remained hardly alert and almost passed out due to weakness.

                                                Incredible arm/shoulder/lymph node pain starting 10 hours post-vaccination lasting about 60 hours. About 12 hours post-vaccine, uncontrollable muscle spasms began and lasted approximately 2 hours. In this time, arm/shoulder/lymph node were extremely swollen. During the muscle spasms, I experienced my first or two &#34;attacks&#34;.  Speaking and thinking became difficult - at times I felt as though I was trapped in my own head unable to speak or move how I wanted (motor function was possible but sluggish and requiring assistance to become ambulatory). The worst of this lasted about 4 hours, though my brain remained some level of &#34;foggy&#34; 48 hours post-vaccination. 1-2 hours into these neurological issues, I lost the ability to feel throughout my whole body. I could tell there was a sensation on my skin, but I could not tell if it was hot/cold/pain/pressure.  I could not feel if I was swallowing, drinking water, or breathing, though I could move enough to perform these activities.  Vision was hazy during these attacks and for a while after. The worst of all these effects lasted 3-4 hours. It then took about 5-6 hours to regain all feeling, though my brain was still foggy/hazy. Heavy swelling lasted several hours, then became moderate swelling, and after 48 hours, there was little to no swelling. About 22 hours post-vaccination, I had another one of these &#34;attacks&#34;, not including the muscle spasms. This second attack was identical to the first in every way, except it was slightly less severe.  Recuperation time was again 5-6 hours. It is currently about 70 hours post-vaccination and most symptoms except moderate arm soreness are gone. During both attacks, BP and temperature were normal, heart rate slightly elevated (80-85 bpm).  Other non-severe effects included fatigue,  slight chills/flush.

A 30-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included steel rods in back from 2006 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was vaccinated and felt fine. She experienced arm soreness on 20Jan2021 originally. Then today, it was so bizarre, about an hour and a half ago, her back started to itch on 22Jan2021. There was irritation. She checked in the mirror, and her back was red on 22Jan2021. She was wondering if this was a reaction from the vaccine. She was getting nervous. A medical student gave her the vaccine. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. Twenty minutes after getting the vaccine, she noticed the arm soreness. It was worse yesterday, but today she thinks it is the same or maybe a little better. The irritation on her back seems a little better since she first noticed it. The outcome of the events back felt itchy and pinkish red and irritation was recovering. The outcome of the event arm soreness was not recovered. The outcome of the event nervous was unknown.

                                                The night after the second dose, I had difficulty sleeping, but that was not particularly unusual. By about 10 the next morning, I started getting joint aches in bilateral hip joints and sacral joints. By 10:30 I suddenly found myself lightheaded and had to sit down so as to not faint. Of note, I had just previous to this lightheadedness donned full PPE to work with a patient (gown, gloves, face shield, N95), not having yet worn it that morning. I did not faint, and was able to sit down for 15 minutes without a mask and drink ice water, but I was not safe to work with my patients (as a physical therapist). I left work and went home to sleep. I did not have a fever or chills. After a 3 hour nap, all of my symptoms resolved.  Additional information: I am pregnant, was 16 weeks pregnant at the time. All fetal imaging prior to the first vaccine and after the second vaccine have showed normal healthy development. I am due July 3

                                                A few hours after the vaccine I started feeling fatigued and having chills.  I was so tired and sleepy I slept almost all day for the first 48 hrs after. Developed fever between 100.5-101 which lasted about 18hrs which did require me to have to call into work the following day.  2/3 I developed swelling and pain in the lymph nodes under my right arm and breast.  The swelling subsided within 4days but I still have some tenderness to date.  I took tylenol and ibuprophen for the first 48 hours to help with all the symptoms.

Within 12 hours, the itching got much worse and my three toes started to swell. The itch was bad enough that I couldn&#39;t sleep, but I wouldn&#39;t say there was much pain. I noticed a cut in between a couple of my toes and a small blister. I thought it was Athlete&#39;s foot until a colleague told me about COVID toes. I&#39;ve been taking Benadyrl and using athlete&#39;s foot products (Lotrimin) that have been helping with the itch. Going on day 5 with some reduction in swelling.

                                                I am unsure if this is related but thought I should report it because it was highly unusual, but: My menstrual cycle began at around 12:30am on 03-19-2021. There was some bad cramping as is usual for me in the first 24 hours. I was able to function normally enough until about 9P (on 03-19-2021),  at which time I began experiencing debilitating cramps and muscle spasms that made it difficult to walk or move. I felt lightheaded and like I was going to pass out (which has never happened related to my period before). I got in bed and this persisted until moving at all brought me to tears. I have not been in this much pain from cramps and muscle spasms in over a decade.  And never this prolonged and intense. I was unable to sleep until about 4:30am, managed to sleep for a few hours, had to see, and now I&#39;m here filling this out before I attempt to go back to sleep.  My pain at the moment is high, but similar to what a normal &#34;first day of cycle and it&#39;s bad&#34; day would be for me.  Before this, though, was 8 hours straight of some of the worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt in my life.  I felt it important for me to make a formal report in the event that adverse effects surrounding menstruation were common for others and in case this does not subside. I am thinking it will like the initial muscle aches after receiving the shot.

                                                I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. After 10-15 minutes from receiving the vaccine, my face got itchy but it was mild so I left after 25 minutes of waiting. Over the next hour the itching got more noticeable (no rash) and my throat felt slightly swollen, although I had no difficulty breathing or talking. I called a pharmacy that advised I take Benadryl, which helped. The next morning my face was still itching and it felt like there was a lump in my throat. I went to urgent care and received a steroid shot and prescription for Atarax, although the pharmacy was closed, so I just ended up taking more Benadryl. Today, 2 days after the vaccine, my face no longer itches and my throat feels normal. Just feel moderately fatigued, although I think that is a normal side effect.

                                                I lost my memory on Friday, March 26, at 10 pm. I do not remember what I did Wednesday-Friday, and the information I am providing is what my family and boyfriend have informed me about. I received my second Pfizer dose on Wednesday, March 24, at 11 am on my right arm. At 8 pm, I had a horrible migraine, body ache, and 101 fever. On Thursday, the fever was gone, and I just had a body ache and severe headache. On Friday, the body ache was gone, but the migraine was still present. I drove to my boyfriend&#39;s house at 8 pm. At 10 pm I informed my boyfriend that for 5 minutes I forgot where I was and that I forgot his room. He told me that I complained of a pounding headache that felt like it took over my whole head.  My boyfriend said to me that I had body chills and that my head was warm, but my hands were freezing. The last thing I said to him before I lost my memory was that the headache was getting worse.   A minute later, I started panicking because I forgot my birthday and my name. He said that I had brain fog and that I lost my memory. I was in a dream-like state and looked confused. I thought I was ten years old and could not remember certain family members or who I was. I was informed I lost my memory for 12 hours. On Saturday, I woke up and did not recall what happened the previous night. It felt like I woke up from a long sleep. My headache was still present, and my head felt foggy. I have tried to remember those three days, and when I try, the headaches become severe.  I reported this to my doctor, and she informed me that I need to report this since the same thing happened to my mother. She received the first Pfizer vaccine on March 3, at 11 am, and on March 7, she lost her memory. The only difference between my mother and I is that she lost her memory after the first vaccine, and  I lost my memory after the second vaccine.  I lost my memory for 12 hours, and for her, it was 24 hours. We both lost three days, and when we try to remember, we get headaches.

For the first 2 days it was on and off and then for the last almost 48 hours it&#39;s been constant. I had to go to the emergency room for pain management but I came back home immediately.

The outcome of the event Pain was not recovered and for rest events outcome was unknown.

                                                Starting less than 24 hours after the second vaccine, I began having severe joint pain in hands, wrists, ankles, knees and elbows. Over the next couple days the severe pain improved however some mild joint pain persisted in the wrists, ankles and hands. Over the next 1.5 weeks the joint pain progressively worsened to the point that I could barely use my hands or sleep at night. I initially thought that the joint symptoms were still just vaccine side effects but since things were still getting worse 2 week post-vaccination I saw a rheumatologist on 1/20/21. He believed that my presentation was consistent with underlying inflammatory arthritis rather than vaccine side effects. Over the next couple weeks I had a thorough rheumatologic workup including extensive lab work and imaging, and was ultimately diagnosed with inflammatory polyarthritis with enthesitis with my triggering event for the initial arthritis flare being the second Covid vaccine. I was initially started on high dose prednisone (up to 60mg) and methotrexate with an upward titration but was unable to tolerate the medication due to side effects and lack of improvement in the enthesitis and have since started cimzia with plan to taper off of methotrexate. It is now 2 months since my initial diagnosis and my arthritis is controlled but I continue to have troublesome enthesitis in my hands and elbow.

                                                After receiving the vaccine I started to get hives 2.5 hours after (10:30 AM). The hives which turned to welts appeared all over my body, behind my knees, elbows, medial elbows, feet under and on top, wrists, hands, inner thighs, knees, shoulders, and armpits. I went to a walk in clinic and they did not give me a steroid injection because it might interfere with the vaccine&#39;s efficacy. I was miserable and they just told me to take Benadryl and Allegra which did nothing for me. I then emailed my primary car doctor on 04/04/2021 which was a holiday and she got back to me immediately and scheduled me an appointment for today 04/05/2021. She prescribed me prednisone and hydroxyzine.  I am currently  waiting to see improvement.

                                                I woke up around 2am and although I was covered in blankets, I was freezing. I also had a fever, was nauseated, had joint and muscle pain, and my heart was racing. My heart rate was 154, so I started doing breathing techniques and got it down to 118, then 111. I was so fatigued that I just fell asleep. Called out of work and slept most of the day next day. I stayed in bed on Sunday. I went to work Monday and then Tuesday, I was sitting at the computer and my heart started to race and pound again. My pulse ox was 132. My BP was 154/92. I had tingling down my arm and I felt weak. I was taken to the ER and they did an EKG and some labs. I saw a doctor around 6:20 that evening and I was discharged around 7 with instructions to follow up with a cardiologist two days later. The first one didn&#39;t even get close to me, so I ended up seeing Dr. . He put an event monitor on me.  He instructed me to come back if this continues or gets worse and he would put me on meds. I&#39;ve never had heart issues before and I&#39;m not sure if everything has been resolved.

It was extremely unusual for me and it wasn&#39;t triggered by anything that I could determine. It lasted for about an hour, hour and a half before going away. Before that, I was feeling low grade general anxiety for several hours.

                                                Within less than an hour receiving the vaccime, I started feeling sharp stabbing pain on my right side below my breast. It was for a short period at first then stopped. However, in the middle of the night I was in so much pain that got worse when I take deep breaths. I also experienced shortness of breath and difficulty breathing especially when I make efforts like walking up stairs. On the afternoon of Friday April 9th, I went to Health center to get checked after reporting my symptoms. The doctor said that it could be an inflammation of the lungs so recommended rest and taking Ibuprofen to help with the pain and if symptoms persist, I go get checked again. I felt slightly better on Saturday but from Sunday evening, the pain came back and got worse Monday night. I couldn&#39;t sleep on my back or sides, heavy breathing, shortness of breath I felt all night. I went to the hospital physician ordered different X-rays that came back negative. Her diagnosis is that I have inflammation of the lungs but not sure what the cause is. She prescribed predniSONE.

I received the vaccine Saturday, I get fine the day of, and the next day I ached all over, but had no fever...itched a little, but didn?t think anything of it. Day 3 I woke up at 3 in the morning excessively itching. Rashes and small bumps all over my body. The rashes aren?t terrible, but definitely noticeable. I?d like a professional opinion on the matter. I remember when researching metoprolol back when I first started taking it, one of the medications it said not to take was Benadryl.

Injection site sore from arm to shoulder and into neck, unable to lift arm for 3 days. 3hrs after vaccine: developed shortness of breath that is only getting better after day 6, Needed to use asthma inhaler several times. Prior to vaccine, had not needed inhaler for many months. Day after vaccine: developed severe migraine, vomited. Had persistent brain fog and made mistakes at work, didn?t start to get better until day 6 post-vaccine. Brain fog and shortness or breath have not fully resolved but do seem better today and more transient rather than constant (day 6 post vaccine). Side effects persisted far longer than expected, and were more severe than my peers, so I feel like it is notable.

I felt hot but had the chills. I felt nauseous and had a headache. My arm was very tender near the injection site. These symptoms continued all day Thursday. I had a fever between 99.7 and 101.3 all day. The aches in my body were the most painful from about 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM.  I felt significantly better when I woke up on Friday morning. I no longer had a fever, the aches had subsided. I still had a small headache, and felt a lot of brain fog.  I did not take any medication and did not contact a doctor.

                                                Approximately one hour after the injection, I had intense pain in my arm, and it spread up into my shoulder and neck. It slowly got more painful as time went on, and I could not raise my arm. About eight hours after the injection, the left side of my face started to feel tingly and numb, similar to the feeling in your face after a shot in your mouth at the dentist. I could not sleep on the left side of my body that night, due to the pain. After a restless night of sleep, I woke up feeling very stiff and sore. The numbness in my face had gone, but the pain in my arm and neck remained. It slowly subsided as the day went on. I did not take any medication or contact a doctor.

Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot umber: EN6199) received at age 30 years, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 04Mar2021 10:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. After the patient received the second dose on 01Apr2021, the patient waited the full 15 minutes in the waiting are before leaving. The patient did not notice any adverse effects while waiting. However, it was reported that about 100 feet from the exit, at 14:45, &#34;I was in a car accident. I believe I fainted or got disoriented because I do not remember anything for a short period from the time I left the parking lot until the moment of impact with an oncoming truck.&#34; The events resulted to emergency room, physician&#39;s office, and acupuncture visits. Treatment for the events was reported as &#34;emergency room visit, acupuncture visit&#34;. The patient was recovering from the events.

This may not sound serious in clinical terms, but it felt like my brain broke and I could not function. It was terrifying. Until my doctor let me know that other people had experienced this same thing. I thought I was having major chemical imbalance issues and was worried I was having a serious mental breakdown.

They spasms range from large jerking of my neck, head, spine, and legs, to small consist contractions and fluttering twitches all throughout my body. I am also experiencing rapid heart beats and massive amounts of anxiety as well as painful electric like shocks going through my feet and legs.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This is the second of two reports of the same patient receiving the second dose of BNT162B2.  A 30-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 17Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose (at the age of 30) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing asthma (diagnosed about 10 years ago), Basedow&#39;s disease from 01Mar2021 and ongoing, hypersensitivity, hyperthyroidism, anxiety. First dose of BNT162B2 was given on 22Feb2021 and she felt sick to her stomach, nausea, had no energy, 160 heart rate atrial fibrillation, hand tremors, shortness of breath, she felt exhausted, low grade fever, thyroid storm, felt tired, shaking, flu symptoms.  Concomitant medications included levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) taken for allergy from 2020 to 24Feb2021, guaifenesin (MUCINEX) taken for hypersensitivity from Dec2020 to 20Feb2021.  When she got the second vaccine, her heart rate was high again. She did have a thyroid storm the day after the second dose (18Mar2021) and she was in the emergency room again since her heart rate was so high. It was reported that the vaccine did cause her thyroid storm. She knows vaccinations have to do with the immune systems, and if she has an autoimmune disease, she is thinking it may have come from it. States two doctors are certain that it triggered an immune response and wanted her to report this. She could barely stand up or talk, she was so short of breath and is guessing that was from her heart. She had normal flu like symptoms from the vaccine but does not think it was related to her thyroid. She has always had little cold symptoms after getting a vaccination. First night she felt very exhausted, tired. She had a low grade fever that Tylenol took care of and it went away within a day. She felt run down and it was vaccination related. The second day (19Mar2021) she had really bad hand tremors that moved into her body. She thought the shaking was from the vaccination and she took a video of it. She did not really have any other symptoms yet, then started to get really fatigued. She went to ER and her heart was really elevated. Each time she went to the doctor or the ER, her heart rate would be 20 beats faster then 20 beats faster again.  The outcome of her heart rate was high again / heart elevated/her heart rate would be 20 beats faster then 20 beats faster again, short of breath was recovering. The outcome of guessing that was from her heart, exhausted/tired/ felt run down/ really fatigued was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                When I received the 2nd dose of the vaccine, I was 26 weeks and 3 days pregnant. My estimated due date is 07/10/2021. I received the vaccine mid-morning on 4-6-2021. The following day (4-7-2021), I experienced arm soreness, fatigue, muscle aches, and chills. Those symptoms were subsiding by the evening of 4-7-2021. Early in the morning of 4-8-2021, I was wakened from sleep because my heart felt like it was beating too fast and too hard. This experience was most intense when lying on my left side, and at its most intense, I felt like I couldn&#39;t quite catch my breath. Sitting upright seemed to slow my heart rate. Walking caused it to increase again, and I felt more winded than usual walking short distances. I contacted my OB-GYN when her office opened on 4-8-2021 and told her what I&#39;d been experiencing, and she instructed me to go to the hospital to be evaluated. I was admitted and monitored in Labor and Delivery continuously all day. My heart rate was elevated. My fetus&#39;s heart rate was normal. I had an EKG which was normal. I had labs done (CBC, metabolic, thyroid, progesterone), and all were normal. I was not found to be dehydrated, but I was given a liter of fluids IV as a precaution. Over the course of the day, my heart rate returned to normal, and I was discharged.

The following day I started again with a headache. That headache has not stopped still.  Still fatigue, low grade fever, nausea...lasted for about 3 weeks. I couldn&#39;t go to work, no energy and I couldn&#39;t go to work. Low back pain that radiated down my legs. Pain in my neck that radiated to my shoulders, arms, right side of my chest. I went to the neurologist and she prescribed steroids.  Those gave me tachycardia, so I was told to stop taking them. She now prescribed anti-depressants, but I&#39;ve not started taking them yet. I am still seeking treatment with her and also my PCP.

                                                Patient received the covid19 vaccine at about 940am on 06/01/21 - dose 1 by Pfizer.  Less than 5 minutes later, patient came to me saying she wasn&#39;t feeling good.  I was still sitting at the immunization table.  She sat down and said she was feeling very tired.  I asked if she wanted me to call 911 and she said said no.  She just wanted to rest.  She then slumped over and fainted.  I was able to hold her in the seat while carefully supporting her head.  I loosened her mask and she was breathing normally, but just fainted.  About 2 minutes she woke up and then proceeded to vomit.  I sat with the patient about 15 minutes or so.  The color returned back to her lips and we called her roommate.  When he arrived, the patient got up and started walking and began to feel better.  Patient went home.

                                                The day after my second Pfizer shot i felt overwhelmed and shortness of breath. I felt like i was going to faint. I got hot. I went to work the next day and felt similar symptoms of a panic attack while at work which us what i thought it was. My stress levels seemed normal so i wasnt sure why i felt anxious all of a sudden. But then i felt the tightening of the chest and shortness of breath daily ever since. Everyone keeps telling me its because of my anxiety but it just came out of nowhere and doesnt seem right at all. I started researching it and saw the article from the CDC regarding myocarditis being linked to the covid shot and i strongly without a doubt believe that is what&#39;s really going on with me currently. I am going to try and go to Urgent care either tomorrow or Friday to speak with someone.

It has significantly decreased my quality of life and I&#39;m now struggling with anxiety and depression due to it. I have never had tinnitus before and am otherwise perfectly healthy - no structural issues to the ear, no hearing loss, etc. The vaccine caused it. I will not be getting a second shot, especially as there is still limited information available.

On the third day, started feeling progressively worse: dizziness upon standing and while standing (to the point I thought I would fall over) nausea, dry heaving, headache bordering on migraine, abdominal pain and a short period of appetite loss. Today (fourth day post shot) I called out of work and feel as if I?m on a tilt table while laying down, and will feel dizzy and nauseated immediately upon standing up. This is is spite of staying hydrated and eating a bland diet in order to not upset my stomach.

There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient stated she got the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Monday, 28Dec2020. She mentioned that she read the list of side effects and all the print outs and stated her events were not on there. She wanted to make sure and stated maybe it was not even from the vaccine. She reported she just came from the hair dresser, had hair colored before many times, but today (30Dec2020), when she put the dye on her hair, she broke out with what felt like a million bugs on her head and face, stated it is burning and itching, maybe it is her imagination. She knows there is a lot of paranoia. She reported that she has had hair colored before and this has never happened, it occurred during hair coloring treatment. She also mentioned that on 30Dec2020 (also reported as &#34;yesterday&#34;, pending clarification), she felt dizzy and nauseous; on 29Dec2020 (reported as &#34;yesterday&#34;), she felt bad and did not feel right all day, but says she knows those were listed symptoms. The outcome of the events dizziness, nausea, burning sensation and pruritus was recovering; the outcome of events paranoia and feeling abnormal was unknown.

About 12 hours after I got the vaccine (around 1 am), I woke up with a headache, chills, body aches and a low grade fever. During the night, my temp got up to 99.9 and continued to stay around mid to high 99s throughout the day on Sunday. I tried Tylenol without any success and kept going in and out of chills with body aches and headache persisting. Before I went to sleep Sunday (01/03/21) night, I switched to Ibuprofen and woke up Monday morning without a fever but still experiencing fatigue. Throughout the day on Monday, fever did not return. I stayed home from work on Sunday and Monday. On Tuesday 01/04/20, I was still tired but able to return to work.

She stated she felt hot and hadn&#39;t eaten all day. She was given a few bites of apple sauce and some Dr. Pepper to drink in case of low blood sugar. She was also given 25mg of diphenhydramine in case of an allergic reaction after the vaccine adminstration at 12:15pm. A few minutes later, she began shaking and stated she thought she was having an anxiety attack.  At this time, the patient requested we call 911 because that would make her feel better and so we did.

                                                Right after the second dose less than 2 minutes my heart rate began to spike. I could feel my heart pumping fast. I couldn?t sit due to this so I began pacing the room. I didn?t know this was a side affect so I thought I was over thinking the second dose. I attributed this to all the worry and doubt the media and people around me try pumping in your head. I thought I was having a panic attack. I didn?t alert any of the medical team there because again, I thought I was over thinking it. A few hours later my heart rate had gone down. My Apple Watch helped me monitor this. The next day I felt pain at the injection site, not my normal self, groggy. Slightly feverish and chilled. I work in a cold environment so I couldn?t quite tell if the chilled feeling was a side effect, or the room. Later that evening around 9pm things took a turn. I began running a low grade fever and was shaking from being so cold. About another hour late my fever was up to 101 and I was still shaking from being so cold. I took about 600mg of ibuprofen. I couldn?t sleep, tossed and turned. Probably another hour later my temperature was 102, still shaking uncontrollably. Covered in about 5 blankets I kept waiting it out. And I?d say around 2-3am I could feel my fever breaking. By late morning my temp was back to normal but I felt achy still. Tired, sore. Definitely sore at my injection site. And I don?t know if this is worth mentioning or not but just haven?t been able to shake that panic attack feeling. Like a worry or a dread over me. I just don?t feel as clear-headed as I did before. This is my biggest concern. Just don?t feel myself yet.

A 31-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose in deltoid right for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on 03Jan2021 and within 15 minutes had a generalized headache. Later that night she had generalized muscle weakness and pain, but really didn&#39;t think too much about it. The next day at work (04Jan2021), she had numbness on the right upper side of her lip and a pins and needle feeling in the right upper quadrant of the face. Had a lot of pain in the area as well on the right upper side of the face as well as a dull aching pain that lasted for hours. Later that day when using the computer and she was trying to reach for her mouse she noticed her right hand wasn&#39;t able to feel anything and that lasted about 20-25 minutes. Kept slapping the mouse with her hand, but could not feel anything, her hand went numb. Yesterday (05Jan2021), she had the same pins and needle feeling in the same area of the face and that dull achy feeling and it occurred for hours and it was very kind of debilitating for her at work.  Later that night she had pain in her right leg and felt the same way, that very severe achiness, which was the pins and needles feeling up and down the leg and underneath the right foot. All these symptoms tend to be on her right side and it definitely lasted for hours. It started about 1 and didn&#39;t end until 6-7pm. It even hurts to move the right eye in one direction and hurts to speak, the pain was so bad. This morning (06Jan2021) she had to call out of work because at 3am the generalized headache, pain was unbearable. She was still experiencing the pain in right leg and bottom sole of right foot. She did not receive any vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. She had made an appointment with a neurologist and will have a MRI done on Friday, 08Jan2021. No further details provided. All events required a visit to physician office. All events were reported as serious per medically significant. The outcome of all events was not resolved. The reporter considered all events were related to the vaccine.   Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal relationship, causality between reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded.

This was controlled 3 hours later by tylenol. For the next 36 hours post symptom onset my sinuses were still affected, my muscles felt very weak and the glands in my neck felt swollen. Everything has resolved except the swollen glands in my neck and my sinsuses being dry and painful.

                                                On  12/25 I was driving home and my left arm got numb, tingly and weak to the the point where I thought I was suffering from a stroke.  I  rushed to my moms and had her to drive me to the hospital where they did a neuro check to include a CT scan which ruled out the stroke but the symptoms lasted about 4 days which came and went with the pain and intensity varying each time which ended around 12/29.  I suffered from body aches and night chills one night.  Around the 12/29 I began to have pressure around the back of my head which felt as if I was laying on bricks when I laid down.  It got to the point to where I couldnt sleep which caused me to go back to the ER on  1/1 where I was given  toradol, decadron and sudafed which allowed me to sleep. I was released from the ER with Motrin 800 and contined to take that and Tylenol until the headaches ceased  which was about 3 or 4 days later. The headache went away but the pressure still remained.  My lymph glands were swollen so I was also given a prescription for amoloxicillin.

                                                1/12 0715: Received Pfizer covid-19 vaccine dose 2 at end of shift. Went home to sleep after waiting 15 min.  1630: Woke up. Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

No fever was ever noted, but I felt hot through most of the next day. The body aches impaired my ability to work on 1/12/2021 and as a result I called out sick. These symptoms resolved the morning of 1/13/2021 and I have felt fine since.

Went back to sleep and woke up around 4 am with fever up to 100.6F, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, and extreme fatigue. My left axilla was swollen with arm pain to mid left chest and back, and my axillary lymph node was painful and swollen to about the size of a large grape. I took 440 mg of Aleve around 8:30 when the fever did not subside. The fever broke and did not return. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. My left axillary lymph node is still palpable as of today, 1/15.

This was swiftly followed by a feeling of tightness in my throat, shortness of breath, and coughing. In addition I had a moderate to severe headache. The hospitals rapid response team was called and I was brought to the emergency department on-site. I was given a racemic epinephrine and albuterol neb treatment which resolved upper airway stridor and cough. I received PO Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone. A EKG was completed. I was observed in the emergency department for about 2 hours until discharge. I was discharged with prescriptions for an Epi-Pen, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The diagnosis on my after visit summary was: Allergic Reaction. I was unable to finish my scheduled shift as an RN.

Very fatigued. At night I threw up and about 2AM I woke up drenched in sweat and I did not take my temperature. I woke up around 7AM and I had a migraine for about 2/3 hours - pounding headache. I took Tylenol, My body was really achy and my arm was like it was dead. General malaise, fatigue, it felt like I had a hangover, from my pounding headache. I threw up once again in the afternoon. Not sure if pregnancy related or the vaccine. Sunday morning I started feeling a little better. Saturday I felt horrible.

                                                About an hour after getting the shot, I did get extremely light headed and pulled my car over to get gas. I then noticed a rash all down the arm I got the vaccine and all over my chest and up my neck. I felt extremely hot. I got back in my car and sat at the gas station waiting for the lightheadedness to pass. I did call my GP at that time to make sure everything was OK. The nurse said that it sounds like a reaction but as long as I do not feel like I can not breathe or that my throat was swelling I should be ok. They advised me to eat something and also take benadryl once I got home. Rash stayed for a total of 2 days and today (3rd day) I only have a rash at the injection site. Its very red and hot to touch. Other symptoms I have/still have was very bad headache, fever (highest was 102.8 and today 3 days later is still over 101). Body aches, chills and the first 24 hours I felt like my internal organs were hot (sounds really weird!)

On 01/20/21 I also started developing stiffness and pain on may arms, hands and feet on both sides. I reported symptoms to Urgent Care. Since then the pain has increased and is now worse on my right hand side-arms, feet; leg-up the glutes and face. I was seen on Urgent Care on 01/22/21 and was told to take OTC ibuprofen. Since symptoms worsened I went to ED on 01/24/21 and was told to keep taking ibuprofen and follow-up with my PCP. I saw my PCP on 01/25/21 and was told to continue monitoring symptoms, continue ibuprofen and f/u in week. I was also prescribed an Hydroxyzine to help with anxiety.

                                                felt part of the dose run down her arm or at least had that sensation.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient). A 31-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient claimed that on the first dose, she felt part of the dose run down her arm or at least had that sensation. The inoculator thinks the complete dose was injected. The patient was upset and wants a recommendation on if she should need a repeat of her first dose. The patient asked if there was any data on repeating the first dose vs. no action and proceed with the second dose in 21 days. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I am reporting my symptoms through this avenue because the VAERS wouldn&#39;t let me complete my daily report on that day (no submit button found).  I had malaise a few hours after the shot. 12 hours after the shot, this turned into a fever that would peak at 103 within the next 12 hours. Fever was accompanied by severe chills, moderate headache, moderate muscle aches, mild joint aches, and mild nausea. I also had a swollen lymph node under my armpit ipsilateral to the injection, the diameter of a baseball. Discomfort from the lymph node was mild. The fever and chills were so bad that I couldn&#39;t do any daily activities and stayed in bed all day. I called a nurses line to ask them if I could take something for the discomfort and they advised Tylenol, so I took 1000 mg. Tylenol did bring down the fever to 101 and the fever rose back to 103, 9 hours after Tylenol. All the aforementioned symptoms lasted for 3 days, and the severe symptoms decreased in severity to &#34;moderate&#34; after about 36 hours.

I stated to have some facial swelling then my throat started to swell/tighten.  I was brought to the ED and an IV was started. They administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The throat swelling started to interfere with my speaking and vocals. They monitored me for 7 hours then I was discharged home. All symptoms returned within a few hours and persisted for a week following. My PCP took over care and prescribed me the following in replace of the medications the ER prescribed: Albuterol HFA, Dexamethasome, Pepcid, Benadryl, Z-Pak, Vitamin D 100,000iu, and Fish Oil. I missed a week of week then was released to work again on 1/25/21.

                                                8 days after my  first vaccine shot, on Jan 19th night, I suddenly started having  pain in the chest. The pain was located in the left side of the lower end of the sternum, in the epigastric region. Pain lasted for 3-4 hours. Initially it was severe, pulsating, acute pain as if nerve pressing against chest. Unbearable pain. I was unable to lie down, turn on sides. Pain would aggravate on movements and if I would touch the specific spot in my chest. . Deep breaths reduced the pain to some extent. Pain severity decreased after 4 hours after which I started getting pain in my left arm, radiating to my pinky finger.  The pain also  radiates to left upper back on movements and exerting left arm for long time, especially typing computer keyboard, doing daily chores cooking, washing dirty dishes, sleeping on the side. ,I am unable to sleep on the left side, if I sleep on left side, I start getting tingling and numbness in my left arm. I did not take any pain medications until Jan 26th as the pain did not disappear. Once at night the pain also radiated to my left leg , I felt  numbness when I tried to sleep on my left side. Occasionally, I feel pain in my right arm and right back. The pain near the sternum area reduced significantly when I took two doses of Ibuprofen 600 on Jan 26th in the afternoon and night. The pain in left arm radiating towards left pinky still persists, with numbness and tingling  if I do daily task for longer duration. Ibuprofen helps to relieve pain temporarily.  Mild pain in right arm, neck and upper arm. I will continue to closely monitor my symptoms.

In the middle of the night, I developed a high grade fever (101.4), which was gone by the time I woke up. Later in the day a low grade fever returned and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck became enlarged. I called out of work for the next day, Monday, and completed the employee covid testing survey. Monday morning the lymph nodes in my neck were about the size of a golf ball and I was incredibly fatigued. Got tested for COVID (came back negative) and remained with an intermittent low grade fever, fatigue, headache, and sore throat for the remainder.

                                                At approximately 8pm began feeling slightly nauseated. Tried going to sleep. Had some heart palpitations and what felt like acid reflux/chest pains. Slight headache before bed.  Took some Tums before going to sleep.  at around 10:00 began vomiting horribly. Nausea went away slightly, but returned around 12am. Started vomiting again at 12am and also 2am. Started feeling severe flu like symptoms, severe body aches (especially in legs). Tried taking Tylenol at around 12, but believe it was out of my system once I vomited at 2am. Did not sleep - every time I moved I felt nauseous. Also heart pounding, stomach pain, body aches kept me awake all night. Took Tylenol again at around 7am. Severe body aches kept me in bed all day. Diarrhea.  Severe head ache also gave me sensitivity to sounds and lights throughout the day. Took Tylenol again at around 2pm.  Started feeling somewhat better around 7pm on Friday 2/12. Sat 2/13 felt extremely tired and no energy. Have some lingering diarrhea.

                                                2/5/21 around 9:30am - started developing shortness of breath, palpitations, and tachycardia upon exertion. I would become winded just walking to another room or brushing my hair. I reached out to the contact tracing center at hospital to find out if this was a reported side effect of the vaccine. The symptoms continued throughout the weekend and I was unable to work. My next workday was Tuesday and I was still short of breath so I reached back out to the contact tracing center who sent me to be tested for COVID. The results came back negative. I contacted my PCP who ordered a chest X-ray and had me get a pulse ox. My heart rate would go up to 138 with one flight of stairs. Sitting eating dinner my heart rate would sit at 108. Brushing my teeth my heart rate was 119.   Thursday, 2/11 - I woke up for my chest X-ray and was light-headed. I put on my pulse ox and my SpO2 was 87%. I went for my chest X-ray and then went straight to the ED. I was hypertensive and tachycardic when I arrived. My blood work and imaging were all normal.  2/12 - I saw a cardiologist who put me on a beta-blocker to temporarily control my symptoms. He believes I am having a secondary reaction to the vaccines as opposed to a primary issue with the heart. I am scheduled for an echo on 2/15 to cover all bases.  Symptoms have NOT subsided to date - I am still short of breath, have chest pressure, palpitations and tachycardia are being controlled with a beta-blocker (resting HR is 60s but will jump to high 90s with any movement), blood pressure being controlled with beta-blocker.   **I was evaluated for palpitations in 2018 but they were found to be minor and no specific cause was to be found, nor was the cardiologist concerned at the time. I have NO known heart issues or defects.

                                                A few hours after injection I developed a small rash at injection site which lasted about an hour (no medications taken for it) I became extremely tired and pain spread from the injection site up to my neck and down to my elbow. I did not want to take any painkillers and continued to stretch and move my arm as much as I could. I noticed discomfort and a rash under my armpit area as well. I slept for about 12 hours and woke up feeling significantly better, but the discomfort under my arms persists. I was not sure who to contact for this as it&#39;s not an emergency. I am the caregiver for 2 elderly people and it has hindered my ability to care for them in the last 24hrs, so  I just wanted to report my symptoms for others to be aware.

                                                Woke me up in middle of night - severe pain in hips and shoulders; same severe headache that causes nausea. I had muscle fatigue and overall general fatigue for 48 hours.  Injection site - starting 2 inches down from it - I had red blotchiness (about 24 hours after) - grew (to not quite down to my elbow)and swelled and was hot to touch for 72 hours. It itched a little bit.  The Monday (11th) following I had Dr. visit - to Primary Care Physician - large allergic reaction. He told me to draw a border around it. It continued to spread but not severely and no streaks down my arm. Applied heat to increase blood flow to the area.  The heat helped. It took about seven days to fully go away (the swelling and redness on my arm).

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL9261) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 20Jan2021 13:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included having one thyroid and had a benign tumor removed from behind heart when she was young and birth control. Concomitant medication included benzalkonium chloride, sodium chloride (ALIVE) and desogestrel, ethinylestradiol (ISIBLOOM) for birth control. After taking the shot she got light headed as she was walking to her car on 20Jan2021 15:00. Didn&#39;t think nothing of it since she was nervous about taking the shot. Then once she got home, she got really tired. She only had one thyroid so the shot made me really sleepy and she had a few skipped heart beats while laying down. After she slept, she felt fine but weird then after being up for a few hours she would get restless again. She got light headed again the next day going to the grocery store then back restless. She didn&#39;t feel normal until this Tuesday, she was not feeling weird and she was not as tired as she had been since she took the shot. She had tried to get seen from her doctor but she was booked up. No treatment was received for the events. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was not pregnant. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No known allergies. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                At 10:35 I started feeling weird in my body like when I get either an asthma attack or flu type. It was an hour later when I first began to feel lightheaded, dizzy, chills, and then really cold. I started then coughing hard like my throat was closing up and hard to breathe. My chest got tight and had sharp pains right under my chest by my stomach side. My heart rate was fast to the point my watch alerted me at over 135. I took my rescue ProAir inhaler to help but it didn?t. I tried to settle down and not panic to make things worse on my asthma attack. I then had to lay down feel weak. Within the next 15-20 min I used my nebulizer at home to help me breathe. After one treatment it helped me tremendously but still felt tired, nauseous, fatigue, pounding headache, but no fever since I barely checked at 98.5.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine on Sunday, I had significant fatigue and sensitivity to light with watery eyes and a headache and was in bed all day. The next morning on Monday I woke with a pressure headache that was kept at bay with Advil. The headache stayed the same on Tuesday and Wednesday. By Thursday the headache was so uncomfortable I was having trouble working. It stopped responding to Advil and the pressure continued to increase on both sides of my head with sharp, shooting pains throughout that would come and go with the constant pressure. By Friday, I couldn?t co to use work and ended up calling into my PCP and advising them that I had a migraine that was very different from my normal migraines that I get (pain on left side behind eye, very nauseous, sensitive to light, always responds to OTC meds) and it wouldn?t respond to Advil and asked them to call in something. They called in generic version of Imitrex that evening; but since this migraine was so different than my normal pattern, I went to the ER on Saturday. They did a CT scan to make sure there were no  brain bleeds and gave me IV magnesium and steroids. I declined the torodol and Benadryl. The headache was still there, but bearable finally when I left. It got worse again that evening and I ended up taking the imitrex at 3am and falling asleep, only to wake up at 7am with a skull splitting feeling. That feeling stayed for the next 4 days, slowly getting less intense. I was unable to workout any of these days (I workout for about an hour daily for the past 3 years) because it was extremely exacerbated by activity. I was not hungry. Finally on Thursday I felt more like my normal self but the headache remained slightly and now on Sunday all that is left is the sharp, shooting pains that come every so often and light sensitivity.

After ER visit I was advised to take Zyrtec and Benadryl. I&#39;ve paired it with Mucinex to get rid of phlegm build-up and the doctor prescribed Prednisone which I&#39;m going to start today (03/15/2021). So far I have less tightness/less tingling in heart area (still occurs randomly but not as opten) but still get fatigued and breathless real quick. I&#39;ve also had sporadic headaches brain fog, body chills/aches/weakness/difficulty concentrating. Also had face numbness for 4 days.

A 31-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9267) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 18Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 31-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included ivermectin (SOOLANTRA) and minocycline, both for unknown indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 31-years-old) in the right arm at 15:30 for COVID-19 immunisation. On 19Feb2021 at 03:00, after the second vaccination, the patient experienced brain fog, chills, fever, nausea, and headache. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcomes of the brain fog, chills, fever, nausea, and headache were recovering.    No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                The injection was put in on top on my shoulder. I?ve had moderate to severe joint pain when moving my arm, especially lifting my arm or lifting in a backwards motion. There is no swelling, redness on the skin and it?s not sore to the touch. It?s painful inside my joint. Even after taking ibuprofen I?m waking up in pain many times  in the night and need assisting putting in coats and getting dressed.  I?m not able to pick up anything heavy.

Swelling and shooting pains in left armpit made it difficult to sleep. The following day, the pain continued, spread to my left breast, and any amount of pressure made the pain worse. The pain continued the third day, with constant chest pain that felt like bad heartburn. The worst of the pain subsided four days after vaccination.

                                                On day of vaccine -- Extreme dizziness  began 1 minute after shot. Dizziness lessened to a tolerable level (I felt I could safely walk around) after about 5 minutes. Dizziness continued to come on sporadically when standing, though lessening in severity and frequency over time. As of today (4/6/21), the dizziness will still occur occasionally when standing or when moving from a sitting to a standing position.  In addition, about 1 hour after the shot, pain began in my jaw and neck area on the left side. This lasted for about three hours. The pain then moved down in my shoulder around the injection site. The pain did not return to my jaw/neck region, and the pain in my shoulder went away after 3 days.  4/2/21 -- Facial and neck numbness began. The left part of my tongue, about one quarter of it, was numb. The left side of my face extending back to my ear and scalp, and down the left side of my neck was numb.  4/3/21 -- Numbness spread down my shoulder, arm, and into my fingers, but was less severe than the numbness in my face and neck.  4/4/21 -- Began 600mg of ibuprofen 3x/day. Numbness decreased after second dose, especially in tongue, but still present. Numbness increased when laying on left side. Weakness in left arm.  4/5/21 -- Increased weakness in left arm and fingers. Numbness still present, but lessened in face and neck. Minor facial swelling in left cheek, left side of tongue tingling and felt slightly swollen. Took 2 Benedryl, did not seem to make a difference.  4/6/21 -- Soreness where left leg connects to hip. Left leg feels a little shaky and weak. Continued symptoms from previous entries. A little brain fog, difficult to concentrate at times. Jaw felt swollen on both left and right side, noticeable when trying to open mouth. Decreased after ibuprofen. Feelings of weakness and general &#34;off&#34; feeling worse when standing versus laying down.

                                                The night after my second Pfizer vaccine on 4/6/2021, I didn?t sleep well. I was tossing and turning all night. I started getting a bad headache. By the time I woke up on 4/7/2021, I felt like when you?re coming down with the flu- I had a really bad headache, my whole body hurt, and I was exhausted. I had a loss of appetite that day. I was able to sleep for 3 hours later that day, woke up, took Advil, and felt mostly better. I slept good the night of 4/7/2021, and after waking up on 4/8/2021, I felt much better. I still had mild muscle aches and a slight headache. At work I felt like I had some brain fog but by the evening of 4/8/2021, I felt completely back to normal. I knew these were expected side effects of the vaccine due to my immune system doing it?s job. I did not need to make any calls to my doctor or hospital.

                                                Received vaccine at Covid-19 pop-up clinic on 4/5/21 at 2:30pm. Was fine during the vaccine administration. Waited 30 minutes after vaccination and left the clinic and felt fine. About 15-30 minutes later she was driving around running errands and was drinking water in the car and she noticed that it was becoming hard to swallow. Felt dizzy and disoriented and called her allergist. She carries epi pen because she gets allergy shots due to dog and cat allergies. Epi pen is for potential reaction to allergy shot. Allergist advised her to call EMS. She called EMS and they told her to administer the epi pen. She administered epi pen and began to feel symptoms improve. EMS arrived and she felt better and was not transported to the hospital. She drove herself home and was fine the rest of the day. She also had a topical reaction to the band-aid on her arm, with blisters and ripping off her skin. She generally has allergy issues with adhesives.

Very sensitive to pressure/hot/cold.   For reference I did not bleach my teeth and have no sinus issues currently.  Sensation was gone by the next morning.  Currently (4/9 9:29pm) no side effects to report except a little lingering arm soreness. All good :)

                                                I received the first Pfizer vaccine on 3/16/21 in the afternoon. I am a young, healthy woman with no pre-existing health conditions: I don&#39;t smoke, am under 120 lbs., no allergies, etc. Two days after the vaccine, I started to experience an eye twitch, which progressed into Bells Palsy by the following week: by 3/23/2021.   I went to an urgent care clinic and was diagnosed as such, and they contributed to the vaccine and told me not to get the second shot. They also advised I get a CT scan to rule out a stroke, which I did,  on 3/24/21. I expect that they also reported this. I have facial paralysis on the left side of my face, and developed an ear infection a week after this...I don&#39;t have allergy issues, and have not had an ear infection since I was a small child. This has been traumatic, uncomfortable and very scary because I thought I was having a stroke.

                                                Patient experienced a metallic taste in her mouth approximately 15 minutes after receiving vaccine. She was to then be observed longer. Vitals at 4:10pm= BP 142/90mmHg, PO2 96%, and heart rate 88 beats/min. Patient reports she had already been having an asthma exacerbation earlier during the day and walking into the facility from the cold makes her asthma worse. Upon the metallic taste in her mouth and the need to be observed longer she states she had some anxiety and that this contributed to her wheezing. Patient took one puff of her albuterol inhaler and was feeling better. At 4:25pm the nurse noted lungs were clear with no wheezing detected. After approximately 30-45 minutes of observation, she was then walked by a nurse outside and due to the cold bothering her lungs she took a second puff of her inhaler in her car. Her wheezing lessened and the patient felt fine to go home.

                                                I don&#39;t remember thinking much about my arm being sore until sometime overnight. I avoided sleeping on my left side because it became sore at some point. I typically sleep on my left side, so this was unusual for me.  The next day my pain continued to increase. I struggled to focus on work, and at the urging of a friend, I eventually called my doctor&#39;s office so I could make sure there wasn&#39;t something serious wrong as a result of the vaccine. I worried that it was perhaps given too high on my arm.  Originally I made the appointment for 3/19/21, but as the day went on I realized I should not wait until the end of the week, so I cancelled a meeting at work and took an appointment on 3/17/21. I saw a PA in my primary care physician&#39;s office. She looked at my arm, the injection site, and compared both of my arms to see if it appeared swollen. She said everything looked fine, told me it was okay to take ibuprofen and alternate with Tylenol, and said the pain should go away in a week or so. The pain never went away, but honestly I kept holding out hope because after insurance I owed $124 for that doctor visit and it wasn&#39;t very helpful. I couldn&#39;t spend any more money for another pointless visit.  But the pain has increased. Simple things like removing my shirt without assistance almost brings me to tears. Using my left arm while driving has become more painful, and I struggle to move in certain directions.  Now that I am vaccinated I was planning to return to the gym, but my arm hurts so badly I don&#39;t think it is a good idea.  I&#39;m concerned about the cost of treatment, but it&#39;s been 5 weeks and I need some help.

I took that for  7 days and by April 16th the rash was dried/scabbed over and my symptoms were tiredness and pain. I did take a couple days off work.  I had a follow up appt on April 16th and she said it looked like everything was healing and I was starting to feel better.

I had theee blankets on me and a sweatshirt, socks, pants. I was shaking uncontrollably for 7 hours. Then around 1am my body was on fire. It felt like my hands were burning just from touching my stomach. My sheets were drenched in sweat. I turned the air conditioning on full blast and could not cool down until 1pm the next day. During the night I was so weak I couldn?t even walk to my kitchen to get water. I had to crawl. I was hysterically crying. I haven?t been sick in a decade or two. I have no medicine at my house, I?m never sick.  This was one of the worst nights of my life.

                                                A few hours after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I started getting heart palpitations.  My heart felt like it was beating really hard in my chest, and my pulse rate started fluctuating.  I can feel it in my back when I&#39;m sitting in a chair, I can feel it in my neck, and occasionally in my stomach. My pulse rate would go anywhere from low 90s to over 130. There have been some nights where it was difficult to sleep because it was pounding while lying in bed.  Eating seems to flare it up.  It has been three weeks now since the first dose and I am still experiencing bouts of palpitations.  It has settled some, but still comes and goes.  Pulse rate still fluctuating, but not as high.  I am scared to get the second shot, especially considering people are turning up with heart inflammation now.  I am postponing the second dose.  People keep saying the risk of COVID is worse than potential side effects, but this side effect is quite distressing and is affecting my daily life.  I have found groups online where multiple people complain of the exact same thing after getting the pfizer or moderna vaccine.  The general public needs to be made aware there are other potential side effects rather than &#34;flu-like&#34; symptoms.

The most concerning side affect for me was I felt as though my central nervous system was affected. I had difficulty speaking, formulating sentences and experienced general confusion. I couldn&#39;t communicate with my husband to tell him how sick I felt or what I even needed.  The fever went away after 24 hours, the joint pain stuck around for 3-4 days, as did the migraine and exhaustion.  My menstrua cycle has also been affected. It&#39;s heavier, lasting longer and affected my usual cycle time.

A 31-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6201) at age of 31 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included spinal cord injury due to MVA in 2012, neurogenic (incontinent) bladder and bowel, bladder augmentation and mitrofanoff, chronic neuropathic pain, dependent of wheelchair. Patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included lavender oil (lavender, helichrysum, jasmine). Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 administered in Arm Left on 28Jan2021 01:45 PM (Lot Number: EL8982) at age of 31 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and no reaction on previous exposure to drug. With first menstrual period after receiving vaccine patient had vomiting, chills, sweating, muscle pain, and her head and heart were pounding. It felt bad enough to go to emergency room but she waited it out at home and it lasted a few hours. Patient had a spinal cord injury so the symptoms were similar to what she got with autonomic dysreflexia, but this was the worst case of it she had ever had. She hadn&#39;t vomited in 10 years (or before her spinal cord injury). Patient still had muscle pain in her shoulders and neck. Adverse event start date was on 25Apr2021 12:00. No treatment received. No covid prior vaccination. No covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Autonomic dysreflexia is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.  Medical history of spinal cord injury due to MVA in 2012 may provide a plausible explanation for the event. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Since receiving the Pfizer first dose, the patient has had a case of psychosis and has been admitted to inpatient as of 5/25/21  for psychological evaluation.  First symptoms I personally noticed were about 24 hours after she received the shot. Speaking and getting stuck in loops,  making up stories that never occurred, forgetting what ?reality? she is in, paranoia, not able to sleep are symptoms she is exhibiting.

A 31-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE 2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 19Apr2021 (Lot Number: EW0162) at the age of 31 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism, allergic reaction to bee sting. Concomitant medications taken within two weeks of vaccination included levothyroxine/liothyronine (NP THYROID) taken for hypothyroidism. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. On 08May2021 the patient experienced lips swelled, throat was kind of itchy. When  she had the lip swelling, it was like little blisters on her lips mainly on her top lip, is like a dry patch of skin, but kind of like a blister. Her lips are a little sore still in that spot with the blister, and it is a tiny bit swollen. On 09May2021 the patients throat was super tight, her tongue swelled, it felt weird. Her oxygen was fine in the emergency room (ER), but it felt almost heavy like there was something heavy on her. Patient was super exhausted, she took a nap and when she woke up her neck was stiff, she was also dizzy. The patient visited the emergency room due to the events. The patient received treatment for the events.  The clinical course was reported as follows: After her first dose, about 19 days later she experienced some kind of allergic reaction. Her lips swelled, her throat was super tight, and her tongue swelled. She ended up in the ER, and they put her on steroids. She was supposed to get her second shot &#34;today&#34;, but now she will get it in 2 weeks. She needed to know if this was a common reaction. The reaction happened on Saturday 08May2021 the day before Mother&#39;s Day. She took Benadryl a couple of times on 09May2021. Around noon 09May2021 she went to the ER. She has no NDC, lot, or expiration date available for the Benadryl, it is at her house and she is currently at work. It was Waldryl, the store version the of Benadryl. When she had the lip swelling, it was like little blisters on her lips mainly on her top lip. The next day her bottom lip was swollen. Her tongue got big and her throat was super tight. It felt weird. Her oxygen was fine in the ER, but it felt almost heavy like there was something heavy on her. That&#39;s why she decided to go to the ER. She was already on Waldryl for a day and a half, and her lip had swelled out more and her tongue had swelled. She called urgent care, and they didn&#39;t have an appointment until 16:00 that day. They told her to go to the ER.  She had taken more Waldryl before she went to the ER so her tongue was not as swollen but her lips were pretty swollen. She has a little bit of swelling on the left, kind of like a dried blister on her top lip. It is like a dry patch of skin, but kind of like a blister. It is weird. As far as her lips there is not near as much swelling now. They gave her a shot of steroids in the ER and then put her on steroids. It is Prednisone, 20mg for 3 days. NDC: #. She does not see an expiration date or a lot number on the bottle. Her throat was kind of itchy but it wasn&#39;t tight on Saturday. She tried to go to an event on Sunday and left and came home by 11:30. She thinks the Waldryl was getting to her. She was super exhausted and dizzy. She took a nap and when she woke up her neck was stiff. Her itchy throat has gone away. It was probably yesterday when she didn&#39;t notice it anymore. She hasn&#39;t noticed it yesterday or today. She doesn&#39;t know what steroid shot they gave her or if it was Prednisone or not. They just said it was a steroid shot. She doesn&#39;t feel any throat discomfort or anything anymore. She has no more discomfort in her throat or her neck. Her lips are a little sore still in that spot with the blister, and it is a tiny bit swollen. It is her left upper lift. She has braces so when her lip swelled it could have irritated her lip. The tightness in her throat went away Sunday night or Monday morning. She doesn&#39;t really remember when it went away. She remembers not really noticing it yesterday. When she woke up from her nap her tongue was swollen and her throat was tight. She went to the ER. The swelling in her tongue and her throat went down. She doesn&#39;t remember when it went away. She hasn&#39;t been feeling good and has been out of it. She takes her last steroid tomorrow, and they wanted her to wait 2 weeks after that to get the second shot. She has to call and schedule because they only schedule a week out. She has to call back in a week or so and schedule it. The heavy feeling is gone. Everything went away at about the same time. She doesn&#39;t know when it went away. She has not noticed it yesterday or today. The steroid may have helped. She is still exhausted and kind of out of it. It could be from the steroid she is sure. She is not used to medications like that. Feeling out of it and the exhaustion still feel the same since they started. She is still dizzy. It is a little better, it is not as bad. She doesn&#39;t really know when her stiff neck went away. She has been out of it. She doesn&#39;t remember when it stopped or anything. She hasn&#39;t noticed it today. Investigations: They didn&#39;t do any bloodwork or x-rays or anything. They just gave her a steroid shot. She thought she was having a reaction to a candle. She had a candle that she burned several times in her house and never had a reaction to, but she assumed it was a reaction to that. It was the only thing around that was different, she blew out the candle. She thought it was a reaction to the candle and they weren&#39;t positive, so they gave her the steroid. The clinical outcome of throat was kind of itchy, throat was super tight, and neck was stiff, was recovered. The clinical outcome of the events was lips swelled, and dizzy was recovering. The clinical outcome of when she had the lip swelling, it was like little blisters on her lips mainly on her top lip, and super exhausted, was not revered. The clinical outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                On 05/05 in the early morning hours, I felt body aches and extremely fatigued. That continued throughout the day. My temperature was normal. I felt horrible. The next day 05/06, I still felt horrible, but I went to work for about 3 hours before I decided that it was too much to handle so I went home. I stayed home the rest of the day. The symptoms subsided by that Friday. That was the first incident. The following week, on Tuesday 05/11 around 7pm, I noticed I had a scratchy throat. By the time, I woke up the next morning on the 12th, I had a really sore throat. It was full blown beginnings of a cold. I was tired, didn&#39;t feel well, and had a really sore throat. I had a drip in the back of my throat by that evening. No runny nose or coughing. On Thursday 05/13, my sore throat had gone away, but I started having a runny nose in the morning and by the evening I was having coughing fits. I would cough for a solid few minutes. That would happen about every hour or so. The cough stayed until Sunday the 16th. I had a hard time talking  because of the cough. By the 17th, I went back to work. It was difficult to talk without coughing. The coughing died down around the 18th. I went to the dr on the 05/06 and 05/13. The last few days, I&#39;ve been sneezing a lot randomly. I have not been diagnosed with allergies. On the dr visit from 05/06 I went to an urgent care. The dr visit on 05/13 was at another urgent care

The patient sense of smell was off and still is. It is like a rancid smell? I gave it some time to see if it would go away but it is still present. The patient also experiencing irregularities in my menstrual cycle such as heavy bleeding and very large clots (2-3 in in size). It has made me unable to go about my daily activities and I have been extremely fatigued. I have never had this issue previously and am not on any kind of medications or birth control.

A 32-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(lot number EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at Arm Left on 21Dec2020 (from 16:30 to 17:00) at the age of 32 years old at single dose for doesn&#39;t want to bring COVID home to her family. The medical history included Migraine headaches. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had so many immunizations for international travel, had Yellow Fever vaccine, all of the Guardasil vaccines, had MMR vaccine four times because she never developed immunity to it until the fourth round, got a flu shot yearly,got TDap vaccine every five years because she was an HCP, did Emgality shots( not done it this month. Emgality had a protein inhibitor, was supposed to get Emgality shot on 21Dec2020). On 22Dec2020 the patient experienced severe serum sickness, high fever, body aches to the point that she was shaking uncontrollably, sore throat that was as painful as a strep infection; Caller mentioned she was taking tylenl and benadryl for her symptoms. The patient was a Nurse Midwife. She got the vaccine on Monday evening at 4:30PM. Feeling like she was having a weird serum sickness. Woke up in the middle of the night and she was full of shakes to the point the bed was shaking. She had a fever over 101. Felt like she was having an extreme immune response. She was taking Tylenol and Benadryl around the clock. Woke up this morning and her throat feels sore to the point of Strep. Wondering if she need to distance and get some kind of test. Has been wearing a mask all of the time and doesn&#39;t know of anyone people who have COVID that she has been in contact with. Feels congestion and sore throat. Shakes and chills: Began at 02:30. Hard core chills and shakes. High fever over 101: same time as chills and shakes. Woke up from a dead sleep. Didn&#39;t have a working thermometer but knows her temperature must have been over 101 by the way she felt. She didn&#39;t feel that crappy unless her fever is over 101. She can gauge her own temperature. She experienced throat soreness: Felt like sharp razor blades. The patient was taking numbing throat lozenges. Seriousness: Would say serious. Didn&#39;t require hospitalization. She self-treated. Had she not had to work, she would probably have stayed in bed. Has been taking round the clock medicine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported serious events including severe serum sickness, high fever, body aches, shaking uncontrollably, sore throat that was as painful as a strep infection, feels like having an extreme immune response, congestion, chills, woke up from a dead sleep and the administration of the COVID 19 immunization with BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.

                                                Recieved the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccination on Dec 26th 2020, and had no major adverse reaction to vaccine except for mild soreness and heat around injection site and intense fatigue for three days after. Symptoms went away after the 4th day. Two weeks later on Jan 5th 2021, i began to notice an intense itching, burning, and swelling at the injection site. Pain and soreness in arm made it difficult to do my job and seem to just get worse. Upon the next morning of Jan 6th 2021, pain remained but itching had gone down, but intense burning, soreness and massive redness around injection site remained and seemed to be getting worse. Pain remains and redness has not gone down, arm is very tender near site and lifting and moving arm is very stiff and sore. Feeling of lump or stiffness on injection site comes and goes and feeling of heavy and sore muscles move from upper left arm down to elbow and extend to hand; making movement and function slowed or slightly numb. Stiffness in arm and intense heat at injection site makes it uncomfortable to move or use arm. Cold tingling sensation on occasion and stiffness in elbow joint. Slight dizziness and fatigue follow with pain in arm. Was informed to see a physician on Jan 6th, 2021 who said to fill out vaccination adverse event report and to keep an eye on arm. If pain or symptoms become worse to return.

                                                As soon as I received my shot it was like an electric shot from the injection shot, up the back of my neck, into my brain. I was instantly woozy and disoriented. They moved me to observation. My hemiplegic migraine started within 10 minutes of the vaccine. I take a preventative every day, and to be honest after the vaccine it was like I had never, ever taken my preventatives. The migraine I got that day is the worst one I have experienced since the first one I ever got.   Now on top of the migraines, the vaccine gave me waves of new symptoms. I was having spells of intense heat flashes, with wooziness, and nausea. So the new symptoms were paired with the hemiplegic migraines that, if you aren?t familiar with, mimic strokes because my whole left side tends to go limp, and I struggle with speech, and cognitive issues. So it really wasn?t all too long before the nurse kindly suggested that I didn?t look great and we should head to the ED.  They treated the migraine, gave me a CT, everything came back fine. They reached out to my neurologist, gave me some fluids, really they wanted to keep me a little longer, but I know the migraine drill and just wanted to go home and sleep and eat. I promised to follow up with my neurologist and fill out my CDC form.  Over the next week the migraine and extra symptoms seemed to slowly but surely let up. The only note worthy thing was really that my left side would get extra tender at times. Not just my injection site, but it was almost like all my nerve endings all over my left side were on fire at times and a pinch on the thigh may as well have been a stab, or a pat on the back a punch. It was pretty intense at times.   And just when I thought it was all over my menses started, you see my hormones trigger my migraines. And once again it was like I wasn?t on a preventative. I had an intense Migraine start. I was able to take my bail out medication (sumatriptan) though and get to work. I moved forward with my day, and just when I thought all was normal, I got one of those brutal heat flashes, the room started moving, and I was nauseous. Unfortunately I was in full PPE, I almost passed out, I had to get a coworker to help, they had to get my supervisor. It was a big, unnecessary-necessary, pride-wounding scene.  Now I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I might speculate that people with neurological deficits, like myself, are going to have a harder time with this inactive Covid strand. I would much rather be immune to Covid then catch it though, so whatever I can do to help, and protect myself and family and friends and neighbors, I will absolutely do... But I imagine there is probably an adjustment to be made here for the neurologically impaired.  Thanks for your time, and let me know if you have any questions.

I let the nurse know under observation and she took my vitals and my BP was high for me as well 146/85.  I waited for an hour and then had my husband pick me up.  The tingling continued for a week and a half and made it impossible to sleep.  It?s slowly gotten better, but I still feel almost a palpitation/flutter feeling.

                                                within 1 hr post-vaccine on 1/7 I had a mild headache that resolved with Tylenol. At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

                                                I work as an occupational therapist in acute care. On 12/28, I was helping a patient transfer from supine to sit. She required maximal assistance, and I was briefly in an awkward position with my trunk flexed and rotated towards the right during this transfer. I felt a pull in my left lower back. After this, I iced the area and took 400 mg ibuprofen and this relieved the mild pain I had.  The following two days, I made an effort to follow back precautions (avoid bending, lifting, twisting), avoided heavy lifting at work. On 12/29 in the morning, I felt only a mild soreness in my left lower back and was able to go on my workday without issue (avoiding heavy lifting) On 12/29 around 3 pm I received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. On 12/30 (day off work) from the time I woke up until around early afternoon I felt a mild weakness and heaviness in both of my legs. It was most notable when I was standing to cook for about  20-30 minutes that my legs felt shaky and I felt the need to sit. I was able to finish cooking without sitting, however, this sensation was abnormal for me as I normally am on my feet for most of the day with an active job without feeling shaky or weak.  Around 22:00 on 12/30 I had severe nausea for about an hour or so. I can&#39;t fully remember, but several days after 12/28 or 12/29 I started to feel a mild cold sensation in my lower back. I attributed this potentially to my mild back injury, but it was unclear.  The sensory change was intermittent and mild, and ongoing until recently. On 1/9 while at work, I started to feel a mild cold sensation below my belly button, in addition to the intermittent lumbar back cold sensation area. On 1/11 at work, the sensory changes to my lower abdomen and back were more apparent after assisting in a maximal assist transfer with a patient.  At this time, it was a combination of cold and burning sensations.

The chills resolved quickly (within 24 hours), but the headache, body aches, and fatigue have continued through today (one week after receiving the vaccine).  Ibuprofen has been the only treatment.  The symptoms temporarily improve after taking ibuprofen and then return.  I have not been able to exercise since receiving the vaccine and I missed one day of work (1/12/21). I have no history of adverse reactions to any other vaccines and I had no adverse reaction to the first dose. I work as a Clinical Nurse Leader on a Critical Care floor.  One of my directors suggested I submit a VAERS.

                                                24 weeks pregnant at time of 2nd shot. Shot given at 1430 on 1/27 in left deltoid. Felt great rest of day. @0500 on 1/28 woke up shivering uncontrollably. Mild fever of 100.5(highest recorded during this whole episode). Body aches, chills, sweats, headache rest of day. 1000 mg Tylenol helped with fever/chills but headache progressed to migraine w/nausea. Took 50 mg sumatriptan and 25 mg doxylamine in evening and this seemed to help with headache and allow me to get to sleep 1/28.  Woke up at 0300 1/29 with chills/cold sweats. Took 1000 mg Tylenol again (didn&#39;t check temp) and went back to sleep. Woke up at 0530 for work - checked temp since I&#39;m a healthcare worker and it was 100.4 (with tylenol). Waited until clinic opened up and called them at 0700 for recommendations on going to work or not (temp by then was 99.8, with tylenol). Was advised to stay home and if febrile tomorrow to get COVID tested on 1/30. As of right now (1300 on 1/29) headache has returned but mild. Body aches still. Temp 99.4 w/tylenol redosed at 1000.

                                                Saturday, January 23rd I received my second COVID vaccination around noon. Later that day I developed the typical extremely sore arm.  Sunday January 24th: I started to feel just a general malaise and had some headaches, like I was coming down with something, but other than that felt fine.  Monday January 25th: I was at work and started developing a sore throat, chest tightness with some shortness of breath, myalgias, fatigue, nausea, and minor chills, although I never had a fever.   Tuesday: symptoms were slightly worse  Wednesday January 27th: I went to work thinking all these symptoms were still just from the vaccine as I hadn&#39;t felt any sickness symptoms before getting the vaccine and hadn&#39;t had an exposure I was aware of. While at work, I asked other coworkers if they had any similar symptoms to the vaccine and was told I should call employee health since I was still having such bad symptoms and really didn&#39;t feel too great. I called the employee health line and told them all my current symptoms which were all the same still. They told me that the sore throat and chest tightness with shortness of breath were definitely not from the vaccine and to leave work and get tested. I did this and my test came back negative. Because I was still having bothersome chest tightness, the employee health line also told me to go to the ER, thinking it could be something else significant.   I went to the ER the night of January 27th to get my symptoms all checked out as told to. Everything came back ok and the ER doctor wanted me tested for COVID again Friday around the 48 hour mark to verify it wasn&#39;t the virus. She also told me that if it came back negative, she was sure it must be my reaction to the vaccine.  Thursday January 28th: I stayed home per guidelines from employee health and still had all the symptoms listed on Monday. After a two hour afternoon nap, I finally felt like I was turning the corner. My sore throat felt better besides a huge lump still in my throat and my chest tightness with shortness of breath subsided. I still had bad myalgias, fatigue, headaches and a general sense of not feeling so great.  Friday, January 29th: Feeling slightly better again, main symptom is bad myalgias, especially my neck and small lump in throat. I got retested around 12:30 pm and it came back negative for COVID as well as negative for strep.   Saturday: Feeling almost 100% better besides sore neck still.

It was comparable to having a 15-20 minute contraction during unmedicated childbirth. It impaired my ability to function. I was bent over in pain and took a hot bath and two ibuprofen.  It subsided in about 30 minutes, but I continued to feel weak afterwards.   I was on cycle day 17 and my average cycle length is 28 days. I have a Paraguard IUD and do not take hormonal birth control.  I do experience mid cycle pain with some regularity, but this was by far my most severe experience.

I lost my appetite  but wasn&#39;t vomiting or having nausea. I had a migraine and fever and body aches and chills (I was either freezing or hot) - couldn&#39;t get warm enough - these symptoms I noticed about midnight - it woke me up after a couple hours of sleep and then I couldn&#39;t sleep. These symptoms lasted through to Monday. Tuesday, I wasn&#39;t feeling fantastic but I went back to work. Fever broke on Sunday morning. Migraine lasted five days. I took Tylenol for fever and ibuprofen for other symptoms. I had a virtual Dr appt on Friday, the 8th. I took migraine medicine but it wasn&#39;t really helping. I met again with Dr on 11th - virtual. I chose to go back work even though I wasn&#39;t better - felt fatigue and the headache on and off for a couple of weeks. Just since the beginning of February do I feel like fatigue has gone away.  When I work out, I do still notice that I get tired faster.

                                                Within 2 minutes of vaccine receipt the patient became agitated. She was noted to have erythematous macules on her upper back consistent with hives. Her heart rate and respiration rates were normal. She was observed initially as the family reported that she gets hives with all injections. However, about 2 minutes later she began to retch and stated that her throat was burning and she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was administered 0.3mg of epinephrine via an autoinjector. Her shortness of breath and throat burning symptoms resolved almost immediately. She was then given 10mg of Cetirizine PO and transported via local EMS for evaluation at the Hospital ED.

                                                On Sunday, 2/21 both forearms, wrists, and thumbs began swelling and experiencing stiffness, tension, and pain (6/10) that was both burning/nerve pain and achy muscle pain. Previously, my DeQuervein&#39;s had been steadily improving through occupational therapy, home exercise, reduced tech use (scrolling/typing), and splinting.  By Tuesday, 2/23, range of motion on the Left hand, wrist, and thumb was reduced to almost 0 and the pain reached an steady 9/10 on both arms. As of writing this, the stiffness, swelling, nerve pain, and tension remain at a level higher than the initial level that drove me to seek out occupational therapy back in January.  Basically, I went from being close to being discharged to worse than I started. Overall the left side was worse than the right but both sides were impacted.  Occupational therapy (ultrasound, fascial release, and assisted stretching) splinting, stretches, and ice were used as treatments. NSAIDs are contraindicated due to Crohn&#39;s disease.   As of writing this at 16:04 on Thursday, 2/25 none of this has resolved. Pain is a 7/10 on both sides. Range of motion and ability to complete daily care tasks (e.g. dressing, showering, cooking and eating) is nonexistent to minimal.

                                                I had excruciating pain during the injection, which progressively worsened afterward reaching 10/10 L shoulder pain within several hours of the injection. The L shoulder pain was so bad that I could not sleep that night, and the L shoulder pain was unrelieved with OTC Tylenol or Ibuprofen. I also noticed a new swollen lymph node under my left armpit the next morning. The L shoulder pain slightly decreased within 48 hours, but I have continued to have limited ROM of my left shoulder, a steady achey pain of my L shoulder, popping and crunching of my L shoulder with movement of my L shoulder, and difficulty abducting or flexing my L arm past 90 degrees since the injection. 2 weeks post-injection I saw an orthopedist who said my symptoms were caused from the vaccine injection and known as SIRVA (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration). He said I was injected too high, leading to injection of the vaccine material into my subacromial/subdeltoid bursa, causing persistent inflammation of the soft tissue leading to bursitis. He had to perform an US guided Toradol injection to attempt to calm down the inflammation caused from the injection.  I have a 4-week follow up with the orthopedist in April. He indicated that an MRI may be required to further evaluate my shoulder.

                                                The day after the second dose I felt sweaty hot and nauseous. I was still really sleepy on the third day. My eye started hurting and I could hear a buzzing sound in both ears. It got worse and worse by day six and I was having trouble seeing out of my right eye. It was really painful underneath my eye on the inside corner with swelling on the top lid. The Steroids seemed to help the problem with my eye. The doctor suspected Bells Palsy. On week two I was prescribed steroids from Lymphadenopathy. I still have the ringing in my ears which is increasing after it had subsided for a little time. I also felt pressure in my ears which is very uncomfortable. Whenever I stop taking the Steroids the ringing in my ears returns like Tinnitus. I plan to reach out to a doctor again because the ringing in my ears has returned after it had improved but was still present after 10 weeks. I did not have any of the same symptoms after the same dose. I have seen a lot of professionals.

                                                Patient was wheeled in on a rolling chair(no wheelchair available at time) from nurse that administered vaccine because of anxiety and a needle phobia that put the patient into a kind of shocked state. Patient was sweating profusely, white to the face, and not speaking very much but would answer questions correctly. EMT was speaking with the PT before walking away to continue other monitor duties when he turned back to see patient limp in chair, head back, eyes rolled back, and some twitching movements of the body. EMT called for rapid response  because first thought of seizure and seizure like activity with the twitching movements. EMT got to patient, supported head up straight, and opened jaw to ensure airway was clear. Patient had no response to EMT trying to communicate. Sternum rub was performed where patient came back conscious nearly instantly. PT was unresponsive for roughly 10-15 seconds. Patient was told of what happened and vitals were taken on her, response team was cancelled with most them already on scene. PT was feeling better, sweating stopped, color to the face returned, and PT was speaking and understanding more clearly than before. PT was given a snack and water and was monitored by EMT for an additional 15mins before patient and staff were confident with her leaving.

                                                I didn?t have many side effects in my arm right after the shot other than it being really sore for about 20 min after leaving while I was on the way home. Other than that, it just felt like I had a bruise at the injection sight. I ran a slight fever of 99.4 on and off for the first few days but felt okay. No longer have a fever (but hard to tell because I?m taking Tylenol around the clock) but symptoms have progressed since the first few days and not getting better. Now for the bad...   I?ve experienced tightness in the middle of my chest randomly, extreme fatigue, feet turning more blue/purple than the usual, sleeplessness, and headaches that are in the middle front part of my head (don?t experience these types of headaches. Usually I get more of a pressure headache to the left side of my head). I?m having random shooting pain under my eyes where the eye socket/cheekbones are (not usually correlating with my headaches). Started with the left side and now both get random shooting pains. I?ve never felt the pain under my eyes before until I got the vaccine.   Random falling/rising stars (usually falling stars indicates a migraine) just happening more often than normal. My lymph nodes in my neck where my throat is, have been swollen on both sides worse on my left side (similar to how they react with strep).  My joints and muscles have been worse than ever and swollen all over. Already had issues with my knees but now can hardly walk up and down stairs. I?ve also had ringing in my ears that can sometimes be intense. Vertigo and randomly feel like falling over. Collapsed on stairs a week after vaccine.

                                                I had multiple treatments - about 15 office visits or more. Right after the vaccine, my throat was feeling super tight; I was very fatigued and very dizzy. I went home and I wasn&#39;t feeling well. They told me to monitor my symptoms. I went to Hospital- where I had the vaccine -  ER around 2:00 pm. They provided me with an IV - Benadryl; prednisone; Pepcid. And provided me with an epi-pen - as swelling in my throat was not going down. I was released. After that, I took Tylenol and the other prescriptions. 25th - pretty bad headache; head fog - very tired; couldn&#39;t really articulate myself well. I slept all day. My throat was still feeling very tight and swollen.  That went on for about 4-5 days after the vaccine. I had a phone appt with a dry (not my primary - but with a dr) on 25th - they told me to continue with Tylenol and the prescriptions - Benadryl; prednisone; Pepcid. January 26 - I had vertigo symptoms, joint pain; muscle pain; very brain fog with not being able to think - couldn&#39;t focus on my work. On January 27th, I went back to the ER - throat discomfort and chest tightness. They told me to continue to take what I was taking to give it more time. I had chest burning and discomfort in my chest area. It felt like gas bubbles almost. It felt uncomfortable. I followed up on January 27 with a doctor on the phone and she told me the same thing: stay hydrated; keep taking the meds and if I had shortness of breath to go back to ER. I had about 9 Doctor appts after that within January. I  have seen  my primary doctor and a physical therapist - I had lots of head fog and I couldn&#39;t think clearly. I had to take a leave of absence from work. I have fogginess and imbalance. I have an extreme balance and dizziness issue. I feel like I am on a ship trying to walk. I have never had these issues before the vaccine.  I have been off work for 2 months. I cannot drive.

                                                I began having noticeable moderate tinnitus mostly in my right ear with very little in the left and pressure at my jaw pint below the ear and deep in the inner ear. It has been continuous since the 4th day after my second Pfizer dose. I?ll be seeing an ENT as soon as possible. It?s been very anxiety inducing as I have never experienced tinnitus in my life before and never had in prior ear or allergy conditions in my life to have correlated with this.

Consistent ringing in both ears that has not changed, on top of it more pitches that appear randomly and loudly. gets worse with stress. adds stress anxiety and interrupts sleep and work.  Visit to ENT concluded no hearing loss and ears look normal. Acupuncture and jaw massages help calm and relieve symptoms but still persisting.

                                                I started to heat up internally in the chest area approximately 1-2 mins after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine. The burning sensation got hotter and hotter.  I asked the administer if I was supposed to feel anything. She asked what I was feeling.  When I told her, she gave me liquid Benadryl.   I started to feel better maybe 15-20 mins after that.  I stayed in observation at the CVS pharmacy for about an hour before leaving.  I felt normal and thought it was over.  About 20 mins onto the interstate the burning sensation went over my whole body.  I also experienced a tingling in the back of my head.  I also got dizzy and felt very faint.  This episode lasted for about 20mins before calming.  I felt normal again for a 2-3 mins and it would happen again where I felt dizzy and faint.  This occurred multiple times in waves.  I called the paramedics and they recommended I take another dose of liquid Benadryl.  I went home and layed down and felt the burning in my stomach several more times throughout the evening and night..even the next day.  There was also extreme confusion all day the following day.  I was dizzy, confused, and spacey all of day 2.  The 3rd day felt a little strange as well.  I didn&#39;t feel like my self again until around day 4.

Vaccine appears to stop effects of sertraline for about a week. I experienced manic depression for about a week both after first and second dose of vaccine, despite not having any issues while on sertraline prior to being vaccinated. It was like my sertraline medication completely stopped working.

                                                Shortly after shot arm became hard to move. Next day, April 14th, arm was very sore and had issues raising it above collar bone without pain in arm or shoulder.  Next day soreness went away and everything was fine until April 17th. I went to dinner with my family and started getting a headache on the way back. I laid down for an hour and a half, but the pain was just as bad. After getting up I took Tylenol and it seemed to make the pain go away. On Sunday, April 18th, I woke up with sever pain from my shoulder, neck, and head. I also had body aches and my eyes were really sore. Looking side to side was really painful. I was only awake from 1 to 5. I slept the rest of the day and didn?t have much of an appetite. I?m pretty sure I had a fever at one point because I got chills, but I didn?t take my temperature. The next day, April 19th, I called into work because I was still having the same shoulder, neck, and head pain along with the eye soreness. I took ibuprofen around 12pm, and started feeling a bit better. I still had no real appetite; I ate cause I knew I needed to and very little. That night I was running a 100.4 fever. Throughout the night I had chills and hot spells. I woke up in the middle of the night and my pants and shirt were drenched in sweat. I woke up this morning, April 20th, feeling much better. I only have slight discomfort with my eyes and my appetite is back. I am currently running a low grade fever of 99.2 which is causing me to sweat badly.  Hopefully the worst is over.

                                                I slept through several hours after receiving the vaccine. Later on that evening I began to feel nauseous and felt abdominal cramps. I had taken multiple paracetamol pills earlier in the night (Took 6 for the day maximum so could not take anymore). It was to relieve the muscle aches, cramps and joint pains. The pain was intense and I could not get back to sleep.   I took a quarter of a tablet of unisom to put me to sleep as the pain was agonizing. I was crying and whimpering and couldn&#39;t stay still. Suddenly I had to use the bathroom and throw up at once while my husband was asleep in the bedroom. I blacked out and do not remember the next 5 minutes. My husband came into the bathroom and said he saw me having a seizure. My eyes were open and dilated with jerking movements coming from my muscles. My husband put me on my side in recovery position as to avoid choking on my vomit and tongue. When I regained consciousness I did not know where I was or who I was for a moment, it was like temporary amnesia.   I vomited everywhere on the bathroom floor until the capillaries in my neck burst. I now have red petichiae all over my neck. The fall from the seizure caused me to severely bruise and damage my face. I cut my eyelid open and bashed my cheek, leaving a black eye and a laceration on the side of my face. I have been having severe exhaustion ever since and my motor skills are affected. I feel very clumsy and it is hard for me to write. All of my senses feel heightened and intensified.

                                                Sore Arm day after getting Vaccinated: Lasted a few days and faded away until there was no pain. Felt very Fatigued the day after getting the Vaccination: Lasted several days. But, got better with time.  Adverse event I wished to report: Seems this Vaccine might have, temporarily, hindered the effectiveness of a medication I take.  I&#39;m on Amytriptyline 25mg, 2 a day at one time, for Postherpetic neuralgia on the right side of my face &amp; right ear. This Amytriptyline medication has helped to cease all pain, including migraines, that I get from the Postherpetic neuralgia, and has also helped with the pain of pinched nerves in my back. Due to that, this medication has really helped improve my quality of life.  After getting the Vaccine, I went home and felt fine the first night. When waking up the next day, I found myself experiencing pain on the right side of my face and in my right ear. Thought this was odd as I took my medication the night before. But, as the day went on, it got a bit worse. That night i had trouble sleeping due to it. Then, the next day, I awoke with not only the pain at a level that it was before having treatment for it, but it also caused light sensitivity, migraines, and I could feel the right upper part of my jaw hurting as if teeth were aching that have been pulled years ago. I was also having vertigo when the ear pain got too bad.  This went on for several days and then faded away around the 20th of April 2021. Although I was confused as to why the Amytriptyline didn&#39;t seem to work as well on those days, I figured that it must be something to do with the vaccine effecting my nerves, or interacting with this medication. I did not seek medical advice for this reaction, as it went away. But just wanted to report it using this form. Thankyou.

                                                I received the 2nd dose of Pfizer Wednesday. Thursday I experienced many of the typical side effects: overwhelming exhaustion, pain in the injection arm, dizziness, slight muscle aches and on/off chills without a fever. By Friday, I woke up feeling almost normal. I ran around 11am Friday on my home treadmill and felt fine. Saturday we went for a hike and I felt fine. That afternoon I was tired but nothing terrible. Today, Sunday, I went for a run outside on a route I do often. I went a slow, comfortable pace. I felt good. Then I got to the final hill at the end and felt like something was in my throat, itching it and I needed to cough. I tried to cough lightly at first but it didn&#39;t help. I drank from my hydration pack and coughed more deeply. I felt my vision go out a bit and stopped completely. Then suddenly it felt like my lung collapsed and I couldn&#39;t breathe. It sounded like I had croup, barely breathing through a wheeze. I was struggling for any oxygen at all, like a clogged straw. I was terrified. It lasted about 20 seconds and then started to ease up.  I was able to get more and more oxygen. It still felt like cobwebs on my lungs,  a tight/heavy feeling for the next 20 minutes or so and then back to normal. I have never experienced something like this before. It was downright terrifying.

Day 4 stiff neck started early morning but night couldn?t sleep from pain and not able to find a comfortable spot.  Day 5. Neck pain significantly increased. Couldn?t turn my head right or left. Any movement caused agonizing pain even the slightest touch on my face caused stabbing pain down my left side of my neck. Neck was tender to touch. Had minimal to no range of motion  of left or right side of neck. To move. Needed to support my neck with something like a board which kept my neck straight in order to get up from a sitting to standing position. Had no relief. Dr prescribed a strong pain relief medication with a muscle relaxant that did nothing. Ended up in the ER that night because I couldn?t get relief from pain. Upon moving my neck I?d have a level 15 stabbing pains. When my neck was resting i had an intense squeezing/ throbbing and burning sensation at level 8 pain. Could not move from sitting position to reclining position let alone laying down without excruciating pain:

I went back to sleep and woke up at least 20 or so times throughout the night with a severe migraine, I felt like I was being stabbed by a bunch of needles and was extremely shaky. A bit light headed and nauseous as well as irritated throat.

I am having trouble walking straight and I bump into things or trip over them.  I have fallen because I was not steady.  If I get up too fast everything gets dark and it feels like I&#39;m going to pass out.  I&#39;m also experiencing brain fog: it&#39;s hard to think and I&#39;m really forgetful.  It also seemed to trigger a manic episode, like the first vaccine did.  I can&#39;t sleep my normal amount.  My initial effects, for the first 48 hours, were the typical pain, headache, and intense fatigue.  Those are mostly better, aside from fatigue and mild headache.

It doesn&#39;t stop me from going about my day-to-day duties, but it is annoying at times the range of movement is limited as it feels like my muscle is being stretched. I don&#39;t work out and haven&#39;t lifted anything heavy recently.

I am nauseous, shaking, pale, and the cramps are bad enough that I had to leave work.  While I usually have a painful period, it&#39;s regular and the discomfort is controllable with ibuprofen.

                                                5 minutes after vaccination, I felt unwell. I sat with EMS that was onsite. HR was 160&#39;s, BP 160&#39;s systolic. Right arm went numb in first 5 minutes and my face went numb after 15 minutes post injection. After sitting 45 minutes with EMS my vitals stabilized and no numbness present. I walked to the car, sat in the car for 10 minutes and then I went into anaphylaxis. My airways began to close. My husband got the EMS on site and I was taken by ambulance to the ER. I was given IM Benadryl in the ambulance. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl and IV steroids.   After anaphylaxis event I had difficulty breathing for 3 weeks from enlarged lymph nodes. I had extreme shortness of breath for the 2 weeks following injection in that I had to crawl up the flight of stairs to the second level of our home.   About the 3rd week after injection, I began having full body itching  with no known stimuli. Only benadryl would treat it. I was on allegra or zyrtec daily. I would also develop 1 or 2 hives on my right arm.   4 weeks after injections I was reacting to food and drink. I could not drink alcohol- gin or vodka- it would result in full body itching and a few hives. I did a course of prednisone, and it decreased my allergic reactions and I felt almost normal for several months.  On May 8th, 2021 I had be experiencing great stress since February from a family member&#39;s cancer diagnosis. I had a crying event and immediately after I had an allergic reaction to gin, which had not occurred since the course of steroids.  Today is 5/13 and I have had 2 additional allergic reactions: one involving food and the other flowers. None of which I have ever been allergic to before. I have full body itching and I am now developing hives more often.

Skin biopsies sent urgently on 5/19/21 for H&amp;E and DIF. Prednisone started 5/19/2021 in ER: 60mg x3 d, 50mg x 3 d, 40mg x3 d, 30mg x3 d, 20mg x3 d, 10mg x 3 d (18 day taper). Out of concern for possible vasculitis compromise of the pt&#39;s kidneys I prescribed bleach baths and topical mupirocin oint rather than add systemic antibiotics for secondary infection of lesions. Given the worrisome and worsening presentation, the pt and her husband agree to present to the E.R. They declined transport by ambulance and will go to the E.R. now. Number and Complexity of Problems Addressed. 1 acute or chronic illness or injury that poses a threat to life or bodily function. Mild headache last evening, no blurry vision.

                                                2 days after the first vaccination I had pain while urinating, lower back pain on the right side pain just below the ribs and the kidney area on the right side and right side pelvic pain, lower abdomin pain around bladder area. Doctor thought it could be a UTI so I was prescribed antibiotics I&#39;ve never had a UTI. After finishing the antibiotics there is no relief pain was worse. I received the second vaccination on 4/28. After receiving that vaccination my left side started hurting and the right side pain continued. After much testing with no results that came up with any issues I was sent to see a urologist. Who after hearing my symptoms and the timing of them believed that it was an adverse effect to receiving the covid vaccination. He put me on some pain medication to help me sleep as I had not slept in a month and now I am feeling much better. Symptoms started on 4/9 and it is now 5/27 and I am starting to feel normal again.

                                                Approx 9 hours after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I began having uncontrollable chills, could not get warm, spiked a fever of 100.4, severe body aches, barely could not move.  It was all I could do to finish my shift at work, drive home, get in the shower, and pass out in bed to sleep.  I slept a good solid 10 hours, woke up for work...fever was then gone and chills, but I had a severe headache, still had severe body aches/fatigue, but I also lost my sense of taste and smell.  I ate a waffle which tasted like cardboard, drank cranberry juice (my mouth puckered like it was tart, but I could not taste it at all).  I reported to work but was immediately sent home by my employee health nurse to be seen by a health care provider and to be tested for COVID-19.  I went home and slept an additional 5 hours, did not do anything at home but rest, and slept a solid 12 hours straight that night.  Still could not smell and taste.  The following day, I could smell things like Vicks vapor rub and I could taste things minimally like when I initially bit into them, or on the back end if that makes sense.  Still had body aches and fatigue, but nothing like that previous day or the night before that.  I was then told that evening my PCR test was negative, and I could report to work the following day.  1/14/2021, I felt almost completely back to normal, and I could smell and taste.

                                                12/20: 10 mins after the injection my arm started hurting so I was moving it around and suddenly a felt a tickle in my throat, swallowed and felt like I swallowed the wrong way and was coughing to the point of feeling like I was going to vomit. Per everyone around I was bright red and I looked weird. The ER nurse said my heart rate was 125 and my systolic BP was elevated at 130s (normally in the 110s). After sitting for 45 mins heart rate was back to 60s. Still felt like I was in a fog but felt ok. Once I walked to my car I felt alot of nausea again and was on and off the rest of the day.  In the middle of the night I woke up short of breath laying on my back had to lay on my side.  12/21. I was moving pavers and got short of breath. Checked my heart rate and it was 100. O2 sat was 99%. If I sat and didn&#39;t move I was fine as soon as I started moving it started again. Also felt nauseating all day. I was having a hard time concentrating and my husband was getting frustrated that I wasn&#39;t understanding what he was saying. My left arm hurt really bad all day  12/22 By the afternoon felt more normal except my arm still hurting really bad.  12/26 was shoveling dirty and suddenly my arm where I got the injection started hurts and I got very nauseated again.  On 12/29 the cdc called me because I did the vsafe program. They were wondering if I was actually going to get the second vaccination because they said my reaction is a severe reaction.  12/30 my arm started itching had chills and temp right after  1/1 rapid test was negative for covid  1/2 pcr was negative

Throbbing in temples, eye pressure, pressure on top of head, worsened when I would bend over. Did not take any medication, worried it would impact immune response. Drank a lot of water, slept, did some sled massage, and gentle yoga/stretches. By that evening pain level had dropped down to about a 4. Woke up the next morning with 2-3 level pain, was able to go to work without being distracted by pain. Still felt more pressure behind eyes and top of head when I bent over. Next day all symptoms resolved, except very minor tenderness at injection site only when palpated.

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

Could not sleep because of chills. Next morning, developed severe legs pains and deep muscle pain - both legs - both calves, both sides. Resulted in me having to miss that day of work. I called my Dr&#39;s office and they advised to go to ER for severe leg pain. I didn&#39;t because I had a pharmacist that I work with who had advised me that I could wait. Similar symptoms to when I got COVID (on Dec 28th). Did have the same moderate arm pain in location of vaccine. Fever stayed above 100 for 48 hours. And the chills went away after 12 hours.  Around the clock Tylenol that stated when I got the vaccine - 1000 mg every six hours scheduled. Fever resolved after 2 days. Chills after 12 hours. Leg pain from severe on 15th - to moderate pain next day and on 18th the pain is more mild. Pain in legs haven&#39;t resolved entirely but much better.

                                                Starting several hours after getting the second vaccination I started to experience systemic myalgias, arthrias, and chills.  It got to the point where it was difficult to type.  I left work early that day.  The following morning, 01/14/21, I woke around 06:30 with searing, shooting pains systemically.  There were severe nausea, chills, and fatigue.  I was unable to get out of bed for the better half of the day and took a sick day.  I was able to go into work, 01/15/21, but continued to experience extreme fatigue, cognitive blunting, chills, arthralgias, and myalgias.  Over that weekend I slept 12&#43; hours each day and into MLK day, 01/18/21.  I went into work on 01/19/20 and continued to experience ongoing fatigue (difficult to walk from my office to the bathroom down the hall), chills, the nausea appeared to return, and intermittent chills/arthralgias/myalgias.  I spoke with the physician at the hospital and he directed me to get tested for COVID.  Details below.  This was on 01/19/21.  I continues to experience these symptoms throughout this week: 01/20-01/22/12.  The interval between the chills/arthralgias/myalgias is increasing but the nausea appears to be lingering.  Chills have basically resolved.

It felt like a very bad flu. My fever continued onto the next day and stayed around 103.7. I slept most of the day- had to call out of work. Tuesday morning my fever was gone and I went to work then went home because my fever spiked again to 101 about mid day. I slept all day and took Tylenol.

                                                About 8 hours after my vaccination, I started to get a headache and chills. Then an hour later, body aches and significant headache. I took 400mg ibuprofen and went to sleep. I believe I had a fever over night, but my temperature was never taken. I woke up the next morning with flu like symptoms, headache, chills, severe body aches and dizziness/fogginess. I took 400mg Ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours. Then the symptoms started to subside that night around 8:30pm (about 32 hours after vaccination). The next morning when I woke up I had a slight headache and very mild body aches which continued to get better  as the day went on.  That night around 8pm I was fine.

                                                Severe neck pain and lower back of the head pain that was debilitating. I could not move my head left or right without pain. I went to urgent care and told it was just muscle tension, but the pain was intense enough where I couldn?t go to work.  This was about 2 days after the first dose and lasted a few days before going away.   With the second dose I just received, it looks like my skin was scraped slightly. It burns.

The redness and itching last 4-5 days. I had to stay on Benadryl and Zyrtec to help with the redness and itching.  My job sent me to the ER to be monitored after getting the shot until I went home. The fatigue lasted for a whole week.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine I felt a rush of numbness/tingling/cold starting from my feet that worked it&#39;s way up to my head. Once the feeling got to my chest my HR increased.  Some SOA, suspected due to feeling of panic.  Feeling passed after about 3 minutes but kept coming back in waves about every 10-15 minutes.  Took Benadryl 25 mg at about 2:30 to see if it would help, symptoms calmed down at about 4:00.  The following morning on 1/30, the immediate symptoms had gone away.   By 1/30 evening, starting developing  constant numbness to BLE below knee. As of today, 2/4.  The numbness is still present.

A 33-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 02Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the COVID vaccine a couple hours ago on 02Feb202 and was very lightheaded. When the patient was asked to provide her mailing address, she stated she was feeling really weird, the vaccine was really taking a big toll on her brain function, she was super dizzy and feels just weird, like everything is in slow motion. Lightheadedness started probably about 20 minutes after she had the shot, they made her wait for 15 minutes, now she just feels really weird. The patient was healthy, she just got blood tests back and everything said she is healthy. She thought they said to call if she was having a side effect of dizziness or weakness, as they are more serious, but she called her doctor and they said to call Pfizer. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: unknown results on unspecified date.

                                                Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration.   Within 2 hours of receiving the shot, I experienced intense and nauseating shoulder pain as well as decreased strength and range of motion. I could not lift my arm. The pain radiating down to my wrist and up to my neck. I could not operate a motor vehicle. 10 days later, today, I am still experiencing pain with any should movement, particularly any heavy lifting. The pain is severe enough it is interfering with my sleep.

                                                5 minutes after the injection, I began to feel a sense of panic. My eyes started to ?white out.? I felt extremely hot,  nauseous, and light headed.  I vomited after a few minutes. Paramedics took my vitals and stated that my blood pressure was very low,  in the 70s. I felt dizzy and nauseous for at least 30 minutes. Once I felt better, they gave me some Gatorade and I was able to go home. The next morning, I woke up with a sore neck, sore arm, headache, and slight chills.

A 33-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264 and Expiration Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 17:45 at 33-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; with no other vaccines administered within four weeks of the bnt162b2 administration.  Medical history included anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to 16Feb2021.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: Bell&#39;s palsy on left side of face (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, vision has been off/ vision is blurry (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, numbness and tingly/burning sensation in right leg (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, brain fog (medically significant) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which required a physician office visit. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, she began having symptoms on the following Saturday and was seen by her doctor and diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. The patient stated she has reported this via VSafe and the Pfizer website. The patient also reported other symptoms that have not been reported as follows: had tingling in both legs, brain fog, and vision has been off. The patient was not sure if it was related to the vaccine or steroids. The patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose. The patient had been on a steroid, so she did not know if she should wait to get the second dose. The patient just stopped the steroid on 16Feb2021, and the second dose was scheduled for 23Feb2021.  The patient also said she had other symptoms that she had not reported and she said she had tingling that started in one leg now in both legs, brain fog and her vision was off and she was not sure if that was related to the vaccine or the steroid (later clarified as prednisone). The patient was not taking the steroids at the time of diagnosis. &#34;Correct I mean it started after the vaccine, but I was also on medication (Clarified as Prednisone) so I am not really sure what the difference is at this time.&#34; Treatment in response to event: the patient stated, &#34;No I mean for the tingling in my leg I have been just putting heat and Ice on it but I have not done anything actual big treatment and then for my eyes no, my doctor is not sure what is related to the Bell&#39;s Palsy and what is to medication.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work: unknown result on an unspecified date (patient stated, &#34;Yes, I have many&#34;).  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of facial paralysis, hypoaesthesia, burning sensation, and paraesthesia; which included steroids and anti-viral and anti-nausea medicine. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination.

                                                I began feeling dizzy and nauseous about 2 hours after injection and tried to lie down but was unable to rest. I felt like I had taken adrenaline or steroids and couldn?t sleep that might. The next morning I did not want to get out of bed. My body, particular along my spine, was in so much pain that I began crying. On Monday I called in sick to work. I had almost total numbness in my left arm arm, hand, and upper body. Periodically my heart would race and feel as if was about to beat out of my chest. I started to black out in the grocery store and continue feel dizzy and weak. This is my second day off of work and I have only gotten out of bed to perform essential tasks. I am nauseated and am having trouble eating. I feel like I?ve been run over by several cars and can?t feel my left pinkie. I don?t remember ever feeling this bad for any past illness.

                                                The day after second injection, I started having sensitivity to temperature on hands and feet, left arm pain(not just at the injection site), and numbness of hands and feet on and off.  When cold air hit my legs I would get a bone chilling pain.  When washing my hands if the water got above warm it was was painful.  My hands and feet were falling asleep at night and waking me up due to being uncomfortable.. This lasted about two weeks.  A week in I called the vaccine clinic who contacted my doctor.  My doctor had me wait another week before setting up an appointment.  I want to urgent care in the mean time due to anxiety over the situation and the doctor there diagnosed a pinched nerve in my neck.  I met with my regular doctor a few days later and symptoms were at a minimal.  She told me to fill out this form and take Advil if the pain continued.

                                                Within 15 minutes - hot and flushed, headache. Dizzy.  Fever onset first night. Lowgrade, sub 100.4. General bad feeling. Exhaustion, sore, muscle aches. Felt very hot and flushed even though fever was only 100. These symptoms lasted for 7 days. On day 3, Tuesday, I developed a dull aching pain in both arms. The feeling was like that of a charlie horse in your leg. Dull, painful, like slowly being crushed. Also felt hot pinpoints that itched all over my hands. My hands felt like they were burning, and the itchy pinprick feelings were mostly on my palms and fingers, but would sometimes present up towards my elbows. My hands were somewhat shaky, and still are. Once or twice my hand would flick involuntarily.  The sore hurting arm feeling extends all the way up to my shoulder blades.  On day 7 I went they gave me a steroid shot and a round of antibiotics. They said it was likely a sinus infection.  The symptoms persisted one more day but then the fever resolved Wednesday night, Tylenol took it down and it didn&#39;t come back Thursday. The headache, sore back and neck, and arm pain persisted. It is now day 10. I am most concerned about the arm pain, tingling, and shaking. Please advise on whether I should get my second dose. I might go to a hospital for further testing if this doesn&#39;t resolve or if it progresses.

                                                Arm pain is pretty bad.  It began 30-60 minutes after the injection and had steadily gotten worse. Injection site shows no redness or bruising, but the pain has been so bad it has interrupted sleep and is preventing me from being able to lift my arm or carry weight. 800mg Motrin and a heating pad seem to help, but I still have limited range of motion.  This feels similar to the ache from a tetanus shot, just worse.

I began experiencing brain fog and memory loss. Then i began experiencing vertigo that impaired my spacial reasoning. On Tuesday 3/9 I lost the ability to see objects far away. on 3/10 I woke up and was unable to read close up, or distinguish letters. The vision and vertigo has continued. I have to shut my eyes completely to walk without becoming sick. I can not be in a busy room with movement or my eyes will hurt. I can not read anything with font smaller then size 18. I can not watch TV because i can no longer see far away. I can not drive a car due to the motion., and i cant see the objects as they move.

                                                Call received from patient who was advised to call to report a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine. Patients history includes contracting COVID back in June of 2020 for which she spent 2 days in the hospital.  In November of 2020, she reports she ended up in the hospital for another 2 days and was diagnosed with post-COVID POTS.  She then went to medical facility and underwent 6 treatments of hyperbaric oxygen in February of 2021. Patient states that after these treatments, she felt great.  She has reportedly been out of work since November, I believe, and was given the OK to return on 3/10/21.  She was also advised by her neurologist that she should take the COVID vaccine which she did on 3/15/21.  Two days later, on 3/17/21, she states that her POTS was &#34;triggered&#34; and she begain to experience dizziness, fainting, fatigue, headaches, nausea and vomiting and various GI issues. Currently, she states these symptoms are getting worse, instead of better, and she has been unable to work, missing last Thursday and Friday, and will be going home early today.  She asks if she should get her second COVID vaccine.  I advised that is something she needs to discuss with her primary care provider.

                                                Received shot ~12:15pm on March 21st. Only symptom throughout the day was sore arm, but tolerable. Around 10:30 PM, I was in bed and noticed that I feel &#34;agitated&#34; and restless. Looked at my FitBit and noticed that my heartrate was unusually high and climbing. My normal resting heartrate is 60-70 bpm. Last night from 10 PM and onward, it rose from 75 pm up to 130  bpm while I was laying down in bed. Soreness in my arm became much worse and more uncomfortable. I focused on breathing slowly and deeply to try to relax myself but did not have any effect. Throughout the night I could feel my heart racing, fluttering and palpitating. Sometimes I could feel &#34;pinching&#34; like sensations too. Every time I was able to fall asleep, I was quickly jolted awake by those fluttering and racing sensations in my chest. I got up ~2 hours later to get a drink of water and had a low-grade panic attack (lost sense of hearing), felt very weak and light-headed, started sweating profusely. Those symptoms let up a bit around 4AM and I was able to sleep lightly. I continued to feel &#34;agitated&#34; and restless all morning until about noon today, a full 24 hours after the shot, 12 hours after symptoms started. My resting heart rate finally started to return to normal at about that time as well. Felt fine and pretty normal by about 1:30ish PM today.

                                                I ultimately suffered from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis and was hospitalized for 5 days due to brain and spine inflammation.  I had numbness in my feet 2 days after my vaccine, then suffered from dizziness and nausea 3 days after my vaccine, and had face paralysis 4 days after my vaccine. I went to the ER 4 days after the vaccine and was told I have Bell&#39;s Palsy and Vertigo. I was prescribed oral steroids and anti-nausea medicine. In the following weeks, I had more tingleness/numbness of the legs, brain fog and confusion, blurred vision, unsteady gait, loss of balance, blurred vision and leg muscle weakness, increased anxiety, hearing sensitivity, lethargy, sleeplessness, 6th cranial nerve palsy, tingles in the face, and headaches. I finally got an MRI and when doctor?s saw the MRI results 3 days later, I was told to go to the ER immediately because I had brain and spine inflammation that needed treatment, and was diagnosed with ADEM. I then spent 5 days in the hospital to receive intravenous steroids and monitoring. During this stay, I had more MRIs and a lumbar puncture. I was released on oral steroids for 25 days, as well as follow up appointments and monitoring progress in recovery. Inflammation has decreased. I continue to have tingleness in lower extremities, headaches, pain in legs, and sensitive hearing.

                                                On the first day, I felt exhausted, then a little woozy with a sore arm, but nothing else. Then a couple days later my armpit lymphs started to grow and get sore and continued to grow until 9 days out. At 6 days in the evening, I started to feel tired and that night I had a runny nose and soreness where my nasal passage hits the back of my throat. This continued for a day with exhaustion, and I felt sick with the flu. There was no cough. The peak flu feeling lasted for 3 days and corresponded with the swelling of my lymphs, then symptoms subsided along with the lymph swelling. Now at 2 weeks out, I feel back to normal.

                                                My right hand started hurting, then started tingling and it radiated up my arm. I had a heavy wave of dizziness, my chest started feeling weird and I started having a little trouble swallowing. I alerted a pharmacist, who sat with me with an EpiPen, but I wasn&#39;t sure what was happening so I didn&#39;t want it. My hands started shaking, I got dizzier, had a headache, felt nauseous, my arm started hurting more and I could feel my throat getting tighter. I started panicking when I couldn&#39;t feel much air coming out of my throat, started feeling confused and so the pharmacist administered the EpiPen. Within a minute or so, I  was able to breathe a little better and within 15-30 minutes, I was able to breathe normally. At the hospital, my potassium levels crashed to a critical level  and I had a potassium transfusion, which normalized my levels. I felt better the next day. It&#39;s almost a month later and my right hand/arm is still having issues, which was determined to be an Ulnar Nerve Entrapment...most likely caused by the anaphylaxis since my arm tightened up. I have an EMG test this week for it.

A 33-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Mar2021 12:00 (at the age of 33-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: asthma and lactose Intolerance- not allergy though (as reported). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included: fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR), loratadine, bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and vitamins (as reported), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EN6200), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 20Feb2021 12:00 (at the age of 33-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient stated that 24 hours after her second dose (14Mar2021 12:00), she felt the worst feeling about to faint, all color drained from her face. She got tunnel vision/hearing and felt a &#34;static&#34; feeling all over her body. Then started throwing up. She took a nap and woke up an hour later with 101.2 (degree) fever (14Mar2021) and fought that, along with migraine, aches, chills, hot sweats (14Mar2021). About 8 hours after initial fever (14Mar2021), it spiked to 102.4 (degree) for two hours. It came down quick. The next day, 15Mar2021, it felt like the back of her skull was fractured. And since then (unspecified date), the back (mostly left side) of her head gets so tight and sore especially when laying down. She has been sleeping on heating pad for 10 days now, and it got a little better but still super sore (head). The events involved a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment was received for the back (mostly left side) of her head gets so tight and sore. There was no treatment for the other events. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Injection site seems higher than normal, almost at the shoulder unlike the first dose. I had soreness within a few hours and by bedtime (7-8pm) my arm was throbbing in pain and shooting numbness into my forearm. The pain woke me through the night while I also began sweating and vomiting with nausea. I can?t lift my arm very high, more painful than the traditional soreness associated with a vaccine, and there?s constant pain even without movement.

At 1.5 days these areas still feel odd/full/like a bandage is on them.

I also was unable to take many deep breaths and trying to do so was very tiring. This continued to impair my work and personal life until I checked into the ER. The doctor there told me this was apparently a side effect, that she hadn&#39;t heard of precisely. She advised that because I had an anxiety disorder (which up until that point had been handled and had not flared up for quite a few months), the vaccine had most likely set off neuropsychological side effects.

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine, I had a strong metallic taste in my mouth. My husband and I sat in our car for the 15 minutes required and I thought I was feeling a bit off, but also was trying to figure out if anyone else had experienced the metallic taste. After our 15 minutes wait period, we left to head back home. On the way home, about 30-40 minutes after I received the vaccine, I started to feel really warm. Then my neck started to feel really hot and when I swallowed it felt like I had a knot in my throat. As far as I know, I&#39;m not allergic to anything, but realized there was something seriously wrong with my body and had my husband get off the freeway so I could get some water and possibly go to an urgent care. It also doesn&#39;t help that my heart was racing and I started panicking because it felt like my throat was starting to close up. When the initial anxiety of what was happening calmed down, we carefully drove home and I called the urgent care nurse line at my doctor&#39;s office. The nurse on the line told me to take a Benadryl and to take another one 6 hours later. He said that I was having an adverse reaction and if things got worse go into the ER . Luckily things calmed down after a while but the metallic taste stayed for two days. I&#39;ve been advised to not get the 2nd dose, which I&#39;m honestly not comfortable getting at this point either.

                                                I had some &#34;brain fog&#34; throughout the afternoon of not remembering where I put things or what I was doing moments before I questioned what was going on. Temporary memory loss of events happened for at less than 30 minutes. I remember going to the bedroom with my fiance and us talking about the possibility of being intimate. I thought we just went to bed and I woke up at 5:30am naked. I questioned my fiance about why I was not dressed. He told me we did get intimate and I seemed myself except saying things I would never normally say. He thought I was role playing. I do not remember any of those events and it was very scary. I have not had any further issues that I am aware.

                                                No symptoms or issues with my first Pfizer vaccine. 15 minutes after the 2nd dose of my Pfizer vaccine I experienced a metallic taste in my mouth.  That lasted for a few hours after the shot. A rash began above my right hip on my abdomen around 3-4 hours after the injection in my upper left arm. It was a small patch of itchy red hives. The rash now is spread from hip to hip and is continuing to grow. It?s on fire like itch and flares up and then calms down a bit on its own. At about 11 hours after the vaccine I came down with a high temp fever at 102.8 that lasted for 14 hours. Tylenol and Advil did little affect. I had body chills, cold sweats, a terrifying headache, severe vomiting multiple times that I?ve pulled my rib muscles or collarbone area and is now painful to breath in. I dry heaved multiple times for over 3 minutes at a time. My joints were sore and I had muscle pain, insomnia but fatigue at the same time. After 14 hours the fever broke along with the chills, joint and muscle pains. My headache remained as well as my abdominal rash, my fatigue and my cold sweats well into the 3rd day. It?s now day 4 and almost all symptoms have resided except my rash, which continues to grow and itch worse, and my headache.

                                                The night of my first shot, I went to bed but woke up at 3am to use the restroom. Upon washing my hands, I started seeing stars and completely blacked out. I had chills but was sweating profusely. I thought I could make it back to my bed but apparently lost consciousness and passed out on my way out of the bathroom, fall forward onto my knees and smashing my head on my bedroom floor. My boyfriend woke up from the bang and found me unconscious for ~10 seconds before he got me to come to. I was extremely disoriented once I came to and he was able to get me back into bed. Since that date (4/6/21 3am), I have experienced a headache like never before. 4/7 and 4/11 were the worst headaches I?ve ever had in my life. I was hysterically crying with ice packs on my head in the dark, as light was very bothersome. Taking Tylenol every 4 hrs during daytime while awake barely shook this headache. I had a good day on 4/10, but then had the set back with the worst headache ever on 4/11. I spoke with my doctor?s office on 4/7 and they decided I most likely had a concussion and could recover at home. I called again 4/12 in the AM after having the worst headache of my life on 4/11 and they could not get me in for a visit until 4/13. I just left that appointment and while I passed their ?neuro? physical exam, I am still experiencing these headaches along with dizziness and shortness of breath when doing the smallest task or bending down and getting back up. I?ve requested a CT Scan to ensure there isn?t a brain bleed causing these issues from my fall which occurred due to the dizziness from receiving this Covid vaccine.

                                                Currently 35 weeks &#43;1 pregnant at time of second shot. Woke up 12 hours after shot with extreme chills that caused my whole body to shake and teeth were chattering. I felt like I was out of my body and couldn?t use the bathroom because my body was shaking so hard. I have never felt that cold in my life. Then I was under double blankets with a heating pad and started sweating and soaked through everything I was wearing but couldn?t have my skin touch the air with intense shaking. Fever was around 100 the entire night and into the next day when it continued to fluctuate between 99.5 and 100. Couldn?t sleep, muscles felt like they were on fire and arm joints hurt. Slight headache, sore throat and very nauseous. Heartburn was worse it?s ever been in pregnancy. Was hard to get out of bed and walk around. Felt slightly better by 5pm but could only eat something small and then went right to sleep. Woke up next morning and most adverse symptoms were gone aside from moderate fatigue. Also have been having pretty intense lower stomach cramps for 48 hours post vaccination. Arm pain was also intense near injection site and felt groin lymph node pain on side of injection.

                                                After I received my first dose I started to experience my first symptom on March 30, 2021. I noticed that I had a small lump on the left side of my rib cage beside my left breast which was about the size of a sausage link. The area wasn&#39;t painful, slightly tender to the touch and soft. By 4/3/21 the area has expanded to the upper portion of the scapula and it was no longer located on the side of my rib. It was about the size a pear and it was inflamed and very tender to the touch. I couldn&#39;t raise my arm and it was pertruding from my clothing and preventing me from sleeping at night on that side. By 4/5/21 the mass had turned into a different shape and direction and it was no longer just primarily on my scapula.. This current shape favored a boomerang and it started on my lower scapula and wrapped around my arm going directly into the middle of my arm pit.. It was about an 1.5 inches wide, inflamed, painful and wouldn&#39;t allow me to fully lift my arm or lay on it.. The mass was hard and didn&#39;t move, I visited a prompt care and they couldn&#39;t decipher what it was. I began to take tylenol and use cold compress and over a few days the mass began to decrease in size and I was able to increase my range of motion obtaining full extension on 4/17/21. The mass is now smaller than a pencil on 4/22/21 and hardly noticable but it was quite an experience.

By the time I went to sleep, I couldn&#39;t put any pressure on my arm, or move it away from my body much at all. The pain was so bad I hardly slept that night. I took 2 Aleve the next morning (and more in the following days), and eventually the pain began to subside, lasting for a total of ~3 days before feeling back to normal.

                                                About 7 hours after my vaccine, I started experiencing chills and body aches. 9 hours after the vaccine, I felt as if I?d taken cold medicine. I was slow to react, felt ?foggy?, I had trouble recalling words and the names of household objects I was staring at, my movements weren?t coordinated and I dropped a few things. During the night, I was tired but had trouble sleeping. The body aches worsened and really concentrated in my joints, especially my spine. I stayed either in bed or on the couch the whole day following my vaccine but my heart rate (as read by my smart watch) would go from the 70?s to as high as 129 just from sitting up higher in bed. My normal resting heart rate is in the upper 50?s/lower 60?s and I don?t see 120&#43; unless I?m working out for at least 20 minutes. I didn?t take Tylenol or Motrin until 7 PM on April 19th (I took 800mg of Motrin) about 34 hours after my vaccine. I had a low grade fever and my head ached so bad all my teeth were throbbing before I took the  Motrin. I started to feel better within a hour of taking Motrin and was fine from then on. I only took Motrin the one time.

No complications with pregnancy from vaccine side effects known at this time. Due June 2, 2021. Experienced extreme fatigue and brain fog the day after the 2nd dose and moderate injection site pain. Temperature was elevated slightly to 99 degrees so I took a dose of Tylenol. Symptoms are mostly resolved 24 hours after appearing.

                                                cardiac arrhythmia; mental disorientation; dizziness; loss of balance; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). This 33-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose on 07Jan2021 14:30 for COVID-19 immunisation. The first dose was on 10Dec2020, 02:30 PM in left arm. Medical history was not reported. There was no known allergies. There was no covid prior vaccination, no covid tested post vaccination. There was no concomitant medication taken. There was no other vaccine in four weeks, no other medications in two weeks. Patient was healthy with no medical issues. Within 2 weeks of second shot, patient developed a cardiac arrhythmia on 21Jan2021 10:30 when she was at work. Patient had continued symptoms of irregular heart beat since then. Patient had had to go to the ED 2 times. Patient was now following with EP cardiology, treated with beta blockers. About 3 weeks after vaccine (in 2021), patient also developed mental disorientation, dizziness and loss of balance. Patient had had MRI brain, Holter monitoring, event monitoring, stress test and cardiac MRI, all with unknown results. Finally patient was on medications and 3 months later beginning to feel a bit better. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care; assessed as life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. The outcome of events was resolved with sequel.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Found to be COVID-19 positive, altered mental status and symptomatic with O2 requirement. Treated with one 200mg dose of remdesivir and dexamethasone 6mg IV daily x 5 days. Oxygen delivered via nasal cannula and SO2 remained over 90% (and mostly over 95%) the entire admission. Acute encephalopathy and Seizure, possible, post-dialysis versus dialysis disequilibrium syndrome occurred during this admission and was the reason for time spent in the ICU (~24 hours).

                                                Arm started hurting around 1:30. I was general tired. No appetite Took a 2-3 hour nap that evening. Got up and ran a low grade fever all night long. Headache and muscle aches. Nauseous - but I&#39;ve dealt with since my pregnancy from 4 weeks pregnant on. Next day, body aches and low grade fever continued. I was triaged at labor and delivery at about 5:00 pm. The fever did me in - I was already getting dehydrated on my own and fever escalated it.  I went to hospital. Sent me home with Pepcid for heartburn. I went into the clinic on Friday after that and got two more liters of fluid which was scheduled previous to injection. Overall, it helped with symptoms. I was still tired on Thursday and into Friday but otherwise I fine. But from Tuesday to Friday afternoon I was pretty crummy. Pregnancy History - second pregnancy - first to go this far. Estimated due date: Sept 16, 2021

The soreness and body aches lasted a good 5 days. And then I went to the doctor.  I got shingles at day 6 or so. I couldn&#39;t work because I had shingles. They gave me Valacyclovir for  one or two weeks. That helped with symptoms - it took close to two weeks  for it to resolve. They hurt but they weren&#39;t debilitating but I couldn&#39;t go to work at the hospital.

A 33-year-old patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), the first dose via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 29Apr2021 at 19:00 (lot number: EW0169PF) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The relevant medical history included felt her lymph nodes on the left side of her neck (For the past five years) and feel a little tender (there is no correlation for when they get tender/ It does not happen seasonal, or when she gets her periods. It just happens everyone in awhile). The patient&#39;s mother passed away suddenly on 15Jul2021 from heart attack. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Vitamin C, fish oil, vitamin D3, vitamin B12 and methylfolate, all (for the past week) from unspecified date. The patient was calling about the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. She had had a negative reaction to the covid vaccine. About a week and a half later, on Saturday 08May2021, she woke up with a stiff neck. She took some Tylenol. Over the next few days, she still had a stiff neck. On the left side of her neck, her lymph nodes are swollen. The next few days, it progressed. It became extremely painful, to the point that she felt mentally delirious. She made an appointment with her primary care physician. She saw her primary care physician on Tuesday, 04May2021. Her primary care physician sent her for blood work and prescribed her an anti anxiety medication. Her primary care physician told her that this was her bodies response to the covid vaccine. Her primary care physician had seen this in a few other patients. She left her primary care physician&#39;s office, in pain, felt anxious, emotional and upset. A few days later, and her pain was so terrible. Her blood work came back negative for an auto immune disease. Her blood work showed that her vitamin D levels were extremely low. She had known that for awhile and took supplements for it. Her pain became so bad, that she went to a walk in clinic. She felt like she got better care at the walk in clinic versus her primary care physician&#39;s office. The walk in clinic doctor put her on a prednisone nine day taper. The brand name of the prednisone is Deltasone. She was taking Deltasone 20mg tablets. The walk in clinic doctor also prescribed her a muscle relaxer named Robaxin. She was taking Robaxin 500mg. It was the third day of taking the steroid and muscle relaxer. She was still feeling discomfort and pain from the bottom of her ear, to her elbow on her left side. Especially around her injection site, she still had the sensation. For stiff neck: she thought that the steroid and muscle relaxer have covered up some of the pain, but she could still feel it. She was now better than she was on Saturday, 15May2021. She felt similar to what she was feeling on Saturday, 08May2021. For on the left side of her neck, her lymph nodes are swollen: They were not as tender now. She felt like it was also hard to tell because of her taking a muscle relaxer and steroid. She thought that prednisone decreased inflammation. For she was in extreme pain, to the point that she felt mentally delirious: On 07May2021, she would rate it a seven out of ten on a pain scale. On 15May2021, she would rate it a ten out of ten on a pain scale. Now she was feeling like it was a six out of a ten on a pain scale. She thought that it was improved. But she was still skeptic to see how she felt once all of her steroids were gone. She was very aware of what was going on with her body. She knew that something was going on. On 15May2021, the pain was unbearable. For she felt anxious, emotional and upset: Since 15May2021, her anxiety had subsided. Ever since she saw the doctor at the walk in clinic, and the doctor gave her a plan of taking prednisone and muscle relaxers. Her anxiety was pretty high end whenever she thought about getting the second dose of the covid vaccine. She had to cancel her second dose of the covid vaccine appointment. It correlated with the steroid. She wanted to give herself time to be off the steroid. She rescheduled her appointment for the second dose of the covid vaccine for Saturday, 05Jun2021. She was a hair stylist. She had heard from a ton of people, about ton of peoples stories, where the second dose of the covid vaccine gave people more of a reaction. She was very fearful to get the second dose. She was going to ask to get the second dose in her right arm. The events result in physician office visit and did not result in emergency room visit. The outcome of the events &#34;she was in extreme pain, to the point that she felt mentally delirious&#34;, &#34;She woke up with a stiff neck&#34;, &#34;On the left side of her neck, her lymph nodes are swollen&#34; was recovering, for the event &#34;She felt anxious, emotional and upset&#34; was recovered on 15May2021, while the other events were unknown.

                                                I had fever and chills 12 hours after the vaccine was administered. I felt fine after 36 hours of the vaccine&#39;s administration. But on May 25-26, I started developing a tightness in my chest and had difficulty breathing. My chest hurt and hurt even more when I took deep breaths. The breathign issue came with a pain in my upper back for which I once took ibuprofen and another time I took half a painkiller [Diclogem]. I felt extremely tired/fatigued and weak, had irregular sleeping patterns, felt dizziness and lightheadedness during the day and this continued until Saturday, May 29. Thereafter, the dizziness during the day subsided but I still felt too tired to do anything. Over the long weekend of May 29-31, I have started developing painful acne on my buttocks. The left buttock inparticular has multiple painful acne. I still have trouble breathing and my chest still hurts so much that I cannot wear a bra for more than a few hours a day as it feels very constrictive. The breathing issue and chest pain really worries me because I don&#39;t have the stamina to do errands or go outside for more than on hour or two on any single day. Today, June 2,  is the 10th day since I got my vaccine.

                                                On February 7th I thought I had a bug bite on my left arm.  I was wearing a black t-shirt in the sun. I got home and it was itchy, I took a Claritin.  I went to work the next day and that night on Feb 8th my head felt itchy, I decided to take a Benadryl.  I woke up about 2 am and I had a really itchy spot on my collar bone and my elbow and my knee.  I thought something was biting me and I looked through all my sheets.  I was so itchy.  Then I woke around 6am on the 9th, my knees, elbow, and neck were still itching.  I looked in the mirror and my body were so activated, my body was so red.  It was also around my lips.  I called the nurse helpline, and I did a phone appointment with the doctor.  They advised to keep using Benadryl and Q4 50mg.  The next day I was miserable and started to have chills. If I was in a normal temperature my body was activated.  I took my temperature on February 10th I had a low-grade temperature.  If I held any anything warm.  On day 5 of the symptoms, my PCP advised that I use Sertorzine instead of Benadryl.  She advised to take a COVID-19 test.  Both came back negative.  She also advised that I should switched to Allegra on February 13th.  Then I noticed less irritation of my skin.  I couldn&#39;t work due to not being able to wear a mask due to activation of my skin.  On February 15th, I felt a little better, but my skin was feeling less activated.  Also holding anything or having anything against my skin caused my skin to activate.  I did start Wellbutrin on January 20th, which I know that skin reactions can start about 2-2 1/2 weeks following the initial does of Wellbutrin.  I stopped the Wellbutrin on February 9th.   I still to this day get itchy and have hives show up.

EMS was called and I received Benadryl and prednisone. 9 days later I saw my general practitioner  9 days later because my throat was still swollen.  She prescribed me Pepcid and I have to go for a thyroid ultrasound.

                                                On Tuesday 12/28 I started to have severe leg pain in my right leg.  The next morning the pain was still in the right leg and had moved up through my right side in my joints to my knee, hip then went to the with shoulder down that arm.  My forearm became very painful on 12/30 and started to swell then radiated into my wrist joint and finger joints.  12/31 the pain continued in all those areas and had moved to my left side of my body starting with the left arm following the same course as the right side.  On 1/1 the pain has persisted and I am unable to perform any ADL&#39;s.  I saw an urgent care physician who told me to take ibuprofen.  I have been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol with no relief. Now all my joints are swelling in bilateral hands, wrist.  On 1/2 my bilateral ankle joints and feet started to have similar pain.  Know all my extremities are difficult to use and it is hard to walk due to the pain.  Because of the pain in my hands things feel heavier than what they should.  I am a medical provider and this almost seems like polyarthralgia rheumatica, I am going to go see a physician on Monday

On evening of 12/29 had sudden onset of mild neck pain and significant weakness and numbness of left arm, weak hand grip, clumsiness in hand . Did not improve after trying to shake arm/move around , and took prednisone 40mg oral. Went to ER and had CT Cspine which did not show evidence of cervical pathology. Continued with corticosteroids, sought consultation with PMR and neurology specialists, and steroid dose increased to 60mg/day.   Some improvement in strength , but still have diminished sensation and strength in left hand/arm. Unable to perform full job tasks as I am left hand dominant.  Likely brachial neuritis / parsonage turner syndrome per both specialists seen. Continuing with corticosteroids at this time, pending bloodwork and OT evaluation

                                                I developed a headache about 1 hour after the vaccine was administered.  Two hours later I developed a 100.4 temperature and malaise and body aches.  The injection site was swollen, tender to touch and warm.  The injection site area remained tender to touch and I was unable to lie on my left side to sleep for over 48 hours.  I continued to feel foggy and fatigued for 48 hours.  All symptoms have since resolved.

                                                I started experiencing soreness to left arm about 1-2 hours after injection but nothing else. I went to bed around 11pm. Then I was woken up in the night around 3am violently shaking, teeth shattering and unable to even stand straight from shaking so bad. I felt like I was freezing but skin was hot to touch. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take temperature at that time because it was in another family member&#39;s room. I felt nauseated as well. I took 600mg ibuprofen and tried to lay back down. At 3:59am my aunt woke and brought the thermometer downstairs. I could tell the ibuprofen was working some and fever was less as the shaking had calmed. I was able to check my temperature and it was 100.8F (an hour after the ibuprofen). I still took 100mg tylenol at that time.  As of this morning (after 7am) I am sore all over, tired and have a headache, temp 99.2F.

                                                Vaccine was received at 4:55pm. 8:30pm, I started to feel fatigued and disoriented. By 9am I started to feel muscle aches and sharp joint pain, as expected. By 1200 noon, the pain intensity was increasing, coming in waves, lasting 10-15 minutes. The pain waves were 10/10, very severe, and was causing me to shake, cry, and be unable to function or sleep. I was also very disoriented, but I think due to the pain. It was mildly relieved with ibuprofen/Tylenol alternating every 3hrs, but continued until 6pm. It began to subside at 6pm.  I am an RN, and sought the advice of my employee health nurse, who advised me to seek medical care if it continued through the night. The pain began to subside, so I did not. However, if a  non-healthcare person experiences that, they will think they are dying.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I felt abdominal pain and felt like I was going to get diarrhea and I got really flushed; shaky; face red. They put ice on back of neck. Arm started to hurt. Took Tylenol and sat down. And felt better 15 minutes later. Intervention was ice on back of neck so I wouldn&#39;t faint and rest. Overnight, first night - chills. Woke up with a headache. Took ibuprofen and Tylenol and had body ache and joint pain, too. Five days consistently (positionally) - when I laid down I would get it for five days. I had the vertigo which started 2 days after vaccine. Had a migraine 7 days after vaccine and I had to miss work because it was so severe. Had a typical migraine. Had an aura and it was so bad I couldn&#39;t see to drive to work. I don&#39;t ever get vertigo with my migraines and so this was different. After 7 days all symptoms were resolved. I am currently breastfeeding.

                                                Had severe body aches m, fever, headache, progressed into dizziness and &#34;foggy memory&#34;, started to have some chest pain. Felt as if I was intoxicated, lasted the whole day. Woke up the next morning and still felt &#34;out of it&#34; and weak but thought it would get better, went to work (im a nurse). Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

                                                The day after I experienced brain fog and a minor headache.  24 hours after I had extreme joint pain in my shoulders, elbows, and even my jaw. 48 hours I developed a crippling migraine and throwing up constantly. I am now 53 hours post the 2nd injection and still have a migraine and nausea.

                                                The evening of the day I got the shot, I began to get tired and started to have a sore arm.  Throughout the night, the arm soreness got worse and I got joint pain.  The whole next day, I experienced severe malaise, headache, chills, fever, and joint pain with the site soreness.    The arm pain got worse.  That night, I struggled to sleep.  The whole day after that, I had less malaise and the fever had gone down but the injection site reddened and grew even warmer and more tender.  That evening it was difficult to sleep as the soreness in my arm migrated to the shoulder, armpit and the right side of my chest, along where a bra band would go on the distal right side of the chest.  The next morning (today) the entire armpit area and upper distal right side of the chest were hot and tender.  This afternoon, I palpated the area and noticed at least one swollen lymph node.  My arm still hurts.

                                                About 15 min I felt numbness and tingling on my face. Gradually  felt it in my whole body by 8:30PM that night, next day I tried to go to work but I had to leave because of the intense numbness and tingling. I also developed left leg weakness and had to even pick up my leg to be able to walk. The NP at my neurologist office (talked over the phone) said it was a pseudo effect due to my MS. My symptoms are still intermittent up to my second dose.  It is all over the numbness and tingling, but as it is subsiding it is now flaring up my symptoms from 2 years ago and I feel it on my second side.

A 34-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EL3284), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing anxiety since she was 13 years old. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the vaccine on Monday at 12 o&#39;clock. She got it for work. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She developed the side effect Tuesday at 2 am. The left side of her face started tingling and had numbness, which is the same side she received the vaccine on. She doesn&#39;t have weakness. It is not resolving. It is from her lower eyelid to her bottom jaw bone. When asked if it was improving persisting or worsening, she said it depends. Sometimes it gets worse and affects her lips, and sometimes it is on and off. It won&#39;t be completely gone. It switched between her cheek and jaw and then her nose and mouth sometimes. If she bends over, it tingles worse. It is just very annoying. It felt like if she had Novocain on the top and bottom of her mouth. It is irritating. She got it because she doesn&#39;t want COVID and she works as a nurse. She does have really bad anxiety. She has nothing else medical. She is just really nervous. It is not going away. She is freaking out. She would like more information. The outcome of the event &#34;It is just very annoying/It is irritating&#34; was unknown, while for the other events was not recovered.

The following morning, I continued to have numbness in my hands but also in my face. By the evening , the day after I had received the vaccine, I felt like my swallowing was slightly impaired and I went to urgent care. I was able to complete all neurological tests and given a prescription for hydroxyzine, thinking that I may have had a slight histamine response.  I slept approximately 10 hours that night and then fell asleep again from 8:30-11:30 this morning due to high levels of fatigue. Today (~54 hours later), the numbness in my hands and face seems to be getting slightly worse.  I also feel some generalized weakness. I&#39;m still able to do normal day to day activities but it feels abnormal.

Developed low grade temp, flushed face, fatigue, muscle stiffness, body aches hours following vaccine. Aches and fatigue continues and it?s now day 8. The fatigue is constant but comes in waves. I?m taking unexpected naps which are abnormal for me. Caffeine and methylphenidate are ineffective. I?m still sore. I also have brain fog, maybe from the fatigue. I can?t think straight and it takes me longer to process and do tasks. I woke up 2 hours ago and I can?t wait to sleep again.

                                                Symptoms of nausea began day of, were moderate for several days.  Did not eat much the day of the vaccine due to these symptoms. Numb feeling, tingling in extremities for 2-3 days post vaccination.  Still some occasional numbness and tingling in nose, facial area, and back of head/neck.  Diarrhea for a couple of days.  Continue to experience mild nausea 1.5 weeks later.  Did not have problems with nausea previously.   Moderate fatigue for about a week following vaccination.  Still noticing mild fatigue, getting tired easily and earlier than usual.   Arm was sore from the day after vaccination until about 4-5 days had passed.  Still otice an occasional pain  when moving arm around a certain way.   For 4-5 days following vaccination noticed various body pains.  Pain in lower back- not muscle pain but something else.   Chest wall pain when breathing in from 1-2 days to about a week post vaccination. Headache for a day.  Brain fog feeling, forgetfulness beginning the day after vaccination and was noticeable for about a week.  Still noticing this mildly and feeling more lightheaded than usual.   Over the last few days, I&#39;ve noticed chest tightness and some mild coughing.  It&#39;s also below zero here, so this could be related to weather and dry air, or possibly related to the vaccine.   Generally, I recognize that the above symptoms are possible after this vaccination.  However, the existing literature seems to suggest these symptoms should last 1-3 days and be mild.  My experience has been that they were worse than mild, most lasted at least a week, and some seem to be continuing.   I am also breastfeeding a 19 month old.  He had a brief bout of redness on about half of his body (underarms, forearms, thighs, knees) for about 30 minutes a week after I received the vaccine.  He has never had that before for no apparent reason, and it did not continue, although he has reacted to lotions and certain brands of diaper wipes in this way previously.  We have also noticed that he&#39;s been more irritable lately- throwing tantrums easily, sleeping more often, and getting inconsolable.  We haven&#39;t tied this to any illness, although we do recognize that toddlers can through periods where they have more challenging behaviors.  This is unusual for him though, he&#39;s generally happy and agreeable.  I thought I&#39;d mention it just in case there&#39;s been some sort of pattern that other breastfeeding moms have noticed.

                                                Prior to the first dose , I felt completely healthy.  I received the first dose on a Saturday at 9am.  Felt fine most of that day other than my arm being sore, which improved with Ibuprofen.  The following day, I woke up a little achy, but felt better after taking more Ibuprofen.  Around 4-5pm on Sunday afternoon, I started feeling more achy with cold chills (highest temp was 99.5) and congestion.  I would take Ibuprofen and Tylenol, which would help.  On Monday, congestion continued, but the body aches and cold chills went away.   I did feel a little tired, but also did not sleep well due to the congestion.  Did not have any other symptoms other than the congestion and actually felt pretty good.  I worked from home on Monday to be on the safe side.   On Tuesday, I was still having congestion (still no other symptoms) and my work did not want me to return until I got checked by a doctor or get a negative covid test.  Went to an urgent care where I was seen by a doctor and tested for covid (rapid test), which came back positive.  The only other symptom that developed was loss of smell (but not sure if that was just due to the congestion -- it seemed to come and go.  Some things I could smell, some things I couldn&#39;t).  I did not lose my sense of test.  The congestion lasted less than a week.  My family quarantined for over 20 days.  We tried our best, but it was hard to isolate myself, especially from my younger kids.  No one else in the household ever developed any symptoms.  Not sure how/where I picked it up at --- We are very careful.  The only other people I saw the 2 weeks prior to testing positive were my parents and in laws at Christmas, all of which have been healthy.

                                                Approx 12 hours after receiving second dose of covid vaccine, I experienced what I can only describe as moderate-strong flu symptoms. I had previously had a mild reaction to the first vaccine (fatigue, mild headache) so I was shocked at how incapacitated I was after the second vaccine. 9:00pm (Wednesday)  (12 hours after vaccine) - after feeling ok all day, starting to feel sick, chills yet feeling hot (fever at 101.4), muscles and joints aching and headache; 9:00pm-4:00am - very intense flu like symptoms, muscle and joint aching extreme, burning and deep pain on arm at injection site, chills not going away.  I eventually fall asleep. 7:00am (Thursday) - call my mother to come pick me up because I am still feeling poorly.  Fever is gone but I have a major headache and body aches are persistent. I take Tylenol and some of the body aches are better. I continue to feel like this throughout the entire day off and on. 7:00am (Friday) - finally feeling better but I have a lingering sense of extreme nausea that won&#39;t go away. My stomach itself is &#34;fine&#34; but the nausea is persistent. I take dramamine and feel somewhat better. 7:00am (Saturday) - still feeling fatigued but almost feeling like myself again. Nausea is still present but has greatly diminished. 7:00am (Sunday) - finally feeling mostly &#34;ok&#34; again. No noticeable major effects that are interfering with my ability to go about my day.

A 34-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EL3247) at right arm on 04Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient received her first shot (lot number EL3247) at right arm on 04Jan2021. Patient&#39;s medical history included acid reflux. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Anxiety started three days after receiving the second shot (07Feb2021). Patient was shortness of breath. The patient had emergency room/department or urgent care and visited doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Per ER, she was hyperventilating which caused her to have panic attacks. Patient had medication for anxiety. Outcome of the events was resolving at the time of reporting. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.

I sat down and the PA asked if I was ok and then I don&#39;t remember anything. I then fainted and my Heart rate was 30 and they called a code blue. They took me to the ER and ran test and gave me IV and everything came back normal.  After that incident, there was at least two other times I had to sit down because I was getting all the same symptoms again and thought it would happen again.  I did donate blood on January 8. I was feeling fine when prior and the following two days.

                                                First vaccine I could feel the vaccine go into my body and down into my legs. It was a very strange sensation. I felt very fatigued 30 min after the vaccine but ignored it because it was not normal to have symptoms after the first vaccine. That night i did feel a litlle bit of swelling in my lips that continued into the next day but it was not severe. The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don&#39;t really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn&#39;t feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work. It is now 4 weeks since i had the vaccine and i am still experiencing  some symptoms that seem to be in relation to after i eat. That includes lip swelling, tightness in the muscles around my throat (feel as if they are strained), stomach burning, indigestion, heartburn.  Called PCP again who recommended I see an allergist/immunologist.

I couldn&#39;t even put weight on my left leg. My muscles were so tight and strained in my left leg. It felt similar like bruising around my knee and all the way up to my quads. The following day, I rested and iced my leg all day. I couldn&#39;t go back to my regular routine of working out until Thursday. However, I was limping until Friday morning. March 13th, my leg is still tight and strained. It hasn&#39;t gone back to normal.

I could not think clearly. I went home and felt that my ear drum felt numb as well. Went to my PCP and she said it seems I was having an allergic reaction and she recommended Pepcid and Benadryl for 3 days. The next morning I noticed I slept for 16 hours. and I was very confused, I could not keep my legs underneath me, I went to ER and my BP was 153/33, my pulse was 120. They kept me there I am not sure for how long, they did some labs and gave me some IVs and told me to go home and rest. Next day I woke up and I was throwing up, shaking, I thought I was going to die and I returned to the ER. They gave me some nausea meds. I returned to my PCP and she put me under BP meds she believes all was caused due to anxiety. I am still taking BP meds.

She had a feeling of rush all over her body, she mentioned that she felt her tongue was swollen. She felt very anxious and nervous at the moment. I didn&#39;t notice any lips swollen,  I asked a staff call 911 and monitored her closely. She calmed down after few minutes and then in 5 mins paramedics showed up. They checked her and she was totally fine. They send her home after 10 mins or so.

                                                About 2 hours after receiving the vaccine, around 4:30 PM on March 31, I began to get small hives all over my arms, legs and upper back. They itched uncontrollably and got more red and angry if I scratched them. I took Benadryl and went to bed as I get up at midnight for my job. Upon waking up the itching was not bad, and I went to work. Around 7 AM the itching started again, but was more intense than the night before. I took another round of Benadryl but it didn&#39;t do anything to stop the itching. It got worse on my arms and legs and spread onto my sides and neck, so I left work 3 hours early and went to an Urgent Care facility around 8:45 am. The doctor there told me I was having a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and instructed me to not get the second shot. She prescribed famotidine 40 mg tablets twice a day, hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg tablet once every 6 hours and a round of Prednisone in the event the itching would not stop. She said to hold off on taking the Prednisone if possible because it would neutralize the effect of the vaccine. After taking the famotidine and hydroxyzine HCl tablets for a day the itching is significantly reduced but still there. The hives aren&#39;t as angry and raised but are still somewhat visible. I have not yet taken the Prednisone.

VERY SEVERE mental health issues, sadness, hopelessness, irritibility that I do not normally experience with PMS normally. I also am extremely regular with my menstruation and have tracked my period for years, and it is always consistent. as of 4/5 still having very heavy bleeding and clotting, some cramping. bleeding is showing no signs of letting up and my period expected start date is around 4/13. I almost didn&#39;t want to say anything because it could be chalked up to hormones or stress but this has not happened to me before, and the emotional state I was in was very bad, not even taking into account the bleeding. I am a very pro science and pro data person so I was hesitant to mention anything at all, but feel like IF this is related this could be a huge risk for folks who have a history of depression and anxiety or post partum conditions. The best way I can describe it was deep hopelessness, something I had not felt since having post partum depression when my daughter was born, 7 years ago.

I laid down to rest, and 5.5 hours passed. I got up around 830 pm, and my forearms itched. I checked and they were covered in red bumps that hurt. I took benadryl over the course of the following 2 days and saw no improvement. I have co rated my doctor, their soonest appointment is next Thursday. If the condition doesn&#39;t improve by Sunday, I will be going to an Urgent Care place.

Eleven hours after the vaccination I had a sudden onset of a fever with chills, nausea and muscle aches. Within a couple of hours after that I had a high fever with chills,  muscle/bone/skin aches, a headache and started  vomiting.  At 8:15 pm (five hours after fever onset) I took 400 mg of ibuprofen but it didn?t help any symptoms. Two hours later I took 325mg of Tylenol and the fever went down to 100.5 degrees. After sleeping a few hours I woke up at 3 am with violent chills/shaking and some vomiting. The fever subsided by then. The rest of the morning I had chills and aches. The next day I gradually felt better and was able to keep down food and water. Some body aches, headache and tiredness remain at 8 pm the next day.

Per the vaccinators, this participant was the sixth and final dose of the vial. Vaccinator initially went to administer the dose and noted that there was nothing in the syringe when he went to push the plunger.   After reviewing the vial with the pharmacy staff, there is still vaccine in the vial with enough volume for a possible seventh dose. With this information I discussed with the participant that participant did not receive two doses. Participant started crying and developing chest pain which prompted an evaluation by EMS team in house at the vaccination center. Due to chest pain, she was given nitroglycerin x 1, and sent to local hospital via ambulance for further evaluation.  We received report from hospital that participant had an MI and was sent to catheterization lab.

It was only 6PM at night (one hour after my vaccine) but I laid down and was able to go to sleep for the night. I woke up the following day at 6AM and ate but had brain fog and very, very fatigued. I was also nauseous and had a pounding headache. I took Tylenol which helped relieved the headache and went back to bed. I woke up periodically throughout the day for less than an hour at a time but was extremely nauseous and unable to eat more than crackers or other very bland foods. My headache continued throughout the day. I basically slept nonstop for 48 hours. After those 48 hours, I was still nauseous but was able to do light housework. 5 days after the vaccine, my pounding headache returned and has been basically nonstop til today, day 8 after vaccine. I have been sleeping 12-14 hours per night but could easily sleep more and am exhausted/fatigued all day.

Saturday03/27/2021 remained dizzy and a bit disoriented throughout the day, at approx 5:50 pm passed out and fell when she got up. Continued to be dizzy and went back to bed. 03/28/2019 still dizzy and passed out again. Took her to the ER at 11:00 am. She was treated and discharged 03/28/2021. Diagnoses: Dizzy Spells &amp; Syncope. It is not in the documentation, but the doctor said he thought it was probably a rection to the Covid Immunization. She is scheduled to receive the second dose on 04/17/2021 but we can&#39;t find anyone to tell us for sure if she should proceed.  HELP!!!!

                                                Minutes after my injection I walked to sit in observation area (I almost drove home and skipped observation).  I felt flushed and noticed my heart start to race.  I thought that walking around may help, but it didn&#39;t.  I asked the nurse to take my vitals and my pulse was 115 and didn&#39;t come down.  My BP was also pretty high.  I went and laid down in the ER and was released without any intervention an hour or so later.  A week later my vitals were still abnormally high and I went back to the ER and was treated with some fluids (my endocronologist prescribed beta blockers, but at this point they did not help).  It has been three weeks now and I am still dealing with high heart rate, and am now having to take beta blockers to regulate my pulse.  I was dealing with some on and off low grade fevers which have subsided. I am not able to sleep and have also noticed some numbness in my right foot.  I did not have any of this before 3/29.

A 34-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Jan2021 13:00 (Lot Number: EL3246) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation at age 34 years old. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. No concomitant medications. No other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (lot no: EJ1685) for COVID-19 immunization at 34 years old. After receiving the second dose of Pfizer vaccine on 08Jan2021, within 13 hours (09Jan2021 02:00) the patient was ill with flu like symptoms (woke up freezing, headache, neck pain, body aches, restless). Later that morning (09Jan2021), the patient had nausea, vomiting and fatigue. After 36 hours (09Jan2021), profound fatigue, intermittently dizzy, felt feverish but did not confirm; body aches had resolved. On 10Jan2021 01:00, slept most of the day and night, had a few scattered hives in the evening. On day 3 (11Jan2021), since this day the patient has had constant vertigo. She was hospitalized from 15Jan2021 to 16Jan2021, had extensive testing and saw different specialists, and was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis secondary to the vaccine. She never had CoVID before, healthy otherwise, and had negative CoVID antibody testing prior to receiving the vaccine. She was off work for 6 weeks, able to go back for 10 shifts but had worsening of vertigo symptoms and was unable to work x 3 weeks and ongoing; still working with vestibular rehab, still having daily significant vertigo. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, disability or permanent damage. Treatment received included medication and vestibular therapy. The patient underwent covid test (nasal swab) on 16Jan2021 with negative result. The patient recovered from body aches on an unspecified date in Jan2021; while not recovered from the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                12 hours after injection, I woke up to excruciating full body pain and nausea. The pain was easily an 8/10 and I was crying from the pain, shaking from chills, and could not get out of bed to the bathroom because the pain was so severe. I took 1000 mg of Tylenol which did not help at all. By 11 am, I began running a low grade fever and the pain felt unbearable. I took an old pain prescription for hydrocodone because I do not have insurance and cannot go to the doctor and the pain was not manageable. The hydrocodone brought the pain from a then 9/10 to a 6/10 and I was able to rest briefly before I woke up nauseous and began vomiting.  The pain was again at an 8/10 in my entire body and i was still running a low grade fever. It is now 4:46 pm and I am severely fatigued, nauseous, and in an unbearable amount of pain. I did not even get this sick when I had the flu 2 years ago. I now have an intense headache in addition to all other symptoms, and stomach pain and cramps. I am unable to keep even water down so I cannot even take Tylenol again. If I had someone who lived with me or I had insurance, I would be in urgent care right now.

                                                I started with symptoms at 11 days post vaccine. It lasted three weeks. Intense itching that would wake me up at night. There would be no rash. I would wake up itching, put some hydrocortisone on and in the morning I would be fine, and this happened daily for three weeks. I saw Nurse Practitioner in my doctor&#39;s office - she recommended I stop my supplements and I was going in to the placebo week of my birth control and I stopped and within a couple of days I had no more itching. Since then I restarted my birth control on schedule and have slowly introduced each of my supplements (one at a time) and today was the last one to introduce and that was the fiber and I started that today. So far, I have had no symptoms that I had before.

                                                During injection 10:20 am  Apr. 7th tasted plastic and had mild facial swelling. That night woke up 1:30 am with worst headache I&#39;d ever had all across top of my skull, diarrhea, started seeing black when I blinked, then fainted on bathroom floor. Felt like someone was throwing buckets of cold water on me. Dizzy, couldn&#39;t get off bathroom floor. Tinnitus off and on. Mom was with me and she called GP emergency nurse who urged us to go to ER, decided to wait because I felt too ill to move. 100 degree fever. Stayed ill like I had the flu for next several days in bed. Noticed heart seemed irregularly fast from time to time, and dizzy when I stand up. Brain fog was very strong. By 4th day body aches started to improve but still very weak. Legs shaking in the shower, feeling sick if I walk or stand more than 20 minutes. Day 8th, Apr. 15th went to ER because of increasing weakness in legs. They wanted to do spinal tap and MRI, but after neurologist evaluated he said my reflexes are too good for GBS. ER also nasal swabbed me, negative for COVID. Day 10 fever came back, 100 degrees. Now it&#39;s day 19. I&#39;m consistently weak in my legs and arms. Saw the neurologist again last week. He said if I&#39;m still not better this Thursday he will give me an EMG, so I plan to proceed with that. My legs still shake in the shower. Haven&#39;t felt well enough to drive or walk down the street because my legs and arms are still weak and I feel like I have the flu if I exert myself. Have to rest in bed a lot. Sunlight hurts my eyes. Don&#39;t feel like myself, still feel like I&#39;m having brain fog. Headaches off and on ongoing. If I rest in bed for four hours or so, I start to feel better, but If I exert myself at all I become nauseous and dizzy again. I have spent most of the last 19 days in bed. I?ve not felt well enough to drive my car or go for a walk outside this whole time.

It started out with very mild pain (1 of 10) and as the day and night progressed, the pain was constant and became increasingly more painful (7 out of 10). It woke me up in the middle of the night. That specific part of my hand was throbbing and very painful and it spread to the rest of my hand. I have a small amount of redness and tenderness on that spot. I woke up the following morning (today) and I could not bend my thumb without it being very painful. I did not do anything to injure myself and I don&#39;t have a history of hand pain or thumb pain.

                                                I ended up feeling slightly sick with sore arm about 30ish hours after and I thought that was it. .  About 3 days later I ended up having very severe symptoms that landed me in the E.R. 3 times in one week and stayed in the hospital for a few nights.   I truly did not know if I would be making it home.  I did have a sinus infection prior to this but was cleared to get the vaccine from my DR.  I had all the side effects  I couldn&#39;t walk very dizzy ringing in ears, (heightened my VM symptoms) fevers as high as 104.7 So lethargic and confused I didn&#39;t know my address.. on the top of all the worse symptoms you can possible think of DRS had to run lots of  test, blood work, cat scans , x-rays, and spinal tap because one Dr said my body was in over drive had too many antibodies and kept fighting infections and one lead to viral meningitis . I am so THANKSFUL  and so happy my body was able to fight it,  I will NOT be getting the second one.

A 34-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP6955, expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the  left arm on 08Apr2021 12:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included tachycardia, depression, migraines. Concomitant medications included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO); metoprolol tartrate; clarithromycin (CLARITIN [CLARITHROMYCIN]); topiramate. The patient previously took vicodin and experienced hypersensitivity (known allergies), first dose of bnt162b2 on 22Mar2021 04:00 pm (lot number: EN6207, expiration date was not reported) for covid-19 immunisation. On 08Apr2021 at 14:00, the patient experienced involuntary muscle movements, stabbing pains, joint/muscle pain, brain fog, fever chills, hypersensitivity to skin, muscle weakness, migraine, skin burning, rashes, hives, muscles spasms. This has been the most painful experience of my life and it still isn&#39;t over. It gets a little better each day but is still just so painful. I can&#39;t believe a vaccine can make someone feel this way. My bones feel like they are exploding. No treatment was given in response to the events. No prior covid vaccination. Not tested for covid post vaccination. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 34-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 12Apr2021 14:45 (Batch/Lot Number: Er8737) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The first dose was received on 22Mar2021 14:45 (lot number: En6208) on the left arm. Medical history included polycystic ovaries, thyroid and serious food allergies. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (TIROSINT) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Approximately 10 minutes after shot on 22Apr2021 15:00 (2nd dose only) patient was flushed, pulse started racing, and hives appeared all over her chest. Over the next hour hives worsened, heart rate stayed fast, had swelling in tongue and throat, and became dizzy and light headed. Patient&#39;s husband wanted to take her to ER, but patient was stupidly resistant. She took a large dose of Benadryl. As the swelling in her airway lessened and the mental fog passed it became more obvious that patient had been having a significant allergic reaction to the vaccine. She was instructed to wait at the pharmacy she received the shot at for only 5 minutes because she had not had an adverse reaction to the 1st dose. She was alone when the reaction began. Patient took a 2nd dose of Benedryl before bed. The next day on 23Apr2021, chest pain began again and patient did go to the ER. The doctor believed symptoms on day 1 were an allergic reaction to vaccine and on day 2 were a strong immune response to the vaccine. They did an EKG and monitored the patient. She reported she was okay at the time of report. Patient received treatment for the events. Outcome was recovered. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination and had not been tested post-vaccination  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                5/3 vaccination By 10pm I had a HA and thought going to sleep it would go away. I woke up at 12AM and it had turned into a migraine. After that, I couldn&#39;t sleep and then in the morning, I went to the daycare with my son. I waited for it to go away, rested (no medication; painful but bearable).  Applied cold compress to forehead and it felt like it was easing, the pain. I did that all day long. The next day, when I woke up, the migraine was still there and decided to go to dr for medical advice. I have never had a migraine like that, not just a HA. Dr. and I didn&#39;t know what caused it. If wasn&#39;t gone by Friday, to call her back. On Wed, same symptoms. On Thursday, it was there but less intense. I felt like my left numb was slightly numb and the upper part of my arm, if felt like I had a tourniquet on it.  I called my Dr and informed her of new symptom and didn&#39;t know if linked to migraine. Advised to go to the ER and order some imaging. I went at 9:30, the Dr. told me she was going to order MRI, urine sample, blood panel, EKG. Everything was normal.  *3 weeks prior, I had been having pain in my legs. Eco doppler on my legs.  Localized pain. Appt scheduled 5/19/2021 *2nd pregnancy (&#39;new things didnt have in first pregnancy like the pain in my legs&#39;), EDD 09/14/2021

                                                Vaccine was given Tuesday late afternoon. Friday morning I woke up with a sore and stiff left knee. Saturday morning my knee started to swell and by Saturday afternoon I was unable to walk and my knee was extremely swollen. I went to Urgent Care Sunday and they couldn&#39;t figure out why it was swollen. I visited an orthopedic specialist Monday morning and he sent me to the ER as he thought my knee was infected. Monday I began to also feel sick, weak, lethargic and had brain fog. At the hospital they drained my knee and discovered it was not infected so they sent me home even though I was feeling very unwell, nauseous and achy. Within 24 hours (by Tuesday evening) I developed severe fevers and my knee was extremely swollen and painful. I checked back into the hospital where they eventually discovered I had C diff bacterial infection, but still did not have any answers as to why my knee was severely swollen and painful. They did an x-ray, MRI, tapped it multiple times and did several blood tests.

A 34-year-old female patient (Age at time of vaccination, 34-year-old) received first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 07Apr2021 at 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient Fainted and experienced weakness in my legs/arms fairly weak too, extreme fatigue/exhausted, brain fog/felt as though someone was throwing cold water at me, i don&#39;t feel safe to drive/ missed significant work, shake with a lactic acid type feeling, had a racing heart, diarrhea, fevers of 100 degrees, parasthesia a pins and needles feelings in my hands and feet, most side effects have been neurological, sunlight hurts my eyes, hard to walk and  impossible to exercise all on 07Apr2021 at 10:30. The patient reported; It is now day 27 post vaccine and I have weakness in my legs, extreme fatigue, brain fog. I don&#39;t feel safe to drive. I have missed significant work. Can&#39;t walk down my block without my legs getting so weak they shake with a lactic acid type feeling. Arms fairly weak too. Initially, when I got the vaccine my right leg went weak. The night of the vaccine, I fainted, legs so weak I could barely get off the bathroom floor. Had a racing heart and felt as though someone was throwing cold water at me. Had diarrhea. I had fevers of 100 degrees (101 the first night) lasting off and on for the first 11 days. For the past several days I&#39;ve been experiencing paresthesia a pins and needles feelings in my hands and feet. Most side effects have been neurological. Sunlight hurts my eyes. Was in ER for the weakness in my legs. Neg for covid. CBC normal. It was deemed that since my reflexes work GBS is unlikely. Exhausted and still extremely weak and it is hard to walk, and impossible to exercise. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination. No other medications were taken in two week and no allergies was reported. Seriousness assessment was reported as disability. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events. The outcome of all the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on April 6, 2021. My symptoms began 10 days later. It all started with upper back muscle aches, on the same side as the vaccine injection. At first, I thought perhaps I pulled a muscle at a workout class, however after the third day of fatigue, the pain started intensifying throughout my body. My knees, ankles, wrists, back, neck and head started intensely aching and turned to flu-like fatigue and a low-grade fever which rendered me bedridden and unable to sleep or move much.   On 4/21, I checked into urgent care where both my COVID-19 and influenza vaccines were negative, so I was instructed to go to the ER to be evaluated for possible meningitis. At the ER, I mentioned separately to both the doctor and a nurse that I believed my symptoms could be related to the vaccine, but they both promptly dismissed the idea and discharged me with a ?muscle ache.?  For two days I was in relentless pain, which left me basically moaning and crying for hours on end. Several of my previous gymnastics injuries from when I was in my teens had resurfaced. My knee swelled up so badly that I couldn?t walk, my previous fractured wrists started aching, my left foot became inflamed, ankles ached, and a rare skin disease I had when I was 19, erythema nodosum, large painful welts on the legs, also re-emerged.   On 4/23, I saw my primary care doctor who also dismissed the idea of my condition being vaccine-related and misdiagnosed me with a respiratory infection, prescribing muscle relaxers that did nothing to ease the discomfort. Three days later I went back in to see her after my condition worsened and she ran labs and suggested it could be an STD (it was not).   On 4/28, the pain was intolerable, and I checked into a different ER where they admitted me to the hospital, ran labs and kept me overnight because my heart rate was so high. It was at a different hospital where the Infectious Disease doctor, finally diagnosed me with having a severe allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and told me that he had seen other similar cases. I was discharged and put on Dexamethasone.  My steroid dose ended on 5/3, and one day later, I started experiencing violent sickness along with the same arthritic symptoms as before, so I checked back into the ER where my knee was drained because there was worry of infection (it was not infected) and I was put on a longer, tapered course of steroid (prednisone) and referred to a Rheumatologist who ruled out autoimmune diseases and confirmed this was a reaction to the vaccine.  I finished the second round of steroids last week and am experiencing the same symptoms all over again, swelling and inflammation of the knee, severe pain in the right psoas, right toe pain, severe neck aches, and sleepless nights. I wanted to avoid a third round of steroids but couldn&#39;t endure the pain and swelling and it got to the point where I could barely walk or move, so I&#39;m back on a third course for 15 more days. In the meantime, I am seeing a naturopath and a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor in hopes that they can provide more support than what I&#39;ve been given elsewhere and that I can get back to  work and to living a normal life again.

A 34-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 07May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0179) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation at the age of 34-year-old.  Medical history included ADHD, allergy to Bactrim. She has felt dizziness when had the middle ear suctioned out while having a tympanostomy. The patient previously received the dose 1 administered in Arm Left on 16Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0161) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation at the age of 34-year-old. Concomitant medications included amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) and sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT). On 09May2021, the patient experienced dizziness that similar to vertigo, that was stimulated by movement, visual changes, and sounds independent of each other. The only time I&#39;ve felt similar dizziness is when I&#39;ve had my middle ear suctioned out while having a tympanostomy. The dizziness set in maybe 48 hours after my second dose and worsened over the following week and then started to lessen; also felt brain fog that included inability to focus my attention, switch between tasks effectively, and confusion as well as decreased ability to make decisions. This brain fog has lasted well over a week now but is starting to abate; and also experienced anxiety that was severe. A week after my second dose, I had what I can only describe as a severe panic attack. I have never had one this severe and have not had a panic attack in well over a decade. The panic attack was not preceded by any event that I would characterize as outside the realm of normal levels of stress. Heightened anxiety levels have remained for almost a week now but are slowly dissipating. The outcome of the events was recovering. No treatment received for the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.

                                                After the first week of the second dose started developing stiffness and swollenness in ankles and left-hand finger joint pain. The pain and discomfort were manageable and lasted for about 2 weeks after the first dose. Then I got the second dose. After getting second dose, had fever, muscle and joint pain on second day after second dose. Then the fever and muscle pain went away but joint pain has been progressively getting worse. On day 12 after the second dose the joint pain reached a point of interfering with daily normal activities. Most of the joints have discomfort but the ankles and wrists have the most pain. The symptoms include joint pain, stiffness, discomfort, feel of swolleness, and heaviness.

                                                The night after the shot, I have extremely vivid and lucid dreams. The following week on June first, I notice that the texture of food felt different. I was still able to taste, but my tongue felt numb, almost. On June 3, my eye began to hurt...like I had something in it. I added a couple eye drops and took some Advil, and that seemed to work. On June 4th, my eye became worse, and eye drops were not helping. On the morning of June 5th, I noticed my smile was off and I could not drink out of a straw properly.  Food textures were still off and my eye was much worse. I went to the Urgent Care, and they advised me to go to the ER to rule out anything neurological. The symptoms I was and still am experiencing, and was diagnosed with was Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never had this happen before and rarely get sick. During this time I have had not other illness.

Starting Tuesday morning, for three days, I got calf/feet cramps that were non-stop. I did call my doctor and got lab work done on 12-31. This lab work showed some kidney values that were off. Starting Sunday my legs and feet swelled up. I had a routine MS appointment on Monday and they stated since there is no data for folks with MS and the vaccine that they cannot rule out the vaccine is playing a role in some of this along with the IVIG.  I did follow up with my primary care doctor on Tuesday and they re did lab work as well as did a ultrasound to rule out blood clots. She did state she felt like it was the perfect storm between the COVID vaccine and then the Immunoglobins that I am on.  She suggested I download the app for CDC and report those items as well.  The doctors are still suggesting I get the 2nd shot just have to do some things prior to the second shot.

                                                About 40 minutes after my vaccine, I felt sudden onset progressive weakness of my entire left arm with spasms/fasciculations of my forearm and hand  (while driving from hospital where I work as a physician to where I live). I pulled over, felt a bit dazed and was unable to use my left hand purposefully to call 911 on my cell phone, but was able to call 911 on my Watch using my right (dominant) hand. While talking to the dispatcher, my symptoms resolved (total duration a few minutes)  so I requested that they not send an ambulance but instead felt well enough to drive to my hospital ED. I discussed my case with the triage RN and ED attending who felt my symptoms were related to the vaccine, with no further work up needed, given then my symptoms resolved. My vitals were stable in triage.  No chest pain or shortness of breath, with normal neurological function and sensation of my left arm.  Note: I was not officially checked in or seen as a patient.     Sudden onset weakness and spasms of left arm (side of vaccine administration) about 40 minutes after vaccine

This was approx 16 hours post dose. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and felt more able to do normal home activities but still tired with a sore arm. 4.5 hours post ibuprofen dose I again had muscle aches, headache, fatigue, and nausea. I also had chills and joint pain. I napped for an hour, took another 600mg ibuprofen, and then napped for another 2.5 hours. After that I felt better at 27 hours post dose but still achy and fatigued. These symptoms had mostly resolved by 31 hours post dose.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded.

                                                I received my second vaccine on Friday 1/8. I felt fine until that evening and then experienced the typical side effects that I had read about. Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Axillary lymph node is larger than a marble currently.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP with the above complaints who referred me to employee health.

                                                After vaccination I felt diaphoretic and dizzy. After waiting in the monitoring area for 45 minutes I drank some water and felt like my bilateral upper thighs were difficult to lift when I tried to walk to my car. I went home and was tachycardic 120-130bpm that continued throughout the night to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep my heart was pounding so hard and fast. I was extremely thirsty and dehydrated all night.  I continued to have tachycardia for several days despite hydrating. My thighs also continued to feel week for several weeks. I developed a 100.7 F temperature and had flu like symptoms the following days.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

                                                Approximately two hours after the shot, I started feeling very dizzy, I felt off balance and felt as if I will fall while walking, had diarrhea, felt heavy at the back of my head and had neck pains. Had small bout of vertigo when I laid in the bed. Felt very tired and had some brain fog. S/S improved in 12 hours. Should I take the 2nd dose?

Shortly after getting out of the shower I became weak, ears started blocking, and started to have tunnel vision. Progressively got worse and was able to sit with head between legs. Took about 1 minute before I didn&#39;t feel like I was going to pass out. Shaky and weak after. Pulse 78 and oxygen level ok. Completed virtual visit and no further medical treatment advised unless symptoms got worse, but advised it was likely a vaccine reaction.  Shortly after a bad headache and body aches developed (expected side effects).

                                                I started to feel rundown/fatigued in the evening on the day I got the vaccine and my arm was very sore.  I woke up very early the next morning with a fever of 101-102, body aches, severe headache, nausea, chills, severe fatigue, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, I would get tunnel vision, my eyes ached and felt very strained, sinus congestion and pressure.  My fever spiked at 103.6 that evening and then stayed below 100 after that.  For the following 7 days I still had the severe fatigue, nausea, headaches, chills, dizziness, difficult concentrating, tunnel vision that was especially  bad when I had to drive, eye aches, sinus congestion and pressure, and my head felt very strange.  The best way to describe it is that I felt like someone had drugged me.  The only time I would leave my house was to take my daughter to school and when I would drive my head would feel super tight, my eye ache would intensify and they would feel super strained, I would get the tunnel vision and I would have trouble making it to the school and back home.  Then I would go back to sleep for several hours, get up and drink some fluids and go back to bed.  On day 7 or 8 I was able to stay up for periods of time and either watch movies or just lay in bed.  I went back to work on 1/20 and am doing desk work.  I am doing a lot better but still have daily headaches, moderate fatigue that is worse in the morning, mild intermittent nausea, my head still feels weird like I&#39;ve been taking some kind of pain med or mild sedative, and I&#39;m easily exhausted.  I have trouble going grocery shopping because I get exhausted.  I had a rapid COVID test done on 1/06/20 due to a headache and temp of 99.6-100.2, it was negative and we thought the temp was due to the Trokendi as that is a side effect of it.  I also had a PCR done on 1/12 that came back negative.

                                                Headache developed before 7pm. Chills soon after for the remainder of the night. Woke up the next morning feeling like hit by a bus with so many muscle aches. Also was warm/hot most of the day. Didn&#39;t feel good in general. Headache came and went most of the day. The next morning still felt &#39;off&#39;, but not horrible like the previous day.

She has numbness and loss of sensation in whole left side of body, limp and sluggish.  Went to ER 01/18/20 and they thought was overload of immune system.  They suggested her to report.  Symptoms did not subside until 01/22/21, gradually the feeling came back, with rest.  She was off work the last week to rest up.

                                                Within an hour was feeling jumpy, easily startled, foggy thinking, fever (highest 101.6 normal temp is 97.5), unable to sleep for over 2 days (still haven?t slept partly due to extreme pain), extreme pain all over body especially on left side, racing heart (103 while laying down normal resting is 78), fever would not go down with any amount of fever reducer for 2 days (starting to slowly go down), sore throat, swelling in ankles and feet for two days (is going down now), congested nose, severe ear pain, joint stiffness and extreme ache.  Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

Then I felt like I had been hit in the head with a bat, but the pain migrated from side to side in my head. It was a very strange feeling. The hot, tingly numbness lasted about 45 minutes to an hour, the headache began to subside after 2 hours. The next day I had a little raised redness and the injection site and a bad headache, but was otherwise fine. At the vaccination site they strongly advised I go to the ER, which I did. I have no history of vaccine reaction.

                                                I am a 35yo G2P1, was 29 weeks pregnant at the time of vaccination (due 3/25/21), completely normal pregnancy so far. CDC Vsafe called and asked me to report as an adverse event though I wouldn&#39;t consider more serious than most. Had low grade fever (99-100) on tylenol, chills, rigors, myalgias and joint pains starting about 12 hours after vaccination.  Went to work the following day (I am an physician) and by about 10 am had a presyncopal event and was unable to stand/continue working. Was unable to stand without feeling faint for about the next 6 hours.  Was febrile until about 8pm 1/9, never over 100 while taking tylenol. Symptoms completely resolved by 1/10 AM except fatigue for the next 4 days or so, though I developed axillary lymphadenophathy on the side of vaccination starting 1/12 for about 5 days.  No effect whatsoever on the fetus.

Swelling beginning to affect the lower legs again. Labs continued to being checked and continued doctor appointments.

There was light headed sensation w/ movement and position, pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode and my eyes were burning.  Because so severe, I took 1000mg tylenol, lathered by entire body in eucalyptus oil and peppermint on my hands, I was able to fall asleep at 3am but it was restless sleep I kept waking up because any movement I made in bed I&#39;d have severe pain.  6am I felt moderately better all symptoms 50% improved, applied eucalyptus oil on again, started work at 730am I could barely function at work I have brain fog, just thinking focusing eyes concentrating makes migraine worse, &#43;photopphobia, phonophobia, just typing is very hard to do because it hurts my joints, the vertigo worsened and the slightest looking down to the keyboard while typing causes lightheaded sensation.  No improvement and it&#39;s now almost 1pm.  I didn&#39;t take any pain medication or apply any essential oils.

My skin has since been very sensitive to touch, this includes skin on my face, arms, hands, and chest. I am very sensitive to temperature changes, especially cold. My nervous systems feels very sensitive, especially my hands. Touching cold items (refrigerator, outside, etc.) makes me shiver. I have also been experiencing a covid fog. I do not feel like myself and am not experiencing joy. I cry daily for no reason.

The healthcare worker came back with my vaccination card within a couple minutes.  I left her know about it.  I had began to feel, but the sensation then spread to the back of my head and down to my lower back.  I felt a little uneasy and had the thought that I probably couldn&#39;t drive.  Before the 15 minute observation period was over, I felt better but still had the cool sensation in the back of my head.

The next morning my tounge was normal ish, the red rash was gone and my hands and wrists were back to normal.  5 days later and I am still experiencing headaches, my throat feels sore and a little bit of a hard time swallowing, extreme exhaustion, dizziness, nausea, a feeling of being completely out of it, otherworldly.

I stayed in bed for 24 hours. I did take acetaminophen - I took it because I&#39;m pregnant and fever is contraindicated. I had been sick for about a week when I got the COVID test. January 31, 2021 - Got a Sore throat (never febril) and headache.- gradual onset - no fever involved - runny nose and cough is what it progressed for. Symptoms onset and course were consistent with common cold. And that made me call in sick for work. Pregnancy History - 2nd pregnancy and have had one birth of twins - Para 14-2. May 21, 2021. Uncomplicated singleton pregnancy. IVS pregnancy - it was. I did start taking Albuterol inhaler recommended by Ugent Care Dr. I had a routine OB appt with doctor - February 8 -  who listened to my lungs. Lungs - wheezes secondary to asthma; nothing concerning. February 4, 2021 I had a virtual visit  with URGENT CARE- their virtual clilnic- who recommended monitoring system and the COVID test.

Dry mouth and tongue tingling stayed consistently for several hours, other symptoms subsided and came back in waves every few minutes, decreasing in frequency over a two hour period in which I was not allowed to leave the Health Department. Blood pressure and heart rate remained normal and consistent, irregular heartbeat noted at about 10 per minute with heart rate of 74-82 bpm (history of frequent PVCs, roughly 8% of heartbeats irregular previously) Symptoms improved significantly over 2 hour period and I was allowed to leave as long as someone else could drive me home, not allowed to return to work for the day.

At 7AM, I had 100.4 degree fever and took a 500 mg Tylenol and the symptoms subsided for about 5 hours. Around 12PM, had chills again and fever and took another 500 mg Tylenol.  Fever went up to 101 at 7PM (almost 24 hours since first onset) and took another 500 mg Tylenol. Since Sunday night, I have been waking up in the middle of the night with weird, vivid dreams/images. The other symptoms don&#39;t worry me but this certainly does. The first night (Sunday) I woke up at 2AM and last night 12:50AM. I am hoping it doesn&#39;t continue but I have not done anything differently since the second Pfizer vaccine. No added stress nothing.

I woke up Thursday 02/11 morning not feeling well at all, it felt like i had been hit by a train. I had a fever that has got up to  as high as 101.3 (my normal temperature is 96 or low 97&#39;s so this is very unusual for me even when i get sick)  fevers  lasted until Saturday 02/13/21 in the morning, at which point I had been taking Tylenol and ibuprofen consistently so i stopped taking my temperature (If i were to stop taking those medications i feel i would maybe still have a temperature).  I was so sore it hurt to move and walk, today (Tue 02/16) it doesn&#39;t hurt to walk finally. My arm pits hurt very bad and still slightly hurt. I have been very tired and weak as well. My eyes have hurt or felt different and appear glossy throughout all of this and still do.

A 35-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 14:30 (2:30 PM) at single dose on left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type is hospital. No history of previous immunization and no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect, also reported as &#34;Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None&#34;. Medical history included ongoing Vitamin D deficiency for quite a few years.  Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) from Oct2020 and ongoing at 50000 IU gel cap, once weekly for Vitamin D deficiency. Patient is scheduled to receive the second dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021 but reported side effects from her first shot including bruising near the injection site, shortness of breath, muscle tenderness and elevated heart rate (main concern). Upon contacting her HCP, she mentioned that this may be a side effect of her anxiety medications and asked &#34;Should she take the second dose?&#34;. Approximately 22hours (13Jan2021) after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. COVID-19 vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy, also experienced blood pressure increased, shortness of breath and Clammy, all on 13Jan2021. The patient was pale on 13Dec2020. Patient noticed on Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Friday morning (15Jan2021) that the lymph nodes in her left axillary (or armpit area) were swollen, and super tender (onset reported as &#34;Jan2021&#34;). Patient became sweaty on 14Jan2021. It was further reported that patient received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021 2:30PM . She said after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine, she has had multiple symptoms. Patient is now due for her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose today 02Feb2021. Patient did not know if she should get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and if her side effects were from the first COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient works in a doctor&#39;s office where there is a medical doctor, nurse practitioner, and several other registered medical assistants. Approximately 12 hours later after vaccine, at 2:30AM (13Jan2021), her left arm was extremely sore. She said she went to work on Wednesday, 13Jan2021, and her left arm was still really sore, but she was fine, otherwise. She said approximately 22 hours after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection site. She said her COVID-19 Vaccine was given a lot higher than she thinks the vaccine should have been given. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy. Her heart rate and blood pressure shot up, and she had pretty bad shortness of breath. Patient said that the medical doctor and nurse practitioner (where she works) told her she gave herself a panic attack. She said that the medical doctor, who she works for, told her to go home, and to contact her primary care doctor if she doesn&#39;t feel better. Patient left work and went home. Patient clarified her heart rate was in the 120s, and she usually has a heart rate in the 80s. She said she was pale and clammy, too. Patient stated that she went to bed when she got home from work on 13Jan2021, and woke up the next morning (Thursday, 14Jan2021), and got ready for work. She said as she was getting dressed for work, she felt her pulse rate go up, and she became sweaty, and clammy. She said she called her work, and her boss (medical doctor) told her to take some Tylenol and rest, and to call her primary care doctor if she was not feeling better. Patient said that her primary care doctor said she was having anxiety, and started her on medicine. She said the medicine helped, but her heart rate was still 112-115. She said she noticed on Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Friday morning (15Jan2021) the lymph nodes in her left axillary (or armpit area) were swollen, and super tender. She said all the muscles in her left arm were tender, as well. She said her left arm muscles were still aching. She said she had bruising on her left arm, and noticed she had bruising (more than usual) throughout the rest of her body. She said she has no idea if the bruising is a coincidence, or if the bruising is related to receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient mentioned that her left axillary lymph nodes were swollen for a good week and a half, but the swelling improved and was gone now. She said her heart rate was still elevated at 106-110 when she last checked her heart rate an hour and half ago. She said her heart rate was elevated, even though she was sitting down doing tele-work, and she has been taking anxiety medicine. She said she was still having breathing discomfort, clarifying she could not take a big enough breath. Patient will take a big breath, and will be good for a while, but then she needs to take another big breath. She said her doctor has checked her lungs, and her lungs were clear. She said she has to take multiple, deep breaths throughout the day. Patient&#39;s last blood work was in Oct2020. She said everything was good with her blood work. She said her hormones were good, but she had a Vitamin D deficiency. For treatment, patient stated that her primary care doctor prescribed Buspar 7.5mg, twice a day. She said the Buspar 7.5mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle and did not have the NCD, Lot, and Expiration Date. She said it will be 3 weeks from tomorrow (03Feb2021) she has been taking the Buspar 7.5mg and reported everyone seems to think she has anxiety, or she was crazy. Events did not require emergency room visit but patient visited physician office. There were no relevant tests. Outcome of muscles in her left arm were tender/aching, was not recovered, for axillary lymph nodes swelling and tender was recovered in 2021, for heart rate was elevated, Shortness of breath/breathing discomfort was recovering while for other events was unknown.

By day 9-10 I have had to leave work because I can?t go more than an hour without having to run to the restroom, and now there is also sharp bowel pain which radiates to my back.  My nausea is extreme and I?m barely eating.  My fatigue is such that I can barely keep my eyes open- not sure if it is related to the diarrhea and lack of eating out the vaccine, and my migraine which I usually get once a week have been more like every other day for the past week.

                                                Six days after receiving vaccine, began feeling unwell. Symptoms are extreme fatigue, red eyes, sore eyes, body aches, joint pain, pain around back/ribs, shortness of breath on exertion. Unable to do usual household tasks and requiring bedrest for much of the day.   The symptoms are very similar to the waves of symptoms I experienced early on in Post-Acute Covid-19 syndrome. I got sick in March and was experiencing waves like this through November. Since November, my physical symptoms had abated and I had not suffered a major relapse like this, besides a mild relapse at end of January. My shortness of breath issues, back pain/rib pain, eye soreness are very specific symptoms that I associate with early on in my long covid experience. The vaccine seems to have triggered a major relapse in my long covid symptoms.

(NDC el9263) On day 7, woke up in the middle of the night with intense nausea and headache. First thought to have food poisoning because husband who received the same vaccine also had similar symptoms. Both vomited multiple times and experienced severe headaches. After second series of vaccine (NDC en 6201), experienced headaches everyday again which required in taking multiple doses of ibuprofen. On day 7, woke up in the middle of the night with intense headache. Developed intense nausea, headache, neck pain, stiffness, light sensitivity, watery eyes, congestion and could not continue to work. Took multiple doses of advil and had to take off work. No vomiting occurred. Did not see a physician but consulted a coworker/neurologist friend who thought I fit the description of aseptic meningitis. No lumbar puncture or laboratory evaluation was done. Rechallenge was positive.

Ten hours after the injection I also had diarrhea and cramps. Today is day 2 and I am still experiencing tiredness and anxiety. I didn&#39;t take anything, just waited for the side effects to pass.

On March 6th, I suddenly developed double vision.  The low grade fever and feeling poorly (other than fatigue) subsided around March 7-8; however, the double vision persists.  It is very difficult to focus at times and drive and perform some other activities that require visual focus at medium to far distances.

                                                On 1/19/21- visual migraine, severe fatigue, difficulty concentrating. These symptoms continued along with blurry vision, dizziness, waking at night to ?buzzing? in head, hypoglycemic symptoms. Multiple doctors visits over the past two months, blood tests, BP and heart rate assessments - only to assume it?s  a reaction to the vaccine. Extreme diet change, elimination of the two prescribed meds and detox- feeling much better however still experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms throughout the day and sometimes at night.

I had a headache, chills, fatigue, increased body temperature (2&#43; degrees) and a sore arm for the rest of the day. I woke up this morning with a really sore arm. I could only lift my arm halfway up, due to the deep muscle pain.

My left ear has a constant feeling of fullness. I have experienced tinnitus and a persistent need to &#34;pop&#34; my ears in my left ear since, as well as bouts of vertigo. I am very sensitive to sound in my left ear, and background noise is amplified and sounds &#34;spotlighted.&#34; I have intermittently been experiencing pain in both of my calves since the injection, as well as joint pain in my hands. I have been experiencing a flushed feeling in the evening, though it is not accompanied by a fever. My muscles in my hands, feet, and legs have been cramping often, which is not a usual occurrence. I have experienced intense chest pain in what feels to be my heart. I have also experienced very vivid dreams.

When I woke up the next day, I was in some discomfort around my collarbone and felts a small lump. I waited until Wednesday and did a virtual visit with a doctor and they said it is probably the lymph nodes. There has been no change in the size of the lump nor has it moved to a new spot.

                                                About an hour later I was very tired. When I woke up the next morning my arm hurt so bad I couldn?t lift higher than my shoulder. The pain was on the arm where my injection was and lasted about 3 days. I then had a red rash about the size of a tennis ball around the injection site for a week. 22 hours after my injection I was extremely lethargic and couldn?t do anything. I had to leave work. That lasted about 3 days. I felt like I had the flu.

I have been sick since then and still have not recovered. I can&#39;t even work because I can&#39;t breathe and still have wheezing. Currently on Prednisone daily and it&#39;s now been 7 weeks.

After just one beer, I completely blacked out. I did not pass out or fall asleep, but I have no memory of anything else after that first beer. I did not drink anymore after that and it took approximately 4 hours to return to &#34;normal.&#34;  This has never happened to me before and the only difference was that I had had that vaccine that day.

                                                I had very severe arm pain in my right arm, which was my arm that did NOT receive the vaccine 3 days after receiving the vaccine.  I had previously had tendonitis in my hand on my right side, but it was as if the vaccine made the existing inflammation much worse.  Instead of just my hand/wrist hurting, the pain traveled up my whole arm.  The pain was so bad that I was not able to work a full day that day and it was hard to focus.  I took an NSAID and eventually it improved the next day.  I still have pain in my right hand, but now it&#39;s just the regular tendonitis pain that I have been experiencing for several months, which is manageable.  I think this is worth noting because this severe pain didn&#39;t happen in the arm that received the shot.  I did have some arm pain in my left arm for a few days as well, but it was less bad than the pain that I get when I get the regular flu shot.

                                                35-year-old female with history of asthma presents for evaluation of allergic reaction. Patient says she has a history of allergy to the flu shot.  She received the first Covid 19 vaccination following her visit with her pulmonology provider today. Shortly after this she developed feelings of throat closure, wheezing and a hoarseness to her voice. She was brought down to the emergency department for further evaluation. She has no history of anaphylaxis and has never been given the EpiPen. She denies any history of chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, skin rash, lightheadedness or dizziness.    Medications Given in the ED:    4/02 Meds   1:24 p Famotidine 20 mg IV Push; MethylPREDNISolone 125 mg IV Push; DiphenhydrAMINE 25 mg IV Push  1:21 p Albuterol-ipratropium 3 mL Aerosolized 35-year-old female presents for evaluation of allergic reaction following Covid 19 vaccination. Overall she is in no acute respiratory distress. Initially when I walked into the room she did appear anxious, and her voice was a bit hoarse. Lung sounds show subtle wheezing bilaterally. Respiratory at bedside. On further conversation with the patient her voice clarity seemed to improve significantly and she seems to be talking at her baseline. She feels overall that the sensation of throat closure is improving. No other symptoms to suggest acute anaphylaxis and we&#39;ll hold on epinephrine administration at this time. Patient was administered IV Benadryl, famotidine, Solu-Medrol in the emergency department.  She was observed for approximately 2 hours after which time she says she is feeling back to baseline. We&#39;ll plan to discharge with prescription for EpiPen, and instructions for use discussed with the patient. Also discharged with prescription for burst course prednisone steroids. Return precautions discussed and she was discharged in stable condition.

Within 24 hours I started my period early. Within 48 hours I had horrible stomach pain, from my ribs to my lower abdomen. Not to be confused with period cramps. Nauseating, doubled over, debilitating pain.  I?ve experienced Covid in feb 2021 and the side effects from the vaccine have felt like COVID did. It?s now been 72 hours and my stomach still hurts (especially when I eat or drink anything); I?m very fatigued when I move around (I worked out and had a very hard time during and after- and I work out 5 days a week minimum).  The only reason I didn?t go to the hospital from the pain is because I knew it had to be vaccine related and would pass - the pain wasn?t accompanied by fever, diarrhea or vomiting.

At ~1305, provider was asked  to assess this 35yo who had received her 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine at 1247, with complaint of itchy rash to neck and throat &#34;tightening.&#34; She has a hx of multiple drug allergies and is on multiple medications as below for seizure disorder and other comorbidities. She had reported a hives rash after her first  dose of COVID vaccine 3wks ago. As such, she had taken 50mg benadryl at ~1200 today to attempt to prevent a reaction. On limited evaluation, her oral airway was clear without obvious angioedema. She did have hives to her neck and was quite pruritic. Her lungs were clear and she was moving air without wheeze. She began slurring her speech and seemed confused, which her family member reported is how she becomes before seizures.  With concern for anaphylaxis, gave a dose of 0.3mg IM epinephrine.  EMS was called to transfer patient to ED. Dose epi given at 1320, with almost immediate improvement in hives, pruritus and notable improvement in mentation and slurring of speech. EMS arrived at ~1325, patient found to have HR 106, BP 180/84 after epi. She was transferred in stable but acute condition.

                                                I had absolutely no symptoms prior to receiving the vaccination. After receiving the injection, I was directed to an extended 30 minute waiting area due to existing health conditions (MCAS). Within the first five minutes I began to feel strange pvc-like cardiac sensations in my chest (which I have not had for almost a year until now). Additionally, I began to feel quite dizzy, like I might pass out, and had immediate brain fog. I told the attending nurse that came to check on me and she called the on-site physician over to do a check up. I was told I seemed flushed on my chest and neck but I couldn&#39;t feel much at the time, so we weren&#39;t  sure if it was related. I was given a snack and water after the clinician asked if I may need to eat. I also took my afternoon beta-blocker a little early as a preventative measure. I began to feel quite hot and symptoms continued until the 30 minute window was up. My pulse was stable, however I was repeatedly asked if I wanted to call EMS services to the center (there weren&#39;t any on site due to time of day). Since my symptoms weren&#39;t seeming to get any worse and I didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital, I decided to carefully drive myself home.  After leaving the clinic, my cheeks began to flush a very bright red, along with both ears, which were a dark reddish-purple. I began to experience a headache but no other symptoms. Later that night I began to feel very tired and generally unwell. I experienced increased muscle pain and fatigue along with multiple strange, vivid dreams.   This morning (the following day), I have felt extremely fatigued. I&#39;ve experienced headache, tinnitus, dizziness, as well as a disturbing feeling of pressure from my chest down to my lower abdomen, and blurry vision (that began in the afternoon). I have had several episodes of severe brain fog and hot flashes.

Building up and breaking and building up and breaking. I was barely able to walk I was so stiff. I was crying and my body and mind didn?t know how to process what was happening. The next day my mind felt far away and detached from my normal understanding of reality. Pain persists and confusion. The second day (today) April 10th I was stiff when I tried to walk and overwhelmed with fatigue and headache. I needed to work so I delivered food for a few hours. My mind is still distant and my body is in terrible pain from activity working. I don?t know when I will start to feel normal or like myself again.

A 35-year-old female patient received 1st dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, LOT/Batch number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 at age of 35-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 18MAR 2021. She stated ten minutes after the vaccine on 18Mar2021 she became dizzy, hot, almost passed out, couldn&#39;t hear everything sounded really far away. Patient stated this lasted for 20 minutes. Patient stated she also had impaired thinking, couldn&#39;t think straight and no concentration for two days straight. She stated she also had buzzing in her ears and heightened sounds for three days. She stated she had pins and needles sensation in her feet that went up to her legs. She stated on day 9 the pins and needles sensation seems to be in her hands and arms as well. Patient stated yesterday (26Mar2021) her right ear was burning and today (27Mar2021) she has pressure in her ears in addition to the pins and needles sensation. Events were reported as non-serious. Patient would like to know if her symptoms have been reported or are normal. She would like to know how long will her symptoms last and if they are permanent. She would like to know if she should receive the second dose of the vaccine. She would like to know what treatment she should have for her symptoms. She would like to know if there were any reports of autoimmune diseases being diagnosed after receiving the vaccine. She would like for someone to notify her if any information or data becomes available regarding the side effects she has mentioned that were not mentioned in the FactSheet. No information in PI regarding impaired thinking, loss of hearing, heightened hearing, pins and needles in extremities, and burning and pressure in ears. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Reactions were collected in the electronic diary (e-diary) from Day 1 to Day 7 after vaccination. No information in PI regarding autoimmune disorders being diagnosed after receiving Pfizer COVID vaccine.  Outcome of dizzy, hot, almost passed out, couldn&#39;t hear everything sounded really far away was recovered on 18Mar2021, of had impaired thinking, couldn&#39;t think straight, no concentration for two days straight, buzzing in her ears and heightened sounds for three days was recovered in Mar2021, of the other events was unknown.

These lasted for about 24 hours from onset of symptoms which began 12 hours after receiving my vaccine. The lymph nodes under the arm of my injection site were also swollen and painful to the touch or pressure such as sleeping on my side. I also had very unusual and vivid dreams the night of my shot which I am still able to recall days later.

After 10 minutes of sitting the client began stating that she was afraid that her &#34;heart would become too &#34;fast&#34; when she got home if she &#34;didn&#39;t throw it away.&#34; After some encouragement, the client was able to clarify &#34;it&#34; as &#34;meth&#34; which she had hidden at home. Client stated some reluctance to go home stating that if she smoked her &#34;meth&#34; that her heart rate would become too &#34;fast.&#34; Client then asked EMT if he was willing to come home with her to help her &#34;throw it away.&#34; All staff present praised the client for sharing this information and after discussing her concerns further, client became much calmer and stated that she felt much safer and that her chest pain, shortness of breath and anxiety had subsided.

                                                I started ovulating on the same day I received the second dose, 3/27/21.  On second night of the second dose, 3/28/21, I had swollen lymph nodes in left armpit, and experienced a tightness/heaviness in the chest. I had to sleep upright to get some sort of relief. The sensation would come and go throughout the coming days.   On 3/30/21, I was still experiencing the aforementioned symptoms, but was also now feeling dull pain in solar plexus and back (4 on a scale of 10). I took Tylenol.  On 4/5/21, I went to see my primary care physician. I had an EKG done, the results were 56 BPM, EKG Severity was borderline abnormal.  I never had a fever, diarrhea, chills. I only experienced left shoulder pain at the injection site, fatigue and a slight headache (which I expected).   Since then, the aforementioned symptoms have subsided, but I now experience tingling, numbness and a faint dull pain (1 or 2 on a scale of 10) in the left arm on the inside near my elbow?especially during night when I?m trying to sleep.

                                                Patient reports tingling within a minute of administration and spreading sensation and numbness  down her arm to her fingers.  Patient stayed in store for 15 minutes, then an additional 15 minutes due to the development of the adverse event.   When patient left in her car, she started feeling a little warm.  After 5 or 10 minutes she felt a discomfort and eventual &#34;lump in her throat&#34;.  Throat tightness ensued similar to an asthma attack, producing a deep ruby red in back of throat with tonsils swollen.  Patient pulled over, experiencing lightheadedness.  Patient describes this as an anaphylactic response.  Her reaction did not worsen but did not immediately improve.  Patient was on phone with husband until arriving home.  She then took a diphenhydramine (about an hour and 15 minutes after the administration of the vaccine).  Her throat discomfort started getting better but arm pain worsened, numbness turning to pain.  Patient went to doctor on 4/15 at about 11:30am.  Patient main issue was arm pain with restricted range of motion at time of dr&#39;s visit.  Throat was improved but less severe.  Dr instructed her to not take second dose.

Strong ache in lower back requiring heating pad.    48 hours: felt fine but had strange pains in organs on lower right side. I?ve been pregnant and have very good sense for strange sensations in my body. Pain was for about an hour and was sharp and on and off for the hour. Pain subsided and hasn?t come back.  72 hours: extremely painful migraine with nausea all day. In bed from the pain. Finally took meds since it?s unbearable. Excedrine.   I?m in good health, underweight but other than that my last medical samples when pregnant 2 years ago were all normal.    Today is day 3 and unknown what tomorrow will be like.  Recovery could come soon but unkown

A 35-years-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), first dose, via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 29Mar2021 at 15:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. The patient reported no known allergies. The patient did not received any other vaccine within four weeks of the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), hydroxyzine 25mg, paracetamol (TYLENOL), pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED), ibuprofen; all taken for unspecified indications, start and stop dates were not reported. On 29Mar2021, about three and a half hours after the first dose of the vaccine, the patient experienced a really bad headache at about 6:30pm. The patient did yoga from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm, had dinner at 8:30 pm,  had a shower at 9:00pm, then right around 10:00pm she was lying in bed and her feet and legs got really hot. She started to feel really sweaty and sick then pressure in her butt. She went to the bathroom a few times first it was normal then it was diarrhea. She threw up about six times. Her throat felt weird while puking. She was sitting on the bathroom floor between puking and pooping and her heart was racing erratically. She was trying to calm herself down. She felt like she was dying or having a panic attack. After about 2 hours she was able to go in her room and lay in bed and she could not stop shaking uncontrollably. She put three blankets on and turned up the heat to 74°. She finally fell asleep but woke up at 5am. She pooped a small bowel movement and had no appetite. She didn&#39;t eat until noon but it was small (meal). She still hardly has any appetite today (31Mar2021). She has been light-headed off and on for 2 days. No treatment was received for the events. The patient did not get tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The outcome of the events dying or having a panic attack, headache, feet and legs got hot, sweaty, diarrhea, light-headed, sick, puking, shaking uncontrollably, no appetite, heart racing erratically was recovering.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after vaccination, patient began to experience hallucinations while going to bed. Sensed that she was sinking into her bed infinitely. Limbs were heavy/sore, felt she couldn&#39;t move. She is a marathon runner and her lower extremities were painful like she&#39;d just run a race. After some hours was able to prop herself up. Was experiencing paranoia, like that the government was monitoring her. When she was able to get out of bed, had some minor visual hallucinations like thinking she spilled a bottle of medication that she had not. Felt she could &#34;see&#34; sounds as colors and shapes. No auditory hallucinations. Drifted in and out of sleep all night with strange dreams, and though the sheets were dry the next morning, there was a foul odor. Temp was normal in the AM when she first checked it. Had more mild paranoia about work throughout the next morning and felt back to normal by 4:30 PM (about 24 hours after vaccination), just a mild sore arm at that point. She used psilocybin once approx 20 years ago as a teen and states this felt similar. Has mild depression, well controlled, no other mental health issues, no other history of hallucination save with the remote psilocybin use, no current or recent illicit drug use.

Medical history included mixed connective tissue disease diagnosed in 2019, autoimmune disorder and anxiety from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included diazepam (VALIUM) taken for anxiety, start and stop date were not reported; paracetamol (TYLENOL A) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; ibuprofen (ADVIL [IBUPROFEN]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps (arrhythmia) on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered  sob and dates for getting really winded (dyspnoea)  on Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, her heart was racing on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really winded on 22Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, for the 4-5 days after receiving her covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30am since it started on 20mar2021 with outcome of unknown, extremely thirsty on 20Mar2021 with outcome of unknown,  low grade fevers  on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, severe allergic reaction on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Additional details were provided as: &#34;I started having a reaction within 12 hours of the shot that persisted. Four (4) days after I was at urgent care and was sent to see a cardiologist due to SOB and heart rate jumps that were happening.&#34; In the past two weeks the patient has seen the cardiologist, had ekgs and echos completed and and now is being sent to see an electrophysiologist. The cardiologist wants her to postpone the second dose until she sees the electrophysiologist since he doesn&#39;t know if this is exacerbation of something or was caused by the vaccine. She had her first dose on 19Mar2021 around 12:45PM-1:00PM in the afternoon. After her vaccine she was ok. She had actually taken a Valium before she went to get the Covid 19 vaccine because she was nervous. She doesn&#39;t know if taking the Valium before getting the Covid 19 vaccine had anything to do with her delayed reaction. She does not take the Valium every day. She woke up around 1:30AM Saturday morning, 20Mar2021 and her heart was racing. Her mother is a nurse and her mother came over the next day to monitor her. Her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps. Even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s. (beats per minute) She and her mother monitored her heart for a while and she called the clinic where she received the Covid 19 vaccine and the nurse told her to go to an Urgent Care. She does report she has an autoimmune disease and she was wondering if she was having a flare up that the Covid 19 vaccine had caused. She could not find a doctor to talk to her about it. Even her primary care doctor wouldn&#39;t help her. Everyone told her to go to an Urgent Care or the emergency room. On Monday, 22Mar2021, she tried to get up and move around but she was getting really winded. She was trying to do things she normally does like walking in her backyard or walking down the hallway. On Tuesday, 23Mar2021 she went to the urgent care. The urgent care did an EKG and told her she needed to see a cardiologist. She was able to see a cardiologist the next day on Tuesday, 24Mar2021. The cardiologist had her wear a Holter monitor to monitor her heart rate for 24 hours. The results showed that she was having arrhythmias, heart rate jumps. The cardiologist did more EKG&#39;s and an echocardiogram. The cardiologist wants her to see an electrophysiologist because of what he saw on the Holter monitor. She is asking if it&#39;s possible that she had a heart issue before and the Covid 19 vaccine brought it to the surface. She&#39;s read things online where people have had similar symptoms. Is it a side effect? She would also like to report that for the 4-5 days after receiving her Covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30AM since it started on 20Mar2021. She&#39;s unsure if she should get the second Covid 19 vaccine. Her second appointment is scheduled for this Friday, 09Apr2021. When she woke up that morning of 20Mar2021 she was extremely thirsty. She reports she does not drink alcohol because of her autoimmune disease, but the thirst she experienced felt like she had been drinking alcohol and was experiencing the extreme thirst that comes with a hangover. The first 5 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine were the worst and that&#39;s why she decided to go to the urgent care. Her heartrate hasn&#39;t improved. Her windedness had improved by the tenth or eleventh day. She can go on a walk and jump up and down with her daughter now. The windedness is lingering a little but is definitely improved. Her autoimmune disease is called Mixed Connective Tissue. She takes no medications for it. She manages it with her diet. Her mother had called her rheumatologist on call on Monday night, 22Mar2021 and asked him is there anything the caller can do or anything she can take. The rheumatologist on call told her to take Aleve.  She didn&#39;t take Aleve but she did take Tylenol and then hours later she took Advil. She does normally run low grade fevers with her autoimmune disease. The fevers are never high, usually around 99.8F never going over 100F. The low grade fevers have been occurring prior to the Covid 19 vaccine for years. She reports that after she took the Tylenol (Tylenol Extra Strength 500mg, she took 2 tablets) and then the Advil (Advil 200mg, she took 1 tablet), she felt drugged, like totally out of it. So tired she couldn&#39;t move. And she&#39;s taken those medications before and never felt like that. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: arrhythmias, heart rate jumps   on 23Mar2021. No follow-up attempts are possible; no further information expected.

                                                I received my first shot at 4:15PM on Sunday 04/25/21. The dose was administered into my right arm. Within 30sec-1min I started feeling pressure wave slowly spreading from my right arm and traveling to my right shoulder blade and neck. Within few minutes I developed neck pain like I pulled a muscle on my right side. 1-2min later I started having muted hearing in my right ear and felt heaviness on my head. within 10-20mins my left ear was impacted as well. (hearing issues lasted about 30mins-1hr). Also, within first 10-15 minutes my face felt swollen and heavy, but it was not visually swollen. Once I took my mask off in the car, I had red/pink marbled rash on my skin on the area that the mask was covering. I haven&#39;t had any face rash from this mask before.  I asked the vaccine site staff if the back and neck symptoms are normal, she gave me a blank stare and nodded her head. Additionally, after first 10 minutes my left thigh muscle started cramping and involuntarily moving for a few minutes, quickly followed by feeling of pulling nerve in my right thigh. That lasted around a minute and suddenly moved upwards and hit my back with sharp pain like radiculitis. Every slight change of move felt like sharp sting. I was still in the recovery area, but I had trouble staying in the sitting position. We went home and back pain developed into crippling pain within 30 mins-1hr after the shot. I could do less and less. By 1 hr I was only able to lay flat in my bed, unable to sit. Bending over would not be possible because of tightness and sharp pain. I spent the next day in bed and barely tiptoed to the bathroom when needed, holding onto the furniture and walls. It has been more than 48 hours and I still can&#39;t bend or wash my hands. I can wash one at a time. Today I can sit, so my back improved since yesterday, but my moves are limited and I feel some pain in my back when I walk. I can&#39;t sit for too long and sitting down or getting up hurts.

                                                The day after my second dose I was achy, tired, and weak. These were all normal to me. However, in the early afternoon I started getting stomach cramps like I did after the first dose. This time they lasted all day and throughout the night until 6am on 4/24. The cramps were located right below my rib cage on both sides although more severe on the left side. The cramps were so severe and painful that they woke me up every few hours. I had to ice my belly to get relief. The morning of 4/24 I noticed my belly was bloated, round, and hard. On top of this I experienced brain shivers or zaps. I thought this might just be me since it had been a month after stopping my anti anxiety meds, but my boyfriend also had brain shivers. He is on a steady dose of anti depressants. Brain shivers usually only occurs when a patient is decreasing these types meds. I would like someone to contact me via email in regards to all my strange side effects.

A 35-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 25Apr2021 at 16:15 (at the age of 35 years old)  (Lot Number: EW0176, unknown expiration) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing penicilline allergy since at the age of 17 years old (manifested by breathing issues, tightness in neck, all swollen up) and currently the patient does not have a thyroid. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) and liothyronine sodium (CYTOMEL), both ongoing as the patient does not have a thyroid. The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergy (at the age of 17 years old).  A few minutes after receiving the vaccine on 25Apr2021, the patient experienced right side neck pain (felt like a pulled muscle) and sharp shoulder blade pain. She got the vaccine in her right arm but had no arm pain. Then in her right ear, it felt swollen and her hearing was muted- approximately 20% hearing loss, could not hear clear sounds. Feeling like a pressure on her ear with partial hearing loss. It was dulled, similar to wearing a thick hat. Then it transferred to her other ear.  Her face was feeling swollen, but it was not swollen, and she had a little pinkish rash but just under her mask. She didn&#39;t have any breathing problems. She asked the (name) staff member if these symptoms were normal. Patient was sitting in the waiting area of (name) pharmacy after administered the COVID-19 vaccine; all of these symptoms started happening around 3-4 minutes after receiving the vaccine. She would say within first 15 minutes after the COVID-19 vaccine was administered, it affected her other ear, where both ears had the muted hearing sensation which lasted about 2 hours. These side effects lasted about 1-2 hours and resolved on their own, no ointments were used.   About 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she started having back pain, felt woozy, and felt a little drunk or funny.  About 45 minutes later, she had sharp pain in the lower back, shooting pain in the hips when she walks.  She currently has these symptoms, limited movement, difficulty walking, can&#39;t walk fast.  After that, she was in bed all day and could barely make it to the bathroom. She previously was very healthy and regularly took long walks. Her back and hips feel sore. Back pain felt like nerve inflammation like sciatica where she got sharp pain in her lower back that felt like immediate inflammation. She got to the point where she was not able to sit straight, felt like body could not hold her weight anymore. She can&#39;t bend over without pain and is unable to get things on the bottom of the refrigerator or pots in the kitchen.  She is unable to wash her hands together, she felt like her back can&#39;t support her weight.  She had to wash one hand at a time.  She is unable to get out of bed regularly, she has to roll out of bed.  It has been 9 days from the vaccine and is still having shooting pains in her hips and jerking muscle in the left thigh and right thigh and it felt like nerves pulling string in the right leg which lasted only like 30-45 seconds. Before she went to the (name) pharmacy for the COVID-19 vaccine, she had never had any sorts of back issues, no strain, no health problems in that area. She told her husband she was going to have to lay on the ground or go home, so they left.  She can&#39;t walk more than 10-15 minutes. She left the pharmacy, and when she got in the car about 20 minutes after she had gotten the vaccine, she felt a heaviness on her face, felt like a heavy mask on it even when the mask was removed. She felt initially that her face was swollen, like it was pressed, but there was no visual swelling that she could see in the mirror. When she took her mask off the triangular area where the mask had covered she could see a little more of a rash, like pinkish marbled rash but it would go away in about 45 minutes to 1 hour, started to slowly fade away. She felt that if it was a rash it would be all over her face; but this area was only where the face mask had been. She had no injury that could have caused that. The pain the next day was so bad, she was not able to sit or stand. She was barely rolling out of bed, had to hold on to furniture and walls to make it to bathroom. She is still not able to fully bend down. She has limit in movement. She still has pain, it did improve since the first day; but she still gets like a sore pain in the spine area, lower spine like a shooting pain from hips to connection where her legs meet bone which is still there. The pain can change from day to day; it can be on both sides of spine, or tailbone, hips, joints from where her legs attach to the hip area. Pain is a stabbing pain very painful and then the stabbing pains come and go and feels like a pulling pain, like a nerve pain but there is constant soreness in that area; on top of that still has the stabbing pain; this has been going on for the last 9 days did not have a break from this. She has tried massaging the area, tried Bengay on her back, tried ketoprofen (Ketonal), tried Capsaicin patches, Voltaren for the pain but none of those have helped the pain. Pain is a deep pain. The only thing that has helped it is like hot or thermal water bottle that you fill up with hot water which helps mute the pain to where it is manageable and helps her fall asleep at night. She still feels pain at time of call feels like a spinal injury. She experienced for 3 days; she would say on day number 3 (in 2021), the pain moved from the lower back to the half of buttocks on both sides and started getting numbness in buttocks and central part of buttocks like tingling pins and pricks feeling for maybe a day or 2 then it resolved. She still has pain in buttocks and hips and the pain can move to lower back and will hurt in lower back. Then on 04May2021, symptoms like entire intestines hurt her, she wasn&#39;t eating, it started at night when she was going to bed; so she is thinking maybe the pain is radiating to other parts of body to like her lower abdominal area; she used the hot water rubber bottle to relax muscles. She does not have the tingling sensation in her buttocks any longer; but does have tingling sensation in both hands and both feet that she sometimes feels, it is ongoing most of the time and is pretty severe. She feels pain getting up and down, still having pain; She is glad she can walk, because before walking was not very possible for her. She also tried a little bit of a back massage where she lay on her back and kind of wobbled on massager, but it doesn&#39;t help; the pain does not feel muscular it feels like something with the nerves. When she walks, she feels pain around her spine and lower back central part of spine, hips or lower back, like someone literally stabbed her in the back. She has seen her doctor on 03May2021 and was suggested seeing a neurologist before getting her second shot which is due 17May2021. Doctor ordered a blood panel and urine test and are still waiting for results (unknown results) taken on 03May2021. The patient asked if these are side effects of the vaccine. The patient did not know if she should or should not get the second dose relative to these events as of yet; second dose is scheduled for 17May2021. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The events resulted in physician office visit. Patient was not hospitalized.  The patient recovered from events right side neck pain (felt like a pulled muscle), &#34;right ear, it felt swollen&#34;, partial hearing loss, pressure on her ear, little pinkish rash/pinkish marbled rash, and jerking muscle in the left thigh and right thigh on 25Apr2021. The patient also recovered from event numbness in buttocks and central part of buttocks in 2021.  The patient was recovering from events limited movement, difficulty walking, and heaviness on face. Outcome of events &#34;felt woozy, felt a little drunk or funny&#34;, and &#34;entire intestines hurt her&#34; were unknown. While the patient had not yet recovered from the remaining events.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I had an auto immune response to vaccine - felt numbing in arm right after vaccine; I noticed it going down my arm (the fluid from the injection). Once I left the building, I could feel that my face was numb and having tingling feeling .(Note: My neck sometimes causes me problems due to my pregnancy - before the vaccine - I was having an issue with my neck and that was going down into making my arms feel like they were going numb.) When my face went number, I had a hard time talking well for the next two or three days. My face and jaw were weak; my arms and hands were weak too.  It went up my whole arm and on my torso (the numbness) - it was going up and down my body - it wasn&#39;t just staying in one place. I went to my mom&#39;s place and she gave me some juice. I did feel better when I had some juice but could tell I was having some kind of reaction. I did feel better when I drank the juice and some water. My husband met me for lunch and when I called him, I coughed - and I started seeing things around my eyes like I was going to pass out and I drank more water. I ate (burger) and I did feel a bit better. I was still having these issues with the numbness going from one part of my body to other. I drove home (30 minutes) and did feel a bit better. It felt like I was just &#34;off&#34; and not doing well - noticed I wasn&#39;t breathing as well. I noticed my heart was racing. I could feel my heart was having palpitations. I called the doctor for my pregnancy and she could tell I was trying to catch my breath. I was trying to stay calm through all of this and my mind wasn&#39;t racing. When I talked to her, she thought I should go to ER, she said I sounded out of breath and my heart was racing. At that point, I was nervous to drive,  I was having some kind of vision problems - it was going in and out (like a disorientation). My husband drove me to ER.  I drank some water though on the way and I felt better after doing that. I&#39;m really sensitive to any kind of chemicals/drugs - I can be affected easily. (This is still within the first 2 hours after shot.) At ER, I drank more water. They told me not to take the 2nd vaccine at least while I was pregnant. They gave me Benadryl - IV 25 mg. And I felt so much better.  Dr told me Benadryl can help with anxiety and with allergic reaction. The fast heartrate did go on for awhile - I did take Benadryl in the middle of the night that night and I had to take Benadryl through the next week or two to help sleep. I kept track of my heart rate because in the morning, I felt like I felt it more in the morning. I checked in with my doctor about it and she told me to watch it. It got up over 100 but it never got to the point that it was dangerous.   Numbness  finally went away eventually  - it lasted about three or four days. My left eye was twitching - it took about three weeks for that to go away. I did get chills that night of the vaccine; I didn&#39;t get a fever. I slept - was so tired - I would get the meals for everyone but then take naps and I slept long at night and Benadryl helped with it. I did trip and fall the second or third day after the vaccine - I tripped on something - but I feel like I tripped because I was a little disorientated.  I knew I had to be careful and take care of myself because of the symptoms.  Four days after I had the shot, I got sick with COVID-like symptoms. Five days later I got a cough. I did not take a COVID test because other members of family tested and didn&#39;t have it.  Pregnancy history  - 6 pregnancies and 4 live births and the first one was a miscarriage. Due date: August 19, 2021

                                                At a pharmacy, in a city, I received my shot at 11:23 am, right after I felt hot and sweaty behind my neck and into my chest. I sat down and rested for about 10 minutes hoping it would pass and then noticed my hands getting cold. My hands and arms started to tremor. The next thing that happened was I started having a hard time breathing, my chest felt tight. The pharmacist told me to take off my mask, but the tightness remained. My heart felt like it was pounding hard and the pharmacist took my pulse and checked my hands. My pulse was over 150 and my fingers were white and hands were bluish purple. I felt disoriented, slower to respond, harder to respond to questions. Paramedics were called. They didn&#39;t give me an epipen because I did not have airway closure. In the ambulance my blood pressure was taken and I was asked questions. I noted that my stomach was cramping slightly.  I arrived at the  ER at 12:03PM-encounter # 7509507. At the ER, I was given an EKG and that read normal. My pulse and blood pressure were also taken. BP was 169/85, PPR 89. I still felt shaky and weird with tingling in hands, still some chest tightness (like a rock sitting on my chest). I was given 25mg of Benadryl and a Gatorade and after some rest time I was allowed to leave.

The headache is almost so bad it&#39;s giving birth, it&#39;s terrible. The headache has not been letting her take care of her children so she wants to know if there are researches that could help her situation. This happened right after she took a shot and does not have a history of headache ever. She has always been very healthy and so she believes it is the shot that is causing her the problem.

Seen my Dr. an audiologist at Center. Dr. diagnosed with partial hearing loss in my right ear. I had the actual Covid 19 virus in August of 2020. At that time I lost my sense of taste and smell for approximately 2 weeks. I had no long term side effects related to the virus. I received my first COVID 19 vaccine in December 23 2020. I had no side effects from that vaccine. The day after receiving my second Covid 19 vaccine, I started having light sensitivity, right eye itching, and visual disturbance of the right eye.  Weeks later I started noticing changes in my ability to hear out of my right ear. Then people started noticing that I wasn?t hearing them appropriately. I?ve had multiple visits from specialist. I?ve had to buy new glasses, eye meds, contacts, take off work many times, and now I?m saving for a hearing aid.  I was told by both specialist that the outcome is unknown at this time because there is not enough information on the virus and the vaccine to make that judgement.

WHEN I WOKE UP AT 6A THE NEXT MORNING I COULDN&#39;T STAND OR LIFT MY HEAD WITHOUT GOING PALE AND PASSING OUT. THAT SIDE EFFECT LASTED FOR ABOUT 10 HOURS. DURING THAT TIME I HAD THE WORST BODY ACHES AND CHILLS I&#39;VE EVER EXPERIENCED ALONG WITH A HEADACHE. THOSE SIDE EFFECTS LASTED FOR 4 DAYS AND FATIGUE LASTED FOR ANOTHER 3 DAYS. AFTER I THOUGHT I HAD RECOVERED FROM THE VACCINE I NOTICED MY BLOOD SUGAR KEPT DROPPING AND I COULD NOT REGULATE MY BLOOD SUGAR FOR 5 MORE DAYS.  AFTER MY 2ND COVID VACCINE, AGAIN, I WAS FINE THE REST OF THAT DAY. I WOKE UP AT 3A TO USE THE BATHROOM AND THE FAINTING STARTED AGAIN LIKE WITH THE 1ST VACCINE. THAT SIDE EFFECT LASTED FOR ABOUT 10 HOURS. AGAIN, I HAD THE WORST BODY ACHES AND CHILLS BUT NO HEADACHE THIS TIME. THE BODY ACHES, CHILLS, AND FATIGUE LASTED ABOUT 24-36 HOURS AND I DID NOT HAVE THE LOW BLOOD SUGAR ISSUE AS LAST TIME.

I think it was an anxiety related to my research I&#39;ve done at my job related to COVID. I don&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction, but I do have an appt on Thursday. I was monitored for about an hour. Symptoms went away but I wasn&#39;t totally ok until the next day besides soreness in next arm.

(Got my period either the night of 18th or morning of 19th). About 36 hours after vaccine; stood up to attend an alarm and felt very ill at patient&#39;s bedside and had to sit down: nauseous (felt similar to co-vid) - took Motrin an hour later; the day of 20th - slept all day; 21st - no appetite; mild headache - nauseous - period at same time of vaccine; 22nd - felt bleh; didn&#39;t eat much food - period going away but I  was feeling worse; feel like I have the return of internal vibrations (can sit in my hands when I&#39;m trying to do something for a patient that needs done quickly)  back in July when I had Co-Vid (when I was out of work out of month - and had to see a cardiologist - two months until normal (neural and cardiac symptoms that went away with time) - so was returning of buzzing/etc. 23rd: could feel like I had internal vibrations sensations; nauseous - increased - got a refill from an old dental prescription - started Zofran; headache pressure (head pressure); a vertigo-ish feeling - felt like I just walked off a boat; at that point - called out of work - COVID hotline hospital call - did a rapid test that was negative (on 24th) and on 24th: had still all the same symptoms - nausea was worse and felt a bit more dizzy occasionally and called out of work again but could take care of myself (laid around) - &#34; it felt like baby covid&#34; 25th - work wanted me to get tested again; 26th - Panther Co-vid test - which was also negative. 27th and 28th - dizziness better; still taking Zofran one time /day (for nausea); was able to go to work on 29th - still had some nausea but didn&#39;t have to lie down all day anymore - still had internal vibrations - feels like I should be having a tremor but can&#39;t see it externally; 30th finally able to see primary care Dr and she ordered lab work: Dr wasn&#39;t certain it was an adverse effect vs. me feeling my own immune response to spike protein; Initial covid symptoms in July were similar to this; and she will see how things go; SED Rate was 1 so not concerning; CBC was fine and B12 was fine. Not much as changed since then: returned to work; can go about things in every day; stopped taking Zofran on 31st; I still had nausea but it was mild enough that I didn&#39;t need to take it and Dr said it would be best to stop due to it&#39;s on effects. Yesterday, was first day with no nausea (1/4/2021); still have internal vibrations sensation but it has gone down quite a bit - now more of a mild buzzing electric current sensation - like insides are buzzing super fast ; when I noticed when not occupied with other things which is how it faded out with original illness.

                                                Immediately after injection, I felt a warm feeling flow from the injection site and across my chest.  No shortness of breath or chest pain.   Felt slightly light-headed. Drank water and ate some food to closely monitor.  Very sore Left deltoid starting about 8 PM on 12/31/20 (same day as the vaccine administration).  It was so sore that it woke me up a few times at night and 1/1/21 I had to take Ibuprofen 400 mg to alleviate the pain. Had a dull headache all day 1/1/21 and very tired. Slept that night from 9 pm - 8 am next day.  No symptoms since 1/3/21.

                                                - Almost immediate onset of nausea, sore throat, headache, and sensation of fast heart rate; along with feelings of mild illness (like a cold) and arm pain which is consistent with other vaccination response.   - Waited at clinic for 30 minutes as directed due to previous history of anaphylaxis to injected meds (among others). Reported feeling poorly to nurse monitoring people waiting at 30 minute mark, who encouraged waiting longer but did no further assessment. Waited another 15 minutes with no resolution or improvement. Decided to leave and monitoring staff said they could not keep patients if they wanted to leave.   - Approximately 15 minutes later (1hr after injection), took one 25mg Benadryl liquid gel as nausea/headache/fast heart rate were consistent with prior allergic reaction and not with prior vaccine response. Those symptoms resolved after 1-2 hours; the feeling of mild illness lingered for approx. 3 days more.

                                                Patient reported, &#34;I received my Covid 19 vaccination on Monday evening. I experienced a reaction immediately following. Within 10 minutes I had tachycardia (130s), high BP (160s), lightheadedness, nausea, headache, and feeling like I was going to faint. I was attended to by Ambulance paramedics. At the time of her report to her primary care provider on 1/7/2021, she was still having pretty significant side effects (headache, dizziness, and light sensitivity), enough so that I was staying home from work. These symptoms have now resolved.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 from Mar2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced body aches, dry mouth, can&#39;t sleep, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and pain at the injection site, temp was 38.1 Celsius, head feels weird in Jan2021. The patient got her first dose and was looking online to see the symptoms. She said that she saw that during the trials, people were experiencing the symptoms she was experiencing after the second dose and she was concerned. She said that she wanted to make sure her symptoms are ok and to make sure that the symptoms are not just caused from the booster, but also from the first dose. The caller said that her mom told her that someone died from the Pfizer vaccine. No further details provided. The patient was having body aches, could not sleep, her mouth is really dry, her temp was 38.1 Celsius, her head feels weird, she has generalized weakness, pain at the injection site, and decreased appetite. She said that it was like having Covid again. She said that she had Covid back in Mar2020. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 38.1 centigrade.  The outcome of all the events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the suspected COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine (approximately 17 hours post-dose), I got up to use the restroom.  While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

Horrible headache that did improve with tylenol and ibuprofen taken at the same time. Body shakes and can&#39;t control body temperature.  Felt freezing cold but skin was very hot to the touch (according to my husband). Then, I started sweating and felt really hot and couldn&#39;t cool down.  Felt nauseous but no vomiting.    Could not sleep but felt very tired.  Today is now 48 hours after vaccine and body aches are gone but I am still extremely fatigued.

I got tachycardia (I tend to have a rapid hart beat but this was pumping pretty good). I also had some GI distress (watery diarrhea) and that lasted for a while. Later I got really weak and shaky, fatigued, that night I woke up with night sweats, and chills, woke up completely drenched, I had to change the sheets and pajamas. 5 days after the vaccine I was really exhausted, the fatigue was awful. There was also an itching sensation but no hives.

This has continued and worsened - I have constant &#34;pins and needles&#34; sensations in both feet and it is extending up to my knees. It&#39;s also in both hands and extending up my arms. Last night it was up to elbows, now it&#39;s going above my elbows. It doesn&#39;t go away. I was unable to sleep well because of the sensations. I&#39;m also starting to feel tingling in my back and shoulders. I called my doctor and he said to fill out this form and report the ER if my symptoms don&#39;t improve over the weekend.

At the ED they diagnosed her with a minor anaphylaxis reaction, gave her methylprednisolone and epinephrine.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021, lot# EJ1685), intramuscularly in left arm on 31Dec2020 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID Prevention.  Medical history included ongoing Hypertension/high blood pressure (Diagnosed about 2 years ago).  Concomitant medication included ongoing ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) and just some other vitamins but she does not think that is relevant. She had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine.  The patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy, weakness/felt very weak, hard for her to talk/was having a hard time talking, like she had to put effort into talking, thought that she would pass out, all on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 31Dec2020, tired and sore on 02Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 04Jan2021. The patient got the vaccine on 31Dec2020, and is scheduled to receive the 2nd dose next week and within a couple minutes after getting the vaccine, like less than 5 minutes later, she felt dizzy and very weak, and thought that she would pass out, and she was having a hard time talking, like she had to put effort into talking. After like an hour, she felt better. From then on, she had no side effects besides just being tired and sore, but she had no fever or anything like that. She does have hypertension in her history, but she hasn&#39;t been taking her pill because her BP has been stable. She felt like when she took the Pfizer Vaccine, some people can feel their BP shooting up, like it felt like a sensation in the back of head that her BP went up, but she did not think it was her BP because she has not needed to take her pill because her BP has been good. She did not take her BP, so she doesn&#39;t know what her BP was at the time. It was a pressure in the back of her like how she feels if her blood pressure is elevated. Investigation Assessment: No. Relatedness of drug to all the events was related per source of assessment: primary source reporter, method of assessment: global introspection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the event depressed level of consciousness is possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) , via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 17:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient received the first Pfizer vaccine on 23Dec2020 at approximately 5:15 PM. The patient felt fine until about 11 PM at night, the patient stated, &#34;when I began experiencing intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; on 23Dec2020. I took a Benadryl and went to bed. At approximately 1 AM (24Dec2020) I woke up feeling like I was 500 lbs (I am about 175 lbs). I also had swollen lymph nodes in my neck, a stiff neck, a severely dry throat, and severe shivering. I attempted to navigate to the bathroom and felt like I needed assistance to walk safely to avoid falling. I felt like an impending sense of doom, and called my mom who is a nurse. She told me to contact the Pfizer #, but nobody was answering the phone at that time. I then started looking up on the internet if anyone else had experience what I was feeling after the vaccine and if the feeling passed, as I was not sure if I should go to the ER. I ended up falling asleep.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient took Benadryl for events &#34;intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; as treatment. No treatment was given to the patient from the remaining events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

This went away and came back over several hours of time throughout the day on Jan 31st.  Exhaustion and mental fog have continued through 2/3, but all other symptoms have resolved.

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

I was extremely nauseous. Then I felt my pulse pounding through my chest and so forceful I felt it in my tongue. I had my Fitbit watch on and looked at my pulse: it was 168 BPM. I called for help. The nurses took my Blood pressure and HR. My normal BP is low - usuall 110/68. When they took my vitals it was 180 BPM &amp; 149/98. I was taken to the ER and monitored. My vitamins returned to normal within a few hours .

She screamed.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done.

I continue with feeling heaviness in my chest, difficulty with shortness of breath, and hoarseness in my voice/tightness in my throat especially with increased activity or talking.

Very weak - if that was a 10th of what COVID felt like, I didn&#39;t want it! Those symptoms lasted about three to five days. By the5th day - I was mostly back to myself. I took Motrin - which helped slightly for headache.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

I was lethargic with full body aches, headache and chills for the remainder of the day. I checked my temperature throughout the day, but I never had a fever. My symptoms prevented me from working that day, but I did not take pain medication and I was able to eat meals normally. At some point during the night, I woke up in a sweat. The following morning, Feb 12th, the symptoms were gone. The injection site was sore for a few days more.

                                                I initially had itchiness at injection site, then more of my arm. At 15 minutes I talked with the nurse, she looked at and we talked for quite a bit what I should do but I was feeling just fine and left to go home and take benedryl. I had just left the hospital (25 mins post shot) and my throat and tongue started swell rapidly. I called 911 and the county rescue responded. My breathing was normal by then. My body has been itchy all over since then and my throat remains minor swollen. I did not get an epi shot since I was mostly okay and the EMTs were convinced I had a panic attack so I just went home.

                                                I had my first COVID vaccine on 1/16/21. I had my second one on 2/5/21. On 2/9/21 I started experiencing a sharp pain in my left breast. On 2/10/21 I had sharp pain in between my shoulder blades. On 2/11/21 I noticed a small red rash-like spot in between my breast. I woke up on 2/12/21 in incredible pain on my back, so I lifted my shirt to look in the mirror and that is when I noticed a blister type rash from the middle of my back wrapping around the front of my body covering my left breast. I went to see the PA at my PCP&#39;s office. She diagnosed me with shingles. She placed me on an anti-viral medication for a week, and gabapentin (nerve medication) for a month. It has been 3 weeks today since I first began treatment and I have not fully recovered yet. My blisters dried up about a week ago, but ever since then I have been incredibly itchy, which has kept me up every night for over a week now. On 3/3/21 I called my PCP&#39;s office and they started me on Prednisone for 6 days. I am 2 days into treatment and I still have not had relief from the itching.

These balance issues are slowly improving but remain ever present. I am also experiencing some cognitive issues including word finding problems, difficulty processing verbal information, and general brain fog. I?ve had an increase in fatigue as well. The same weekend the balance issues began I had some visual disturbances as well.

                                                Within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I experienced extreme dizziness. This dizziness lasted for 2 days. The following day I felt extreme fatigue, body aches and arm soreness at the injection site in addition to the dizziness.  Exactly 7 days later on 3/13/21 (after my initial side effects had resolved), my left arm began to itch painfully and intensely. The itch began on my left wrist and by the end of the day, the itchy spot on my wrist had progressed to itchiness on the majority of my left arm. It&#39;s not very visibly red, but it&#39;s incredibly itchy and painful, like fiberglass under my skin. The itch is not obviously localized to the injection site but is on the same arm as the injection and nowhere else on my body. It has lasted for 24 hours, and I currently still have it today (3/14/21). I have taken antihistamines and NSAIDs and applied cortisone cream, but it is still very, very uncomfortable. It kept waking me up while I slept during the night. I am wondering if this could be &#34;COVID arm.&#34;

A person on site took my blood pressure which was higher than normal. I was advised to wait longer than 15mins, but after 30mins waiting I still was not okay to leave. I had to call family to come for me, at which point the people on site told me to eat food. I was given water and licorice by the facility, my mother brought me tacos but I still felt very weak. (Weakness was not food related). I was in the waiting area for 1 1/2hrs, advised not to drive myself home, my mother had to drive me home and stayed with me. I also had trouble walking, and was helped to the car. I did not go to a hospital for these adverse reactions as I did not get a fever at any point, and wasn&#39;t exactly sure what could be done for me.  Days following the vaccine I still felt very weak, slept a lot, and felt very out of it. It took 4-5 days to return to normal.

                                                1 hour after receiving the vaccine I developed the same headache I had when I was diagnosed with COVID on November 27th 2020. The next morning I felt the same headache treatable with over the counter medication (Tylenol). Around 1030am I began to feel fatigued at work. This worsened followed by an increased headache and dizziness. I left work early. Once I got home and took my temperature (tympanic) it was 100.3 at 130pm. Next symptom happened within the next half hour and it was pain in both thigh muscles. The pain felt how muscles would feel the day after a hard workout. This muscle pain began to effect all the muscles in my body. This worsened to joint pain even in my fingers. The fatigue was very severe. I went to sleep around 230pm and slept and off until 3-23-21. I was barely able to walk on 3-23-21. I was not able to perform any daily tasks. I contacted my primary car physician. She advised me to rest and if my symptoms did not improve my the next day to consider getting a test for COVID. I did go to an urgent on 3-24-21 for a rapid COVID test which was negative. I returned to work on 3-25-21 not feeling completely back to normal but much better.

                                                I developed a fever, muscle aches, and chills about 26 hours after the vaccine administration in my lt upper arm. My first temperature taken was notated to be 100.5 degrees. I took two ibuprofen, drank some cold water, then laid down for about 1 hour. I retook my temperature and it was about 99.8 degrees. I laid back down for another 2 hours and took my temperature again, reading was 99.2 degrees. I texted my boss to say I needed to work at home due to fever, muscle aches, and chills the next day to make sure it wasn&#39;t actually covid. I was granted permission to work from home. On Monday morning (wake time was 7 am), my temperature upon waking was 99.2 degrees but the muscle aches and chills had gone away. I took two more ibuprofen with cold compresses on my forehead and temperature finally broke about 9 am.

Around 3, hands turned purple, lips turned white and I felt like I was going to pass out. Took some Benadryl and saw improvement within 20 minutes. Husband monitored for a few hours afterwards, still felt a little off but didn&#39;t get worse and saw gradual improvement, started being itchy all over. 3/31 - Extremely tired, sore arm, puffy face, extremely itchy. About a 4x4 inch patch of itchiness moves all around from my scalp, to ribs, to back of knees, etc. and stays itchy for about a minute or two, then moves. Very odd sensation. 4/1 - Still very tired, arm is achy but not sore, face is less puffy but throat still feels slightly tight. Not itchy. Seems to be on the way out.

Taken to ED, normal exam, diagnosed with vasovagal syncope, went home to rest remainder of day. 3/30 still fatigued, tried drinking coffee and it spilled out right side of mouth. Looked in mirror and thought right eye and lip were drooping. Touched face and could not feel anything on right side. Also noticed splotchy red rash bilateral cheeks and left arm (same as injection) that was itchy. Saw PCP (via tele) who documented decreased right smile, forehead elevation, cheek puff and decreased sensation on face. Prescribed 7 day course of Valtrex TID and Prednisone 60mg daily which she began on 3/31. Seen by neurology (via tele) 4/1, patient indicating 50% improvement in symptoms but states she cannot feel entire right side of face or ear. When talking appears to only be talking out of left side of mouth but no flattening of right nasolabial fold, normal smile, cheek puff, questionable asymmetry of right forehead elevation but symmetric eyebrow furrow. Unable to assess forced eye closure. States she cannot feel pinch or nail on right side of face.

                                                Following day, a little over 24 after dose was administered, I felt very loopy, almost as if I were drunk. My speech was noticeably slowed/slurred, I had a sleepy like gaze, my reactions were slower than normal, standing or walking it felt like I was floating, and not only did I feel this, but my husband noticed it as well. This only lasted for an hour or two. 48 hours after dose was administered, I felt &#34;sick,&#34; I was very fatigued and spent most of the day in bed. I was not actually sick. I had no fever or any other symptoms of illness other than general unwellness. Arm was only sore whenever I first woke up or had not moved it for a while. I maintained a full range of motion despite my arm being sore during the times I mentioned. This lasted for no more than 72 hours.

                                                In observation area, my tongue swelled up - nurse held be back for a bit to observe and gave me bottled water.  The injection site arm went dead and unable to move (left arm stated on my vaccination card but it was the RIGHT arm that was jabbed. Another inconsistency of this whole process).  I had weird tingliness shooting up to my neck/back of neck. After finally being released from the observation area when the tongue swelling went down, I was tired walking to my car.  That night I was exhausted and couldn&#39;t get off the couch and nauseated. The nausea and fatigue hit in waves over the next day.  On Monday (second morning after the shot), I could not get out of bed.  After finally getting up, I went to work. At work I was still dealing with fatigued, shortness of breath, my head was dizzy and light, then mid-morning I had sharp stabbing chest pains under my left breast, the pain shot up to my left neck and jaw. I could not breathe. The more I tried to breathe, the sharper my chest pains became. I had emailed my primary care doctor twice that morning because of symptoms and never heard back so when the chest pains hit, I went to the ER. At the ER they ran EKG, blood work, XRays. Kept me all day. At the end, they told me  I was healthy and let me go. The doctor had ZERO regard or interest in the fact that all of this started after the vaccine. No where in my notes was it noted that I had the vaccine.  The nurses told me this was a trend with the patients coming into ER complaining of post-vaccine symptoms and not having them documented.  I had breathing issues for almost two weeks after the vaccine where I would be short of breath and winded, not able to complete sentences without stopping for air.  I still have awkward breathing moments.  I called healthcare facility nightly to report this and again was told to just monitor my symptoms. I feel like this whole process has been an isolating, careless time where my vaccine side effects have NOT been taken seriously.

Monday-Tuesday felt extremely lethargic, slept most of the days. Wednesday my brain felt more alert but my body still felt funny, and the sound sensitivity was gone but the light sensitivity was still there. Was able to do some exercise. Each day has improved but now it?s Friday night and I continue to feel skin and light sensitivities.

                                                ~2 hours post-injection sharp pain in upper left abdomen under rib cage when breathing in but not constantly. Just every now and then. This lasted for ~72 hours.  ~12 hours post-injection developed a mild fever, chills, body aches, and head ache. Body aches became so bad that I couldn&#39;t sleep, sit, stand, lay down comfortably. Every joint in my body felt like glass shards in it and it felt like my body would crumble. I felt like the TinMan with no oil. This lasted for about 28 course post-injection. Fever lasted about 48 hours, and headache lasted about 72 hours.  ~36 hours post-injection I had a swollen lymph node on my left collarbone (shot was given in left arm). I&#39;m now ~96 hours post-injection and swelling has not come down. From my left collar bone to my left elbow there is dull aching soreness, and in my armpit too. I have weakness in my left arm and when I try to reach for anything it feels like my armpit is going to rip. I hope this goes away soon.

BP concerned pt so she stayed longer, called pts husband so she wouldn&#39;t be driving home. we rechecked 15 minutes later and BP check was 168/109, HR 89. pts breathing was rapid and shallow but no facial swelling or other signs of anaphylaxis. pt did not want us to call  EMS at this time. another 25 minutes later, BP recheck was 147/104 HR 82. Determined husband would take her to urgent care. Upon helping her get up and out to the car, pt became closer to passing out, she fell limp and started gasping for air. At this time I called EMS and paramedics arrived on scene to assess her further and took her to the ER, Follow up with pt about 2 hours later, she was still in the ER with her BP being monitored

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6208) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21Mar2021 14:45 (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included epilepsy and asthma. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included levetiracetam. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6203) administered in left arm on 28Feb2021 14:30 (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had the normal yet severe side effects of sore arm &amp; neck, stiffness behind the ear, stiffness of the neck and injection site arm, fatigue, fever, headache, sore throat, chills, for the first few days her 2nd dose. But on day 2, she started suffering from tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, confusion in both ears and increased seizure activity. The events started about 2 days after the second shot on 23Mar2021 12:00 PM; its been a week now and it still hasn&#39;t gotten better or gone away. She had an appointment with her pcp tomorrow but so far nothing has helped. Its debilitating and extremely hard to focus &amp; function. She mainly just wanted to know if any other vaccine trial participant/recipients have reported anything similar &amp; if so, how long can she expect this to last. The adverse events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was unknown if treatment was received for the events. No COVID prior vaccination. No COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Woke at 5am today and had what I can only describe as vertigo? Could not balance, did not have control of my legs which were wobbly tensed and shaking. Vision is off room spinning and hallucinating. My dogs shoulders were made of wood boards my partners eyes were black marbles and the room I was in I did not trust to be real or even existing (I was in my bedroom in my apartment I?ve lived in for over a year). It?s now 9am and still difficulty walking with wobbly tensed legs, dizzy, heavy eyes, and one nausea and cotton mouth. This is terrifying

                                                I&#39;ve always been very aware of my menstrual cycle as my body gives significant signs. My cycle has always been regular, with only a maximum of three days or less difference. Interestingly, a day after my first vaccine dose, I told those around me the symptoms were very similar to when I&#39;m about to menstruate but worse.   Tonight after about a week, very oddly, my cycle started 10 days early. Additionally, the color also looks different from what it looks like normally. It is usually ranges between dark red and brighter red but today, it has a notable purple tinge to it.   After an internet search, there is article where it seems other women are also experiencing significant shifts in their cycles. And as I&#39;m not one who normally pays much attention to health changes, this was significant enough for me to feel incentivized to report this. It is also quite troubling and is increasing a bit of anxiety on how the second dose may impact the hormones. I really hope there are better studies on how the vaccine can affect hormones as it can cause havoc with the body.

                                                Constant Tinnitus began in left ear the night I received the Covid-19 Vaccine shot. After a couple of days more symptoms appeared, including: Left ear fullness/pressure/inflammation feeling, left ear numbness, left outer ear tightness, shooting nerve pain in into left ear (outside and inside ear), shooting nerve pain towards the scalp on left side, extreme cramping inside and outside left ear. The tinnitus alternates between loudness of 2-7, at worst its a high pitched ringing noise, at best its a hissing noise. Often also a whistling noise, crackling noise, sleigh bell noise, occasionally pulsatile.  Also have increased anxiety due to the tinnitus.   Audiologist confirmed unilateral hearing loss in left ear in the Ultra high frequency hearing range (35db at 10K Hz, 60 dB at 11.2K Hz, 50 dB at 12.5K Hz, 40 dB at 14K Hz, and 35 dB at 16K Hz). Audiologist recommended practicing Mindfulness and listening to classical music, so as to not be in quiet environment, where I might focus more on the ringing in my ear. Taking supplements including: Multi-Vitamin, Iron supplement, Vitamin D3, Vitamin B Complex, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Bio-Flavonoids, Systemic enzymes, Benfotiamine, Turmeric. Currently 3.5 weeks later, I still have tinnitus, but it is usually at a volume of 3 or 4. It more often is hissing noise with alternating high pitched ringing. The ear fullness, numbness and nerve pain is less, but still there. ENT PA prescribed Methylprednisolone 7 day tapered dose on 4/15/2021 to take if painful symptoms of nerve shooting continue or get worse. Nerve shooting pains improved slightly, so as of yet have not begun the methylprednisolone. Anxiety has improved with use of Classical Music and Mindfulness. Also found a Facebook Group of those suffering tinnitus after the Covid-19 vaccine, and have found support there to cope.

                                                The day after receiving my first vaccine, I began to develop a headache and fatigued. I was unable to move my left arm much higher than an inch or two. My arm pain got better after 24 hours, but the headache and fatigue persisted. I felt well enough to work on April 12, 13 and 14 and went outside my home on the 12, 14 and 15, interacting with other people while masked. On April 16, the extreme fatigue set in. I could not get out of bed. EXTREME. That entire weekend I stayed in bed with the chills and also developed nasal congestion that has persisted to the time of this writing (April 23). On April 19, I started spotting and started my period (old blood) two weeks early. That has for the most part subsided to the level of my usual discharge, though it is a bit heavier than normal.  Also on April 19, the sore throat and chest pain started. I went for a COVID test today. Negative result. Chest pain is similar in location and scope to when I suffered with pericarditis years ago.  Took a sick day off of work. Fatigue getting better, but very very wiped out by the end of the day. Brain is foggy.  April 20 - virtual visit with my primary doctor to discuss symptoms. Chest pain continually getting worse, harder to take a deep breath, like when the doctor asks to &#34;take a deep breath and hold it,&#34; that really hurts. Can breathe regularly fine. But just sitting on the couch I&#39;m in pain. Laying down hurts the most. Get bloodwork, chest x-ray and covid test done. All normal.   April 22 - Chest pain continues to get worse. Starting to cough. Go to Urgent Care  at request of primary care doctor. Another covid test done, xray taken, flu swab., EKG. All normal. They send me to emergency room at  Hospital additonal assessment. EKG, ultrasound of heart and lungs, bloodwork done, all normal. They send me home on ibuprofin and tell me to follow up with my cardiologist. They believe it to be presumptive pericarditis.

                                                Hour after vaccination I started feeling nausea and chills. Four hours after I started having stomach pains that were sharp and burning, they would come in waves. Injection site started to be warm, firm, and hurt a lot. Ten hours after vaccination I started feeling more stomach pains as well as bloating, lower back/hipside pains, mid upperback discomfort below ribcage and 99.1 fever with chills. 12 Hours after vaccination I continued to feel bloating, stomach discomfort, chills, but also headache and increased heart rate and over all unwell feelings. Throughout night from midnight until 3:30 am I would wake up with increased heart rate and feeling hot and stomach bloating and discomfort. Heart rate would range from 82-100 bpm resting and fever never went past 100 degrees with one does of 500 mg tylenol. The next morning I continued to have stomach discomfort in upper stomach right under ribcage on both sides, mild bloating, nausae, on and off side and mid back under ribcage discomfort, and 99.2 degree fever with no medication. A week later my period started (on time) but a lot heavier than normal, with larger clots and headache/neck pain and extreme fatigue.

                                                Had vaccine, first feeling the cold, and stayed on the couch.  Then a burning sensation was felt in her legs and throughout her body.  She felt hot/burning sensation.  She took off her clothes as she had that sensation to feel more comfortable as she felt the clothes felt like pins and needles.  Then she had problems falling to sleep.  Her arm was hurting as well, and then had a mild headache.  She woke up early around 5:00 AM, and her arm was hurting to the ponit that she could lift it.  She had pain in the muscles of her legs, thighs, calf and then her stomach started aching, and her whole body was aching.  The arm was still unable to move, headache, and stayed in the bed all day, was very very tired as well.  The next day she felt so tired, stayed in bed, body aches, headache, and then she started noticing her vision was going.  Very very blurry vision on 4/21/21, and sensation to the light.  She was this way all day Wednesday and still problems on the light.  On 4/23/21, she was still tired, her arm was not hurting as much.  When she woke up her extremities were shaky.  Today her arms are shaking, her vision was tweeking and she could feel it, and also the headaches.    She called her doctor on the 24th, and told him her symptoms.  Her vision is bad to the point that she cannot use her phone as she cannot see, focus well and has blurry vision.  Yesterday at 4:00 Am she went to the hospital and they kept her over night.  They ran blood work, then they took an MRI of her brain, head MRI, and did not see anything of concern and told her to FU with a Neurologist.  to have further tests done but as she is pregnant (5-6) weeks they would probably have to wait.   Some of her side effects are still there, but has nausea and feels that her vision continues to be bad, and daily she wakes up and is worsening.  She has slight dizziness, and headaches, and feeling shaky.   She has not seen her doctor as far as her pregnancy yet, but has an APT on 6/10/21.  She has an APT to see her PCP on Friday, 4/30/21 at 9:00 AM.

It was accompanied by much more intense pain and cramping, as well as intense suicidal ideation. That period ended after a very heavy bleeding of 4 days. I got the second shot just before my 37th birthday and the very next day felt terrible. My entire body hurt in a way I have never experienced before. My feet hurt, my hips, extreme fatigue. That continues in varying severity. I started spotting again on April 19th, which continues until I started another period on April 23rd which just ended yesterday, the 26th. I am still very fatigued and have been dealing with extreme suicidal thoughts and uncontrollable crying.

I developed chills, a 102 F fever, and my skin hurt. My arm also hurt very badly and I had trouble moving it. The reason for reporting, is I also had some odd side effects I&#39;m not seeing reported. I also experienced extreme vaginal dryness 24-48 hours after the vaccination. I use the Nuva Ring and it actually stuck to the inside of me. It was very painful. I also started my period two weeks early. The vaginal dryness continues while I had my period. My period lasted 6 days. On the 5th day of my period the vaginal dryness diminished. It was very odd having vaginal dryness while I had my period. Fortunately that is gone and I have recovered.

                                                11.20 am March 31st 2021 ? Pfizer first dose Around 4.30 pm ? severe headache, feeling like in an unfamiliar environment, low-grade fever, muscle pain Took ibuprofen around 4.30 pm, took Tylenol after 8 hours, took Tylenol in 12-hour gap for two days After about 30 hours, symptoms went away. Had headaches occasionally.  8.10 pm April 8th Eyesight declined to a certain limit; Eyesight was similar for both eyes. Waited for about 10 minutes hoping it would go away. Started feeling right arm was numb and after some time left side of the head including the ear was aching. Got medical help after about 5 minutes. Nothing was found wrong in the preliminary checkup. Taken to the emergency room. Could remember all the basic information. Had difficulties recalling past incidents and correlating things. Could think only about one thing at a time when making decisions. Could not relate things well. After coming home, realized that I had taken extra effort when talking as my tongue moving was quite resistant. Had headaches few times and took Tylenol. Had a headache and took the medication given at the ER. It did not help much.  April 13th Went to see the doctor as instructed by the emergency room. Asked to start taking aspirin 2 days prior to second vaccine and continue for 5 days after vaccination  4 pm April 14th Was lightheaded for few hours. Took aspirin before bed. Had a severe backpain throughout the night.  Morning April 15th Took Tylenol as body was paining and it did not help much. Contacted health center. Was asked to get a Covid test done.  April 16th ? felt better April 18th ? Started feeling like my usual self again. Felt fit again.  April 19th Went to see the doctor at the health center. Felt tired after walking a short distance. Unusual for me. Covid test was negative and another test was done to check whether I has another viral infection and the test turned out to be negative.   April 20th- April 21st When recalling things in my work, I realized few times that I cannot think properly.  April 21st I was felt healthy throughout the day but got exhausted by the end of the day without doing much work. Got a severe headache and took two aspirins around 9 pm before bed. Woke up around 12.30 pm. Could not go to sleep for about 3 hours as I felt so warm and I was restless. Lot of negative feelings were coming to my mind.  April 22nd Got up around 7 am. So tired and the whole body was aching. Took Tylenols as I still had the headache and headache except body aches were gone by 1 hour. I had fatigue by the end of the classes. Before classes, I was trying hard to understand the material. Though I could read those familiar problems, I could not understand the concepts easily. When doing classes, I was just reading the answers of the problems. I was trying hard to correlate things as I felt like my brain was not cooperating with me making familiar concepts unfamiliar to me. Towards the end of the day, I could correlate things and think properly though I was still tired. After about 6 pm, I started feeling fit again though there were body aches.  I have taken aspirin about twice within a three-year period. To my knowledge, no problems occurred.  Though my second dose was scheduled to April 22nd, I did not take the second dose as I was not feeling well even after 3 weeks.  After about one month taking the first dose, I was feeling better. Specifically, I felt that my thinking was not clear for the past 4 weeks.

This consumer (patient) reported for herself that a 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP7533) at the age of 36-years, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included had a pregnancy (a while ago, not ongoing). No other products. The patient stated that she experienced shortness of breath on 08Apr2021 (4 days after receiving the first dose), it got so severe on day 7 that she went to the ER on 11Apr2021. She started getting progressively more shortness of breath. Twice, she called the nurse line for her doctor and was advised to go to the emergency room. Added she could not catch her breath, and it was worse at night, could not sleep, so she went to the emergency room, she was in emergency room for 2 and a half hours and then went home. She wanted to know if the second dose could cause issues or if she should get it, added that the paperwork said that people should not get the vaccine if they received an adverse reaction to the first dose or any vaccination. She did not know if this was normal for it to get progressively worse and 2 to 14 days later. Patient wanted to know if the shortness of breath was something that can get worse, if this was a reaction to the vaccine even though it happened so many days later. Patient added it was the only thing she could think of and that her heart rate, oxygen levels, and everything was good minus she felt like she could not catch her breath. The doctor in the ER gave her anti-anxiety medicine, something with an L, but the doctor gave her that and it really seemed to help. It was kind of like, she did not know, it made her feel calm enough to fall asleep. Caller added that she has that and an salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. She was not sure whether progressively worsening shortness of breath had gotten any better or was still going on, added that yesterday was the day she did not need either treatment medication. The day before, she took just the anxiety medicine and not the albuterol. Yesterday, she took none. During the day on 11Apr2021 (Sunday), she had called because she was feeling uncomfortable constantly. She has two children and all day she did not feel well. She told her husband she did not feel well at all. Sunday when she went to lay down, she could not sleep. Patient reported that as her shortness of breath subsided, her arm started hurting again, thought this began on 19Apr2021 and was not sure, it went away completely and was just at the injection site, probably lasting half a day or so and then it went away, clarified as left arm, same as injection. Caller added that 15Apr2021 was after the ER visit, was that she was standing up doing things and from her knee down felt tingly. Stated that knee down felt tingly on 15Apr2021, which was after her ER visit occurred, she was standing up and doing things. She had not been doing things for long periods but her knee down felt tingly. Added not like numb, but like her legs were falling asleep. She was preparing dinner and moving around and felt tingling in both legs. This probably lasted about three hours. She just kind of took it easy and it started to subside and then it was gone. While mentioned investigations, patient stated the ER did an EKG, where they put stickers and monitor her heart. They did a chest x-ray, and they took blood. She believed they checked for blood clot tests and anemia. Patient did not know any results but stated the doctor came into the room and told her everything was clear and nothing came back with anything on it. She stated the date was either the night of 11Apr2021 or the morning of 12Apr2021 for the tests. Outcome of the events shortness of breath and arm hurting was recovered/resolved in Apr2021; of the event knee down felt tingly/like her legs were falling asleep was recovered/resolved on 15Apr2021; while of remain was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Apr2021 (at the age of 36-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included schizophrenia. Concomitant medications included unspecified schizophrenia medication. The patient experienced feels like about to die, feel drowsy/sleepiness/could not stay awake, feels like wind trying to take, hard to go to sleep, and feeling in her stomach like it is coming down on 02May2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient reported that she has been drinking lots of water and doodling because doodling flushes it out. She felt like when sleeping and it is hard to go to sleep because it feels like something is trying to take her breath. The patient reported that the drowsiness started on the fourth day after she received the first dose of the vaccine on 28Apr2021. Ever since the 4th day, the drowsiness has been off and on. The patient reported that when it is going to flush out, she has a feeling in her stomach like it is coming down and she drinks a lot of water.  She reported that she will feel drowsy and sleepiness like she cannot stay awake. The patient felt it more when she is laying down for a nap. She had to stop taking her unspecified schizophrenic medication because it was making her drowsier. She felt like she was about to die and has never felt like that before. She did not feel comfortable taking the second dose of the vaccination as she did not want to feel worse than how she was feeling at time of call on 06May2021. The clinical outcome of feels like about to die, feel drowsy/sleepiness/could not stay awake, feels like wind trying to take, hard to go to sleep, and feeling in her stomach like it is coming down was not recovered.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                I had recovered about 90% (with medication) since having COVID in December when I received my first dose of the COVID vaccine. Thirteen days after the vaccine I began to experience symptoms like when I had COVID. On day 13 I started to itch and my BP dropped and I became light headed. My vision started to go and I had a hard time breathing and forming words for my husband to help me with some water. This lasted about 20 min.    Since then I have been having heart rate increases up into the 150s with minimal effort. Bending like doing dishes or putting away groceries makes me extremely light headed. I have become so tired just folding a little bit of laundry. It wasn?t until a few weeks in that I noticed this was all exactly like when I had COVID. Including being okay in the morning but having so many issues by the evening. So weird.   I?m 3 weeks and 4 days past my second shot and finally starting to have some better days again but no day has been symptom free. I wish could know if this is happening to other long haulers and that it will most likely resolve, I have been starting to wonder about disability and really having a hard time facing the fact that I no longer can complete simple house hold chores like I used to.

Then my lymph swelled up for 3 days. From my collar bone to my shoulder blade and under my arm, it was extremely swollen and painful. I thought I had a rib out! When the swelling subsided (day 4 or 5), my heart started fluttering, palpitating, and I felt extreme anxiety.  I also felt achy in my entire body for the following month. Pain in all my joints. A LOT of inflammation. I was worried.  I got a dr. appt and had an EKG.  Nothing was found and nothing was suggested. Upon seeing a second doctor, he suggested I take aspirin. This has helped A TON! I am still having a lot of heart fluttering. This is NOT NORMAL it happened within a week of getting the shot and it is scary.

                                                Client received her first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine (Lot # EW0187 Exp. 08/2021) on 6/3/21 at 2:48 PM. Client&#39;s husband whistled to EMT and paramedic, signaling that he needed assistance. Client was a 36-year-old female found sitting upright in an observation chair, alert and tracking and appeared to be in mild distress. Client had a chief complaint of throat irritation. Client&#39;s husband stated that the client was complaining of itchiness in her throat and on her chest. Client stated that she had a history of heart murmurs and frequent anxiety. Client denied prescription medication. Client had no known allergies. Assessment revealed no hives, swelling, discoloration, rash, accessory muscle use or other signs of anaphylaxis. Client stated that she began to feel the itchiness in her throat immediately after she received her shot but was hesitant to signal for assistance and waited a few minutes to notify staff. Client then added that her throat felt &#34;swollen&#34; and that she felt an itch on her chest as well. However, the client was able to make these statements without difficulty other than some mild fatigue. Airway, breathing and circulation were intact. Client was alert and oriented to person, place, date and event. Clients first set of vitals at 1503 were heart rate 138, respirations 28, blood pressure 152/98, O2 saturation 100% on room air, eyes equal and reactive to light, lung sounds clear bilaterally, and skin signs were normal throughout her body. Client was assisted from the observation chair to an observation bed by her husband and EMT. After lying down, the client briefly fell asleep and was laid supine. Client was asleep for approximately a minute before waking up. The client was then sat up and her vitals were retaken and had improved with a blood pressure of 138/98, heart rate 88, respirations 24 and O2 sat at 100%. After some brief monitoring, the client consented to an RN?s administration of Benadryl 50mg (Lot # 020020 Exp. 02/2022) Intramuscular at 1512 on her right arm. Client then remained lying down and stated that she felt &#34;better&#34; approximately 10 minutes after Benadryl administration. However, five minutes later the client complained of a headache and chest pain which she later described as itchiness on her chest once again. Client then briefly became extremely anxious again before becoming calmer and consenting to staff dialing 911. Client consented to 911 at 1522 and Paramedics arrived at 1530. Client&#39;s vitals were assessed at five minute intervals until paramedics arrived: 138/100 (BP), 112 (HR), 99% (O2), 24 (RR);  1512 - 138/100 (BP), 88 (HR), 100% (O2), 20 (RR), 1517 - 130/92, 76, 100%, 20, 1522 - 128/94, 76, 99%, 20, 1524 (Anxiety episode)- 158/98, 92, 100%, 28  1529 - 130/ 98, 76, 99%, 24. Client consented to transport with paramedics at 1540 to the nearest hospital.

I also had pressure/ pain in the left side of chest where the heart is. I can&#39;t sleep well, because of the involuntary twitching in the legs. It&#39;s mainly my left part of the body that is affected. I feel like this vaccine messed up my nervous system. Not going  for the second shot. Consulted my GP who said some people have these side effects and to go to ER if I have problems breathing or severe pain in the chest.

Tried to hydrate and eat nutritious food for the first few days.  However, strange feeling of being lightheaded, dizzy, wobbly on my feet, almost feeling faint, continued for a full 2&#43; weeks after the 2nd vaccine on May 15th.. I went to the ER on May 22nd since that was 1 week past the vaccine and I wasn&#39;t feeling any better.  I was getting nervous.  I had this &#34;out of body&#34; feeling, like the pressure in my head wasn&#39;t right.  I had blood work and was recommended to see a cardiologist.  I wore a heart monitor for 2 weeks, all while my symptoms started to slowly improve.  I feel mostly completely recovered now.

                                                I got the vaccine at 9 a.m. and I started feeling very tired at some point in the afternoon. I was feeling a little bit odd and mostly just tired. We sit down to dinner at 6:30 or 7 and I started getting these weird 8 sort of radiating down my legs almost like achy knee pain. I had the urge to have a bowel movement, which appeared to be a normal bowel movement. I started feeling progressively worse. I was just achy, fatigue, and it was just kind of hard to do things and move around. I breastfed my daughter. I guess I should mention that with both of the vaccinations, this being my think it, my breasts got very engorged and painful. I am 7 months postpartum and never have engorgement or pain in my breasts. But for two days after the vaccine I had engorged painful let down both times. I was feeding her and just ceiling off. I got up hoping I would have the energy to put some groceries away and then I wanted to take a bath because I thought it would make me feel better. I walk to the kitchen and my knees and legs just felt so weird and achy. My entire body started shaking and trembling uncontrollably. I really couldn&#39;t move very well and all of my muscles were tensing up. So I just went down to the floor and tried to stay in a fetal position. While this was happening I was getting really cold. At some point my teeth started chattering and my muscles were tensing up, especially the muscles in my neck and jaw and shoulders. They hurt so bad and felt like they were just tightening beyond control. My arms and hands felt very very cold. My lower back especially along my spine was hurting really badly and my knees and other joints were hurting. I stayed on the ground until my husband, who was putting our daughter to bed, came out and helped me get to the bathtub. He actually thought we should call 911, but I wanted to try hot water to see if I could get my muscles to unclench. I sat in hot bath and the shaking stopped but I started feeling like my head was boiling. My husband helped me get out of the tub and dressed and pretty much right when I got out of the tub I started feeling really cold again and the shaking started again. I got in bed under lots of layers and was still very cold and shaking. My head felt very hot but the rest of me felt very cold. I had a lot of trouble sleeping and kept alternating between feeling like I was on fire and then my body would be really cold but my head would be really hot. I just felt really achy and feverish. At one point I felt pretty dizzy. So I just held still as much as I could. At another point I got what felt like really severe period cramps on my left side. I changed positions and they did go away. I felt nauseated the next morning and have no appetite. I made myself eat some saltine crackers and have a coconut water. I felt still like I had a flu or something but the headache was the worst part. I have never had a headache that bad it felt like my entire skull was cracking open. And pretty much the first half of the day after the vaccine I felt like I had just been hit by a truck. I ended up taking ibuprofen midday because of the headache and the joint pain that I was experiencing mostly in my knees and started feeling significantly better. It has been 2 days after the vaccine and I pretty much feel normal except my lower back feels swollen on the left side. The night when all of this was happening my lower back was hurting pretty badly as well along with my other joints, specifically my knees.

These spread to my upper extremities and became consistent. Occasionally will appear in lips and trunk. These are associated with sensation of numbness and some discomfort in my extremities. I&#39;m also experiencing significant brain fog, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Headaches are occurring about every other day.  Symptoms are present currently and have remained relatively consistent in severity.  Was evaluated by urgent care on December 28 and encouraged to observe. Was evaluated in the ER by neurology on January 4. There leading hypothesis is vaccine related immune response. Neurologic exam was largely normal, being evaluated by a specialist in the coming days.

A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EH9899) via intramuscular on 19Dec2020 09:00 on left deltoid at a single dose for COVID-19 prophylaxis. The patient medical history, family history and relevant tests were reported as none. Current concomitant medications included multivitamin took 2 chewable gummies sporadically for years as supplementation therapy. The patient previously took Flu shots she got a sore arm. It was not bad. Tetanus gives her a sore arm, but that was all. Caller wanted to know what she should do for preparation to safely get second dose of Covid vaccine and how to fix what she was feeling right now, making sure it doesn&#39;t get worse, considering she is still having symptoms. Caller stated that she had side effects of tongue felt swollen and globus sensation in her throat. The transferring agent stated that he has a caller on the line that was calling about the Covid-19 Vaccine and reported that the patient got the shot on the 19Dec2020 and was inquiring about to proceed with her weird side effects. Caller had not told her physician about her symptoms yet. Caller clarified that she said a half an hour after the dose on 19Dec2020 09:30 she said that she had a Globus sensation or like a lump in her throat. Caller also reported that the back of her tongue felt swollen. Caller said that the Globus sensation was intermittent and it was not as prominent now as it was. Caller said that it was medically significant, but she has not sought medical treatment yet. Caller said that she still had a bruise or ecchymosis at the injection site. She said that the injection was high but reported that she did not have a lot of injection site pain, it very minimal. No emergency room or physician office required. The outcome of the event tongue felt swollen and globus sensation in her throat was recovering and the outcome of the event a bruise or ecchymosis at the injection site was not recovered and the outcome of the event minimal injection site pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible chronological association between vaccine administration and onset of the events. Causality cannot be completely excluded.

The time I went to bed had fatigue, headache, body aches with neck and back pain. Took tylenol and motrin before going to sleep. When I woke up at 4pm, 31 hours after receiving the vaccine I had, sore throat, head congestion, severe body aches and headache. I attempted to get up since I was scheduled to work at 7pm and then got dizzy. I took tylenol and motrin, put a heating pad on my back, drank some hot tea and went back to bed for the night. Woke up at 7:30am almost 2 days after receiving the vaccine still with headache, body aches and fatigue. The sore throat and head congestion seem to have subsided. Took more tylenol and motrin and went back to bed. Still at this time feel just tired and body aches, mostly in the neck and back.

The following morning I felt well enough to come into work but then felt increasingly weak, achy, and tired and had to go home at 12pm. All side effects were resolved by 5pm. &#34;

                                                At 2000 on 1/13/21, I started to experience intense ache at the injection site, which by 2200 progressed to myalgias in my back, especially lower back, neck, and right arm. At 2300,  I started to have fever/chills, up to 39 C orally. This only partially responded to Tylenol. I was not able to sleep.  At 2:30 am I noticed an unusual headache, 8/10, as well as bilateral eye pain on Moving eyes side to side as well as sensitivity to light. Headache was mostly frontal, which came and went every few minutes  until exactly 11:38 am on 1/14/2021, when the fever and myalgias very suddenly got significantly better. Almost exactly 24 hrs to the minute after injection. On 1/15/2021, I still have significant pain in my left arm, swelling, redness and, now, itching at the injection site. My lower back still hurts.

                                                Within 2 minutes post vaccination i started feeling loss of sense of myself. I could not pinpoint if i felt dizzy or vertiginous. Felt like i was off balance and i was super vernous to walk. Vertiginous episodes come and go with peaks for at least 10 times. The whole episode lasted 4 hours until i felt going back to myself.   I was provided water, 1 L and orange juice, there was epi available. No anaphylactic symptoms, no shortness of breath.   I drank 1,5 L of fluids and then my BP was checked 120/80, HR 80s.  I note that i never felt syncopal,  no diaphoresis, nausea, nor darkened vision and i was fully interactive with the bystanders.  Note, i am a critical care intensivist so i had full grasp of the issue but i could now quite describe the sensation of this acute loss of instability. The best way to describe this was vertigo. Similar episode occured at the first vaccine with COVID, occured after 10 minutes and lasted no more than 30 seconds. I didnt report that then because i thought it was just dehydration.

A 37-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Ek5730), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 28Dec2020 12:00PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at hospital facility. Medical history included Hashimotos disease. The patient had no known allergies and has not had COVID prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she felt tired and confused and unwell on day of injection, 28Dec2020. After three days (31Dec2020), she developed hives on her stomach and arm and seven days later (04Jan2021), she was diagnosed with pneumonia and continued to have hives all over her legs and arms to this day. The patient was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She underwent Covid test/ Nasal swab post vaccination on 09Jan2021, pending result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported pneumonia was more likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I developed the expected side effects of fever, chills, and body aches.  The body aches were mostly in my neck and hips.  They slowly improved but lingered in my neck.  Then on Sunday 1/9 I developed severe 10/10 pain in my neck and shooting down my left arm and down my shoulders and back.  It was unrelieved by ibuprofen, norco, heat, essential oils, and changing of positions.  I was unable to sleep.  I went to my chiropractor and she was unable to adjust me due to severe pain.  She applied icy hot, did some gentle massage, and gave me curcumin for the inflammation . She believed it was an inflammatory response in my cervical spine.  It slowly improved to a 8/10 pain, but I was still unable to sleep laying down. I was unable to work for 3 schedule shifts.   I saw my chiropractor 4 times total that week. On 1/16 I went to urgent care because the pain was not getting better.  She said I had torticollis and gave me naproxen and a stretching exercise.  It is still lingering muscle pain, but I am able to finally sleep and function normally.   I had never experienced pain like that before and I hope I never do again.

The injection site hurt for 1-2 days but very mild.  I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen before the shot.  The most disturbing was the increase blood pressure and palpitations.  It was on and off.

So I did... and then again.... and again.    Then I felt dizzy and disoriented... foggy headed kind of drunk feeling.    Then within what seemed like seconds... my mouth felt full so I opened my mouth and looked in the mirror.   My tongue seemed bigger than usual and lighter in color.  But what was most noticeable was that I had Ripples along the whole outer edge and side of my tongue.    pulse ox reading was an 89 so they administered a prescription strength Benadryl shot and told me they would need to monitor me and keep an eye on me.  Another woman drove me from the vaccination site to the clinic where they checked my oxygen levels again and i was already back up to 99.  They monitored me and checked on me for about 15-20 minutes before releasing me.  My tongue finally felt normal again about 2 hours later while resting at home.

I couldn&#39;t focus on work, and I felt my eyesight starting to get fuzzy.  I realized there was an issue, and decided to go to bed.  As soon as I laid in bed, the chills started, and for the next hour I couldn&#39;t stop shaking.  I couldn&#39;t get comfortable, hot/cold, hot/cold, the chills were incessant and I couldn&#39;t will myself to sleep.  I finally fell asleep and proceeded to toss and turn.  I woke up at 5am on Thursday and could barely move.  My body was so sore and my head was pounding with a migraine.  I was trying to take care of the kids, unsuccessfully, while battling all the symptoms.  The day progressed slowly, and I started to feel better mid day after a few more hours of sleep.  Around 6pm is when the fever kicked in, hovering right about 99.5.  I drank Pedialyte and went to bed not long after I got the kids in bed.  At 2am I woke up with another headache and took more Tylenol.  By 6am today, Friday, the fever broke and I am back to normal.

The following day (1/20), the pain  was worse leaving me unable to do daily tasks.  It increased through the day at work (1-handed work) to the point of being unable to use 3 fingers without excruciating pain.  On 1/21, saw a neurologist who diagnosed parsonage turner&#39;s syndrome due to the covid vaccine.

I tested positive for COVID 12/27/2020 and experienced mild symptoms such as mild fatigue and congestion. Thinking I had recovered from COVID I returned back to work as a RN on 1/9/2021.  I was told I could still get the 2nd dose of the vaccine if I still wanted to and that I should expect side effects of possible fevers, chills, fatigue and that they can last up to 3 days. I went ahead and got my 2nd dose on 1/13/2021. By the next day I had chills and extreme fatigue. I was expecting it and thought it would go away by the next two days. By day 4 I was feeling just as bad and actually felt worse than I did when first testing positive for COVID. On 1/17/2021 I experienced shortness of breath and palpitations while getting dressed. I went to ED and was sent home. On 1/19/2021 I experienced similar symptoms while driving home from DR appointment. Went to ER again and was sent home and was told it was all post covid symptoms.

Moved to observation chair for further assessment and vitals check. Upon getting up to go to the new chair, was lightheaded. Vital signs taken and revealed tachycardia and increased BP beyond normal values. Prior symptoms persist. Healthcare workers continue to monitor me while sitting on chair.  Oral Tylenol for headache was given. Approximately 30-45 minutes in I feel chest palpitations and an uneasy &#39;anxious&#39; type of feeling even though I am just sitting down and staying calm. Due to all these symptoms plus the BP and HR remaining high they gave me  Benadryl 25mg IM to the right arm as well. The BP started to slowly go down after about 2 hrs as well as HR. Allowed to leave hospital vaccination clinic, while BP and HR still high, was better than the first 2 hours.   New symptoms on day 2, pain left arm at injection site and muscles, fatigue and some intermittent nausea. The symptoms continued for 3-4 days post vaccination. I monitored Vitals at home.  BP finally stabilized to my normal range around the 4th day.

I thought it was allergies associated with changing weather and I wasn?t running fever so I continued to go to work. Two days later I still had no fever, but got dizzy and started feeling bad. I went and got tested that night and tested positive for the virus.  My eyes have itch and burned, but I still have never run and fever and didn?t loose my Sense of smell until 5 days after symptoms first started. My cough got worse and I have also had sneezing.

I also woke up in the middle of the night with horrible pain throughout my entire left arm, from my shoulder down through my hand. This lasted a couple hours and then returned to just moderate soreness at the injection site only.

Lasted about 2 hours still after medicating myself with antihistamines.  About 3 days after the vaccine I noticed a different vaginal discharge that has a different odor, almost like a  metallic one.  I am not sexually active at the moment  but this happened after the vaccine. I have never smelled something like this. It does not smell like an STD odor. I got body aches and severe headaches, congestion and runny nose, I felt terrible, I had a low grade fever (99.1F) I am usually on the 97F range) , general malaise and fatigue, I could not get out of the bed, just to go out to the bathroom. Went to the PCP who tested me for flu and covid and both were negative.  The symptoms lasted about 48 to 72 hours.  Except the discharge/vaginal odor all symptoms subsided.

The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D) and ethinylestradiol/ norgestimate (ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. On 15Jan2021 (day 2; also reported as 08Jan2021), entire body tingling started. On days 3 and 4 (16Jan2021 and 17Jan2021), the patient had very heavy sweats. No fever, just body felt hot all over, and body just felt weird and off in Jan2021. The side effects went away on day 9 (22Jan2021). No treatment was given for the adverse events. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on 22Jan2021.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I suddenly had blurry vision with dots and squiggles in front of my eyes to the point I couldn&#39;t even see. It then turned into a raging headache. I went to bed, where I had terrible, restless sleep. I woke up feeling as if I was awake all night and very woozy and weak. It went away by early afternoon the following day, so a total of about 20 hours.

A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 22Jan2021 at 09:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was reported as the clinic. The patient had no medical history; she had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included aloe ferox gum, aloe vera gum, atropa belladonna herb, peumus boldus leaf oil, rhamnus frangula (SPARK, &#34;Advocare Spark&#34;) and &#34;NLA for Her Shred Her&#34; as diet supplement (sup). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 22Jan2021 at 10:00, also reported as 10-13 minutes after vaccination, the patient needed to clear her throat a few times. Within seconds or minutes, she felt dizzy, disoriented, and foggy headed. Then her mouth felt full and she looked in the mirror and noticed her tongue was larger than normal and swollen. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The adverse events did result in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events, which included a steroid and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) shot. The patient recovered from all the events on an unspecified date.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                This is a 37 y.o. woman who developed an episode of acute self-limited hemolysis just over a week following her second injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine immediately prior to the episode for a urinary tract infection.  She had no history of hemolysis prior to this episode.  She was in her usual state of health and received COVID-19 vaccines on 12/24 and 1/14 with the Pfizer vaccine and had no serious side effects at that time.  She then developed dysuria and was seen by telehleath by her primary care physician who prescribed ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine for her for 3 days ending 1/22.  She took these and her dysuria resolved, however the day after developed what appeared to be blood in her urine.  Then in the following 2 days which were a weekend this worsened and she started feeling poorly.  She also noted that she appeared yellow.  On Monday 1/25 her boyfriend took her to urgent care and she was subsequently sent to an ER at the hospital that referred her to our hospital.  There she was evaluated for gross hematuria with no evidence of urinary bleeding and found to be anemic due to hemolysis.  Her hemoglobin was in the 5&#39;s and she received 2 units of PRBCs.  She was transferred here to Medical Center for further management.  After the initial transfusion she did not require blood transfusion and her hemoglobin continued to increase until it was 10.4 on 2/1 which was the day of discharge.  At a follow up appointment on 2/8/2021 she was recovering and feeling well.   Her jaundice had resolved.   No treatment was given from the hemolysis aside from the blood transfusion and it was self-limited.  It is most likely that her acute hemolysis was due to the phenazopyridine as this agent is known to cause hemolysis and she took it for 3 days prior to the onset of hemolysis.  She has no prior history of drug induced hemolysis and had not taken this medication previously.  As this occurred just over a week following her second vaccination I cannot exclude that is could be related to the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the second shot at approximately 1030AM, I returned home and felt fairly normal. In the evening, I started to feel very weak and developed a fever of 101.9 and took 500mg tylenol and continued to hydrate with water and powerade. Throughout the evening, I checked my temperature, it ranged from 101.9-102.8. I also developed strong chills, which caused me to shiver to the point where my significant other thought I may be seizing. (this also happened with the first shot - fevers and chills). I went to bed, waking up 3 hours later and I had to change my pajamas as I was soaked in sweat. I became nauseous and vomited a decent amount of what appeared to be red blood - but did not want to go to the ER as I was cold and exhausted and extremely feverish. Throughout the next 36 hours I continued to run a fever and struggled to do basic household chores (wash a dish, walk up and down the stairs, change shirts, etc) without assistance - normally not things I would need help with. Having had COVID nearly 90 days ago, the aftermath of the vaccination was worse than the actual illness for me.

The numbness was only on my left side and went from my jaw to my eye. I also had a headache as well. I also felt like something was stuck in my throat, but not like I couldn&#39;t get air. Those symptoms lasted about 2-3 hours. When I got home, about an hour after I got the vaccine, I ended up breaking out on torso. I took Benadryl and went to sleep. The next morning, I was itchy and breaking out in hives in torso area. I took Benadryl again and the numbness and itchiness improved, but I had a headache for like 8 days.  On the 6th day, I had really bad body aches and my headache was extreme. Per on call allergist, I wasn&#39;t allowed to get 2nd dose based on CDC guidelines.

Went to bed cold and then woke up several times very hot and sweaty, but don&#39;t know if this was related to vaccine, since this happens on occasion without the vaccine.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 01-13-2021 at 8:30am in my left upper arm.  By 3pm that day, my left arm was very tender to the point I couldn?t lift it up and I began having whole body chills and shivering along with extreme fatigue. I went to bed at 5:30pm that night and woke up around 11:30pm to my whole body shaking and shivering and my teeth where chattering together. My husband said I was confused at that time and kept repeating that I was freezing. I must have had 5 blankets piled on top of me to try to get me to warm up.  By the next morning, I soaked through the bedsheets and had extreme fatigue (like I had a hard time keeping my eyes open) all over body aches, fever and chills.  I remained this way for the next week.  At the end of the 1st week I still had chills, extreme fatigue, nausea and horrible headaches and my left arm pain turned into left elbow joint pain. By the end of the 2nd week, I still had extreme fatigue, headaches and left elbow pain along with body tremors. On 1-28-2021, I went to the hospital due to having two episodes where I felt so dizzy I had to lay down on the ground until the dizzy spells subsided. I was given IV fluids and sent home with orders to rest. By the end of the 3rd week I no longer had body tremors or dizzy spells but I still had extreme fatigue needing multiple naps a day along with headaches at which time my primary doctor prescribed me Imitrex to help alleviate the headaches and I still had left elbow joint pain. I also developed bronchitis. It is now February 25, 2021 and I am still having fatigue and mild to moderate headaches along with the left elbow joint pain along with some right elbow joint pain. I have been out of work for over a month now due to my fatigue and joint pain.

An hour after, developed chronic mild headache, chronic mild lightheadedness, and chronic moderate fatigue which are expected symptoms with the immune response. HOWEVER, symptoms did not improve in 3 days and actually very slowly worsened until I couldn?t function for work about 2.5 weeks after the vaccine. At this point, the lightheadedness and fatigue were severe and headaches varied between moderate to severe, resulting in me being out of work for 9 consecutive  work days. Had multiple MD visits with tons of tests. During the time I was out, I developed severe lower abdominal pain for two days and severe lightheadedness/nausea/mild vomitting due to being nauseated with chronic headaches. OTC meds did not help much for the headaches nor other symptoms. I have never dealt with symptoms like these before and am very healthy.  At the 4.5 week mark post vaccine, these symptoms finally started to very slowly improve, VERY slowly. Tests at MD were inconclusive. I?m still dealing with chronic mild headaches, lightheadedness, and this past Friday now unusual chest pains that move location and severity.

                                                Within 12-14 hours from receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine, I began to have symptoms that initially started as general malaise, fatigue, and muscle and aches and pains. By 2am On 2/09/21, I began having chills and by 6am, I had a fever of 101. F. Pain at the injection site started to develop , which I understood is a normal side effect of vaccines in general, but then over the course of hours to days, the pain began to radiate up my arm to my shoulder, and up my neck, to my head where a severe headache would ensue and render me unable to perform my daily activities. For days I was feeling unwell causing me to call out sick from my job as a nurse more than once. I also feel pain in my axilla and breast tissue adjacent to my arm pit, directly beneath the injection site. I also experienced nausea when the headache and muscle aches were at their worst. The fever eventually subsided after a few days, but the headache has persisted despite taking Ibuprofen as directed by my physician via a telehealth visit on day 3. (I called for an appointment on day 2, but they only had the next day available.) The headache pain is heavy, sharp, piercing, and throbbing, definitely interrupting with my daily activities. I have to go lay down and apply an ice pack to my head and neck area several times a day. These symptoms had been persisting for several days in a row and after being seen by my doctor again on the 8th day because of the symptoms, she recommended I go to the emergency room to address the persisting headaches and rule out any head bleeding and report the symptoms related to the vaccine. I was also advised by my physician to consider skipping the 2nd dose of the vaccine because of my severe reaction to the first one.

                                                Day of vaccine (Tues 3/9): Mild headache, injection site soreness.  I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s related, but I couldn&#39;t really focus on work-related tasks - I don&#39;t know if it was just the nervousness of waiting for side effects or what.  Day after vaccine (Wed 3/10): Mild headache that came and went through the day (I took acetaminophen in the early evening), tiredness, injection site soreness (noticed bruise forming), and felt &#34;off&#34; - not quite nauseated, but not normal self.  Same lack of focus/productivity.  Two days after vaccine (Thur 3/11): No headache, injection site soreness waning (but bruise is bigger), not as tired, better focus, but in the evening, I felt a hard rounded node above my collarbone (about two fingers wide).  Freaked out, Googled it, saw swollen lymph nodes on side of vaccine site is somewhat typical.  Appears to be my left supraclavicular lymph node and if you look hard enough, you can visibly see the left side is slightly swollen.  I cannot feel any other swollen lymph nodes.  Today (Fri 3/12):  Bruised injection site, and this swollen, hard lymph node is quite sore.  Other than that, I feel fine at the moment.

                                                Scenario: Pharmacist administered immunization and patient  had immediate reaction to imz. The patient has multiple health conditions such as lupus, cerebral palsy, and is currently on dialysis. She indicated on the PQCF that she had never had an adverse reaction after a vaccine but after the incident, her husband indicated this was normal and not uncommon.    SIG: Pharmacist Administered Immunization   What happened (Describe in detail, what occurred)? * The patient came in for a covid vaccine; this was the first of a 2 series of Pfizer. * The pharmacist injected the immunization and a few minutes afterwards the husband called for the pharmacist to come because his wife didn&#39;t feel well. She immediately became unresponsive and her eyes rolled back into her head but she came to. She was responding somewhat to questions but she was also slightly mentally impaired at baseline due to her co-morbidities. She never fell to the ground or wanted to lie down, so not a true faint. * The pharmacist offered to call 911 but they both declined. The patient was given water and a banana and taken to a private area to recover until she fell well enough to leave.  How did it happen? * The Pharmacist administered an appropriate, routine vaccine per protocol. *Patient had an somewhat immediate reaction (~4 minutes) after the vaccine. *The pharmacist followed the adverse event protocol. CPR was not administered nor benadryl.  Why did it happen (Root Causes)? * Unknown; patient has no known allergy to the vaccine but has had adverse reactions to different procedures in the past.  Plan of Action * Make sure all pharmacists are refreshed and aware of the adverse reaction protocol. *Document reaction as a SCRT and with VAERS. What specific task will take place to prevent future recurrence? *N/A. Who: * Pharmacist Where: * clinic When: *All pharmacists at location must review by 3/20.

About  01:00, I woke up and I was in a lot of pain. I had hives all over me. Hives were spreading all over my body: hair; arm with the injection; we called 9-1-1 I went to the hospital. They gave me some meds through IV. By that time, I had taken Bendryl and I was there about 4 hours with IV. I felt better but hives didn&#39;t subside. That Sunday afternoon they started getting worse again and I went back to the hospital  (16th)and they gave me rounds of something through IV.  On 17th, I went back to hospital - they gave me another shot for the hives. I worked on the 18th - but was they said I should go home because I didn&#39;t look well. My lip started swelling that night. On the 19th, I went to my doctor and the Dr, used an epi-pen on me and gave me a shot of something for the  welts still on my body. They still didn&#39;t go away.  Symptoms have calmed down - but I still have spots on me. I am on Prilosec and anti-itch - Atarax and some others.

                                                I felt great and had no left home the week prior to vaccine as I work from home and my husband was off. My son was home with us as well. None of us had a cold/virus. I went to the vaccine clinic, received first pfizer and 6 hours later the dizziness, nausea, severe headaches started. After 5 days I had to go to ER because I was still so sick. They did blood work and gave me fluids. Thursday, 9 days after vaccine, I went to PCP as I was still so sick. I could barely work part-time at work 4 hours a day due to severe dizziness and headaches. Today is Saturday, day 10 and I still have dizziness, nausea and severe headaches.

Quickly became short of breath, cough, nauseous and dizzy. I reported my symptoms to the RN in the observation room and took Benadryl. My HR was in the 130s at that time. I then used my EpiPen. They gave me 2 puffs of an albuterol inhaler and a 2nd EpiPen before taking me to the ER where IV allergic reaction protocol was initiated ( famotidine, iv fluids, solumedrol) and a 3rd EpiPen was given along with a duoneb and iv lorazepam. My symptoms improved after the 3rd EpiPen and seems to slowly resolve over the next 48 hours. &#34;  Per ED note Patient is a 37 y.o. female presenting to the ED with shortness of breath and throat tightness. Immediately after getting a COVID vaccine today, patient developed sudden onset of shortness of breath, voice hoarseness and throat tightness. She gave herself IM epinephrine, Benadryl, and albuterol puffs through the inhaler prior to arrival. She was in her normal state of health prior to today. Patient has hx of vocal cord dysfunction, mast cell activation syndrome, and anaphylaxis, and has required epinephrine drips in the past with ICU hospitalizations. Has also needed intubation in the past.  Initial evaluation reveals patient to be tachypneic, tachycardic and anxious. &#43;stridor and hoarse voice. Patient gave herself IM epinephrine prior to arrival along w Benadryl and albuterol puffs. Says her symptoms feel similar to what she has had before w anaphylaxis. Patient was given additional IV methyprednisolone, pepcid, Duonebs, and ativan. She was monitored and her work of breathing improved. No additional epinephrine was needed and patient was monitored in the ED for a few hours.&#34;

                                                1:45 driving home, started to notice weird feeling like I had an allergy shot. 2:30 I got home and breathing was aggravated. 2 puffs of inhaler, sat down and waited. Breathing worse, 2 more puffs. Breathing not improving enough, tongue started to feel weird. Went to ER. 3:45 went to ER. By 4:45 I was in a room, saw physician at 5:45. I had a heart rate in 140s in triage, and a low BP around 90/60. My tongue continued to feel funny and started to get hard to talk. It felt heavy, but medical staff didn&#39;t think swollen. I was given a breathing treatment, Benadryl, Pepcid, IV fluids and monitored. 8:15 I was asked to walk a bit to make sure oxygen was staying up. My chest tightness was getting worse but since my oxygen stayed at 95 when walking, was discharged. As of today, I still struggle to control my breathing and have an appointment with my allergist for tomorrow. I&#39;m scheduling albuterol treatments every 4 hours around the clock and continue to take Pepcid and Benadryl in addition to my normal meds. 3/20 I developed uterine cramping, felt like I was having back labor as the result. Uterine cramping resolved 3/21 but severe soreness in back remained.

                                                I have had persistent headaches since the vaccination date. I developed a headache (HA) within 30 minutes of receiving the dose, and for 14 days straight I was so fatigued and had a persistent HA, it was hard to go to work. Ever since then, I have headaches almost daily. About half of them turn into migraines and the other half are just general HAs, and I continue to feel somewhat more fatigues than I did prior to vaccination. I have not felt ?right? since vaccination. I don?t remember a day where I did not have a headache- even if I wake up feeling well the HA develops within a few hours. It cannot be attributed to medication overuse because I rarely take medications to treat them for fear of causing medication-overuse-headaches.  I am a healthcare provider.

                                                Following day - I had pain on my feet and during the day I had the pain from my bottom of feet to my head. Then around 2:00 I was having chills. And then around 6 pm, chills worsened and I had   a headache and a high fever - 103. Around 8 pm it was getting worse - the pain, the body aches, chills and headaches and I called my dr and she told me to take Ibuprofen and I took it at 8:40 and by 9:40 my chills were going away and my fever going down and by 10 pm  I just had a headache and had pain in my body - the pain in each was less and I was feeling very tired. The next day, I woke up fine. I woke up with body pain but it wasn&#39;t bad. I had a low fever but nothing else. And then by Wednesday, 3 days after, I started developing a rash. The rash was on my arm and on my belly and on both legs. I went to see my Primary Care Dr - as it  (the rash) was getting worse. She gave me Steroid cream. Two weeks after that it was getting much worse - I was not sleeping at night. It was itchy and it was too much. Went back to my doctor and she did a biopsy on my arm on February 24th. I went back to my Primary care doctor - she thought maybe it was a false positive and I did it again and it was positive again. I went to Endocrinologist - and she said that it is Hashimoto&#39;s Disease. No treatment yet. I will have follow up with her this month for her to check my thyroid levels again.  I still have the rash but it is less. I am getting rid of the rash, it&#39;s just a slow process.

I immediately went to a store and purchased fexofenadine. I took one and within an hour I did not feel the lump anymore. I had a similar reaction once, to allergy shots, and the fexofenadine stopped the reaction.

Waited my 15 minutes and went home, progressively got more and more tired and run down as the day went on, by 3pm I was nauseas. 4pm took a shower thinking it would help but after had to lay down.  5pm I was vomiting, extremely light headed, chills then burning up - this continued until 9pm when diarrhea started while vomiting/ dry heaving. This continues until 10:30pm. I could keep nothing down. Finally about 11pm - there was nothing left in me - I was able to lay down and rest. All night was hot/cold, very nauseas, extremely tired but could not sleep. Very sore left arm. All day Friday i sipped a little ginger ale - no mood or want to eat - VERY tired, sore and general terrible feeling,. Saturday and Sunday were very much the same and no on Monday I&#39;m feeling about 70%. I have NEVER been that sick in my life.  My 72 year old fully vaccinated parents, 40 year old husband and 3 year old  son had been around me for at least 24 hours prior to the vaccine and we had all eaten the same items and they were completely fine - no sickness at all.

I&#39;ve iced it and it helped but as of this morning its still there, not any bigger or redder but its still warm. I am riding out bc its the only side effect I&#39;ve had so far.

Woke up next day (Saturday at NOON, which is not like me after having very vivid dreams is someone in my past. Felt like I had been run over by a semi truck. Had body coaches and couldn?t stop sweating. Finally took Motrin around 2 or 3 pm. An hour later my temperature was 99.3 F. By 7pm I had to take more Motrin because my temperature was 99.3 again.  By 8 pm, I almost fell over walking to the kitchen to warm up soup.  Sunday, did not trust myself to drive to my mothers for breakfast. Freezing cold all day. No shiver just cold. Temperature was 97.3 all day. Monday and Tuesday, 4/5 and 4/6 I had a splitting migraine which felt like I had alternating pouring from a hammer or an axe. Tuesday woke up with what felt like my head was split open. Severe pain behind my eyes and the entire head. Stiffness in my neck, especially left side and down the left shoulder. Slight lingering headache on Wednesday 4/7

The body aches progressed to skin and joint pain similar to a terrible sunburn. I was unable to sleep more than 2 hours in a 36 hour period. The fever subsided after about 20 hours and the joint and skin pain subsided after 32 hours. Regularly administered Tylenol brought the fever down a bit but made no impact on the body/skin aches.

Symptoms improved and felt better Tues - had a dry needling session. 4/7/21 Wed afternoon all symptoms returned (except joint pain), in addition to low grade fever, heat/warmth in head/neck region &amp; some disorientation, decreased apprt. I have had moments of higher than normal BP (when headache, fever, pressure and pain and particularly worse). I visited my PCP on Thursday 4/8/21. They felt I was having a strong anti inflammatory response to the vaccine, but they ran two COVID tests to be safe d/t protocol (I had low grade fever and headache). My symptoms have continued to this day (Sunday 4/11/21) with minimal improvement. Under advisement of my PCP, I am resting and have taken 220mg Naproxen sodium (2xs) and 500 mg Acetaminophen (multiple times).

Woke up on Saturday feeling very bad body ache and low energy. Hard to even squeeze toothpaste and hold up electric toothbrush to brush teeth. Found it difficult to walk around and couldn&#39;t even stand the whole time while showering. By Saturday afternoon around 3 pm, started getting fever which went up to 102 degrees. Body hurt everywhere. Very uncomfortable. Took some naps though was never really tired mentally. Fever started subsiding by around 11pm Saturday night, so lasted about 8 hours total. Slept much better and woke up on Sunday almost back to 100%.

Nurse called for assistance and began talking with the patient.   Provider arrived and patient was pale, slumped in chair but conversive. Upon assisting patient to the floor she became unconscious and we laid her down. EMS was requested. Over the next few minutes had 3 episodes of LOC with brief ~5 seconds of breathing cessation and seizure like activity with significant head shaking sometimes involving upper torso followed by coughing and retching without actual vomiting. Due to this she was placed in left lateral recumbent position with the first episode. Each time she awoke she appeared confused but was able to answer questions. Oxygen was applied with pulse oximetry but unable to obtain BP during this time. After the third episode she suddenly asked what happened and mentation returned to normal.   Upon Fire/EMS arrival was conversing normally on the floor on her left side. Reported multiple food/environmental allergies and metformin allergy. History of suspected seizure but nothing proven.   Reported before her vaccine that last time she experienced a brief LOC hours ~12 hours after her first vaccine. She had arranged for someone to stay with her tonight in case she felt faint again.

                                                A wave of something came over me almost right away, where I just felt a little off - I was still able to drive home, and felt pretty much ok for the rest of that day.  By the next morning, I had horrible muscle aches, a headache, extreme fatigue, chest tightness, and a mental fog that at times had me slightly disoriented and almost dizzy.  These symptoms lasted that entire second day, even with the administration of Tylenol.  I started to feel somewhat better by night fall, but by the following day I was back to normal.

                                                Within one hour of the shot administration I became tachycardia, hypertensive, and with chills. Over the next 48 hours my symptoms worsened to include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and near syncope requiring an emergent visit to the ER.  My symptoms persisted and two weeks  later I required another visit to the ER and was admitted to the hospital overnight due to tachycardia, hypertension, diarrhea, chest pressure, headaches, fatigue, weakness, chills, and near syncope.  Since the onset of events post the Pfizer vaccine, I have required multiple visits with MDs/specialist for management of symptoms and course of treatment.  My local physician suspected postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) of which I seeked medical opinion and met with a world expert and after meeting with him, he concluded my symptoms were in fact in line with POTS.  Since then I have continued to experience flare-ups and episodes of tachycardia, most recently 4/14/2021.  It has now been over 3 months since the onset of symptoms post vaccine and I continue to require treatment and management of above symptoms.  I have not returned back to previous level of function nor have I been able to return to work.  I do not have any prior medical history of this condition or set of symptoms.

                                                Approximately 48 hours after injection, a 2-inch red, warm rash started on my left arm at the injection site. It was warm, slighly itchy, and very painful and swollen. It hurt enough that I couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side for several days. By the third day after injection, the rash had grown considerably, but the pain was less. Now 17 days later, I still have a dark pink and almost grey, oval shaped patch of skin on my arm that&#39;s approximately 2.25 inches wide and 1 inch high. It&#39;s no longer in pain, though the area is still slightly warm to the touch, and tender like a healing bruise. I also experienced two days of extreme fatigue three days after the injection. I had the injection on the afternoon on Thursday, April 1, and by Saturday, April 3 I had terrible headaches and felt complete wiped of energy. This lasted until mid-day Monday when I started to feel better. My husband, who also received the same Pfizer vaccine (same lot number and time/date of injection), did not get a rash, and only experienced the &#39;punched in the arm&#39; pain on the arm for a couple of days. He also reported some fatigue.

                                                Roughly 12hrs after receiving 2nd Pfizer Covid-19 dose I woke up with a stabbing headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, slight chills and bodyaches. As the day progressed I began to develop extreme bodyaches, extreme joint pain, I couldn?t regulate my body temperature which fluctuated between feeling very cold and very hot/feverish. My eyes were bloodshot from having a fever of 102.5 at it?s highest. I was in significant pain and unable to sleep and rest due to the severe bodyaches and joint pain in my hips, knees and wrists. I also had significant pain in my low back. I don?t have pain anywhere in my body generally. The dizziness and lightheadedness also continued to worsen to the degree that I couldn?t sit up or walk without losing balance. Around 11:30pm on Saturday 4/17, my fever broke and my aches and pains started to dissipate.  As the aforementioned symptoms began to dissipate, I started having difficulty breathing. I felt as though I was having trouble breathing, specifically inhaling. I felt like I couldn?t catch my breath at times, though I was sitting or lying down and not exerting myself. I also developed wheezing and a mild cough, both of which have continued to worsen. Today is Monday 4/19/21 and I?m still having mild lightheadedness and dizziness, mild headache that feels like stabbing pains and my cough continues to worse as is the wheezing and feeling like I?m having difficulty breathing at times, without exertion. Injection site continues to be sore. My first dose, I had fatigue and injection site soreness, both of which were completely resolved as of 24hrs after being vaccinated.

After throwing up was gasping for air for a few seconds. The shaking was uncontrollable. Took an advil and it calmed the chills and shaking. Very weak, and fuzzy in the head.  Phizer vaccine, was my second dose.

The last 8 hrs were progressively better. At 3:30 AM I had diarrhea but only once. No vomiting. The closest pain would be contractions as I could feel the cramps literally rolling into my stomach. It was a sharp hot pain. This is my second day home resting and easing into food. I?ve had half a bowl of oatmeal since Tuesday afternoon.

                                                Visible swelling over lower abdominal region for 1 week that started about 1 day after vaccine. Pain over ovaries/uterus lasting for 1 week starting 1 day after vaccine.  On 4/14 I began my first menstrual cycle after the vaccine. On 4/17 I experienced heavier than normal bleeding, bloating and cramping. With this was extreme abnormal mood swings, severe depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, insomnia lasting severely for 3 days. I called my psychologist, spoke to the nurse at my clinic and many others because it was too much to handle. I have never experienced this to this degree in my life. Since 4/19 the mood swings and mood changes have mellowed but are still present today along with low back pain, cramping, bleeding and extreme exhaustion. I have been bleeding for 12 days. I usually bleed for 6-8 days. I usually only experience PMS for 1-2 days.

Has not helped with the issue and I am still in great pain today (April 26th). It is so bad that I have fallen at work and home. It makes me very nervous now because I do not need to end up breaking something or getting hurt really badly because I did what was right and took this shot.

The next day on 07Jan2021 about 7:59 am (around 13 hours after receiving the vaccine), all of a sudden she was driving and her jaw was paralyzed, it&#39;s became hard, she couldn&#39;t move it and it was very painful. she never had that and she was driving with her two little kids and it freaked her out and she tried to park and she finally parked being it lasted for a couple of minutes. When she looked at the time again it was 8:03 am, it was gone. She needed to get her kids to safety because she was driving but then it went away. On 09Jan2021, she started to have all of a sudden this tension on her neck that felt like a neck injury, it was hard to move her neck to a certain side and started while she was working. It was progressing and she thought she hurt herself. The pain began to lead to a severe headache. The neck pain felt like an injury lasted for a couple of days, but headache persisted and was intense, it lasted for 2 weeks and her coworkers thought she had COVID. She worked on 09Jan2021 and 10Jan2021 and then called out after that. On 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 the pain was not just in her head but in the left eye, it was throbbing and severe pain deep inside. It lasted for a couple of days lasted for over a week, it was not as bad as the first couple of days, the pain was the most severe on the 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 and couldn&#39;t do anything and stayed in bed. It felt like it was nerve pain and she never had that before, it was definitely different. She took daily anti migraine medicine and as long as she took it she doesn&#39;t have migraine headaches. For her Sumatriptan 50 mg, she took it twice on 12Jan2021, but because of the side effects it makes her nauseous and she couldn&#39;t take it anymore, she just has the prescription. She was only allowed to have 10 a month. It is sumatriptan and it didn&#39;t work either and she was supposed to take it to reverse the headache and it didn&#39;t work. For the amitriptyline, its 10 mg and had to triple to 30 mg. She took it at nighttime, but one of the side effects is that it made her sleepy but she didn&#39;t sleep. She has a 3 month supply and had plenty, if she needed to adjust but that was her first time she was taking that much, her doctor said she could up her dose to 20 mg, her gave her permission before because it can be used at higher doses if needed, she did try the 20 mg but that did not work so she had to triple to 30 mg. Once she realized that was not helping she just said forget it. She had to triple the dose of her migraine medicine and she was taking 3000-4000 mg of paracetamol (TYLENOL) even that couldn&#39;t take it down and even did cold compresses. The headaches lasted for a couple of weeks and then she finally got COVID. The headache after that was different, not as intense, and even taking paracetamol a couple times per day was dealing with this headache, the fever the body aches. It is not like the headache she got from the vaccine. It lasted for another week with COVID and was different and managing the headache. So currently she was good. She stopped taking amitriptyline, she was taking it for 3 years and was switched to Vitamin B2 and magnesium in the last month and had no headaches. She had to switch after getting COVID because she felt more tired and sleepy and felt that the amitriptyline would make it worse so she had to find something else. She was good with the new medications. She was cleared to go back to work on 03Feb2021. She was pretty much good by 03Feb2021. She was told by her MD not to get a second dose but her employer stated she could be terminated if she was not fully vaccinated. She was concerned and scared of having this reaction again. Her arm pain hurt for a few hours but because she has other pain she thought it was her left arm but she really couldn&#39;t recall. she did have pain in her arm, it was normal pain nothing significant. It started at 11 pm on 06Jan2021 and lasted until Saturday 09Jan2021 and remembered that she had a hard time helping at work because she has to used the arm but the arm soreness was just like with any other vaccine, nothing abnormal. From 10Jan2021 to 13Jan2021 she kept feeling she like had something in her throat in the morning, and when she would start drinking she couldn&#39;t swallow like her body forgot how to do it. She would hold it in her mouth and then 30 seconds later she would start swallowing and then it went away. It was just in the morning for like 4 days. It cleared by 14Jan2021, clarifies it ended then. Caller stated her husband took a test on 11Jan2021 and didn&#39;t get his results until 14Jan2021 and showed he was positive and he was already isolating and she was at home with the kids. States her husband was the one that brought it in. She did start to have COVID symptoms until 23Jan2021, she had fever, chills, body ache, runny nose, shortness of breath and diarrhea. She was prescribed a z pack, azithromycin, and it helped with cough, the congestive cough and nasal spray for her runny nose. It was water coming out of her nose, most runny she has ever felt. She got testing and kept going for testing because she felt so sick and it was negative (on 13Jan2021 and 18Jan2021). She finally tested positive on 25Jan2021. No additional therapies for COVID-19. No other test performed, they see patients that keep testing positive 3 months later after no symptoms and just want to wait for symptoms to go down. The patient was not hospitalized, not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit.

                                                Within minutes of getting administered the shot, my entire body started to sweat, and I got very intense nausea and period cramps that was 8/10 on pain scale. I was moaning and crying and didn&#39;t know what to do. After they came to check on me about 15 minutes later, I asked if I could take Advil and they said I could so I did. I also told them I felt like I was going to throw up, so they gave me this bin, and I threw up twice.  I was supposed to get my period later that day or the next day, but it hadn&#39;t started yet and I felt completely fine when I first got there before I got the shot. But it was almost instantaneous after the shot that I had the sweating, nausea, and period cramps that made me feel like I couldn&#39;t walk or talk because I was in so much pain. I kept wanting to be crouched down and also to have my head down. The nurse kept asking me what I needed, and I didn&#39;t know, I just kept saying, &#34;I don&#39;t feel good, I don&#39;t feel good.&#34; I eventually asked to go to the bathroom because I thought that might help even though I didn&#39;t actually have to go. They took me to the bathroom where I kept moaning and crying and felt so awful. Only a couple times did the pain subside for about 5 seconds but then came right back. I think it was probably an hour of this when they called the paramedics to take me to the emergency room. But as soon as they arrived to the women&#39;s bathroom in the mall where we were, the pain finally subsided. They still wanted to take me to the ER, but I convinced them not to because I was feeling better and worried about the bill I would receive and dealing with all the insurance stuff. They eventually agreed to let me stay in my car 30 more minutes while being monitored. The nurses were all very nice and gave me juice and snacks to help the nausea, and then they scheduled my next appointment at the hospital and told me I should come with someone next time. When I got home I noticed my arm was sore, but I knew that was normal so wasn&#39;t too worried about it. However it&#39;s now been sore almost three weeks, and I can&#39;t move it certain directions, which is super frustrating because I&#39;ve been pursuing dance outside of my day job and hadn&#39;t gotten an injury from that all year, but now all of a sudden I can&#39;t move my arm a lot of ways and it&#39;s affected me being able to take class and do choreography, and also regular household things. I can&#39;t reach with my left arm to grab things, and I can&#39;t ever tense the muscle in my upper left arm / shoulder, and if it tenses by accident (i.e. I go to grab something that&#39;s falling or see a bug), pain shoots through. And now I have read about vaccines causing shoulder injuries, and I&#39;m feeling quite frustrated, which is what led me to find this vaccine report site, and is why I am probably going to cancel my second dose appointment.

                                                While receiving the vaccine I felt pain and burning.  That subsided after waiting the 15 minutes for monitoring.  When I arrived home my arm was sore, tight, and felt swollen.  I wasn&#39;t able to sleep on that side, I wasn&#39;t able to lift normal everyday items and I felt shooting pains as if I was getting injected again.  I treated myself with Aleeve and iced my arm (20 mins about 3x a day) for 3 days.  Symptoms still persisted.  At my second dose my experience was very different from the first however, the pain from the first one still remained.  I inquired if I should still feel this pain and I was told to expect soreness.  At the urge of my family and coworkers I went to my doctor on 5/4 and he informed me that I have shoulder bursitis due to the poor administration of the vaccine.  The person who gave it to me either went in the wrong spot, or went too deep.  I am being treated with Methylprednisolone tablets (4mg 21 tabs) currently.  My doctor said that if this doesn&#39;t work I would have to see an ortho and possibly need to get cortisone injections.  There is no way to tell if this will heal or if I will have to live with this for the rest of my life.  Poorly skilled administration of this vaccine so far has changed my life...and not for the better.

This was my third pregnancy. I became pregnant in March with positive tests on 4/19, 4/20, and 4/21. I had the Covid vaccine 4/21 and by 4/23 was suddenly in pain and bleeding, which continued for six days, after which my body began to recover. Additionally, I began to suffer breathing trouble, waking in the night, heart pounding (no nightmares or fears) and gasping. Was prescribed two inhalers to recover.

                                                The next day I started to feel strange and had a racing heart and some leg pain. Slowly over the course of four days (Friday to Monday) I continually felt &#34;off&#34; but differently than others explained post-vaccine (not necessarily flu like). This was an extremely high heart rate (up to 130&#43;) and palpitations, chect pains, and calf discomfort. Finally on Monday, March 1, I went to my primary doctor because I felt so off and I knew something was wrong.  My doctor sent me to the ER where they found a new DVT in my upper leg. This time it was deemed unprovoked, though it was right after the second vaccine.

                                                Currently 37 weeks pregnant, 2nd shot, will be induced June 3, due date June 11. Shot administered at 11:20am, I waited 15 minutes, no reaction. That night I took tylenol at 9pm for my headache (recommend and approved by pharmacist who administered my shot), then I took my prenatal vitamin. Around 9:30 I had trouble breathing. It lasted throughout the night. I had to sit up all night. I had to take off my necklace due to my neck swelling. I couldn&#39;t take any deep breaths. I was able to fall asleep around 5am when it subsided a bit. I have continued to be short of breath today, neck still looks a bit puffy. It&#39;s hard to know whether the more mild difficulty breathing is due to pregnancy or not. I haven&#39;t had trouble breathing with this pregnancy unless I am active. This morning I was sitting on the couch and it was hard to breathe (but more mild than last night). No other side effects, my headache is gone and went away after I took the tylenol that night.

I did not feel better after day 4 or 5. I did not see any improvement. I called into a tele-health visit because I was having problems with exhaustion. On day 6 I went to Urgent Care, even though I should not have driven myself there. The doctor told me that she has seen a range of adverse events. I asked for a week off of work because of the exhaustion. My brain fog started lifting 7 days after receiving dose 2 of Pfizer. I was at about 50% energy on day 8-9. I did not feel at 100% energy until day 14. I constantly felt overwhelmed. I feel like this was a very scary time that I experienced.

These effects were felt minimally at first, then more intensely after several days. During the past three months, she has gone up to 9-10 days without experiencing symptoms, but these eventually return, frequently more intensely than before, for periods of up to 10 days. She is able to function and complete tasks, but the impact of these side effects is overall debilitating, both physically and, increasingly, psychologically. She is increasingly concerned that these symptoms will never go away. In April she contacted Pfizer regarding her side effects, but was referred to her general practitioner.

Intense pain continued non-stop for 24 hours not allowing sleep. Never felt such intense pain for so prolonged a period. Was the worst experience. At 5:30 am on 5/28/21 began vomiting and could not hold down liquids or food for 7 hours after. Took Ibuprofen at 8am and was able to sleep for a small time. Continued to use as directed in order to rest until around 5pm that evening. At this time was finally able to eat and drink. Pain subsided after 24 hours of initial cramping. Constipation for the next 24 hours until 5/29/21. Stomach was still a bit upset days later. After a few days energy was back up, rest, food and water was as normal.

I  was assured by multiple doctors that this was &#34;normal&#34;. I  was rushed to ER with sever pain my left leg and chest pain on 3/24/21. I  was instructed this was all my anxiety and it was safe to receive the second dose.  The anxiety and severe brain fog did resolve within 2 weeks. I  stupidly received the second dose 4/7/21. I  was fine for 3 days until I  got severe ear pressure, severe vertigo, low blood pressure, high heart rate, GI symptoms, severe brain fog, anxiety, neurological issues and palpitations.  9 weeks later and I  am still not recovered form the inflammation and Pfizer admitted &#34;severe adverse reaction&#34;. I  reported this to V-Safe and heard nothing back.

                                                Around 12 hours after receiving the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine (around 1:00am), I began to get extremely tired (similar to the way one gets after taking a sedative). The next morning, I felt run down. I didn&#39;t want to get out of bed. Felt like a truck hit me. Very normal reactions so far. Foggy headed. Then got chills and a mild fever some time in the afternoon. Tongue *felt*(?) funny. Difficult to explain the sensation. Taste and tongue feel just felt different than usual. On Saturday (two days after the vaccine), I still felt run down, cold and foggy headed. Attempted to eat a cheese sandwich, but it hurt(!?). Felt like I really burnt my tongue on food, but did not. The rest of the symptoms were 90% gone by Sunday, the 3rd day after vaccine, but tongue still hurt. Noticed a few swollen taste buds on tongue on Monday (4th day after), and a sore on upper R gum area, near canine. It took roughly 5-6 days for tongue to return back to normal. &#34;Odd&#34; feeling remained for a few days more. I had been put off, for some reason, by wanting to drink coffee ever since day 1 after the vaccine. I drank it on Friday, but absolutely didn&#39;t want it on Saturday, or since. I have just been drinking tea. It is very strange for me, since I absolutely love(d) coffee and would normally drink several cups a day! Also, side random note: On Tuesday, the 5th day after the vaccine, I had a very random, very strong taste of rosemary while eating lunch (a tuna sandwich, prepared by myself). I didn&#39;t put rosemary in it. The taste subsided nearly as quickly as it came, which is odd considering if I were to have bitten into a rosemary leaf (that washow strong it tasted), the taste would have lingered for several more bites. It did not.

After the second shot the back pain flared up again so much so I could not go into work, had to get a professional massage to be able to even move. After 3 weeks from second shot, my lower back paid still plagues me and limits my ability to lift things over 5 pounds.

                                                Starting on the day of the vaccine, my arm felt sore (nothing abnormal).  I had a little bit of joint pain and felt tired.  The joint soreness slowly went away but the vaccine site (right arm) felt very sore and did not go away.  About a month afterwards, I started to notice weakness and could not lift anything heavy with my right arm.  About a month later, I went to my PCP and he recommended a nerve conduction test, which I was able to schedule for  April 2021.  I was sent for blood work and X-ray in March, which all came back normal.  In 5/2021 I also tore my ACL when getting up from the sofa and had a MRI to  confirm (6/2021).   Not sure if related but I still want to report.  I am are still recovering. I still am suffering from  right arm weakness.

                                                Mental decline. Short term memory is not as good as it used to be. It started after recovering from Covid. I had to bring it to my bosses attention because I could not retain anything. So steps were put into place to help me. Range of motion in my right arm, I couldn&#39;t lift anything for at least two months.  I get random shock pains randomly in my arm. I can now lift things better. Reaching over my shoulder was also difficult. It aggravated the brachial nerve. I got a migraine that started at 11 am that morning. It woke me up at 2am the next morning.  It stopped the next day. Loss of smell and taste. Nauseated. It was like french kissing a tailpipe. This all stopped like a light switch.

I took my temperature and it was 101 degrees I told my husband I was going to lay down. I felt really crappy similar to when I had the flu. It started off as body aches and when I started to get a headache I started to feel bad then the fever came. The following day my fever reached 102 degrees I woke up in a pool of sweat form having a fever the headache was worse I felt really bad and didn&#39;t want to move. By the third day the fever was gone I still had a slight headache and my arm was really sore, By the end of the week everything was back to normal.

                                                My first period since getting my second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was much heavier than usual. Normally during my period, I have one or two days of heavy bleeding, and one or two days of feeling more tired than usual. This time, I had two days of heavy bleeding. What was unusual was that the second day was extremely heavy, and I was extremely fatigued. I had to change my pads more frequently than usual, and saw multiple small blood clots in the toilet which is unusual for me. For about one and a half days I felt extremely fatigued and lightheaded, and for a short time nauseous, all of which is not normal for me. Also unusual was that I had a tight feeling in my calf muscles, similar to feeling swollen, but they looked normal. The fatigue was so bad that I had to call a sick day at work; something I never have to do because of my period. The fatigue lasted for several more days.

I was unable to fall asleep naturally and felt like I had way too much energy (the uncomfortable kind of energy). When trying to sleep, my brain would jolt me awake. I felt two pops on both sides of my forehead the second night after being vaccinated.  After 5 days of only 4 hours sleep per day, I was finally able to sleep more hours. I still have days where I am not sleeping well. My ears also felt full and still do, which I have not experienced in years. After the insomnia subsided, my tinnitus increased to extremities that I have never experienced in my entire life of having mild-tinnitus.  My tinnitus is loud keeping me awake and making it hard to sleep and triggering ongoing anxiety. The enhanced tinnitus began around May 30th and still going.  I have not had anxiety this bad in several years.  The vaccine has triggered this and it is debilitating.   I also feel &#34;cramps&#34; near where my heart is every now and then - which is also concerning.

A contactable 38-year-old female Nurse (patient)  reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021) at single dose since 22Dec2020.  Relevant history and concomitant drug was none. The patient excepted Covid 19 vaccine could decrease the chance of contacting Covid 19 virus, while she stated she was getting a red patchy hives and itchy waves of red rashes all over the body just after received the vaccine. The patient (nurse) stated, &#34;I would if I can explain a little more, the day after I received the Covid vaccine I had noticed a big like what I would explain it like a red hives, like a raised red rash on my left hip it last like a day its subsided and next morning I woke up and I had a different flares that was the same on my other side of my body again went away. After a day when I woke up and I had two new spot on my knee that was the other thing, those went away on that day. This morning I woke up and I had another one on my shoulder and on my lower back. I am also thinking I am getting one may be on my ear like I said they pop up and they itch a little and they go away. I never ever experienced anything like it and I see the only thing that I have changed in my life or regimen or added to my body so I just wanted to make sure it was reported. I am nervous and curious if it is a potential side effect added if I should be careful before getting second one all those things.&#34;  No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of events was unknown. When probed for the Causality, the nurse stated, &#34;I have no idea, if it is something going on with me that is completely unrelated its just occurred right after I got the vaccine so I have no idea if this is a separate issue or not. I going to see dermatologist and physician but until then I just thought to report it to you all to see if anybody is experiencing this and to know if it is safe to go for second dose.&#34;

                                                I felt weak and with muscle fatigue the day after the shot. Also had a headache and neck muscle tension and mid back muscle tension. Joint pains as well. These subsided after 48 hours except for the neck and upper back muscle fatigue and mild soreness. This gave me a low grade headaches almost daily since the vaccine. I took ibuprofen a few times which helped. On the 6th I awoke at night and felt weak all over. I felt like I was falling in my bed. Mild dizziness.  I went to work and felt extremely fatigued with muscle weakness but no neuro deficits. I feared some terrible autoimmune illness and took Decadron that day- 4mg tab BID. This helped my muscle weakness but left me with insomnia. The decadron is now wearing off after 4 days and I still have muscle weakness/fatigue. It takes considerable effort walking up the stairs. Yesterday my masseter muscles became fatigued with little chewing. My arms feel heavy when I lift them. The strange thing is that at night when I lie down I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is being triggered. I will get palpitations and feel just strange- I can&#39;t describe it.  I took valium to sleep last night -5 mg tablets that my doctor gave me Saturday as there seems to be an anxiety panic component going on. I have no history of diagnosed anxiety or panic attacks- I have never felt this way before. Today I feel a little better but still have considerable muscle fatigue and neck and upper back muscle soreness and overall muscle tightness in my arms and legs- feels good to stretch kind of feeling. I have mild dizziness when standing up and turning too abruptly. But no considerable focal neuro deficits.

                                                Began with shooting sharp pains in left foot gradually going up my left leg. At that point I took aleve and a trazadone in hopes of getting some rest. I fell asleep. I woke up around 0200 on 1/13/21 with extreme muscle and joint aches, a sensation of pins, needles, and tingling all over my body I felt very jittery and was actually shaking slightly throughout the ordeal. I felt like my nervous system was overloaded and my perception of pain was extremely heightened. At one point during this 4 hour period I had a visual hallucination. By 0600 I was feeling better- more relaxed. Muscle aches and sore joints are still present today. Also have a slight increase in temp 99.6 and injection site pain.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart began to race and I became very warm and sweaty. I was brought into another room for monitoring and my heart rate was above 100. After some breathing exercises, it came back down to the high 70s for a few minutes but then increased again into the 90s, at one point it was 113. My chest and throat then began to feel tight and I began sweating again. My face also felt funny on my right cheek. At that point I was first given 25 mg of benedryl then epinephrine. I was then taken to the emergency room via ambulance and was observed for approximately an hour. I was given an additional 25 mg of benedryl and discharged at 4:55pm. I was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and prescribed 25 mg of benedryl every 6 hours over the next 24 hours. The following morning, I experienced a hot flash with profuse sweating followed by chills. I was very tired and felt feverish throughout the day on 1/12 and stayed home from work. On 1/13 I still felt tired but was able to work. Today I feel mostly normal but still occasionally have had heart palpitations.

Took four doses of ibuprofen between 6pm on 1/13 through 6pm on 1/14.

All symptoms resolved upon waking at 6am on 1/15/21.

                                                When I got up at 0530 yesterday (1/19) my right arm was so sore I couldn&#39;t lift it. I got to work at 0700 and felt really drained and tired. I fell asleep without realizing it at some point and a coworker saw me and woke me up at 0930. I attended a lecture at 1000 and started feeling chills, aches, and was sweating. I tried to take notes but couldn&#39;t remember how to spell a lot of basic words and couldn&#39;t get my brain to focus.  My boss sent me home at 1145. I was driving home and when I got off the interstate I couldn&#39;t remember which way to turn at the light off the exit. I had to pull up a navigation app on my phone to remember how to get home.  When I got home I took my temperature and it was 98.5F. I slept for 3 hours, picked my kids up from school, and then slept for another 2 hours. I took my temperature at 1900 and it was 98.5F still. My chills and aches had lessened but not disappeared by the time I went to bed at 2100, but by the time my alarm went off at 0530 this morning I felt completely back to normal.

I felt it in my stomach, head, hands, all over.   I told the workers that I didnt feel well.  They moved me to the bathroom and propped me up over the sink sitting in a chair.  I felt very lightheaded at that point and somewhat responsive but was feeling very bad.  I looked at my iwatch and my heart rate was 198.  I felt lightheaded like I was going to pass out.  They had me move to the floor to prop my feet above my head.  They checked my blood pressure and it was normal.  I had them get my purse with my Xanax.  I took 1.5 tablets of .25mg Xanax.  My heart rate slowly went back to normal around 80BPM after about 15 minutes.  The rest of the day I felt very tired.  I felt normal again at 8pm with bo further side effects.

                                                The day following the 2nd vaccination dose, I had zero symptoms other than a slightly sore injection site.  Around hour 30 following the vaccination I began to feel warm, and I got up to brush my teeth and cool off in the bathroom.  As I was brushing my teeth, I started experiencing an increasing ringing noise in both my ears that I thought was strange and somewhat alarming, but I didn&#39;t feel any signs of dizziness or dysphoria.  The next thing I remember is waking up the bathroom floor with my husband standing over me.  Apparently I experienced a complete lose of consciousness and feel to the floor, hitting my chin on the bathroom vanity as I feel and splitting my chin open, which I have zero recollection of.  My husband states that when he found me, that my eyes were open, but I was staring blankly at him with a glazed over look and my whole body was limp and diaphoretic.  I came too in about 30 seconds after he found me, but I was very confused, not making a lot of sense, and felt very disoriented and weak.  It took about 20 mins for my fever to break, and to have the strength and power to get up and walk to bed.  We changed all my clothes because I had soaked through them, and he got me into bed after cleaning/bandaging up my chin.  I then slept solidly until noon the next day, which is very unlike me, but since then I have felt relatively fine with no other experiences of fever/chills/disorientation, just some continued mild fatigue off and on.  After discussing with my nursing colleagues, they all had similar experiences around hour 24-30 post 2nd vaccine with fevers, chills, restless sleep, or just general malaise, but no one experienced a complete loose of consciousness, so I reached out to my PCP yesterday, and she confirmed today that I should report this to VAERS.  I have never experienced any form of loss of consciousness/fainting/black-out/syncope prior to this, which is another reason I thought it was important for me to report this.

I slept fairly well on Thursday evening. When I woke up on Friday morning, I had a pounding headache and my body ached. I was still sluggish and tired. Later that morning I also felt very nauseous. Pain relievers did not seem to help relieve any of my symptoms. I also had chills throughout the day. My arm and armpit hurt very bad throughout the day as well. Friday evening I did not sleep well. I was sweating and my body ached all over. Nothing seemed to provide relief. When I woke up on Saturday morning, I still had chills, body aches and a headache.  Pain relievers did seem to help. By about 2pm I started feeling better and like myself again.   Today is Monday and I do still have a sore arm and armpit. My armpit is swollen.

I woke up with barely any strength. I slept from 8am-1:30pm Thursday. I had body aches, an upset stomach, muscle aches, and overall felt yucky. Friday I went to work for a presentation and was feeling awful. I had a fever and took some ibuprofen. My injection site was swollen and warm to the touch. I was dripping sweat last night Friday night. My lymph nodes are still swollen under my arm where I got the vaccine and my neck.

At 1:00am the next morning I started having chills and shaking which continued until 4am when I started having back cramps and arm cramps where I had my shot. I also felt feverish and had a very bad headache, so I took 600mg  of ibuprofen. I went in to work that morning and had chills and my skin hurt when my clothes touched my skin. I continued to have a headache also. I was sent home by my boss at 12pm on 1/5/21 because I looked and felt so bad and slept through the afternoon and for 10 hours that night. The next day, I continued to take 6oomg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and still had a lot of fatigue. The day after I was tired but them remained symptom free.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID). On 11Jan2021, within about 10 minutes of getting the vaccine she reported that her heart began to race and she became sweaty and uncomfortable. After another 5 minutes or so she began to have difficulty breathing as her chest and throat felt very tight and restricted. She also became lightheaded. Her heart rate was over 100, then dropped into the 70s, then shot back up over 100. Her face had a weird sensation as well. She was given Benadryl first and then epinephrine and had to go to the emergency room via ambulance for observation. She was released after an hour and had to take Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 24 hrs and diagnosed with an allergic reaction. On 12Jan2021,  she had a hot flash upon waking up and felt generally under the weather all day. Her arm was very sore at the injection site. She missed a day of work due to the whole ordeal. On 13Jan2021, she felt more normal but still have some tightness in her chest with a fluttering feeling. The outcome of event diagnosed with an allergic reaction was not recovered; for other events was recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known product safety profile, causality between event allergic reaction to vaccine and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

A 38-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 14Jan2021 15:30 to 14Jan2021 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing pernicious anaemia, a B12 deficiency diagnosed 2-3 years ago (she gave herself B12 shots and she cannot convert B12 through her food), and myomectomy (15 cm uterine fibroid, removed this past summer). Concomitant medication included ongoing cyanocobalamin (B12) for pernicious anemia. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 28Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and a flu shot (the MA gave it in the back of her arm, it was pretty significant). The patient was a nurse and informed that she received the second COVID vaccine the day before report (14Jan2021). She woke up on the day of report on 15Jan2021 03:00 with a nasty headache, she felt hot, had the creepy crawly shivers, was achy and when she talked, she felt like she had to close her eyes because of pressure, and she was nauseous. She figured this was probably normal but she couldn&#39;t get a hold of her doctor and the hospital she worked at did not know what to tell her. She was wondering if she can take Tylenol or ibuprofen and has even thought about drinking caffeine, that it might help her headache. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor as she got it at work. The first round of the vaccine she only had a super mild sore arm and a slight headache. She received the second vaccine at 3:30pm and then went to bed when she got home. She woke herself up at 3 am because her arm was hurting really bad. She started feeling like she couldn&#39;t keep her legs still. She felt hot, achy, and was shivering. She hasn&#39;t taken her temperature. When she woke up at 3 am she got on her phone, and her eyesight felt like she couldn&#39;t quite focus. It wasn&#39;t bad, but she felt like she was straining. Then her head started hurting at 5-7 am. She was very sensitive to light. She woke up and couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She had cold sweats, and was shivering. Every time she stood up, she was chattering. She felt achy almost like growing pains. She woke up with the arm pain, and then 10-15 minutes later, she started feeling that creepy crawly feeling. She got up and the cool fan hit her, and she realized how bad she was shivering. The shivering intensified at times but hasn&#39;t gotten worse. She had just called employee health and realized that when her eyes were open when she was talking was when she felt nauseated. She has noticed the nausea in the past half hour. She did not know if it was related to the headache or what. She had to cover her eyes, her eyeballs felt sore. When she talked with her eyes open, she felt a little queasy. She was just straining to see. Her vision was not blurry but she can tell she was straining. She did not know if it was because of the headache and nausea. When she got out of bed, the cold fan did not feel cold but it made her shiver. She was a nurse was trying to be socially responsible as she did not want to get COVID. She was a little suspicious because of the headache after the first one. She hasn&#39;t been around anyone in a couple of weeks and had been working from home. She has not been exposed to people. She kept feeling like she needed to stretch because she was sore. The patient was tested for COVID pre-surgery (myomectomy) and was negative. She was also tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any. She was vaccinated at a hospital facility. Patient received no other vaccines on that day. The adverse events did not require any visit to the emergency room or physician office. Patient did not receive prior vaccines in the previous 4 weeks. Outcome of the events cold sweat and &#34;tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any&#34; was unknown, nasty headache was reported as worsened (not recovered), and the remaining events was not recovered. The reporter considered the events serious due to medically significant events and related to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine in the development of the events cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 10 mins after receiving the first dose of Pfizer vaccine - I experienced chest pounding tachycardia. They had me lay on the gurney and checked my pulse ox. My heart rate was 147 but my Sp02 100%.  After about 30 mins or so it naturally came down with no medical interventions.  Otherwise for the first dose my only other reaction was expected fatigue, injection site soreness and mild headache.   Of note - I did go ahead and get my second COVID19 vaccine after consulting with medical professionals on 1/24 and did not experience any chest pounding tachycardia. Maybe mild tachycardia but I was also nervous due to the previous first inject reaction.

                                                With the second dose my symptoms started late evening on 01/13/2021. I started feeling bad, but finished my shift. Felt drained, headache to start. By next morning (01/14) I had fever (101.5F) and the whose body aches, nausea, diarrhea, horrible horrible headache, like a migraine, severe congestion, runny nose and some days later I started having an earache on my right ear. I would like to mention I also had a vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor that started with the first dose and had not resolved by the time I received the second dose and this time the odor is much stronger, it is awful, I already made an appt with my GYN. The odor got much stronger about a week after the second dose. I kept self medicating at home with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, but the fever would return as soon as the dose was weaning off. The 101.5F fever lasted for about 9 days.  I also experienced shortness of breath from 01/14 until the 22nd and I never had to use my rescue inhaler before. I had to use it and had to even call for a second one. I am very athletic and active and never need it even after my runs and workout activities. I consulted with my PCP on the 19th and again she gave me a covid test. Negative. She diagnosed me with inner ear infection (right ear). Prescribed me Levaquin and in 2 days I was much better. On the 22nd I finally started seeing the symptoms subside and started feeling better.  Also, I wanted to tell that I had a gas pain episode that almost sent me to the ER. My chest, my left shoulder hurt really really bad. I called a friend who is a physician and he told me to take some gasex first and if that did not work to go to the ER. Fortunately it worked. But the pain was excruciating.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I started to have a very mild headache. It felt like a pressure headache. I took Motrin. About 6 hours later that was gone. That night, about 8 hours after vaccine, I began to have muscle aches - whole body. I was very sore. I went to bed. Next day, I had severe joint and muscle aches and pains. The Motrin did not help that. Ice did not help, heat did not help and rest did not help. No headache. I wasn&#39;t red in face etc. Over the next week, I the muscle aches and joint aches were varying between moderate to severe. Some days it did restrict my activity completely. It started to get better week two - but still moderate to severe. I had some abdominal pain on upper left side and my right side (upper, as well) The upper right side pain would go away with ice but the upper left side wasn&#39;t helped with that. The only thing in those two weeks that helped was Celebrex (Motrin stopped helping). After two weeks - around 2/5/2021, I saw my Dr - a virtual visit. He told me to double up on the dose of Celebrex to help with muscle aches, joint aches and right side abdominal pain. Heart palpitations - irregular heartbeat. On 2/7/2021, I took a test for COVID and it was negative.  The joint and muscle aches were moderate to mild the third week. There was no more abdominal pain in third week. Week 4 - mild joint and muscle aches - only a few days that week and that was it. Last week was the first week where I had a few days that were fine. And this week, I have been completely fine. Had general malaise for three weeks solid. And now it&#39;s gone.

Within 10 minutes of the vaccine she became ill dizziness nausea throwing up vertigo and it persisted for about a week heavily. The nurses were unequipped to handle possible side effects from the vaccine putting her in a corner and having her vomit in a box. They ignored her when suffering from obvious effect from the vaccine.  One nurse on our way out even told her to put on her mask as I dragged her out of terrible situation.She was unable to work drive or function somewhat normally for 4-5 days then it began to diminish. She is still having instances of vertigo and dizziness however much less.

She had aching in her left arm, as well as shooting pains through her arm and into palm.

                                                Employee received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on January 18th at about 2pm.  By 6 pm, she noticed that she had bilateral swelling of lymph nodes in neck by the clavicle bone (more prominent on right hand side - same side as injection).  She also experienced difficulty swallowing and went to the ER at 9pm.  At the ER she received solumedrol IV, Pepcid IV and was discharged with hydroxyzine, Pepcid, solumedrol dosepak, zofran and epi-pen. At this time she was diagnosed with angioedema.  Swelling persisted and she contacted an allergist who prescribed additional antihistamines.  The allergist advised to her take Zyrtec or Claritin in addition to hydroxyzine day and night. The swelling continued to persist and two weeks later after returning to work for one day, she experienced feeling hot and flushed on right side, increased swelling and difficulty swallowing again and returned to ER on 1/25/21 and was treated with solumedrol and hydroxyzine and was discharged with solumedrol dosepak in addition to continuing antihistamines.  Upon returning to allergist, she was advised to take 4 zyrtec, 4 Claritin, Pepcid 40mg bid and hydroxyzine 10mg at bedtime.  PCP referred her to oncologist. After CT, oncologist diagnosed condition as bilateral lymphadenopathy and to return in 3 months for follow up.  PMH significant for ALL as a child (8 yrs), went into remission at 13yrs. PMH also includes DM2.

                                                I got my first Vaccination of the Pfizer shot on Wednesday, with no immediate symptoms. Gradually muscle soreness and fatigue kicked in, but nothing concerning. The next day, my stomach had a burning and unsettling feeling. I tried a couple of Tums, thinking I was having some pregnancy issues, but that didn&#39;t help. I was having waves of nausea. I didn&#39;t have much appetite, and could only manage to eat some potato soup for dinner. I was feeling very weak, lethargic, and needed to lay down the majority of the evening.  I finally had some uncontrollable vomiting by around 9pm, followed by the chills. I slept all night, struggled the next day at work, and left early to sleep the rest of the day since I was just too weak and lethargic to do anything. I consider myself to be very healthy, I exercise every morning, and the pregnancy has been normal. I am in the early 3rd trimester, and my due date is June 14 - this is my second pregnancy. I am an onsite teacher, thus I have built up a strong immune system and never get sick, so this caught me by surprise. I am feeling much better today, and I will absolutely get the second Pfizer shot later this month. I will try to better prepare myself as I hear the symptoms may be worse on the second shot. My sister, a pharmacist, insisted that I should share this information, in case it is helpful for data.

                                                Pt received her vaccination around 11.58am and advised to stay for observation by RPh for 30minutes due to history of her throat closing up due to Aleve allergy years ago. Patient started reporting fast heartbeat about 10minutes after and we concluded that it might be because she was anxious and continued to observe pt. However, she started feeling foggy, tongue felt numb, and throat started to hurt as well. Pt was not able to clarify whether her throat was closing up. Due RPh professional  judgement, she gave pt EpiPen 0.3mg injection on Left thigh considering pt history and called paramedics. Pt was seen by paramedics at the pharmacy and brought to ER/urgent care for treatment. Called patient several hours after, and she is currently fine at home.

By the time I went to bed it was feeling strange up to my  right elbow.  I woke up (3/12/21 about 6a) with both hands (mostly all my fingers) looking very white (like Raynaud phenomenon).  My right hand to elbow still feels strange and seems most affected (shot was administered on Left deltoid).  My right hand almost feels like I have a glove on (wetsuit material).. I&#39;ve been trying to keep circulation to them by taking hot showers and rubbing them.  They now seem more reddish and almost like chilblains might occur.   They feel tingling.   I have previously had chilblains in my feet when they were cold, but I&#39;ve been good at managing and don&#39;t get that anymore.  Never had it in my hands previously..

I let the staff know and they hoked me up to blood pressure monitor and monitored heart rate. My pulse was high at about 103bpm. My blood pressure got as high as 155/84, I believe. I was feeling very uneasy and not like myself. Luckily about twenty minutes later, these symptoms went away. I did not check these two things again, but I felt better. My arm was sore, but I know that was to be expected. I also felt like I could taste a medicine taste for about 24 hours.

                                                I started feeling groggy after the shot, which seemed normal. By Sunday afternoon, i felt foggy and off like i was in a brain fog. And, Monday, I started feeling vertigo and like I was rocking with a headache. By Wednesday, i was worried because it was impacting my day to day so i went to urgent care. They told me to go to the emergency room, which i did on  Thursday. They did a cat scan, which was clear, tested me for COVID ( negative) and ran bloodwork. I am planning to go to the ENT doctor on Monday, but still feel off and am concerned about getting the second shot next week. My second dose is scheduled for Thursday, March 25th. I have never had vertigo before and I just feel off all day and it started after my vaccine.

By 3 PM the next day I felt fine. I tried to stay as hydrated as possible and used cold compresses while my heart was racing.

                                                (note: I had no reaction to the first dose)  13 hours after receiving my second dose I had been in bed for a couple of hours unable to get comfortable because I felt weird. That?s when my ankles and feet began to itch. I checked for mosquito bites, none were there but I noticed that my ankles and feet were swollen. I applied a lotion recommended eczema  thinking my skin might be dry. Over the next hour the itching got worse and spread up my calves. That?s when I noticed that my tongue felt weird and kinda poofy. I?m used to occasional dry mouth due to my meds, but this was nothing like that. It freaked me out so I got up took Allegra hoping that on top of the Zyrtec I?d taken hours before would help. Since I was restless and desperately needed sleep  I took 1/2 of a 15mg trazadone tablet. That did the trip. No itching and I was able to sleep. Now I?ve been in bed all day with flu-like symptoms, I?m miserable and I?ve missed work. Unless I awake tomorrow morning feeling magically better I?ll miss work again.  The itching and swollen tongue  really freaked me out, hence my report today.

Joints, muscles etc. The next 3-4 days I could barely get out of bed. Moving was agony. I treated with Advil as I was told to. It waned a bit over the weeks, but after my second shot 3 weeks later, it reared its head back up and I&#39;m in a constant 8/10 on my pain scale Everything hurts. Blood work normal, doctor just shrugs.

My vision went weird for a few minutes and I felt light headed and as if my whole body was vibrating/buzzing a bit.  It&#39;s hard to describe, but I knew something wasn&#39;t right.  I spoke with a nurse on site who suspected I had a vasovagal reaction to the vaccine.  I had to wait 40 minutes before I felt okay enough to leave the site.  I continued to feel off for the rest of the night, along with extreme fatigue and soreness in my arm, neck and back.  The day after the vaccine I still had extreme fatigue, muscle soreness, was nauseous, with hot flashes and chills throughout the day.  Currently on day 2 past the vaccine and still have fatigue and muscle soreness.  The other symptoms seem to have improved some.  I have not been able to sleep much that last 2 nights either.

                                                I passed out about 10 min after receiving the vaccine.  The nurses said my BP dropped and kept me an hour after receiving the vaccine.  Within 3 hours of receiving the vaccine I felt nauseous and had arm pain around the injection site.  Two days after the injection the arm pain was gone but the nausea remained and I began having severe stomach cramps w/gas and feeling light headed.  The nausea, body aches, stomach cramps and gas remain on day 9 and the night of day 9 I woke up shivering and drenched in sweet while having a nightmare.  It is day 10 and I have nausea, stomach cramps, fatigue and mild body aches.

                                                Around 1:35pm I noticed my nose starting to itch. I didn?t think anything of it and continued to drive. Around 1:38 I started feeling very hot and numb in my face, ears, and toes. I felt that my heart was beating very rapidly and I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach, and felt I might pass out.  I pulled over and contacted 911 for fear of my reaction progressing. Around 1:45pm I started to feel better. By the time the ambulance arrived, I felt a little fuzzy but better. They checked breathing and vitals, all of which were normal. By the end of the day my symptoms had self resolved.

Less than 24 h after second vaccination, began to experience mild chills and mild lightheadedness. Within 30 minutes of symptoms onset, I had a near syncope with transient hypotension with blood pressure measured 70/40. I required  some assistance from coworkers before my husband was able to pick me up. Once home, symptoms evolved to fever over 100*F, chills, mild nausea, mild headache, and moderate to severe back, hip, and leg pain. Myalgias and joint pain particularly back pain 24-36 h after vaccination was debilitating and prevented sleep overnight. Symptoms as described in the context of acetaminophen use, 500-650 mg every 4-6h.

                                                On December 21st I got my first Pfizer Injection.  Had minimal side effects, that included a weird headache (I have migraines and this was unlike any migraine I ever had), it was like a halo above my ears and around the crown of my head.  I also had a sore arm.  No other issues.  On January 11th I got my second dose.  Again sore arm, nothing terrible.  This time I was prepared and over hydrated to prevent the headaches.  On day 2 after my shot I noticed both my shoulders starting to hurt and complained to my best friend I felt like a bus ran me over.  I said maybe it?s the shot but we shuffled it off to I slept funny.  2 weeks went by, same thing still going on; except some days my shoulders hurt so bad I couldn?t take my clothes off.  About 4 weeks post injection my knees also started to hurt.  I visit my chiropractor every 2-3 weeks regularly since having my daughter 12 years ago because my pelvis rotates out of place; her and I discussed what was going on and she said she had a couple other patients complain of similar things and it typically gets better after 6 weeks.  So I give it a few more days, decide to message my family care doctor just to let her know what?s going on.  She checks me for Rheumatoid Arthritis- that?s negative.  Checked my CRP-  which were elevated to basically say I was having an inflammatory response.  (I knew all these things already lol you don?t just wake up at 38 with RA with no family history but whatever).  Another week went by and I am at work and can?t stand up to walk- like crying in pain my knees and arms hurt so bad.  One of the anesthesiologist gives me a Decadron injection.  An hour later it was like magic, I actually had relief.  Unfortunately less than 48 hrs later the pain came back.  I went to my family doctor and had a conversation about all of this.  They put me on a tapering dose of Prednisone for 10 days- because unfortunately the max dose for Decadron is 6 days we decided to do Prednisone so I could have more days.  I started with 100 mg a day of Prednisone and tapered it down for 10 days.  I finally felt back to normal and it was amazing!!  Then 5 days after the last dose of Prednisone the pain came back yet again in my knees.  It hasn?t come back as bad in my shoulders but it?s definitely worse in my knees.  My family doctors recommendation is for me to see a rheumatologist; which I am waiting on an appointment for now.

                                                I woke up the day after the vaccine with nausea, chills, loss of appetite, and severe panic attacks (I don?t typically have panic attacks). The anxiety has subsided slightly, but I am still severely nauseated every morning and weak/lightheaded throughout the day.  I vomit most mornings. I have been to urgent care, called 911 and gone to the ER, and seen my GP twice. No one knows how to help me.

Within in hour felt one single hive on neck. Still felt like not significant.  Over next day and a half, I experienced symptoms similar to when I have had suspected cross-contact with shellfish allergens at restaurants:  Shortness of breath Lightheadedness/dizzyness Chest pressure Stomach pain (very brief instance) Sense of disconnect from body (low blood pressure?) General sense of something being wrong, like my body was struggling against something Tight throat feeling came and went, switching from right to left side A few more hives appeared on my wrist the day after the shot Fatigue Cough that appeared at end of day 2/day 3  I monitored myself and took allergy medication (Zyrtec, Zantac, Claritin, Benadryl). I did not administer Epipen, but my husband was available and was ready to do so if needed.

                                                The night after the vaccination, I woke up with extreme anxiety.  I had a week of panic attacks (I am not at all prone to panic attacks - very usual for me), high blood pressure, and a pounding heartbeat with a high heart rate.  On April 7th (two days post vaccine), I developed a vibrating &#34;pins and needles&#34; sensation in my feet and legs, and some transient pins and needles and numbness in my hands and face.  On April 12, I developed a terrible headache in the  back of my head (base of my skull).  There is a squeezing sensation in the back of my head that comes and goes.  I contacted my doctor, and was advised to take antihistamines and advil to try and reduce inflammation. I saw my doctor in person on April 14th, and was given a prescription for Meloxicam, and gabapentin to help calm the nerves.  On April 15th, I visited the ER because the headache had not resolved, even with Meloxicam.  They preformed a Head CT which came back normal, and gave me a shot of Torodol and  antihistamines.  Today, (April 16th), I am finally starting to feel some better, but I still have a mild headache at the base of my skull and some lingering pins and needles sensation.

On the 16th I was very depressed, spacey, and restless.  I was also nauseous that day but it subsided.  I was depressed and agitated all weekend and was unable to get out of bed to work on 4/19 due to depression and anxiety.  As of 4/20, I am still feeling the lingering anxiety and depression but it seems to be passing.  I am seriously thinking about not getting the 2nd shot.  This has been a terrible mood and I do not want to feel it again.

Had to wait 30 minutes due to prior reaction to MMR in December of 2020. At 20-25 minutes post injection patient started itching with arms and chest becoming red. Nurse and NP observing came over to patient and assessed. They administered Benadryl 25mg due to itching and redness. Advised patient to go home and also take Pepcid to help the Benadryl. Patient drove home immediately and by 12:00pm after looking in mirror lips and lower arms minimally swollen. Patient took another 25mg of Benadryl. No change, skin continues to break out and itch. Right lower forearm begins to swell more. Patient takes a third Benadryl 25mg along with a Prednisone 20mg PO.  After the 75mf of Benadryl total and Prednisone 20mg the reaction gradually subsides, but does not go away 100%. It is manageable at this time.  *Overnight the patient develops dizziness and headache.  *By morning (07:00am on 04/16/2021) the patient is itching minimally, dizzy, has headache, nauseated, and now is experiencing vertigo with what feels like equilibrium imbalance. Patient stays home from work and rests all day. No fever, no SOB, and no other signs at this time.  *Patient continues to show the above signs through Monday, April 19, 2021 with now on Tuesday April 20, 2021 additional signs of night sweats, muscle cramps, and soreness in her legs.

I managed to roll over and get some restless sleep until about after noon. I tried to read or watch tv, but had no focus and felt pretty miserable. Around 3pm, I had a late lunch and took Advil (2x200mg capsule). The Advil knocked the chills and fever back for 6 hours. I took a 30 minute walk and chatted with friends. Around 9pm, I could feel the chills and fever start to come back, so I took 2  additional Advil and when I got up the next morning, I was better except a bit of fatigue.

                                                For 2 weeks following the second dose of Pfizer I experienced severe adverse reactions: dizziness, vertigo, headaches, Paresthesia (tingling and numbness in hands, feet, arms, and legs),  nausea, slow digestion, loss of appetite, extreme fatigue (I could not perform any kind of daily activity for several days). I have been admitted to the ER twice over the 2 weeks. After undergoing multiple exams (ultrasound, detailed blood tests, MRI, CT scan), nothing major was found. My doctor prescribed antisthamine for dizziness and nausea. The symptoms have subsided since then.

                                                Sever pain in my left arm, it?s so bad that I can barely move my arm. It brings me to tears easing my arm from my side more than a few inches. I have a pretty high pain tolerance and this is unbearable. I am unable to dress myself, I have been unable to leave my apartment because I can?t use both my arms which is needed to operate the old elevator in my building, and working at my computer has been very difficult. I can rest my hand on the keyboard to type but the consistent pain leaves my mind focused on my arm and not the work I need to get done.   I think the injection was given way to high on my arm, it is less that 1/2 inch away from the edge of the tip of my shoulder. Higher than any other shot I have ever received.   It has only been 27 hours since the pain started but it has not gotten better.

After that was fine until day 10, woke up feeling short of breath and over all not well.  On day 16, began a racing heart. This has continued to current day. 3 ekgs normal, blood work done 4 times all normal, CBC, thyroid, metabolic panel, heart, etc. 3 chest X-rays normal, echocardiogram normal. But still short of breath and occasional racing heart that often wakes me from a deep sleep.

My friend came over that?s a nurse and talked to me we didn?t think it was a stroke or if it was it was a mini one because I could start to tak and came back to normal with in a couple of hours. By wednesday the symptoms started again. I went to the Emergency Room. They determined that it has to be neurological and I am following up with my primary care. I have an MRI scheduled May 3rd

                                                Slight numbness in face beginning approximately two hours after injection.  Approximately three hours after injection, felt disoriented and had difficulty breathing while seated in the passenger seat of car; immediately diverted toward nearest hospital.  Five to ten minutes later, experienced an extremely elevated heart rate and a burning sensation in chest with continued difficulty breathing.  Heart rate began to decline and breathing began to normalize when approaching the emergency room, so did not seek treatment.  Waited for an hour outside emergency room before departing without treatment with no further symptoms other than fatigue and discomfort resulting from the episode.    I had a similar but milder and more immediate (~15-20 minutes after injection) reaction to a quadrivalent influenza vaccine in October 2020; other than that, I have never experienced an adverse reaction to a vaccine.

It induced a panic attack because my husband was gone on a work trip and I was alone with kids some of the symptoms subsided a bit the next day but the vertigo and more elevated heart rate lasted 5 days. After acupuncture on day 3 to try and release muscle tension, and chiropractic treatment, by day 7 I felt almost 100%. I&#39;m a physically active person who works out about 30-40 minutes a day 5 days a week with two young kids at home. This sent me spinning and left me unable to complete normal functions well (driving a car, getting groceries, picking up kids from school) for 5 days.

When I woke up the next day on April 19 my day started with horrible joint aches. I couldn&#39;t even grab my coffee cup without pain. As the day progressed I had fever and chills for less than 12 hours, but the joint pain lingered. When I woke up April 20 I still had joint pain especially in my right arm. This pain in the right elbow has continued since and increasing in pain and discomfort. It&#39;s a burden on my daily activity especially since my right arm is my dominate arm/hand.

The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received for all events. The outcome of all events was not resolved. All events are serious with disability.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between felt very ill (flu like symptoms), severe fatigue and weakness in her legs, have intensified to the point of not being able to walk, or put her feet to the ground and BNT162B2 vaccination cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association. The Company considers the reported events Blood Sugars have ranged from 40-440, Neuropathy in her feet/legs, memory loss and confusion, stomach had become paralyzed (Gastroparesis) are unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccination, but more likely due to underlying or inter-current medical conditions.

The only change in my routine was the vaccine, and between dose 1 and 2 I had a total of 7 panic attacks; since dose 2 I have had 3 panic attacks, for a total of 10 panic attacks. All attacks last for approximately 1 minute and occur at varying times of the day and night.

                                                At 6 hrs post vaccination I became lethargic. I laid down and my heart was racing. I fell asleep for a few minutes and when my daughter came walking across the wood floors after having left for a few minutes I had auditory issues in which it sounded like she was storming in large boots at a fast speed across the wood floor (pounding in my ears). I became panicked and was afraid of her until I realized who she was. I fell back asleep and had delirious &#34;fever dreams&#34;. After 30 min nap, I felt ok. The next day I had vertigo and didn&#39;t feel safe to drive so I worked from home on Fri 4/30/21. Every time I moved my head, everything had a &#34;tail&#34;. This lasted until the next day, Sat 5/1/21.  I was increasingly becoming confused and scatterbrained (losing things, not being able to &#34;collect my thoughts&#34;. On Sunday, 5/2/21,  I was able to play pickleball with family but at the end, felt vertigo again. On Monday, 5/3/21 the vertigo was gone but I continued to feel confused and had a phone conversation with a client in which I involuntarily yelled &#34;UM!&#34; 6 times and was unable to control it.  I continued to work during this time period and those around me felt I appeared more scatterbrained but inside I was increasingly concerned. I also forgot to pick up my 14 year old daughter as arranged.  On Thurs 5/6/21 I had a pre arranged doctor appt in which I was clear headed enough to tell her I had been confused continuously since the last vaccination. Beyond this appt, I continued to have distortion of time in which I would think 10 min passed but an hour or more had passed. Additionally, the following 2-3 weeks involved me undoing the damage I had done to my work files. I had dramatically mis filed almost every piece of paperwork that I touched and forgot to call clients when making changes to schedule, etc.

A 38-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0169, Expiration Date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 30Apr2021 as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient had not receive other vaccines on the same day as the suspect product. The patient medical history included itchy red spots on her legs and body (the red areas are gone, but I still itch a little bit), and bad anxiety (Prednisone gave her bad anxiety). Concomitant medication(s) included ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (SPRINTEC) taken for birth control from about two years ago, ongoing and prednisone taken for itchy red spots on her legs and body (took 40mg of Prednisone for three days, then 30mg for three days and then did one day on 20mg and then she stopped taking it because it gave her bad anxiety). The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: ER8732, Expiry: unknown) on 09Apr2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced some mild &#34;off imbalance feelings&#34; and &#34;some itching with small red areas&#34;. After the first dose of the product, she got all these itchy red spots on her legs and body, and she went to a dermatologist for that and got Prednisone and was on that for about 7 days during when she got her second dose of the product. On an unspecified date in Apr2021, after the second vaccine dose, the patient experienced &#34;I have had head pressure&#34;, weird symptoms, &#34;I feel off balance, like on a boat&#34;, &#34;I am going to fall forward, not dizzy like vertigo&#34; and &#34;I can&#39;t work at all since the 2nd dose&#34;. The patient asked whether this were the normal side effect. The patient stated that she had seen reports of imbalance online and discussions between patients who were experiencing these symptoms. She went to emergency department and underwent lab tests and procedures which included ear, nose and throat examination: normal, electrocardiogram: normal and electronystagmogram: normal on an unspecified date. She was scheduled for a Brain MRI on 28May2021. The patient did not know whether what she was going through was related to the vaccine or not, but ever since she got her vaccine, she has been not feeling good, like she has not been able to work. The patient further reported that after her second dose, about five days later she felt off balance and has had a lot of issues. Her events were ongoing and persisting, like there was a point where, when they first started, she went to the emergency room, and she didn&#39;t felt like that anymore, but it was definitely still ongoing. The events led the patient to visit emergency room and physician office (had been to her primary and specialists as well) but was not hospitalized. The outcome of the events feeling abnormal and loss of balance was not recovered, and was unknown for the rest of the events.  Follow-up attempts are needed. further information is expected.

                                                After sitting calmly for a few minutes post vaccine, there was a sudden hot flush that rose up through my chest and into my face. My heart then started pounding very hard a quickly and my body started trembling. I became short of breath and lightheaded, but never felt I was wheezing. The pharmacist did not seem to know what was going on and told me to just stay seated and let him know if there were any changes. I took my mask off to get enough air and after a few minutes my heart rate slowed down and then the issue seemed to come in waves for about 10 minutes. After 15-20 minutes I felt shaky and lightheaded, but my heart rate seemed normal. At that point I asked the pharmacist to take my BP,  which was normal. Over the next week I had an increase in heart palpitations and difficulty sleeping. It felt like I had increased amount of adrenaline in my system. 3 weeks out I still have increased palpitations, but they are less frequent than they were initially.

Responders said I was out for a minute or so then regained consciousness. Pupil dilation during event per responders. ICU MD responder states no radial pulse but had carotid pulse which was weak at initial loss of consciousness. Given fluids. Blood pressure normal during fluids. Improved heart rate without tachycardia. Had recurrence of clammy hands, globus sensation with frequent swallowing/throat clearing about 30 minutes after initial event while still receiving fluids. No airway compromise or stridor. Received PO Benadryl 25 mg. Transferred to ER for monitoring for an additional 90 minutes with complete resolution of globus sensation about 30 minutes after Benadryl. Fatigue and weak post event.

                                                I developed immediate flushing, sweating, rapid heartbeat (was around 110bpm, is normally around 75bpm), and lightheadedness.  I sat down and had a few sips of water.  Within a few minutes, I felt like I was having a difficult time getting a good breath in.   I raised my hands over my head and took slow deep breaths to try and keep my breathing  under control.  I stayed at the hospital for about 45 minutes, over which time I had a few bites to eat and some water.   The flushing and sweating resolved within that time.  The lightheadedness and &#34;feeling of doom&#34; lasted about 3 hours.  I had no anxiety going into this vaccine, nor have I had a reaction like this before.

Pain is in anterior shoulder and radiates down right arm. Pain is constant but worse with movement. Pain started the night that vaccine was given 1/2/2021 and has been persistent since then making it difficult to work. Pain not relieved with tylenol or ibuprofen. Pain is more severe that what would be expected from needle trauma. Of note, vaccine was given particularly high near subdeltoid bursa.

Still dry next morning and a couple hrs later it switched to increased salivation.  The evening after injection I had a headache and  just felt general malaise and fatigue, &#34;run down&#34;. Difficulty sleeping that night due to body aches. HEadache, neck and lower back pain. Skin sensitivity when touched, bed sheets kinda hurt my skin. The bodyaches and malaise persisted through out day 2. Tylenol seemed to help.  I slept better that night but woke up with night sweats, completely drenched.  Arm pain at injection site on day 2 that resolved by mid day.  Now 1 week later I have extreme fatigue yesterday and today. I do have hypersomnia but not even my adderall is helping. Not sure if this is related or not.

A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 24Dec2020 at 08:00 AM in the hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, has no known allergies, had no other medications in two weeks, and did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. At 3:00 PM of 24Dec2020, the patient developed a severe tachycardia with no other symptoms. She walked herself to the ER (Emergency room/department or urgent care), was nervous and kind of shaking. By the time they got to her, her heart rate was stable and was at 88. Transient tachycardia was at around 120-140 for 7 minutes and resolved with no intervention. Basic labs came back normal. She got discharged from the ER. The patient didn&#39;t think they reported it but she was willing to cooperate in any way. The patient was not treated for the adverse events. As per the patient, she reported her adverse reaction (after the 1st dose) on the website as recommended. She experienced &#34;very fast heart beat 8 hours after receiving the vaccine&#34;. The patient was inquiring if she would be contacted after. The patient also asked if the very fast heartbeat was related to the vaccine because the reaction did not happen right away like usual, she was not sure if it was an allergic reaction since it happened 8 hours later. Outcome of the event &#39;Tachycardia&#39; was recovered in Dec2020, while for the other events was unknown. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

I tried to read my email and the words were there but didn&#39;t have meaning.  I had to drive home after my 15 minute observation and plugged my home address into my gps so I wouldn&#39;t get lost even though I drove home from Medical Center for years.  I got home and laid down and slept for a couple hours and woke up fine.  I felt ok the following day and was doing laundry around 6 pm and my arm stopped being sore and I got really dizzy and nauseated and my vision had shadows (reminded me of an ocular migraine) and drank 2 x 16 oz glasses of water and laid down and felt better in about 20-30 minutes.

                                                I had a slight headache while at work but was fine. I was home and was a little cold and my throat was scratchy. . Then about 9pm all of a sudden I started to get waves of chills. My hand were cold and my feet were frozen. I layered up with sweater and sweatpants to go to bed with a heavy comforter. I just could not get warm. About 1am, I woke up and put on my thick winter socks on because my feet were still frozen. I kept reminding myself to breathe in deeply.  I checked my BPM and it was 80-82 and normally its about low  70s. I woke up about 5:30am and had a really bad headache, injection area and arm hurt, my  body hurt and felt like I weighed several tons making me so slow. I didn&#39;t go to work the next day. My husband took my son to school and I took ibuprofen and went back to bed. Woke up again about 12:30 and felt better.

I didn&#39;t take any meds since I&#39;m pregnant. Symptoms peaked around 26 hours after vaccine. I slept almost all day. A very deep sleep. I started to feel a little better gradually. At 36 hours, I was completely back to normal. I am currently 31 weeks. I was 29 when I received the vaccine.  Even with everything I experienced, I would do it again.

                                                Internal brain bleeding 10 days after 1st dose covid vaccine; Brain damage; confused; suffering memory loss; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician (patient). This 39-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 18Dec2020 14:30 at single dose (lot number: EJ1685) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. The patient experienced internal brain bleeding and brain damage on 30Dec2020 07:30 after 1st dose covid vaccine. Brain surgery received on 29Dec2020. Events were still recovering. Patient was confused and suffering memory loss on 30Dec2020 07:30. Events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Prolongation of existing hospitalization (vaccine received during existing hospitalization), Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. Days for hospitalization was 16. The patient received treatment for events as brain surgery due to internal brain bleeding. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination, no COVID tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported internal brain bleeding and brain damage with confused and memory loss more likely represented intercurrent disease, and less likely causally related to 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                Hearing loss; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse Anesthetist (patient).  A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL0140) on 18Dec2020 at single dose in the left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization.Medical history included ongoing anaemia. There were no concomitant medications. On 06Jan2021 at 16:00 the patient experienced hearing loss, serious as medically significant. Patient had no problems with her ears before hand. On 06Jan2021 around 4 PM, she was just walking in the store, with no loud music or anything, and all of a sudden her hearing in her left ear went lost and muffled. On 07Jan2021 she went to the Otolaryngologist (ENT doctor) to get her ears checked. They said no it looked perfectly fine. They did an audiogram and hearing test on 07Jan2021 and there was a 20% hearing loss. She had no idea what it was from. She took no other medications. She had anemia but that was it. She was wondering if hearing loss has been reported with the vaccine either in the studies or recently. She researched it, and with the COVID virus itself, back in Jul2020 and Oct2020, people reported hearing loss. So she went and had a COVID test in Jan2021 and it was negative. Patient stated it was very scary and weird. Event treatment included high dose oral steroids to see if it can be treated and the ENT doctor was also giving her steroid shots in the ear. She was due to see him again in Jan2021. The outcome of the event Hearing loss was not recovered.  Patient also clarified that she did continue with her second dose of the vaccine on 08Jan2021. She had asked the ENT doctor his opinions on still getting the second dose, and he recommended it. The second dose of the vaccine was given on 08Jan2021 (lot EL3302, EXP: May2021) at single dose in the left deltoid for COVID-19 immunization.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported hearing loss cannot be excluded.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

My boss came to help walk me outside because I didn?t even feel like it was me walking. I don?t remember walking out of work.  I was there but ?not there?. I was not myself. I didn?t feel like i was in my body. I had to have my husband come get me from work, I slept most the rest of the day and night. Now I?m on day 2 and my joints still ache, my head hurts so bad, I am so tired I either am asleep on the couch or in bed. I have no energy. It takes everything I have to move just to go to the bathroom.

She couldn&#39;t eat and couldn&#39;t sleep. She called her PCP who referred her to the ED. She received ibuprofen and Zofran in the ED. Symptoms have improved some, but she is still having hip and back pain and hot and cold chills.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Healthcare Professional (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 16:15 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included GERD, sciatica, allergies, asthma, allergies to some foods (non anaphylactic). Concomitant medication included curcuma longa (TURMERIC [CURCUMA LONGA]), metaxalone, mometasone furoate (NASONEX), famotidine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Dec2020 01:00 PM at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. About 8 hours after the shot, on 15Jan2021 01:30 AM, patient woke up very cold, checked temp it was 95.9. Remained that way though the night (96F), could not sleep much b/c of chills. In the AM, temp gradually increased back to baseline 97.9. She doesn&#39;t think it was thermometer malfunction bc sx (symptoms) correlated with the temperature and she took the value repeated times. No treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered on 15Jan2021. The patient was not pregnant. Facility type vaccine was Workplace clinic. No other vaccine in four weeks. Not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. Not tested for COVID post vaccination.

                                                10 hrs after I received 1st dose of Pfizer I started feeling my heart beating rapidly and hard.  I was short of breath and had nausea and a headache.  This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

The onset of delirium came with the temp as we were on a road trip in the car headed to a hockey tournament.  It was noticed by my spouse who is a physician and several other hockey parents. I looked up delirium as a side effect but could not find anything related with the exception of elderly or with COVID itself.  So I thought I should report it to see if it had been reported by anyone else. It lasted until I went to bed and fever came down that night.

                                                Approximately 40 minutes after injection, my tongue began to feel thick, my throat tight, and my face slightly numb.  I spoke with a nurse and was given zyrtec.   Within an hour, symptoms related to face and tongue were gone.  Even 11 hours later, my throat feels like there is a small lump in it.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient). This is the second of two cases and refers to events occurred with the second dose of the vaccine.  A 39-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot EL1283), on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 at single dose in Deltoid Left for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, shellfish allergy, allergy lobster (used steroids). Patient was not pregnant.The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Previously on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM patient took the first dose of the vaccine (Lot EJ1685) at single dose in Deltoid Left for COVID-19 immunization and couple of days after she had nausea and something stuck in her throat. On 11Jan2021, 5 minutes after the 2nd dose (at 11:05), the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, that required Emergency room visit. Patient was not hospitalized and was treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLUMEDROL) and &#34;Pepcid&#34;: she was prescribed 3-day course of oral prednisone and H2 antihistamine oral &#34;Pepcid&#34;. After finished it, she felt it was coming back therefore she took diphenhydramine hydrochloride for 2 nights in a row. She did not experience any respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological or gastrointestinal manifestation. She completely recovered in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of anaphylactic reaction  due to temporal relationship.

I sat and was observed til approx. 1715 at which time I thought I was ready to head back to my department. After the elevator to the LL I really wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ended up going to the ER which they diagnosed me with Vertigo. I have never had vertigo in the past. I remained in the ER until approx. 2220 until my symptoms were managed with medication and I felt well enough to leave.The lightheaded and dizziness lasted a few days while the headaches lasted about a week.

I had no issues after that. I received the 2nd shot on  1/15/21, I had the exact same reaction however it only lasted 20 min. I then went to my car and started driving home, about 10 minutes later and while on the freeway I had dizziness, flushing, tachycardia, , shakiness, and facial numbness. I took an exit and was able to pull over in a parking lot. It lasted about 20 minutes. Since that time I have had frequent episodes of dizziness, facial flushing, tremulousness,  facial numbness/tingling, and presyncope. The worst episodes were on 2/1/21 and 2/3/21. I was unable to work because of these symptoms.

                                                Very uncomfortable ache in arm for 3 days several days (after initial expected and familiar post-injection soreness that only lasted 24 hours).  New ache impacted sleep and daily activities. Feels like what I would imagine a blood clot would feel like but did not notice redness and heat. Discomfort currently focused near inner elbow and underarm area. Discomfort increases with applied pressure to area. Massage has not helped. Sx have diminished since insert but still present after 3 days.

Sometimes accompanied by vibrating sensations, pins &amp; needles. The twitching is constant, never stops, and interferes with sleep. Symptoms increased in degree and severity after 2nd vaccination.

                                                Something stuck in my throat; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EJ1685; Expiration date was not reported) on 22Dec2020 (12:30) at a single dose on the left deltoid, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital. Medical history included allergy to lobster, and had used steroids. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 24Dec2020, the patient had something stuck in the throat; and had nausea. The patient had an emergency room visit due to the reported events; and had received a three-day course of oral prednisone and antihistamine, and then diphenhydramine (BENADRYL). The patient had no respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological or gastrointestinal manifestations. The outcome of the events, &#39;something stuck in the throat&#39; and &#39;nausea&#39;, was recovered on an unspecified date. The reporter had considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the events were related to the suspect vaccine.

I had to call off work for the following 2 days as I barely ate or slept during that time. Seventy-two hrs post vaccination, I was able to return to work with only one remaining side effect: lingering stomach cramps.  Self treated with alternating doses of OTC Extra-strength Tylenol and Excedrin Migraine while I was experiencing migraine, fever, myalgia and joint pain. Also took Ultra-strength Rolaids as needed for bloating and stomach cramps.

That night I had a headache that was not going away with medicine and couldn?t sleep. I also continued to have fever. The next day I still have breast pain, fatigue, and dizziness.

About 2.5 hours later I got a red rash on both arms and hands ( looks and feels like sunburn but it?s not). Rash persists off and on since ( even today).  I?ve had a temperature of  about 99 off and on for several days. Only my head and face are flushed and hot, but rest of me cold. I have soreness in both breasts. My left shoulder and breast had small sores ( looks like small scrape but no injury occurred). Those areas sting internally  with some pain and redness. Feels like bruise but nothing visible.  I?ve had fatigue almost every day. I have brain fog ( can?t spell simple words, forgetting words, lack of focus).

                                                Since the beginning of February, 1 week post vaccine, I have had 3 separate instances where I awake in the middle of the night out of a dead sleep with a racing heart and feel like I&#39;m going to vomit or pass out. It usually subsides within 10 minutes.  I have also been having spells of dizziness during the day, usually 3-5 days each week. I have seen my primary care MD, that diagnosed me with vertigo. I have also been to the ER, who then diagnosed me with anxiety and explained my waking up in the middle of the night as a panic attack. I have never had these feelings with physical symptoms prior to my vaccine. I have never had the COVID-19 virus to my knowledge.

                                                When the injection was placed I experienced deep pain inside my shoulder. Within 3 hours my shoulder was frozen in pain and unable to move. I used ice and anti-inflammatory medication with no relief. I was unable to move my shoulder and could not complete daily self care tasks like brushing hair, changing clothes, cooking or driving. I could not drive to work the next day and had to use sick leave. I was in a high level of pain. I woke up crying throughout the night for three nights due to pain. I sought care at unspecified Urgent Care and was told that it was just sore and I need to keep moving the shoulder and apply heat. I was given an RX for Cephalexin, an antibiotic. Dr. indicated the injection site was warm to the touch. By Wednesday morning, there has been a slight improvement in pain and mobility. I am able to hold my arm straight down as opposed to keeping the elbow bent and tucked in. Still cannot raise my arm at all from the shoulder joint.

My left arm from injection to fingertips felt internally as if I was injected with peppermint oil. A hot/overly cold prickly feeling started and then proceeded to feel hotter and my arm felt tingly, numb, as if an epidural was put on my left arm or it fell asleep. These feelings were internal (no rash or external redness). I also felt a bit of this same on my lower left jaw (again no outside rash or redness just inside feeling). I reported it immediately to the pharmacist who administered the shot and he said there looks to be no redness and that after my 15 minutes was up it was ok to go home. It is 5 hours now after the shot and it feels as if a nerve has been hit - my arm feels very internally cold. Fingers and arm functions fine, but it feels like its slightly detached from myself (none of this occurs anywhere other than the injection site down to fingertips and left jaw bone).

She had left the parking lot after 30 minutes of monitoring, however, upon reaching the exit, started to feel extremely unwell. As such, she was directed back to the monitoring area for urgent evaluation. Patient-reported bilateral UE tingling, subjective facial and oral swelling, and panic-type symptoms. EMS was alerted and patient vitals were collected along with a 12 lead EKG. VS were WNL. 12 lead showed sinus tachycardia.  encounter After serial monitoring and careful evaluation, it was evident that the patient was suffering a panic attack without signs of serious allergic reaction or airway compromise. After the passage of an additional 15 minutes, the patient had returned to baseline without additional intervention. She was returned home with her husband as the driver.

                                                Ten days after the vaccine I started having involuntary twitching of my arms and legs . It was bilateral, a single twitch every ten minutes or so all day long.  I am still  having the twitching in my arms and legs hourly after 11 weeks. I also have insomnia nightly, a brief waking one or two times a night also still happening after 11 weeks. My left ear had a crackling sound that came and went a couple of times a day. which is now happening a couple of times weekly. Starting on day 14 I had severe breast pain for three days. I have been trying multiple forms of naturopathic treatment to help and the symptoms have improved slightly. I plan to see a Neurologist.

                                                The first abnormal effect I experienced was numbness in my inner upper lip. This was intermittent and lasted roughly 24-48 hours after vaccine administration. Then on 3/25, I had muscle cramping/soreness in my lower leg muscles (calves). The next day (3/26), the muscle soreness continued, and my lower leg muscles began to feel tight when walking. On 3/27, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my right 5th digit, which then spread to all my fingers and toes.  That morning, the muscle soreness had also spread into my thighs and bilateral upper extremities. I also noted mild swelling in my hands and feet and could not put my rings on or wear socks or shoes. By that evening, walking became more difficult as the muscle soreness had now turned into muscle weakness. This prompted me to go the ER for evaluation. A CT scan of my head and lab work was done. I was given IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return to the ER the following day for a MRI of my brain. Overnight, the weakness and swelling in my hands and feet progressed . I became unable to walk, go to the bathroom, or feed my self without assistance. The numbness and tingling I first experienced in my inner upper lip returned, and these symptoms were also now noted in the rest of my face as well. I also began having muscle soreness in my neck, my jaw felt sore when chewing food, and I began seeing some floaters. I returned to the ER the morning of 3/28.  They did more blood work, imaging, as well as a lumbar puncture, and I was admitted to hospital. Once admitted, the hospitalist consulted with another hospital and recommended transfer by EMS there where I was admitted under a neurologist&#39;s care. When I arrived at that hospital, I began to feel somewhat better as the soreness and swelling appeared to be improving, and I could walk without assistance. They did a full neurological workup and kept me overnight for observation. Overnight, I did experience a mild headache that was relieved with Tylenol and rest.  I woke up the next morning  (3/29) with nausea and did have a few episodes of vomiting that turned into dry heaving and was given Zofran with relief. The swelling in my hand went down enough that I was able to make a fist and grasp objects with my fingers again. After the neurologist reviewed my labs and work up the morning of 3/29, I was allowed to return home to await final test results as all my tests were looking normal, my symptoms were continuing to improve, and PT had cleared me to be able to return home. Upon discharge, I was instructed  to not get my 2nd COVID vaccination as it was possible that my symptoms were an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccination as no  other diagnosis was found with testing. I was instructed to follow up with my PCP in one week. Since returning home, I have continued to be very easily fatigued and have had some headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I continue to feel weak when walking and have some muscle stiffness when first waking from sleep. I also continue to have some intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling.

A 39 year old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201,Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in right deltoid on 01Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in left deltoid on 01Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing lung cancer from 03Jul2017, metastatic disease from lung cancer from: Dec 2018 and hypertension from: 2007. Concomitant medication included Losartan at 100 mg once a day tablet for blood pressure, Atorvastatin at 80 mg a day tablet for cholesterol, Lorbrena from 26Jun2019 at 100 mg once a day tablet for lung cancer, vitamin D3 at 3000 IU once a day gel cap and coq10 supplement at 100mg and all the drugs were ongoing. The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021. As a treatment therapy the patient received some CBD and went to sleep, and this lasted about 2 days and after that it got a little better. The patient was improved but had slight lasting effects. The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had the typical arm soreness for the first day or two, On Friday, two days after the vaccine, I became very depressed. I have had some experience with depression, but I would say this was one of the worst experiences in 10 years. The depression has continued for the past few days. I thought of suicide, but I would not say I was suicidal. It did make me wonder if this could be a side effect that had not been adequately reported. I do not know for sure that it is, but, if a vaccine recipient was very prone to depression/already suicidal, this could be very serious.  Less worrisome, but worth noting: I also had high level of breast soreness which was confusing because I had not heard that was a symptom until I mentioned it to my primary care doctor.

                                                12 hours after the vaccination, I woke up with severe chills, causing me to shake violently. I also felt dizzy and a bit confused. My gait was unsteady after I first got out of bed due to the dizziness. I had body aches, a headache, a head cold feeling, and fatigue. I also had slight soreness when raising the arm that received the injection, but less so than after the first dose or even my annual flu shot. I was able to work on Monday, 4/14, although I was less productive than usual (office worker). After work, I needed a nap before taking my son to a store. After 10 minutes of walking around the store, I had to sit down due to extreme fatigue. I slept from 8:30 pm - 6:45 am that second night, waking every few hours to drink, urinate, add a layer of clothing, etc. Somewhere in the middle of the night, I was aware I had sweat alot, and my thick clothes were wet. I was feeling slightly better after waking up on Tuesday morning, but still took cold medicine for symptoms. Around 12:30 pm on Tuesday, April 13th, I felt much better.  Now, on the evening of Tuesday, April 13th, I have only slight residual body aches remaining.

                                                I immediately felt dizzy, like I was drunk. At around 4pm, I started feeling wheezy. It felt like there was a mastiff sitting on my chest. I took some benadryl, which helped. The next day, the feeling persisted and I had a mild cough, especially while lying down. More benadryl. Same on the third day. I did not seek medical attention because I didn&#39;t think it was an extraordinary reaction and I have had much worse reactions to other things in the past that have been managed with benadryl. I thought what I was experiencing was an expected side effect based on the information I had been given. The feeling started to ease by the 4th day, but then the insomnia, mood swings, exhaustion and body aches set in. The cough was sporadic, but still present. Today, I still get the heavy chest feeling intermittently, activity doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect or cause. My arm still itches at the injection site and hurts when touched.  I went back to get my second dose on 4/9. When the nurse asked me if I had had any adverse reactions to the first one, I told her about the chest heaviness and coughing and the other symptoms. She stopped what she was doing and called her medical director. They both decided that the first response was enough of an anaphylactic reaction to be a caution for the second. They refused to give me the second dose because they thought the second would elicit a much worse reaction - possibly to the point of intubation. They told me that I would have to be evaluated by a physician and that I would need a &#34;doctor&#39;s note&#34; in order to get the second vaccine.

But I was able to sleep fine, and I don&#39;t think it was caffeine, I think it was a bout of shakiness tied to the vaccine. Morning of 7th day still feel a little shaky with facial flushing.

                                                Presyncope occurred the morning after receiving the vaccine. I did not actually faint, but when I got out of bed in the morning and walked across the house I suddenly had ringing in ears, started sweating profusely, felt lightheaded and felt like I was going to faint. This lasted for at least a couple minutes.   I&#39;d received the vaccine at 9:10am on 4/14. The first side effects started around 8:15pm and were along the lines of what I expected: body aches, low fever, fatigue, chills. Overnight, despite the fatigue, I had trouble sleeping due to heart palpitations and intermittently feeling too hot or too cold, and eventually I had a headache. All night, I was falling asleep and waking up a little while later.  At around 6:30am on 4/15, after sleeping poorly, my headache had gotten bad enough that I decided to take acetaminophen. I had not previously taken any medicine leading up to the vaccine or after getting the shot. I got out of bed and walked across the house, and that&#39;s when the presyncope came. Feeling very faint, I sat down, took the acetaminophen, and waited for the feeling to pass.   Once the feeling did pass, I started to feel better pretty quickly, which may have been the medicine working, and then I was able to sleep for a few hours. A slight fever came back over the course of the day, I took a couple more small doses of acetaminophen as needed, and then on 4/16 I woke up feeling fine.

Within about 15 minutes, Pt complained that she had a rash appearing on her arms. The rash appeared on both arms and she described a burning sensation. I gave her 25mg diphenhydramine and kept her longer for observation. She had no other symptoms. The rash was spreading to her torso and she seemed agitated. We had her driven to an Urgent Care Facility for examination. The staff advised Diphenhydramine 25mg  every 4-6 hours as needed for the rash and to see her primary physician.

Worsening POTS/Dysautonomia Sx with severe flushing episodes that left me unable to work as a physician for 6wks. The episodes got progressively worse. I eventually ended up on steroids which did improve my symptoms. I was diagnosed officially with POTS and small fiber neuropathy. I attempted to go back to work but became too fatigued and weak to be able to walk, my husband had to come get me and I was taken to his care in a wheelchair. I could not get out of bed for 5 days. I saw rheumatology and am back on steroids. I am now showing lab evidence of lupus. I have polyarthritis and polymyalgia on exam as well as muscle weakness in the quads. I continue to have neuropathy.

                                                12 hours after my shot (April 24, 2019) I had a very sore arm much like most people I&#39;ve talked to but then I had the sensation of being really cold - enough that I couldn&#39;t sleep, so I got up and put a heating pad on and numerous layers of cold. Was able to sleep that night. Then on April 28th at around 11:00 pm I got the same sensation but much more significant. It felt like my entire legs were frozen. They were not cold to the touch but the sensation in my skin was that they were very very cold. I could not warm up. 3 shirts, pants, wool socks, 2 blankets - one of them a down comforter - a microwave heated pad and an electric heated pad and I still felt very very cold. No shaking or shivering. No fever. No sweating. My temperature was 97.7 which is what it usually is. Eventually fell asleep but when I got up in the morning (April 29) the cold sensation remained and is now in my arms as well. Took a hot shower but still can&#39;t &#34;feel&#34; warm. Sat under multiple blankets and started sweating but never felt hot or even warm. Still no change in temperature and no shivering. Just a very cold sensation - like someone has blasted my legs and upper arms with an air conditioning unit. As of 10:15am on April 29th, these symptoms remain unchanged.

Hives developed on ears and back of neck.  Had difficulty concentrating and confusion.  Felt like passing out.  Pharmacist did not react or call for ambulance because I was still breathing.   My husband had to drive me home.  I have a doctor as a neighbor who was home when I got home still having reaction 30 min after the shot and took blood pressure that was extremely elevated (top number in 200) and heat rate still over 100bpm.  Took 50mg Benadryl and symptoms started decreasing within an hour and blood pressure was decreasing but still higher than normal.  By 7pm, blood pressure was back to normal and heart rate back to 70bpm.

                                                Felt lightheaded after receiving vaccine. Stayed at pharmacy for 30 mins. Later that evening had intense headaches and the feeling of blood rushing to my head. The next morning my headache subsided some and I drove to work. My throat felt tight and continued to feel tight through the morning. At 11:30 I called the pharmacy because my throat tightness continued to get worse and it was difficult to eat my breakfast. Also my lips began to go numb and tingle. I was told to immediately go to the ER. I went to ER and was seen by Dr. in the ER. They did xrays of my throat and bloodwork, inserted an IV and gave me steroids thru the IV. Within about 30-40 mins I began to feel better. I was prescribed steriods to take for 6 days at home. I have continued to have headaches, mainly at night and extreme inflammation in my neck, chest/clavicle area, back of neck and shoulders from my lymphnodes, difficulty sleeping flat. This is now 4 days after the shot and I am beginning to feel a little better, just still swollen lyphnodes and mild headache.

A 39-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 20Apr2021 at 19:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and pregabalin (LYRICA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at 100 mg, 3x/day for neuropathy. Medical history included neuropathy from 2020 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient got the vaccine and she was taking pregabalin as well and after vaccination, she experienced an adverse event, her legs were heavy and numb and also her bladder was now the problem she was actually now at the emergency room. Patient was a little nervous. The patient was still in the hospital and she was not getting any care. What happened at the beginning was that she totally became paralyzed from the waist down, when your foot fall asleep you get painful tingling feeling she have that kind of feeling in her legs not able to move any part of her anywhere from her waist down later on that night, after she took pregabalin, went to sleep about an hour she was able to move her left toes and able to drag one leg a little bit. She was supposed to take pregabalin 3 times a day and they were giving her a difficult time about it, she took one at 12 O&#39; clock on Wednesday and the hospital they did not give another one until 11 o clock that evening because she was supposed to take 3 times a day. After she no longer feel from the waist down, she took a pregabalin and it didn&#39;t help her it didn&#39;t work and her physician told her to take 3 times a day and then at 10 O&#39; clock yesterday morning she was still asking the hospital to give her another one. When asked to repeat the concern, patient stated &#34;weakness in her legs that felt very heavy like she was dragging. The date of hospitalization was reported as 21Apr2021. The reason for hospitalization was reported as numbness in her legs and weakness in legs, became paralyzed from the waist down, and her kidneys. So her brain doesn&#39;t tell the body to go to the bathroom she is leaking because the bladder is filling up filling over and the body doesn&#39;t know to get it out its leaking because it is filling up it is so full. The patient underwent lab test in the hospital. The action taken with pregabalin in response to the events was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I was diagnosed by my neurologist with Guillain-Barre Syndrome.  9 days after my 2nd Pfizer shot (Sunday, March 28th), I felt tingling in my feet. On Monday night I felt tingling and pain in my feet, but I was sure it was passing and said nothing since the pain was manageable at a level 2?3. On Tuesday I was getting concerned. My feet were now tingling and in pain all day, and the pain had escalated to a level 5. On Wednesday I suddenly realized that my life could effectively be over soon. The pain was at a 7-8, and I could barely get through my day. My body felt like there were tiny needles shooting electricity into me, and it felt all-consuming. It was unrelenting, and I suddenly understood why the CEO (a COVID survivor) killed himself after suffering through constant ringing in his ears. It became CRYSTAL clear how chronic pain made regular working life impossible, and I wondered how I would get by on disability and how long it would take to kick in after applying. I started panicking while focusing enough to book a doctor?s appointment for that Friday. By the end of Wednesday my calves and thighs were severely cramped, and by Thursday my eyes were tingling and my hands and arms were tingling with pain. I feared MS since it runs in my family. I was terrified and confused and made an appointment with a PCP for Friday, April 2nd.

                                                5 minutes after vaccine was administered, while seated in the waiting area, I suddenly had an intense metallic taste in my mouth and became lightheaded. I felt like I was going to faint so I had my son get the nurse&#39;s attention. The lightheaded feeling began to pass within the next few minutes. The intense metallic flavor remained. They gave me water and gum to chew on. I waited an additional 15 minutes (totaling 30 minutes) to ensure there were no other side effects. I felt odd but safe to drive home upon leaving. The metallic taste has not subsided. It does not fade and it affects how my food tastes to me. Sweet food now has a saltiness to it, savory food has a bitter taste to it. I felt very tired the rest of the day and my arm hurt the next day, but I had no other side effects from the vaccine. The metallic taste has not faded.

A conta sctable consumer (patient) reported a 39-year-old female patient received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 39-years-old) as aingle dose in the left arm  for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and pre-diabetic. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccine. Concomitant medications included multivitamins. The patient did not have any allergies. On 26Mar2021, ten minutes after the vaccine (also reported as 10:15) the patient experienced heart raised really quick and felt difficulty breathing but calmed down and left the site. The next day (27Mar2021) she drank coffee like every morning but noticed palpitations, noticed sensitiveness to salty foods after ingestion felt palpitations but was not concerned as she thought it was a side effect. On 31Mar2021 she suddenly woke up at 05:00 with heart palpitations &#34;138 bps.&#34; She thought it was going to go away but she felt worse, fainted, and almost &#34;felt&#34; passing out. Paramedics showed up and her heart rate was 115 but nothing serious, suspected panic attack. She never had before so she thought it was going to go away but she had multiple panic attacks during the day and night, could not sleep at all for 3 consecutive days. The patient visited a doctor as a result of the events. She was prescribed trazodone &#34;one at night.&#34; The patient also saw a cardiologist for the palpitations and was treated with metoprolol 25 mg twice a day to control palpitations but the meds gave her intrusive thoughts and deep depression with suicidal thoughts. The outcomes of heart raised really quickly/palpitations, difficulty breathing, sensitiveness to salty foods, fainted, almost &#34;felt&#34; passing out, and panic attacks were recovering.    No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Immediately after receiving the second dose of Pfizer on Tues May 18, I felt prickly sensations throughout my body. After sitting for the recommended 30 minutes (due to known allergies to previous medications), I began to feel dizzy. They monitored me in the tent for several minutes and checked my vitals, which were fine. The nurse thought I may have hyperventilated. I thought I must have just had a mild panic attack.   But the attacks did not stop. Rather, the first three days post vaccine, I had several panic attacks a day, even being woken from sleep because of them. It&#39;s not fear or a racing mind but a constant racing heart, weakness, feeling faint. I feel prickly sensations and sensation of heat, which are common in panic attacks. But even after three days, they were not letting up. In addition to the attacks, I felt lightheaded, weak and extremely fatigued, even at rest. There is also constant pain and tightness in my neck and jaws.   Thursday evening (May 20), I had an episode where I nearly passed out. Once I got seated, my body froze. I was unable to get my words out clearly. Instead of saying the full sentence in my head, I could only get a word or two out. Instead of being able to lift my arm to eat, I couldn&#39;t move. The episode lasted about 15-20 minutes. I had several of these episodes on Saturday, two on Sunday and one on Monday.   Thinking it was purely anxiety, I reached out to my psychiatrist who prescribed Klonopin to ease the symptoms. I took 0.5mg on Friday afternoon (5/21) and 0.5mg on Saturday morning (5/22).   Realizing the Klonopin was likely making my symptoms worse, I have not taken any since Saturday morning (05/22).   Most of the day I am breathless, weak, feel faint doing nearly nothing. I have an hour or so a couple of times of day where I&#39;m more functional but still have to move very slowly. Otherwise, I&#39;m either like a zombie or unable to speak clearly, stuttering when I speak, and unable to operate without feeling faint.

                                                Immediately I started to feel a warm sensation like a wave come over my body. My heart started racing and I told the woman who administered the vaccine. I started to feel like I was going to faint so I sat in a chair with my legs up on another chair. The hot wave feeling kept getting more intense and so did the feeling like I was going to faint. I never fainted but the feeling kept coming on strong then going away. The woman kept telling me I was ok because I didn?t have hives or trouble breathing. At one point she walked away from me and I had a started to shake uncontrollably. I called paramedics because my heart was racing and the shaking got even worse. At this point I laid on the ground because I couldn?t sit in the chair from the shaking. The paramedics were very dismissive and asked if I had a history of panic attacks. I repeatedly told them and the woman who administered the vaccine that I was not having a panic attack and that I felt fine before the vaccine and that I do not have a fear of needles.  They took my blood pressure and pulse and said I was fine. I didn?t feel fine and kept shaking throughout the examination (on the floor). I was unable to stand up for 2 hours. It was awful laying on the floor of a grocery store for that long and feeling so terrible. The shaking lasted 2 hours but the rapid heartbeat and feeling of waves of heat lasted days.

                                                Pt arrived at vaccine site  for second Pfizer COVID vaccine. Pt reported experiencing itching after the first vaccination.  However, she denied SOB, chest pain, dizziness, and N/V.   She reported non-anaphylactic response to egg and strawberry and indicated &#34;that was a long time ago and it doesn&#39;t happen any more&#34;. I cleared pt for second injection (0.3 mL Pfizer Lot# EP7533) which was administered at 10:28 AM.  At 10:36AM I was alerted that she needed assistance.  She was in her car, drivers seat, with daughter in the passenger seat.  PPR she was experiencing constriction in the throat with difficulty breathing, chest pain and dizziness.  Pt was diaphoretic, labored breathing, BP: 110/80, HR: 72 bmp. pulse ox on site was broken.  I reclined the seat and elevated legs on the dashboard.  I administered 50mg Benadryl IM of left deltoid m. at 10:39 AM.  Patient was breathing and able to answer questions.  She had no apparent angioedema so I delayed administration of Epi pen to continue observation.  At 10:45 AM pt reported resolution of sensation of constriction of the throat however was still experiencing chest tightness and dizziness.  Bp: 130/82 HR: 76.  Pt continued to have intermittent chest tightness and dizziness.  She had a syncopal event lasting approximately 3 seconds at 10:54.  She was disoriented and unable to focus.  She continued to report having intermittent difficulty focusing, dizziness and chest discomfort.  &#34;feeling fuzzy&#34; I gave water and Chewy granola po at 11:02.   I called EMS as I felt she needed to be monitored for some time and we are not set up for this at the vaccine site. Due to her inattention I was not certain that this was psychosomatic.  Arrived shortly thereafter.  Evaluated patient and gave her the option of going home with daughter monitoring her or going to hospital. I confirmed daughter felt comfortable with this and new what s/s to be aware of.  Pt&#39;s daughter drove her home.

A 40-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 18Mar2021 at 11:30(at the age of 39 years old) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included , ankylosing spondylitis from 2020 and ongoing, ongoing autoimmune thyroiditis(Hashimoto) diagnosed after her second baby, she was 6 so maybe 5 years ago , cardiac disorder from an unknown date and states her mom has a heart condition and they tested her and her heart&#39;s good. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL9267) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 26Feb2021 at 14:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization (she reported as, she knows it was close to the expiration because she got in at the last minute. It was probably the same day, the expiration. the first one was the same day expiration by 1700), flu vaccine (FLU VACCINE VII) 6.5 to 7 years ago(she would have been 34 year old) and she get Guillain-Barre and she just felt numbness, and she cut her hand open by accident a week after the first shot and got tetatnus shot (TETANUS VACCINE) on right arm on 04Mar2021 for immunization. The patient experienced as, experiencing swelling of her soft tissue palate at the back of her throat/swelling where her soft tissue palate gets swollen, she can&#39;t swallow, the roof of mouth also feels dry and sticky and achy, she is muscle pain at the left back side of her mouth, the nerves start getting crazy, back of her tongue feels like it swells, feels like she&#39;s gagging on an unspecified date on May2021. Reporter reported as, she has been experiencing swelling of her soft tissue palate at the back of her throat which started 3 weeks ago. She said that she feels like she can&#39;t swallow, it comes and goes and has been in the ER multiple times because of this. The roof of mouth also feels dry and sticky and achy. She has muscle pain at the left back side of her mouth. She enquired regarding reports on this and as to how long she will be experiencing this. She was taking Pfizer COVID vaccine as she got very paranoid, they instilled a lot of fear, she has a lot of autoimmune diseases too. She is just wondering if Pfizer has had any other people with similar symptoms to what she had after the second vaccine in March. She just started getting some insane symptoms in her mouth. she&#39;s been to the hospital 3 times with swelling where her soft tissue palate gets swollen and the nerves start getting crazy. She wasn&#39;t sure in the beginning if it could be tied to the vaccine, but from her last three hospital visits they are kind of questioning it, its kind of an unexplained reaction. It started where she felt like she couldn&#39;t swallow so they ran tests, they thought maybe it was strep throat and everything got cleared. It was nothing viral, nothing medically they could find. They could see the swelling, but theres no reason for it. The back of her tongue feels like it swells feels like she&#39;s gagging. It swells then it goes down. It gets worse then it&#39;s go back down. It&#39;s not getting better, but progressively gets worse then stabilizes then worse again. It just won&#39;t go away. She was a little skeptical of the Covid shot as she had flu shot which she did get Guillain-Barre. She was told it was safe. She was tested for strep probably 5 days after her symptoms started. She also got a Covid swab too because they didn&#39;t know what it was. They tested her for everything, viral, bacterial, Covid, strep, and everything came back negative. They are kind of puzzled, she&#39;s having symptoms, they come and go and it drives her to the emergency room because of the swelling in the soft tissue in her throat. She did read online there is some people with the vaccine have had swelling so she thought and wondered if its related.she went to the emergency room three times and she has been to an ENT, neurology, her family doctor, she has been everywhere. They discharged her every time she went to the hospital. they see the inflammation almost like it&#39;s spasming, as it gets spasms and goes down then goes up, it&#39;s very spontaneous. She went to a gastroenterologist and they did a scope and they said it was red and inflamed all the way from the back of her throat to her soft palate and all the way to her stomach, it&#39;s swollen and inflamed. She states that&#39;s why she&#39;s on steriods. They thought it could be a viral infection and the biopsy came back and it&#39;s not so they are questioning the vaccine. She states Rheumatology, they also did a test to see if her inflammation marks are high and they weren&#39;t so it shows it&#39;s not her autoimmune, it&#39;s something else. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial test: negative on an unspecified date, endoscopy: red and inflammed all the way from back to throat on an unspecified date , sars-cov-2 test: negative on an unspecified date on May2021, streptococcus test: negative on an unspecified date on May2021, viral test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of experiencing swelling of her soft tissue palate at the back of her throat/swelling where her soft tissue palate gets swollen. Adverse event resulted in visit to emergency room and physician office. Outcome of all the events were not recovered.  Information on batch/Lot number was obtained. Further information has been requested.
