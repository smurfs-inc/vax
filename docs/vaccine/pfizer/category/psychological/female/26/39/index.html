                                                Had me wait for 15 minutes after vaccine and started having a redness in neck and was really itchy; whole body big time itchy. My chest - shortness of breath. Gave me a shot of benydryl  - 25 mg in my right arm and I went home and itching still didn&#39;t go away and I took pill of benydryl. Chills next day; super cold; headache; tired - and I couldn&#39;t think straight. Nothing was registering in my head with training at work - felt slow. Went home from took more benydryl. Next morning - pins and needles in back of my head. Went to urgent care (Riverside Urgent Care) and they gave me gave me Vexamethasone - shot it up in my butt and every symptom went away after that shot and I was okay after that.Itching went away after that. Felt weak for about a week afterwards. Went and had second shot yesterday 1/10/2021. They gave me medication with vaccine so I wouldn&#39;t get reaction this time. Gave me liquid 25 benydryl beforehand and had me wait 15 mintues and after 15 min they gave me the second dose of vaccine after the injection and they had me wait for 30 minutes. Right away I started getting itchy and they gave me pill form( 2 pills) of Vexamethsone and itching slowly stopped and they sent me home after an hour. Itching slowly went away - later that day. And today I&#39;m okay.

                                                12 hours after administration, woken up from sleep by tingling, throbbing in lower legs. Described as a nerve and muscle ache/throb, or &#34;growing pains&#34;/RLS symptoms. Put on compression socks which helped, but still too uncomfortable to sleep. Was able to sleep after taking ibuprofen 800mg and drinking water. 6 hours after the ibuprofen was administered, pain returned in lower legs as well as neck/ears  with body temperature swings (cold, teeth chattering to sweating uncontrollably in a few minutes). After 1 hour of trying to sleep but failing, put compression socks back on. Temperature rose to 100-100.2 F, chills causing whole body to shake under multiple blankets. Tingling/muscle pains extremely uncomfortable and unable to rest, took another ibuprofen 800mg and water and was able to sleep. Tingling and muscle pains have continued as soon as ibuprofen wears off and come back more intense each time, most notably in the lower legs and near ears/neck and elbow of arm administered in (similar to &#34;tennis elbow,&#34; assumed to be provoked by inflammation, happened with first dose).

I had both symptoms all through Saturday as well.  I was also very tired and slept most of the day Saturday. When I woke up on Sunday I felt totally fine again.

                                                At 1 AM on 1/19/21, I awoke with chills, a fever of 101, neck pain, muscle pain, joint pain, and a severe headache. This persisted throughout the night and I did not sleep. Took 1000 mg of Acetaminophen at 5:30 and slept until 7 AM. By 8 AM, my temperature was back down to 98 F. Took 500 mg of Acetaminophen at 10 AM with food. Headache, muscle pain, and joint pain persisted. Moderate to severe chest pain began 15 mins after eating at 4 PM. Waited 30 mins to see if it resolved; it did not. Went to the urgent care. Chest x-ray and EKG was performed, no issues found. Was diagnosed with costochondritis and was given a steroid shot and ibuprofen,  which reduced the pain significantly within 30 mins later.

Headache and body aches have worsened in severity. Unable to work for the morning but was able to go in the afternoon for a short time period. Lower body aches are particularly severe. Fatigue is noticeable. Mental health conditions have worsened but that may be due to lack of sleep.  30 hours following the vaccine: chills, nausea, and dizziness have dissipated completely. They were slowly improving throughout the day. Body aches and headache still severe but lessened with marijuana use.  48 hours following the vaccine: all symptom seemed to have subsided during the night. Sleep was much better quality. Only remaining symptom is an ache on the right side of my chest towards my ribs.

For about 36 hours, it ran 100-130&#39;s; Dehydration; Feeling fatigued/Excessive fatigue; Had some general arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ 1686, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 08Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ 1685, unknown expiration) via intramuscular in right arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as needed and unspecified birth control. The patient has no known allergies. The patient started feeling fatigued about 1900 hours (07:00 PM) on 08Jan2021 and only had some general arm soreness. She woke up on 09Jan2021, with serious chills to the point of physical shaking; nausea started soon after and around 0300, began vomiting and dry heaving. The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the event &#34;having sweats&#34; was unknown, while the patient is recovering for the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported serious chill was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

                                                Within 24 hours of getting my 2nd COVID vaccine, I began to feel weak and achy. My neck and face got really hot while the rest of my body stayed cold. A small headache began to turn into a migraine. During the night, my body began to hurt beyond achy causing me to toss and turn. When I woke up in the morning, I couldn&#39;t stand even the littlest of pressure placed on my body. For example, my cat jumped on my leg and it felt like someone wacked me with a baseball bat because of how sensitive my body was. The only treatment used for myself during this time was Tylenol. It helped with the head aches. Overall, it took me about three nights to actually feel ok again.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after the administration of the second COVID19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chills and myalgia through the night.  I did not improve when I woke up on 01/25.  The chills and myalgia worsened and were complicated by vomiting without blood.  I called off sick from work and took 3 Aleve tablets.  I went back to sleep with improvement in symptoms approximately 6 hours later, with only mild myalgias and a very sore L. arm.  Symptoms completely resolved by the morning of 01/26.

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular in left deltoid on 20Jan2021 11:00 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunisation. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first dose yesterday at 11:00am. She was talking to someone and all of a sudden she got throat to neck pain that was intense that lasted two minutes on 21Jan2021. It has been about 10-15minutes since and if she hold her neck straight she is fine, but if she looks up it hurts. She can breathe fine. It hurts to swallow all of a sudden on 21Jan2021. Asking if it is normal to experience this. She had a low grade fever/low grade temp of 99.4, body aches, and a headache that started today 21Jan2021. She received Tylenol as treatment. States she is a nurse and she is tired. Her head feels fuzzy, she has not taken her temperature recently and it still hurts to swallow. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Relatedness of drug to events from reporter for throat and neck pain, hurts to swallow, low grade fever, headache, body aches was reported as related. Reporter seriousness for throat and neck pain and hurts to swallow was medically significant. Event outcome of throat and neck pain was recovered, of hurts to swallow was not recovered, of others was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were likely causally related to the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  However, it is worth noting that the reporter/user of the vaccine was nurse, and her tiredness from job could have confounded with the events.

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 14:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the workplace clinic. Relevant medical history included COVID-19, which was diagnosed prior to vaccination and migraines (before). The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included melatonin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 30Dec2020 at 15:45 or 1 hour after the vaccine injection, the patient had an aura like a bad migraine and she had bright spotty vision in the peripheral right field for 15-20 minutes; the patient has had migraines before, but they&#39;re not common for her. Two hours after the vaccine, on 30Dec2020 at 16:45, the patient had mental confusion and an inability to speak; she tried to say things to her husband and it was a jumbled, meaningless string of words. She also felt very cold and she had tingling around the mouth. Her husband thought she was having a stroke and called 911 on 30Dec2020. All her vitals were stable, and within 10 minutes she could speak again. On 30Dec2020, the patient&#39;s electrocardiogram (EKG) showed peaked T waves, common with dehydration and high potassium. She was encouraged to go to the emergency room (ER). Instead of taking the ambulance, she drove herself several hours later. The patient wanted someone to tell her it wasn&#39;t a stroke. After a brief neurological exam on 30Dec2020, the doctor said it was likely a severe migraine and wrote the reason for her visit as a vaccine reaction. This took place in the late evening to early morning, and she missed one day of work. The events did result in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient did not receive any treatment for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from all the events on 31Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event stroke with BNt162b2 can not be fully excluded.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

It wasa very scary experience for me. This lasted about 15 or 20 minutes I&#39;m guessing (hard to say for sure because I was too worked up to watch the clock) but I ended up making myself fall back asleep. The next day January 8th I had diarrhea multiple times in theafternoon and felt strange, somewhat lightheaded and some what felt like anxiety.

I got my vaccine at around 3, and didn&#39;t have any immediate reaction.

I woke up in the middle of the night feeling achy and unwell. When I woke up in the morning I was extremely fatigued and my eyes were itchy and puffy.

Twelve hours later, after waking up those same symptoms were only on the right side of my body. Friday morning, mostly normal physically just with some overall fatigue. Friday afternoon I started to get hives on my chest and overnight into Saturday they were on my lower back, sides, and legs. I took 50 mg of Benadryl every 6-12 hours until Monday mid-day when Benadryl was not helping reduce the hives and so I had full body hives. I did try an drugstore cortisone cream which did not help.  Sought treatment at an urgent care as I was feeling anxious and could not control the itching. I and was diagnosed with likely allergic reaction to the covid-19 vaccine.

I tried to bear down at home to decrease my heart rate but it continued to climb to 164 so after an hour of sustained Hr 126-164 I went to the emergency room where I had SVT. They did a valsalva maneuver 3 times and that made my heart rate go down to the 130s. It was then sinus tachycardia and stayed 120s-130s until about noon. Upon discharge at 3:30pm my resting heart rate was still 105 but it was determined to be a vaccine reaction as all other tests were normal.

                                                Neuropraxia of Left Arm; A PHASE 1/2/3, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED, OBSERVER-BLIND, DOSE-FINDING STUDY TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, IMMUNOGENICITY, AND EFFICACY OF SARS-COV-2 RNA VACCINE CANDIDATES AGAINST COVID-19 IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS  This is a report from an interventional study source for Protocol C4591001 sponsored by BioNTech, managed and reported by Pfizer on the sponsor&#39;s behalf. The subject is in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred.  A 27-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies (Mar2006 and ongoing not taking any medications to treat) who received the first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 1) on 14Aug2020 at 10:34, second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 2) on 04Sep2020 at 09:27. The first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) on 23Dec2020 at 09:25, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) on 11Jan2021 at 09:48. All intramuscularly in the left deltoid as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included ethinyl-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (LOESTRIN) for birth control from May2014 and ongoing. There was no family medical history relevant to AE and no concomitant vaccine administered on the same date of investigational vaccine or other prior vaccine within four weeks.  The subject experienced neuropraxia of left arm on 11Jan2021 at 09:51 considered an important medical event requiring a visit to physician office.  The clinical course was the following: At 9:51, 3 minutes after receiving the second dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid, the subject complained of left arm numbness and tingling starting at elbow and extending to fingers, weakness, and a weak grip in that hand. She also reported a decreased range of motion on the left side including her arm, shoulder joint, elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal. Subject was afebrile with a normal vascular exam, no bruising, capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. No antipyretic medication was administered. The investigator requested the subject to return to site the following day. On 12Jan2021, the investigator noted some improvement to symptoms but the subject was unable to return to work for several days after event. An appointment was scheduled with a neurologist for 13Jan2021. The action taken with BNT162B2 for the event was not applicable. The clinical outcome of the event was recovering.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event neuropraxia of left arm was related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) and clinical trial procedure (vaccination administration in the left deltoid, investigator did consider the location was appropriate), but unrelated to first and second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) or concomitant medications. Per investigator, it was not likely that the event was related to the investigational product (IP) itself, however, that could not be 100% determined until neurologist had evaluated the subject.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  There is a reasonable possibility for the event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; to be related to the procedure of vaccine (BNT162B2) administration (needle trauma) rather than to the product administered. The event would not be considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162B2). The case will be reassessed upon reception of neurological advice.  Pfizer&#39;s safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 31-DEC-2020 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Nerve injury. Review of the database for the PT Nerve injury had the following results: 0 serious clinical trial cases and 1 non-clinical trial case.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committee and Investigators, as appropriate.

While sleeping I could feel that I had chills and felt very warm. Woke up at about 0200 to take my temperature. Felt dizzy when I got up, still had a headache and a fever of 101.0 (taken orally). Contacted a nurse triage line to ensure I can take t=Tylenol to bring the fever down and get rid of the headache. She said yes, which is when I took 500mg Extra Strength Tylenol rapid release. Continued to feel not so well, and broke my fever around 0630 timeframe. Once I woke up around 0900 (day after administration) still felt a little warm  (99.5)  and a mild headache. Will keep an eye on any other adverse reactions.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after the vaccine administration, I started getting symptoms that started mild and became severe including: headache, dry cough with chest pressure, dizziness/lightheaded,  joint pain, body aches, fatigue, and chills. At 5:30 pm I started getting a fever, that started at 100.5 then increased to 103.3 by 8:30 pm. I was also nauseous and vomited once.  I was tested the next morning for influenza and COVID and was negative. My fever came back down to 98.8 around 12 pm the next day. Overall, symptoms lasted approximately 30 hours after the vaccine was administered.  I was out of work the following day after the vaccine. Now, 2 days after the vaccine I am just mildly fatigued with a dry cough left.

                                                Several hours after receiving the vaccination, I became fatigued and sore with muscle aches in the arm of the vaccine site. That night I woke up with moderate body aches and chills and a dull headache, no fever. The next morning, I awoke feeling very fatigued, severe muscle/body aches, headache and chills, still no fever. I slept most of the day. Extra strength Tylenol helped tremendously with the body aches. I was symptom free the morning of 1/15/2021. I was scheduled to work the day after my vaccination and was unable to due to the symptoms described.  I had no adverse reactions with my first dose.  I am a nursing mother and for the first and second doses, I noticed no side effects or any concerns with my child or milk supply.

She had proactively taken diphenhydramine following the reaction to her first dose.  Around 08:40 AM,  she began to feel tightening in her throat and some heaviness in her chest. She was evaluated by a nurse who took her blood pressure (normal), however, her heart rate was elevated (noted this could be that she was nervous following initial reaction and repeat tightness in throat).  Around 08:55AM, she began to feel like her tongue was swelling and that she had a &#34;bubble&#34; on the top of her throat. She was taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She was given hydroxyzine, famotidine, and dexamethasone in the ED and was discharged and felt stable.  She reported a continued odd sensation in her throat the evening of the second vaccination.  This feeling resolved the next day, and she reports no additional side effects from the vaccine.   Of note, patient had experienced a similar reaction following her first vaccination (E-number 261589)

I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

A 28-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL3346), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 15Jan2021 08:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included seizure, asthma, known allergies to penicillins and NSAIDs. Concomitant medication included levetiracetam, escitalopram, phenytoin, lamotrigine. The patient previously took naproxen, azithromycin, clindamycin; all experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Jan2021 at time of 08:30, the patient experienced seizure, muscle spasm and weakness, hard to breathe at time, can&#39;t stay awake. Events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the seizure and other reported events due to temporal relationship.   Of note, the patient has a medical history of seizure disorder.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM. The patient used naproxen 440 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg on 19Dec2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

I was very fatigued and could not use my arm to work since the pain in the arm. I took some Ibuprofen and took a nap and then after that it got a little better, it still hurt but at least I could I use my arm. The next day it was fine.

I went to the emergency room where they did an EKG, labs, and chest xray; all were within normal limits. I was observed for a few hours and sent home.

Unable to lift my arm very far without pain. Worse than any other injection recieved in the past. Pain throught the night-causing lack of sleep. Severe pain for about 24 hours or so then completely gone. My muscle in my arm then felt tight as if there was inflammation of some sort or an injury to the muscle. Upon lifting my arm it felt as if my arm was pulling back. No pain during this action but more of a weakness. No relief from anti inflammatory medicaiton or ice. Sensation in arm noted to be gone on 01/09/2021.

Woke up at 2:00am uncontrollably shaking with chills/goosebumps, sweating with shortness of breath. Extreme headache and all over body soreness also at that time.  This continued in waves for the next several hours. I finally slept for a short time and woke with continued headache and muscle/joint soreness. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea and decreased appetite. This persisted throughout the entire next day following vaccination. The day after that was slightly better and the subsequent day I felt relatively back to normal.  I checked for fever many times throughout the symptoms but was always afebrile.

                                                1 week history of significantly worsened (previously present &#34;low back strain&#34; lower back pain that had become radicular to both LE and associated with progressively worsening bilateral LE weakness, paresthesias since COVID vaccination last week. see continuation for HPI and assessment/plan from office note 1/13/21  HPI from OV dated 1/13/21  She had presented initially in December 2020 for her annual physical, and we evaluated some low back pain that that time, felt to be a sprain/strain resulting from a fall in the shower earlier December which was aggravated significantly by lifting/transferring a patient at the SNF she works for as a nurse. Presentation at that time was rather benign, no imaging obtained, pt was placed on leave from work for 1 week to avoid the heavy lifting and likely aggravation of back pain, and rx including diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine. She did not FU in the office, but returned to work at SNF a week after I saw her for the back pain. She states she had improved enough to feel like she could go back to work but wasn&#39;t 100% without back pain yet. At no time was comp mentioned at the visit in December. She did tell her employer about the injury and was off of work for a week and was encouraged to seek comp. We were never notified.    Yesterday 1/12 she followed up in the office for the back pain and was found to have much more severe pain, now radicular to both LE (pain intensity worse on right), with new neurologic impairment including objective weakness bilateral LE (R&gt;L), sensation disturbance bilateral LE (R&gt;L). Xray of lumbar spine obtained in clinic, this was essentially unremarkable, non-acute.  Pt was sent for stat MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI last night revealed no findings to explain her severe symptoms - she has mild symmetric disc bulging at L5-S1  nd mild bilateral facet arthropathy with patent canal and foramina, and a mild nonspecific  &#34;STIR signal abnormality&#34; within the soft tissues abutting the left lateral aspect of the L5 spinous processes felt to be small and nonspecific. I did discuss the case and the imaging with the radiologist and he feels this is unlikely to be the source of her back pain/radicular symptoms. No obvious signs of apparent discitis or any signficant soft tissue abnormality.    Pt contacted last night with initial &#34;normal&#34; results of MRI as formal results were pending - hydrocodone was sent to her pharmacy for pain relief overnight. Pt received 60mg toradol in the office yesterday during her visit. Pt noted significant improvement in her back pain, bilateral leg pain about 30 minuts after that injection. She continued to have pain in the evening but went to sleep. She woke at 3am unable to roll over due to weakness and pain - her sister gave her a hydrocodone and she went back to sleep&#39; she woke this morning feeling much better; today, she has less severe low back pain, less severe right lower leg radicular pain, NO pain radiating into the left LE, lessening of the weakness in her right LE, lessening of paresthesia reported in the right LE (now isolated just to the heel), resolution of the weakness in the left LE, resolution of the tingling of the left knee. Other than the toradol and one dose of hydrocodone, no other medications were given, no other treatments given since presentation yesterday.   Upon further questioning, patient does reveal that she received the 1st of 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (pfizer) last week. She received the vaccination at work at nursing home on 1/7/21. She had some relatively quick onset nausea and dizziness within an hour of the injection, but that resolved. She recalls feeling like her low back pain, bilateral lower leg pain, leg weakness and paresthesias all intensified sometime either Wednesday 1/6/21 or 1/7/21, but more obviously worsened over the weekend 1/9 and 1/10. Along with the lower extremity symptoms, she does admit today that she experienced soreness in bilateral upper arms starting the day following the vaccine administration, with left arm/shoulder still feeling sore and tender to the touch now. She also developed some altered sensation of the right thumb and index fingers the day following vaccination (1/8/21) and this has been persistent/unchanged. She is right handed. No prior issues with right hand/fingers. Other than the altered sensation, she denies pain, swelling, or notable weakness. She is right handed, and really hasn&#39;t done much with her right hand over the past week since she hasn&#39;t been working. Patient denies having significant headache, fever, chills, diaphoresis, fatigue, rashes/injection site erythema since the covid vaccination. She was not told to sign up for or told about the V-safe program and hadn&#39;t thought to report her symptoms to work or think to be concerned regarding possible vaccine SE. Pt denies prior hx of low back pain, neurologic symptoms including weakness/paresthesias, previous allergy to or adverse reaction to vaccination or injectable medications. She has a history of latent TB(fully treated) but is otherwise in good health.  After gathering much further detailed information/history today from patient, review of chart including the MRI results and xray results from yesterday, my prior OV note, and discussion with radiologist today regarding her MRI - I Discussed with patient and her sister that I believe what is becoming more apparent to me now is that she is likely suffering from an adverse event associated with the COVID-19 vaccination she received on 1/7/21 through her workplace. I&#39;m unable to define this for certain, but I suspect that she developed the progressive worsening of low back pain, development of radicular pain and bilateral LE weakness and paresthesias about 1-2 days following the vaccination administration. She has had notable and rather surprising improvement in both subjective and objective findings  Today as compared to yesterday. Only intervention was toradol 60mg IM and one dose of hydrocodone, she had already been taking diclofenac or ibuprofen so I believe the only explanation for the improvement over the past 24 hours is the fact that she is gradually having resolution of the temporary paraparesis, neuralgia, paresthesia brought on by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. I believe she truly had injury to the low back in December, initial injury at home but had improvmenet and then significant worsening/exacerbation when transferring a resident at work. Her presentation following that was consistent with a strain/sprain of the lumbar spine. This was treated appropriately with rest, activity modification, stretching, NSAID, and muscle relaxers. She returned to work w/o restriction likely earlier than she should have but I believe the covid vaccination is likely what caused her condition to so significantly decline; Its also possible that her physically demanding job requiring lifting/transferring/standing for prolonged periods of time on top of an only partially resolved low back strain had aggravated her low back condition.    plan from OV dated 1/13/21 Given the improvement since yesterday, I recommended obtaining some labs looking for any sign of alternative explanation including infectious etiology or autoimmune/inflammatory condition, however will hold on further imaging as would be the plan, specifically EMG of the bilateral LEs. Explained to patient that I&#39;m hopeful with continued rest and time, her symptoms (weakness, tingling/numbness, radicular back pain) will completely resolve. She may need some eventual PT for the disc bulge in the lumbar spine and lumbar strain that is likely still lingering. Will contact pt with any change in care plan based on the laboratory findings. I would like to closely follow her, and make sure her symptoms continue to slowly improve /resolve. If at any point she develops worsening symptoms again or any new neurologic signs/symptoms (and we discussed what emergency signs/symptoms would be) then she needs to be in touch with me right away. I will work on reporting this suspected adverse covid vaccine reaction to VAERS / possibly also CDC and see if they have any additional input/suggestions for monitoring/treatment.    For pain control, pt may continue with the diclofenac OR ibuprofen, and the hydrococone/APAP as needed for breakthrough severe pain uncontrolled with the NSAID. I have advised pt to remain off of work at this time, resting at home avoiding lots of physical activity as she continues to heal. Suspect will have her follow up in clinic sometime next week for repeat evaluation/examination depending on VAERS/CDC recommendations and of course the lab results and any updated condition reports from the patient in the interim. Will want to make sure she has full resolution of the paresis and adequate resolution of her back pain/radicular pain prior to returning to work, even in a limited capacity. I am informed today that there is light duty available and will keep that in mind. Pt to be contacted regarding follow up. Encouraged to call with questions/concerns/updates. Pt was very thankful for the care.

I could not sleep that night after I received my vaccine. I decided not to go the ER and slept it off I woke up much better next morning.

There were no medical history and concomitant medications reported. Patient has no prior vaccination within 4 weeks.The patient got her first dose of the  COVID 19 vaccine yesterday (07Jan2021) from her employer.  She started &#34;feeling yucky&#34; today (08Jan2021) around noon with a low grade fever,and developed a cough that was not persistent. Patient has soreness in the arm where vaccine was given. She was asking what should she do about it? Outcome of the events low grade fever, cough, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal were not recovered while vaccination site pain was unknown. The events low grade fever, cough, feeling unwell were considered serious medically significant and related to vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the events fever, cough and malaise are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

                                                I felt q lump in my throat and tingly in hands qnd feet for a few minutes after. I then was speaking with management and felt faint and short of breath, continued to be tingly.  Last night 1/19/21 I had a moment of not feeling well and my heart rate went from 60s to 120s with shortness of breath and nausea qnd tingling. This continued for about 30 minutes, I was debating going to the ED for the SOB. I then became really cold and had such bad shaking I couldn&#39;t hold anything for another 20 minutes.  Today I continue to have some tingling. All of this on top of the expected side effects.

I don&#39;t like to take medicine and I had no choice but take Panadol every 4 hours and apply ice to treat the muscular pain. I went to emergency and was told that I had an urine infection  (which is very rare on me), and was treated with antibiotics.   With the second dose I took acetaminophen 500 mg befor the vaccine, that helped because the day of the shot I didn&#39;t have pain, but the numbness was like if I couldn&#39;t connect my body to the brain. Couldn&#39;t talk properly, sleep 2 hours during the day, is funny that I applied ice on the injection site (Me thinking) but the pain doesn&#39;t go away, when the ice melts I notice that I applied the ice on the wrong arm. That&#39;s what I mean when I talk about numbness. Fever of 39.8F and Chills even today . Some cough and dry throat (Dryness can be because I&#39;m a teacher) and constant tiredness.

Approximately 7-8 days after my vaccination, my left armpit started feeling sore. This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

This A 30-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EH9899), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 22Dec2020 09:00 for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included reaction to pork, porsine and/or if she ever was exposed to exposed to heparin. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced syncope (medically significant), dizziness (medically significant), feeling faint; like going to pass out now and then (medically significant), overall achiness, severe headaches, fever. The outcome of the events syncope, dizziness, feeling faint; like going to pass out now was recovering and outcome of overall achiness, severe headaches, fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The patient ask: are there any animal products, pork gelatin or a lipid form of that contain in the vaccine?   The events were described as follows: She experienced a significant amount of syncope and dizziness, for greater than 4 or 5 days post-receiving the vaccination. Also feeling faint like she is going to pass out every now and then. Has a more important question, wondering along with the doctors if one of the ingredients may have an animal product, like pork gelatin or a lipid form of that. It looks like one of the ingredients may have an animal cell lipid and was wondering if she was having a reaction to that. Declines to provide primary care provider details. States she received this first dose at occupational health in her workplace. Received the vaccine on the 22Dec2020 at 9am. 24 hours post vaccination, 1 day after, the syncope, dizziness, feeling faint started. Also the other symptoms, overall achiness, severe headaches, and fever were also experienced, but they stopped after that 24 hours. Those were expected since it was listed as side effects that popped up, so she expected those and they stopped after 24 hours. The syncope, dizziness, and faint feeling are not any worse and are very slowly improving, but she still has it and had to call out of work today because of it. That&#39;s consistent. Mentions it takes her a while to get down the stairs when getting product details for the COVID-19 vaccine. Unable to provide the vaccine NDC or expiry, or dose. Did not have any other vaccines at time of this one and none 4 weeks prior. Had to call a (company withheld) doctor and has to go to occupational health tomorrow to be seen. Declines having COVID virus. No further details provided.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events syncope and dizziness are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

The next morning I had a fever and my joints, muscles, head and even my skin was hurting. My fever never came down to normal even with advil and I was extremely tired all day.  The arm that had the injection is extremely sore with splotches of red (which is expected.) Today, 01/08, I woke up in a pool of sweat. My head is still hurting and I still have a fever. My arm is still sore but my skin and joint pain has improved. I am still very cold. Have been wearing my winter coat in my house even with the heat and the fire place on.

                                                Wednesday 1/13/2021 I woke up feeling like nauseous, then later in the day I started to get itchy in my lower body that was coming and going (I believe I still had some allegra d in my system). On  Thursday 01/14/2021 by noon time the itching had become extreme and unbearable all over my body and felt like my skin was crawling/burning, my chest and parts of my arms were really red . I also developed a lump in my throat that kept getting bigger and felt itchy and couldn&#39;t stop clearing my throat. Around 3pm I took 10ml of Claritin. The Claritin had not really helped however the redness had gone down a lot and by 4:30 I was miserable. Informed by a provider I work with to go to urgent care. I arrived at urgent care at about 5:10 where I was treated for an allergy reaction. I was given  0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus 500mL, Methylprednisolone sod suc(PF) (SOLU-Medrol) 125mg Intravenous, Famotidine (Pepcid) 20mg/2ml injection 20mg intravenous, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50mg/ml injection 25mg intravenous.  The itching subsided within 30 minutes, the itchy throat/ lump was still present but was not getting worse and slowly improving.   I was discharged home and was told to pick up famotidine 20mg, otc benadryl and prednisone 50mg to take for 5 days.  got home a little after 7 and was able to eat dinner, let dog out, shower, rest  before going to bed. I did take another 10 ml of Benadryl at 10:30. Woke up without any itchy skin at 5:45 and was able to return to work this morning. I still have a slight itchy throat but it is tolerable. I took allegra d and famotidine this morning. I am holding off on the prednisone because of the immune response to vaccines from steroids. I don&#39;t want to lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine.

                                                1022 - Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccine by RN.  She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient. Ambulance in route, about 5 - 10 minutes out per radio communication.  Checking BP every 2  minutes.  Now is 68/44. C/O nausea and vomited. Pulse ox won?t pick up.  Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

                                                Two days after receiving first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine started feeling generally unwell. On the third day, started feeling progressively worse: dizziness upon standing and while standing (to the point I thought I would fall over) nausea, dry heaving, headache bordering on migraine, abdominal pain and a short period of appetite loss. Today (fourth day post shot) I called out of work and feel as if I?m on a tilt table while laying down, and will feel dizzy and nauseated immediately upon standing up. This is is spite of staying hydrated and eating a bland diet in order to not upset my stomach.

A 31-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient stated she got the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Monday, 28Dec2020. She mentioned that she read the list of side effects and all the print outs and stated her events were not on there. She wanted to make sure and stated maybe it was not even from the vaccine. She reported she just came from the hair dresser, had hair colored before many times, but today (30Dec2020), when she put the dye on her hair, she broke out with what felt like a million bugs on her head and face, stated it is burning and itching, maybe it is her imagination. She knows there is a lot of paranoia. She reported that she has had hair colored before and this has never happened, it occurred during hair coloring treatment. She also mentioned that on 30Dec2020 (also reported as &#34;yesterday&#34;, pending clarification), she felt dizzy and nauseous; on 29Dec2020 (reported as &#34;yesterday&#34;), she felt bad and did not feel right all day, but says she knows those were listed symptoms. The outcome of the events dizziness, nausea, burning sensation and pruritus was recovering; the outcome of events paranoia and feeling abnormal was unknown.

About 12 hours after I got the vaccine (around 1 am), I woke up with a headache, chills, body aches and a low grade fever. During the night, my temp got up to 99.9 and continued to stay around mid to high 99s throughout the day on Sunday. I tried Tylenol without any success and kept going in and out of chills with body aches and headache persisting. Before I went to sleep Sunday (01/03/21) night, I switched to Ibuprofen and woke up Monday morning without a fever but still experiencing fatigue. Throughout the day on Monday, fever did not return. I stayed home from work on Sunday and Monday. On Tuesday 01/04/20, I was still tired but able to return to work.

She stated she felt hot and hadn&#39;t eaten all day. She was given a few bites of apple sauce and some Dr. Pepper to drink in case of low blood sugar. She was also given 25mg of diphenhydramine in case of an allergic reaction after the vaccine adminstration at 12:15pm. A few minutes later, she began shaking and stated she thought she was having an anxiety attack.  At this time, the patient requested we call 911 because that would make her feel better and so we did.

She has taken a benadryl this morning with no improvement.  Patient was recommended to seek care in the ER.

                                                Right after the second dose less than 2 minutes my heart rate began to spike. I could feel my heart pumping fast. I couldn?t sit due to this so I began pacing the room. I didn?t know this was a side affect so I thought I was over thinking the second dose. I attributed this to all the worry and doubt the media and people around me try pumping in your head. I thought I was having a panic attack. I didn?t alert any of the medical team there because again, I thought I was over thinking it. A few hours later my heart rate had gone down. My Apple Watch helped me monitor this. The next day I felt pain at the injection site, not my normal self, groggy. Slightly feverish and chilled. I work in a cold environment so I couldn?t quite tell if the chilled feeling was a side effect, or the room. Later that evening around 9pm things took a turn. I began running a low grade fever and was shaking from being so cold. About another hour late my fever was up to 101 and I was still shaking from being so cold. I took about 600mg of ibuprofen. I couldn?t sleep, tossed and turned. Probably another hour later my temperature was 102, still shaking uncontrollably. Covered in about 5 blankets I kept waiting it out. And I?d say around 2-3am I could feel my fever breaking. By late morning my temp was back to normal but I felt achy still. Tired, sore. Definitely sore at my injection site. And I don?t know if this is worth mentioning or not but just haven?t been able to shake that panic attack feeling. Like a worry or a dread over me. I just don?t feel as clear-headed as I did before. This is my biggest concern. Just don?t feel myself yet.

By 2030 I had severe full body chills and could not stop shaking. I had a severe headache/migraine. Every muscle in my body hurt. This continued on for the entire night. Got tested for COVID the next morning with the rapid results and the symptoms continued with the muscle aches and severe headache. Vision became blurry and I became very dizzy. Slept for 8 hours during the day on 1/7/2021 and then slept another 12 hours that night. The body aches and headaches continued until 1/8/2021 at which the symptoms finally subsided

A 31-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose in deltoid right for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on 03Jan2021 and within 15 minutes had a generalized headache. Later that night she had generalized muscle weakness and pain, but really didn&#39;t think too much about it. The next day at work (04Jan2021), she had numbness on the right upper side of her lip and a pins and needle feeling in the right upper quadrant of the face. Had a lot of pain in the area as well on the right upper side of the face as well as a dull aching pain that lasted for hours. Later that day when using the computer and she was trying to reach for her mouse she noticed her right hand wasn&#39;t able to feel anything and that lasted about 20-25 minutes. Kept slapping the mouse with her hand, but could not feel anything, her hand went numb. Yesterday (05Jan2021), she had the same pins and needle feeling in the same area of the face and that dull achy feeling and it occurred for hours and it was very kind of debilitating for her at work.  Later that night she had pain in her right leg and felt the same way, that very severe achiness, which was the pins and needles feeling up and down the leg and underneath the right foot. All these symptoms tend to be on her right side and it definitely lasted for hours. It started about 1 and didn&#39;t end until 6-7pm. It even hurts to move the right eye in one direction and hurts to speak, the pain was so bad. This morning (06Jan2021) she had to call out of work because at 3am the generalized headache, pain was unbearable. She was still experiencing the pain in right leg and bottom sole of right foot. She did not receive any vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. She had made an appointment with a neurologist and will have a MRI done on Friday, 08Jan2021. No further details provided. All events required a visit to physician office. All events were reported as serious per medically significant. The outcome of all events was not resolved. The reporter considered all events were related to the vaccine.   Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal relationship, causality between reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded.

                                                On  12/25 I was driving home and my left arm got numb, tingly and weak to the the point where I thought I was suffering from a stroke.  I  rushed to my moms and had her to drive me to the hospital where they did a neuro check to include a CT scan which ruled out the stroke but the symptoms lasted about 4 days which came and went with the pain and intensity varying each time which ended around 12/29.  I suffered from body aches and night chills one night.  Around the 12/29 I began to have pressure around the back of my head which felt as if I was laying on bricks when I laid down.  It got to the point to where I couldnt sleep which caused me to go back to the ER on  1/1 where I was given  toradol, decadron and sudafed which allowed me to sleep. I was released from the ER with Motrin 800 and contined to take that and Tylenol until the headaches ceased  which was about 3 or 4 days later. The headache went away but the pressure still remained.  My lymph glands were swollen so I was also given a prescription for amoloxicillin.

                                                1/12 0715: Received Pfizer covid-19 vaccine dose 2 at end of shift. Went home to sleep after waiting 15 min.  1630: Woke up. Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

This day the headache was the worst symptom and it was very severe. The new thing that started on this second day post vaccination was nausea and abdominal pain which was not present as badly the day after.

Went back to sleep and woke up around 4 am with fever up to 100.6F, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, and extreme fatigue. My left axilla was swollen with arm pain to mid left chest and back, and my axillary lymph node was painful and swollen to about the size of a large grape. I took 440 mg of Aleve around 8:30 when the fever did not subside. The fever broke and did not return. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. My left axillary lymph node is still palpable as of today, 1/15.

Very fatigued. At night I threw up and about 2AM I woke up drenched in sweat and I did not take my temperature. I woke up around 7AM and I had a migraine for about 2/3 hours - pounding headache. I took Tylenol, My body was really achy and my arm was like it was dead. General malaise, fatigue, it felt like I had a hangover, from my pounding headache. I threw up once again in the afternoon. Not sure if pregnancy related or the vaccine. Sunday morning I started feeling a little better. Saturday I felt horrible.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

A 31-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient claimed that on the first dose, she felt part of the dose run down her arm or at least had that sensation. The inoculator thinks the complete dose was injected. The patient was upset and wants a recommendation on if she should need a repeat of her first dose. The patient asked if there was any data on repeating the first dose vs. no action and proceed with the second dose in 21 days. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I stated to have some facial swelling then my throat started to swell/tighten.  I was brought to the ED and an IV was started. They administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The throat swelling started to interfere with my speaking and vocals. They monitored me for 7 hours then I was discharged home. All symptoms returned within a few hours and persisted for a week following. My PCP took over care and prescribed me the following in replace of the medications the ER prescribed: Albuterol HFA, Dexamethasome, Pepcid, Benadryl, Z-Pak, Vitamin D 100,000iu, and Fish Oil. I missed a week of week then was released to work again on 1/25/21.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL9261) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 20Jan2021 13:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included having one thyroid and had a benign tumor removed from behind heart when she was young and birth control. Concomitant medication included benzalkonium chloride, sodium chloride (ALIVE) and desogestrel, ethinylestradiol (ISIBLOOM) for birth control. After taking the shot she got light headed as she was walking to her car on 20Jan2021 15:00. Didn&#39;t think nothing of it since she was nervous about taking the shot. Then once she got home, she got really tired. She only had one thyroid so the shot made me really sleepy and she had a few skipped heart beats while laying down. After she slept, she felt fine but weird then after being up for a few hours she would get restless again. She got light headed again the next day going to the grocery store then back restless. She didn&#39;t feel normal until this Tuesday, she was not feeling weird and she was not as tired as she had been since she took the shot. She had tried to get seen from her doctor but she was booked up. No treatment was received for the events. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was not pregnant. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No known allergies. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 32-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(lot number EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at Arm Left on 21Dec2020 (from 16:30 to 17:00) at the age of 32 years old at single dose for doesn&#39;t want to bring COVID home to her family. The medical history included Migraine headaches. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had so many immunizations for international travel, had Yellow Fever vaccine, all of the Guardasil vaccines, had MMR vaccine four times because she never developed immunity to it until the fourth round, got a flu shot yearly,got TDap vaccine every five years because she was an HCP, did Emgality shots( not done it this month. Emgality had a protein inhibitor, was supposed to get Emgality shot on 21Dec2020). On 22Dec2020 the patient experienced severe serum sickness, high fever, body aches to the point that she was shaking uncontrollably, sore throat that was as painful as a strep infection; Caller mentioned she was taking tylenl and benadryl for her symptoms. The patient was a Nurse Midwife. She got the vaccine on Monday evening at 4:30PM. Feeling like she was having a weird serum sickness. Woke up in the middle of the night and she was full of shakes to the point the bed was shaking. She had a fever over 101. Felt like she was having an extreme immune response. She was taking Tylenol and Benadryl around the clock. Woke up this morning and her throat feels sore to the point of Strep. Wondering if she need to distance and get some kind of test. Has been wearing a mask all of the time and doesn&#39;t know of anyone people who have COVID that she has been in contact with. Feels congestion and sore throat. Shakes and chills: Began at 02:30. Hard core chills and shakes. High fever over 101: same time as chills and shakes. Woke up from a dead sleep. Didn&#39;t have a working thermometer but knows her temperature must have been over 101 by the way she felt. She didn&#39;t feel that crappy unless her fever is over 101. She can gauge her own temperature. She experienced throat soreness: Felt like sharp razor blades. The patient was taking numbing throat lozenges. Seriousness: Would say serious. Didn&#39;t require hospitalization. She self-treated. Had she not had to work, she would probably have stayed in bed. Has been taking round the clock medicine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported serious events including severe serum sickness, high fever, body aches, shaking uncontrollably, sore throat that was as painful as a strep infection, feels like having an extreme immune response, congestion, chills, woke up from a dead sleep and the administration of the COVID 19 immunization with BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.

                                                Recieved the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccination on Dec 26th 2020, and had no major adverse reaction to vaccine except for mild soreness and heat around injection site and intense fatigue for three days after. Symptoms went away after the 4th day. Two weeks later on Jan 5th 2021, i began to notice an intense itching, burning, and swelling at the injection site. Pain and soreness in arm made it difficult to do my job and seem to just get worse. Upon the next morning of Jan 6th 2021, pain remained but itching had gone down, but intense burning, soreness and massive redness around injection site remained and seemed to be getting worse. Pain remains and redness has not gone down, arm is very tender near site and lifting and moving arm is very stiff and sore. Feeling of lump or stiffness on injection site comes and goes and feeling of heavy and sore muscles move from upper left arm down to elbow and extend to hand; making movement and function slowed or slightly numb. Stiffness in arm and intense heat at injection site makes it uncomfortable to move or use arm. Cold tingling sensation on occasion and stiffness in elbow joint. Slight dizziness and fatigue follow with pain in arm. Was informed to see a physician on Jan 6th, 2021 who said to fill out vaccination adverse event report and to keep an eye on arm. If pain or symptoms become worse to return.

                                                As soon as I received my shot it was like an electric shot from the injection shot, up the back of my neck, into my brain. I was instantly woozy and disoriented. They moved me to observation. My hemiplegic migraine started within 10 minutes of the vaccine. I take a preventative every day, and to be honest after the vaccine it was like I had never, ever taken my preventatives. The migraine I got that day is the worst one I have experienced since the first one I ever got.   Now on top of the migraines, the vaccine gave me waves of new symptoms. I was having spells of intense heat flashes, with wooziness, and nausea. So the new symptoms were paired with the hemiplegic migraines that, if you aren?t familiar with, mimic strokes because my whole left side tends to go limp, and I struggle with speech, and cognitive issues. So it really wasn?t all too long before the nurse kindly suggested that I didn?t look great and we should head to the ED.  They treated the migraine, gave me a CT, everything came back fine. They reached out to my neurologist, gave me some fluids, really they wanted to keep me a little longer, but I know the migraine drill and just wanted to go home and sleep and eat. I promised to follow up with my neurologist and fill out my CDC form.  Over the next week the migraine and extra symptoms seemed to slowly but surely let up. The only note worthy thing was really that my left side would get extra tender at times. Not just my injection site, but it was almost like all my nerve endings all over my left side were on fire at times and a pinch on the thigh may as well have been a stab, or a pat on the back a punch. It was pretty intense at times.   And just when I thought it was all over my menses started, you see my hormones trigger my migraines. And once again it was like I wasn?t on a preventative. I had an intense Migraine start. I was able to take my bail out medication (sumatriptan) though and get to work. I moved forward with my day, and just when I thought all was normal, I got one of those brutal heat flashes, the room started moving, and I was nauseous. Unfortunately I was in full PPE, I almost passed out, I had to get a coworker to help, they had to get my supervisor. It was a big, unnecessary-necessary, pride-wounding scene.  Now I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I might speculate that people with neurological deficits, like myself, are going to have a harder time with this inactive Covid strand. I would much rather be immune to Covid then catch it though, so whatever I can do to help, and protect myself and family and friends and neighbors, I will absolutely do... But I imagine there is probably an adjustment to be made here for the neurologically impaired.  Thanks for your time, and let me know if you have any questions.

I could not change my own clothes my myalgias and joint pain were so severe. I was sobbing in my kitchen and my fiancé had to help me move around the house. I was slowing my speech and mentation. Severe headache. I made my fiancé wake me up every two hours to make sure I wasn?t decompensating.

                                                within 1 hr post-vaccine on 1/7 I had a mild headache that resolved with Tylenol. At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

                                                I work as an occupational therapist in acute care. On 12/28, I was helping a patient transfer from supine to sit. She required maximal assistance, and I was briefly in an awkward position with my trunk flexed and rotated towards the right during this transfer. I felt a pull in my left lower back. After this, I iced the area and took 400 mg ibuprofen and this relieved the mild pain I had.  The following two days, I made an effort to follow back precautions (avoid bending, lifting, twisting), avoided heavy lifting at work. On 12/29 in the morning, I felt only a mild soreness in my left lower back and was able to go on my workday without issue (avoiding heavy lifting) On 12/29 around 3 pm I received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. On 12/30 (day off work) from the time I woke up until around early afternoon I felt a mild weakness and heaviness in both of my legs. It was most notable when I was standing to cook for about  20-30 minutes that my legs felt shaky and I felt the need to sit. I was able to finish cooking without sitting, however, this sensation was abnormal for me as I normally am on my feet for most of the day with an active job without feeling shaky or weak.  Around 22:00 on 12/30 I had severe nausea for about an hour or so. I can&#39;t fully remember, but several days after 12/28 or 12/29 I started to feel a mild cold sensation in my lower back. I attributed this potentially to my mild back injury, but it was unclear.  The sensory change was intermittent and mild, and ongoing until recently. On 1/9 while at work, I started to feel a mild cold sensation below my belly button, in addition to the intermittent lumbar back cold sensation area. On 1/11 at work, the sensory changes to my lower abdomen and back were more apparent after assisting in a maximal assist transfer with a patient.  At this time, it was a combination of cold and burning sensations.

The chills resolved quickly (within 24 hours), but the headache, body aches, and fatigue have continued through today (one week after receiving the vaccine).  Ibuprofen has been the only treatment.  The symptoms temporarily improve after taking ibuprofen and then return.  I have not been able to exercise since receiving the vaccine and I missed one day of work (1/12/21). I have no history of adverse reactions to any other vaccines and I had no adverse reaction to the first dose. I work as a Clinical Nurse Leader on a Critical Care floor.  One of my directors suggested I submit a VAERS.

Felt great rest of day. @0500 on 1/28 woke up shivering uncontrollably. Mild fever of 100.5(highest recorded during this whole episode). Body aches, chills, sweats, headache rest of day. 1000 mg Tylenol helped with fever/chills but headache progressed to migraine w/nausea. Took 50 mg sumatriptan and 25 mg doxylamine in evening and this seemed to help with headache and allow me to get to sleep 1/28.  Woke up at 0300 1/29 with chills/cold sweats. Took 1000 mg Tylenol again (didn&#39;t check temp) and went back to sleep. Woke up at 0530 for work - checked temp since I&#39;m a healthcare worker and it was 100.4 (with tylenol). Waited until clinic opened up and called them at 0700 for recommendations on going to work or not (temp by then was 99.8, with tylenol). Was advised to stay home and if febrile tomorrow to get COVID tested on 1/30. As of right now (1300 on 1/29) headache has returned but mild. Body aches still. Temp 99.4 w/tylenol redosed at 1000.

Medical history was none.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient was calling to report that she got the COVID vaccine yesterday, and she wanted to put input in on the effects she experienced last night. She is a pharmacy transition specialist. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. A few hours after, she was really tired. She could have fallen asleep at her desk. Then, last night, her heart was like pounding but not beating fast if that makes since. Her heart rate wasn&#39;t up that much, but it felt like it was going to come out of her chest. She couldn&#39;t sleep because of it. She had a headache. She received the vaccine at 11:30. She is not as tired today. Yesterday, she could have just laid head back and went to sleep. The rest of the side effects started right after dinner. She couldn&#39;t sleep because she was anxious. Her heart rate is usually 60-65 bpm, but last night it was up to 75-80 bpm. It almost felt like her blood pressure was up. This happened right around after dinner.  The headache is hanging over into today. It could be still there because she didn&#39;t sleep. Her arm is sore still. It isn&#39;t serious. The handwriting was bad on her card so it was hard for her to read the lot number. The outcome of the event Headache, sore arm was not resolved, the outcome of the event really tired was resolving, the outcome of the event heart pounding was resolved in Dec2020, while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Approx 9 hours after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I began having uncontrollable chills, could not get warm, spiked a fever of 100.4, severe body aches, barely could not move.  It was all I could do to finish my shift at work, drive home, get in the shower, and pass out in bed to sleep.  I slept a good solid 10 hours, woke up for work...fever was then gone and chills, but I had a severe headache, still had severe body aches/fatigue, but I also lost my sense of taste and smell.  I ate a waffle which tasted like cardboard, drank cranberry juice (my mouth puckered like it was tart, but I could not taste it at all).  I reported to work but was immediately sent home by my employee health nurse to be seen by a health care provider and to be tested for COVID-19.  I went home and slept an additional 5 hours, did not do anything at home but rest, and slept a solid 12 hours straight that night.  Still could not smell and taste.  The following day, I could smell things like Vicks vapor rub and I could taste things minimally like when I initially bit into them, or on the back end if that makes sense.  Still had body aches and fatigue, but nothing like that previous day or the night before that.  I was then told that evening my PCR test was negative, and I could report to work the following day.  1/14/2021, I felt almost completely back to normal, and I could smell and taste.

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

Throbbing in temples, eye pressure, pressure on top of head, worsened when I would bend over. Did not take any medication, worried it would impact immune response. Drank a lot of water, slept, did some sled massage, and gentle yoga/stretches. By that evening pain level had dropped down to about a 4. Woke up the next morning with 2-3 level pain, was able to go to work without being distracted by pain. Still felt more pressure behind eyes and top of head when I bent over. Next day all symptoms resolved, except very minor tenderness at injection site only when palpated.

My temperature  was 102, then  my fever rose to 104.5 for most of the night. I did not sleep because my body was shaking and shivering. My body ached all over, especially my lower back. It felt like a very bad flu. My fever continued onto the next day and stayed around 103.7. I slept most of the day- had to call out of work. Tuesday morning my fever was gone and I went to work then went home because my fever spiked again to 101 about mid day. I slept all day and took Tylenol. By Wednesday my Fever was gone but I was still very lethargic. Thursday I felt fine.

A 33-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 02Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the COVID vaccine a couple hours ago on 02Feb202 and was very lightheaded. When the patient was asked to provide her mailing address, she stated she was feeling really weird, the vaccine was really taking a big toll on her brain function, she was super dizzy and feels just weird, like everything is in slow motion. Lightheadedness started probably about 20 minutes after she had the shot, they made her wait for 15 minutes, now she just feels really weird. The patient was healthy, she just got blood tests back and everything said she is healthy. She thought they said to call if she was having a side effect of dizziness or weakness, as they are more serious, but she called her doctor and they said to call Pfizer. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: unknown results on unspecified date.

She then started to feel as if her throat was itchy and started coughing uncontrollably.  Denied lip or tongue swelling.  Was feeling normal prior to receiving the vaccine.  Was not recently seen/assessed for other medical care.  No similar symptoms previously.  Patient was taken to the Emergency Department.   Ptaient did have a few red splotches on her chest, but these did not appear consistent with urticaria per the ED physician&#39;s report.  ED physician felt patient&#39;s symptoms may be secondary to anxiety.  However, given history of anaphylaxis and feeling of throat itching it was felt necessary to treat for possible allergic reaction.  Patient was given epinephrine, Benadryl, famotidine, and Solu-Medrol.  She was then monitored in the ED for 4 hours.  During this time, she developed no new symptoms.  She continued to breathe easily with normal and stable vital signs.  She was discharged with instructions  to buy OTC Benadryl 25mg PO to take every 8 hours for 48 hours.  Prednisone 20mg, 3 tablets orally daily for 5 days weas prescribed.  An EpiPen was also prescribed.  Patient advised not to receive second dose of the vaccine and to follow up with her primary care provider.

A 33-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264 and Expiration Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 17:45 at 33-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; with no other vaccines administered within four weeks of the bnt162b2 administration.  Medical history included anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to 16Feb2021.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: Bell&#39;s palsy on left side of face (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, vision has been off/ vision is blurry (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, numbness and tingly/burning sensation in right leg (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, brain fog (medically significant) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which required a physician office visit. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, she began having symptoms on the following Saturday and was seen by her doctor and diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. The patient stated she has reported this via VSafe and the Pfizer website. The patient also reported other symptoms that have not been reported as follows: had tingling in both legs, brain fog, and vision has been off. The patient was not sure if it was related to the vaccine or steroids. The patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose. The patient had been on a steroid, so she did not know if she should wait to get the second dose. The patient just stopped the steroid on 16Feb2021, and the second dose was scheduled for 23Feb2021.  The patient also said she had other symptoms that she had not reported and she said she had tingling that started in one leg now in both legs, brain fog and her vision was off and she was not sure if that was related to the vaccine or the steroid (later clarified as prednisone). The patient was not taking the steroids at the time of diagnosis. &#34;Correct I mean it started after the vaccine, but I was also on medication (Clarified as Prednisone) so I am not really sure what the difference is at this time.&#34; Treatment in response to event: the patient stated, &#34;No I mean for the tingling in my leg I have been just putting heat and Ice on it but I have not done anything actual big treatment and then for my eyes no, my doctor is not sure what is related to the Bell&#39;s Palsy and what is to medication.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work: unknown result on an unspecified date (patient stated, &#34;Yes, I have many&#34;).  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of facial paralysis, hypoaesthesia, burning sensation, and paraesthesia; which included steroids and anti-viral and anti-nausea medicine. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination.

                                                On Tuesday 12/28 I started to have severe leg pain in my right leg.  The next morning the pain was still in the right leg and had moved up through my right side in my joints to my knee, hip then went to the with shoulder down that arm.  My forearm became very painful on 12/30 and started to swell then radiated into my wrist joint and finger joints.  12/31 the pain continued in all those areas and had moved to my left side of my body starting with the left arm following the same course as the right side.  On 1/1 the pain has persisted and I am unable to perform any ADL&#39;s.  I saw an urgent care physician who told me to take ibuprofen.  I have been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol with no relief. Now all my joints are swelling in bilateral hands, wrist.  On 1/2 my bilateral ankle joints and feet started to have similar pain.  Know all my extremities are difficult to use and it is hard to walk due to the pain.  Because of the pain in my hands things feel heavier than what they should.  I am a medical provider and this almost seems like polyarthralgia rheumatica, I am going to go see a physician on Monday

On evening of 12/29 had sudden onset of mild neck pain and significant weakness and numbness of left arm, weak hand grip, clumsiness in hand . Did not improve after trying to shake arm/move around , and took prednisone 40mg oral. Went to ER and had CT Cspine which did not show evidence of cervical pathology. Continued with corticosteroids, sought consultation with PMR and neurology specialists, and steroid dose increased to 60mg/day.   Some improvement in strength , but still have diminished sensation and strength in left hand/arm. Unable to perform full job tasks as I am left hand dominant.  Likely brachial neuritis / parsonage turner syndrome per both specialists seen. Continuing with corticosteroids at this time, pending bloodwork and OT evaluation

It lasted until about 24 hours after the vaccine. Over the last week, I?ve had horrible insomnia, waking up multiple times throughout the night with difficulty falling back asleep. I didn?t think much of it other than it?s very unlike me until a handful of other coworkers vaccinated around the same have also been experiencing this.

This 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 15:15 at single dose on left arm for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies to hepatitis B vaccine rhbsag (HEY B VACCINE) booster and poison ivy. Concomitant medication included biotin / calcium pantothenate / cyanocobalamin / folic acid / nicotinamide / pyridoxine hydrochloride / riboflavin / thiamine mononitrate (B COMPLEX), fexofenadine, ascorbic acid (VIT C) and Multivitamin. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Immediately after shot (29Dec2020 15:15), her tongue and lips tingled but it went away quickly. She was walking for a short distance and felt &#34;off.&#34; The patient checked her pulse and pulse ox and her heart rate (HR) was 180. Her HR had bounced around from 150-180 with minimal exertion and was in the 90s at rest. No treatment received for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The outcome of not recovered. The events were non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

Later that morning 6:30am, I developed severe fatigue, dizziness upon standing and walking,  a L sided headache, L sided arm pain extending from elbow to sternocleidomastoid muscles on the L side, and axillary lymphadenopathy in the same arm as the vaccine (left). I took 650mg of Tylenol and went to work. Walking at a normal pace, my heart rate was 145. At rest inside the hospital it was in the 110s (measured by watch). the headache lasted all day on 1/9 and 1/10 and my neck felt slightly stiff (it was difficult to turn my head to look at traffic behind while driving). I took additional doses of Tylenol on 1/9 and 1/10 and by the AM of 1/11, all of my symptoms had resolved except for the L axillary lymphadenopathy.

                                                I started experiencing soreness to left arm about 1-2 hours after injection but nothing else. I went to bed around 11pm. Then I was woken up in the night around 3am violently shaking, teeth shattering and unable to even stand straight from shaking so bad. I felt like I was freezing but skin was hot to touch. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take temperature at that time because it was in another family member&#39;s room. I felt nauseated as well. I took 600mg ibuprofen and tried to lay back down. At 3:59am my aunt woke and brought the thermometer downstairs. I could tell the ibuprofen was working some and fever was less as the shaking had calmed. I was able to check my temperature and it was 100.8F (an hour after the ibuprofen). I still took 100mg tylenol at that time.  As of this morning (after 7am) I am sore all over, tired and have a headache, temp 99.2F.

By 9am I started to feel muscle aches and sharp joint pain, as expected. By 1200 noon, the pain intensity was increasing, coming in waves, lasting 10-15 minutes. The pain waves were 10/10, very severe, and was causing me to shake, cry, and be unable to function or sleep. I was also very disoriented, but I think due to the pain. It was mildly relieved with ibuprofen/Tylenol alternating every 3hrs, but continued until 6pm. It began to subside at 6pm.  I am an RN, and sought the advice of my employee health nurse, who advised me to seek medical care if it continued through the night. The pain began to subside, so I did not. However, if a  non-healthcare person experiences that, they will think they are dying.

Felt as if I was intoxicated, lasted the whole day. Woke up the next morning and still felt &#34;out of it&#34; and weak but thought it would get better, went to work (im a nurse). Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

                                                About 15 min I felt numbness and tingling on my face. Gradually  felt it in my whole body by 8:30PM that night, next day I tried to go to work but I had to leave because of the intense numbness and tingling. I also developed left leg weakness and had to even pick up my leg to be able to walk. The NP at my neurologist office (talked over the phone) said it was a pseudo effect due to my MS. My symptoms are still intermittent up to my second dose.  It is all over the numbness and tingling, but as it is subsiding it is now flaring up my symptoms from 2 years ago and I feel it on my second side.

Developed low grade temp, flushed face, fatigue, muscle stiffness, body aches hours following vaccine. Aches and fatigue continues and it?s now day 8. The fatigue is constant but comes in waves. I?m taking unexpected naps which are abnormal for me. Caffeine and methylphenidate are ineffective. I?m still sore. I also have brain fog, maybe from the fatigue. I can?t think straight and it takes me longer to process and do tasks. I woke up 2 hours ago and I can?t wait to sleep again.

Starting Tuesday morning, for three days, I got calf/feet cramps that were non-stop. I did call my doctor and got lab work done on 12-31. This lab work showed some kidney values that were off. Starting Sunday my legs and feet swelled up. I had a routine MS appointment on Monday and they stated since there is no data for folks with MS and the vaccine that they cannot rule out the vaccine is playing a role in some of this along with the IVIG.  I did follow up with my primary care doctor on Tuesday and they re did lab work as well as did a ultrasound to rule out blood clots. She did state she felt like it was the perfect storm between the COVID vaccine and then the Immunoglobins that I am on.  She suggested I download the app for CDC and report those items as well.  The doctors are still suggesting I get the 2nd shot just have to do some things prior to the second shot.

                                                About 40 minutes after my vaccine, I felt sudden onset progressive weakness of my entire left arm with spasms/fasciculations of my forearm and hand  (while driving from hospital where I work as a physician to where I live). I pulled over, felt a bit dazed and was unable to use my left hand purposefully to call 911 on my cell phone, but was able to call 911 on my Watch using my right (dominant) hand. While talking to the dispatcher, my symptoms resolved (total duration a few minutes)  so I requested that they not send an ambulance but instead felt well enough to drive to my hospital ED. I discussed my case with the triage RN and ED attending who felt my symptoms were related to the vaccine, with no further work up needed, given then my symptoms resolved. My vitals were stable in triage.  No chest pain or shortness of breath, with normal neurological function and sensation of my left arm.  Note: I was not officially checked in or seen as a patient.     Sudden onset weakness and spasms of left arm (side of vaccine administration) about 40 minutes after vaccine

This was approx 16 hours post dose. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and felt more able to do normal home activities but still tired with a sore arm. 4.5 hours post ibuprofen dose I again had muscle aches, headache, fatigue, and nausea. I also had chills and joint pain. I napped for an hour, took another 600mg ibuprofen, and then napped for another 2.5 hours. After that I felt better at 27 hours post dose but still achy and fatigued. These symptoms had mostly resolved by 31 hours post dose.

                                                I received my second vaccine on Friday 1/8. I felt fine until that evening and then experienced the typical side effects that I had read about. Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Axillary lymph node is larger than a marble currently.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP with the above complaints who referred me to employee health.

                                                After vaccination I felt diaphoretic and dizzy. After waiting in the monitoring area for 45 minutes I drank some water and felt like my bilateral upper thighs were difficult to lift when I tried to walk to my car. I went home and was tachycardic 120-130bpm that continued throughout the night to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep my heart was pounding so hard and fast. I was extremely thirsty and dehydrated all night.  I continued to have tachycardia for several days despite hydrating. My thighs also continued to feel week for several weeks. I developed a 100.7 F temperature and had flu like symptoms the following days.

                                                Positive COVID-19 test with symptoms; Positive COVID-19 test with symptoms; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program, from a contactable nurse (patient). A 35-year-old female patient (weight 55.79 kg, height 160 cm) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EK5730) intramuscularly, in the left deltoid, at single dose, on 23Dec2020 at 12:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were none. On 25Dec2020, the patient felt extremely tired (fatigue). On 28Dec2020, the patient had headache and minor cough noticed. On 29Dec2020, the patient experienced back pain and she said that it felt like sunburn soreness more than anything else. She said that she literally slept 3 days in a row (29Dec2020, 30Dec2020, and 31Dec2020).  On 31Dec2020, the patient lost her sense of smell and developed dizziness. On 01Jan2021, the patient experienced nausea and lost her sense of taste. COVID-19 virus test was found positive on 01Jan2021.The patient recovered from back pain, sunburn and sleepy on 31Dec2020, recovered from tiredness on 01Jan2021, recovered from nausea and dizziness on 06Jan2021. Clinical outcome of the events, smell loss, cough, headache, and loss of taste was recovering. Final clinical outcome of positive COVID-19 test with symptoms was unknown at time of this report. The case was assessed as serious (medically significant). She is scheduled to get 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) on 13Jan2021 and is wanting to know if she is supposed to get it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

Shortly after getting out of the shower I became weak, ears started blocking, and started to have tunnel vision. Progressively got worse and was able to sit with head between legs. Took about 1 minute before I didn&#39;t feel like I was going to pass out. Shaky and weak after. Pulse 78 and oxygen level ok. Completed virtual visit and no further medical treatment advised unless symptoms got worse, but advised it was likely a vaccine reaction.  Shortly after a bad headache and body aches developed (expected side effects).

She has numbness and loss of sensation in whole left side of body, limp and sluggish.  Went to ER 01/18/20 and they thought was overload of immune system.  They suggested her to report.  Symptoms did not subside until 01/22/21, gradually the feeling came back, with rest.  She was off work the last week to rest up.

Currently in inpatient acute rehab to re learn how to walk. Sharp painful neuropathy ongoing.

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

                                                Within 10 minutes I was numb with a hot, tingly sensation from my left knee up to my neck and my left wrist up my arm to my neck. Then I felt like I had been hit in the head with a bat, but the pain migrated from side to side in my head. It was a very strange feeling. The hot, tingly numbness lasted about 45 minutes to an hour, the headache began to subside after 2 hours. The next day I had a little raised redness and the injection site and a bad headache, but was otherwise fine. At the vaccination site they strongly advised I go to the ER, which I did. I have no history of vaccine reaction.

By 24 hours post-vaccine, I developed a fever of 100.8, a headache, and swollen lymph nodes.  By 36 hours, my fever broke, diarrhea discontinued, and the headache subsided.  The body aches, nausea, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes continue to inhibit my ability to perform ADLs and I was unable to work today.

                                                Sunday started with severe headache and continued with mild body aches and feeling of just being tired but didn&#39;t change my day much. Woke Monday morning at 4am to get ready for the work and the room was spinning. Off and on for the next 4 or so hours my blood pressure dropped and I had to lay back down. Even laying down had the room spinning. It has not been consistent and has improved as the day has gone but has yet to go away.

                                                I have learned that it was syncope. I felt like time was moving quickly. I was jittery and felt like my heart was beating quickly. I was taken to a separate area and felt warm and flush in my chest. They laid me down on the cot and said I looked pale. My hands were cold and within minutes I was shaking uncontrollably. I think it was an anxiety related to my research I&#39;ve done at my job related to COVID. I don&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction, but I do have an appt on Thursday. I was monitored for about an hour. Symptoms went away but I wasn&#39;t totally ok until the next day besides soreness in next arm.

                                                I worked the night of 18th and 19th (night shift nurse) -  night of 18th  - arm very sore (dominant arm where shot was taken) by end of night arm was sore; continued for several days. (Got my period either the night of 18th or morning of 19th). About 36 hours after vaccine; stood up to attend an alarm and felt very ill at patient&#39;s bedside and had to sit down: nauseous (felt similar to co-vid) - took Motrin an hour later; the day of 20th - slept all day; 21st - no appetite; mild headache - nauseous - period at same time of vaccine; 22nd - felt bleh; didn&#39;t eat much food - period going away but I  was feeling worse; feel like I have the return of internal vibrations (can sit in my hands when I&#39;m trying to do something for a patient that needs done quickly)  back in July when I had Co-Vid (when I was out of work out of month - and had to see a cardiologist - two months until normal (neural and cardiac symptoms that went away with time) - so was returning of buzzing/etc. 23rd: could feel like I had internal vibrations sensations; nauseous - increased - got a refill from an old dental prescription - started Zofran; headache pressure (head pressure); a vertigo-ish feeling - felt like I just walked off a boat; at that point - called out of work - COVID hotline hospital call - did a rapid test that was negative (on 24th) and on 24th: had still all the same symptoms - nausea was worse and felt a bit more dizzy occasionally and called out of work again but could take care of myself (laid around) - &#34; it felt like baby covid&#34; 25th - work wanted me to get tested again; 26th - Panther Co-vid test - which was also negative. 27th and 28th - dizziness better; still taking Zofran one time /day (for nausea); was able to go to work on 29th - still had some nausea but didn&#39;t have to lie down all day anymore - still had internal vibrations - feels like I should be having a tremor but can&#39;t see it externally; 30th finally able to see primary care Dr and she ordered lab work: Dr wasn&#39;t certain it was an adverse effect vs. me feeling my own immune response to spike protein; Initial covid symptoms in July were similar to this; and she will see how things go; SED Rate was 1 so not concerning; CBC was fine and B12 was fine. Not much as changed since then: returned to work; can go about things in every day; stopped taking Zofran on 31st; I still had nausea but it was mild enough that I didn&#39;t need to take it and Dr said it would be best to stop due to it&#39;s on effects. Yesterday, was first day with no nausea (1/4/2021); still have internal vibrations sensation but it has gone down quite a bit - now more of a mild buzzing electric current sensation - like insides are buzzing super fast ; when I noticed when not occupied with other things which is how it faded out with original illness.

This has continued every night.  I am unable to fall asleep despite being exhausted.  Once asleep I am waking up  within an hour and a half to two hours and not able to go back to sleep.  Over the past 5 nights I have averaged 2 hours a sleep night and no day time naps.

Felt slightly light-headed. Drank water and ate some food to closely monitor.  Very sore Left deltoid starting about 8 PM on 12/31/20 (same day as the vaccine administration).  It was so sore that it woke me up a few times at night and 1/1/21 I had to take Ibuprofen 400 mg to alleviate the pain. Had a dull headache all day 1/1/21 and very tired. Slept that night from 9 pm - 8 am next day.  No symptoms since 1/3/21.

                                                - Almost immediate onset of nausea, sore throat, headache, and sensation of fast heart rate; along with feelings of mild illness (like a cold) and arm pain which is consistent with other vaccination response.   - Waited at clinic for 30 minutes as directed due to previous history of anaphylaxis to injected meds (among others). Reported feeling poorly to nurse monitoring people waiting at 30 minute mark, who encouraged waiting longer but did no further assessment. Waited another 15 minutes with no resolution or improvement. Decided to leave and monitoring staff said they could not keep patients if they wanted to leave.   - Approximately 15 minutes later (1hr after injection), took one 25mg Benadryl liquid gel as nausea/headache/fast heart rate were consistent with prior allergic reaction and not with prior vaccine response. Those symptoms resolved after 1-2 hours; the feeling of mild illness lingered for approx. 3 days more.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL1284, expiry date not provided) on 23Dec2020 09:15 intramuscularly in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as preventive). There was no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The nurse (patient) received her first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at the hospital that she worked at. She was kept there for 15 min for monitoring and she felt fine. About 30 minutes post vaccination she got a hot flash, a flush over her face, she does not know if she was red but she felt flush. Her tongue felt strange, nothing swelled that she could tell, it felt hard to swallow, to make the motion to swallow it felt kind of sluggish. She felt weird swallowing which lasted for only a few minutes. She never struggled to breathe. She went back to park in the hospital parking lot since she was not sure if she was experiencing a anaphylactic reaction and then after a few minutes it went away. Her arm was sore and heavy feeling for that day. She had drowsiness for a couple of hours and pain and redness at the injection site for a couple of days that was not bothersome, it was mild. No relevant test. She wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine due to the symptoms she had after the first dose. The pain and redness at injection site was resolved on an unspecified date in Dec2020, while the other events were resolved on 23Dec2020.  The reporting nurse considered the events hot flash, flush all over her face, arm was sore and heavy, drowsiness, pain and redness at injection site were non-serious, while the events &#34;tongue felt strange, it was sluggish to swallow&#34; were serious that she drove back to the hospital (no emergency room/phycian office visit). She considered the events were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162Bw on the reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 from Mar2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced body aches, dry mouth, can&#39;t sleep, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and pain at the injection site, temp was 38.1 Celsius, head feels weird in Jan2021. The patient got her first dose and was looking online to see the symptoms. She said that she saw that during the trials, people were experiencing the symptoms she was experiencing after the second dose and she was concerned. She said that she wanted to make sure her symptoms are ok and to make sure that the symptoms are not just caused from the booster, but also from the first dose. The caller said that her mom told her that someone died from the Pfizer vaccine. No further details provided. The patient was having body aches, could not sleep, her mouth is really dry, her temp was 38.1 Celsius, her head feels weird, she has generalized weakness, pain at the injection site, and decreased appetite. She said that it was like having Covid again. She said that she had Covid back in Mar2020. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 38.1 centigrade.  The outcome of all the events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the suspected COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

Horrible headache that did improve with tylenol and ibuprofen taken at the same time. Body shakes and can&#39;t control body temperature.  Felt freezing cold but skin was very hot to the touch (according to my husband). Then, I started sweating and felt really hot and couldn&#39;t cool down.  Felt nauseous but no vomiting.    Could not sleep but felt very tired.  Today is now 48 hours after vaccine and body aches are gone but I am still extremely fatigued.

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine (approximately 17 hours post-dose), I got up to use the restroom.  While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

I got tachycardia (I tend to have a rapid hart beat but this was pumping pretty good). I also had some GI distress (watery diarrhea) and that lasted for a while. Later I got really weak and shaky, fatigued, that night I woke up with night sweats, and chills, woke up completely drenched, I had to change the sheets and pajamas. 5 days after the vaccine I was really exhausted, the fatigue was awful. There was also an itching sensation but no hives.

This has continued and worsened - I have constant &#34;pins and needles&#34; sensations in both feet and it is extending up to my knees. It&#39;s also in both hands and extending up my arms. Last night it was up to elbows, now it&#39;s going above my elbows. It doesn&#39;t go away. I was unable to sleep well because of the sensations. I&#39;m also starting to feel tingling in my back and shoulders. I called my doctor and he said to fill out this form and report the ER if my symptoms don&#39;t improve over the weekend.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021, lot# EJ1685), intramuscularly in left arm on 31Dec2020 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID Prevention.  Medical history included ongoing Hypertension/high blood pressure (Diagnosed about 2 years ago).  Concomitant medication included ongoing ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) and just some other vitamins but she does not think that is relevant. She had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine.  The patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy, weakness/felt very weak, hard for her to talk/was having a hard time talking, like she had to put effort into talking, thought that she would pass out, all on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 31Dec2020, tired and sore on 02Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 04Jan2021. The patient got the vaccine on 31Dec2020, and is scheduled to receive the 2nd dose next week and within a couple minutes after getting the vaccine, like less than 5 minutes later, she felt dizzy and very weak, and thought that she would pass out, and she was having a hard time talking, like she had to put effort into talking. After like an hour, she felt better. From then on, she had no side effects besides just being tired and sore, but she had no fever or anything like that. She does have hypertension in her history, but she hasn&#39;t been taking her pill because her BP has been stable. She felt like when she took the Pfizer Vaccine, some people can feel their BP shooting up, like it felt like a sensation in the back of head that her BP went up, but she did not think it was her BP because she has not needed to take her pill because her BP has been good. She did not take her BP, so she doesn&#39;t know what her BP was at the time. It was a pressure in the back of her like how she feels if her blood pressure is elevated. Investigation Assessment: No. Relatedness of drug to all the events was related per source of assessment: primary source reporter, method of assessment: global introspection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the event depressed level of consciousness is possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

She screamed.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

Very weak - if that was a 10th of what COVID felt like, I didn&#39;t want it! Those symptoms lasted about three to five days. By the5th day - I was mostly back to myself. I took Motrin - which helped slightly for headache.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

                                                Parasthesias began in my lower extremities intermittently about 36 hours following administration. These spread to my upper extremities and became consistent. Occasionally will appear in lips and trunk. These are associated with sensation of numbness and some discomfort in my extremities. I&#39;m also experiencing significant brain fog, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Headaches are occurring about every other day.  Symptoms are present currently and have remained relatively consistent in severity.  Was evaluated by urgent care on December 28 and encouraged to observe. Was evaluated in the ER by neurology on January 4. There leading hypothesis is vaccine related immune response. Neurologic exam was largely normal, being evaluated by a specialist in the coming days.

Causality cannot be completely excluded.

I took tylenol and motrin twice during the 12 hour shift at the scheduled times. I was working night shift when this happen and came home and went to bed 24 hours after receiving the vaccine. The time I went to bed had fatigue, headache, body aches with neck and back pain. Took tylenol and motrin before going to sleep. When I woke up at 4pm, 31 hours after receiving the vaccine I had, sore throat, head congestion, severe body aches and headache. I attempted to get up since I was scheduled to work at 7pm and then got dizzy. I took tylenol and motrin, put a heating pad on my back, drank some hot tea and went back to bed for the night. Woke up at 7:30am almost 2 days after receiving the vaccine still with headache, body aches and fatigue. The sore throat and head congestion seem to have subsided. Took more tylenol and motrin and went back to bed. Still at this time feel just tired and body aches, mostly in the neck and back.

At 2300,  I started to have fever/chills, up to 39 C orally. This only partially responded to Tylenol. I was not able to sleep.  At 2:30 am I noticed an unusual headache, 8/10, as well as bilateral eye pain on Moving eyes side to side as well as sensitivity to light. Headache was mostly frontal, which came and went every few minutes  until exactly 11:38 am on 1/14/2021, when the fever and myalgias very suddenly got significantly better. Almost exactly 24 hrs to the minute after injection. On 1/15/2021, I still have significant pain in my left arm, swelling, redness and, now, itching at the injection site. My lower back still hurts.

                                                Within 2 minutes post vaccination i started feeling loss of sense of myself. I could not pinpoint if i felt dizzy or vertiginous. Felt like i was off balance and i was super vernous to walk. Vertiginous episodes come and go with peaks for at least 10 times. The whole episode lasted 4 hours until i felt going back to myself.   I was provided water, 1 L and orange juice, there was epi available. No anaphylactic symptoms, no shortness of breath.   I drank 1,5 L of fluids and then my BP was checked 120/80, HR 80s.  I note that i never felt syncopal,  no diaphoresis, nausea, nor darkened vision and i was fully interactive with the bystanders.  Note, i am a critical care intensivist so i had full grasp of the issue but i could now quite describe the sensation of this acute loss of instability. The best way to describe this was vertigo. Similar episode occured at the first vaccine with COVID, occured after 10 minutes and lasted no more than 30 seconds. I didnt report that then because i thought it was just dehydration.

A 37-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Ek5730), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 28Dec2020 12:00PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at hospital facility. Medical history included Hashimotos disease. The patient had no known allergies and has not had COVID prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she felt tired and confused and unwell on day of injection, 28Dec2020. After three days (31Dec2020), she developed hives on her stomach and arm and seven days later (04Jan2021), she was diagnosed with pneumonia and continued to have hives all over her legs and arms to this day. The patient was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She underwent Covid test/ Nasal swab post vaccination on 09Jan2021, pending result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported pneumonia was more likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                This is a 37 y.o. woman who developed an episode of acute self-limited hemolysis just over a week following her second injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine immediately prior to the episode for a urinary tract infection.  She had no history of hemolysis prior to this episode.  She was in her usual state of health and received COVID-19 vaccines on 12/24 and 1/14 with the Pfizer vaccine and had no serious side effects at that time.  She then developed dysuria and was seen by telehleath by her primary care physician who prescribed ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine for her for 3 days ending 1/22.  She took these and her dysuria resolved, however the day after developed what appeared to be blood in her urine.  Then in the following 2 days which were a weekend this worsened and she started feeling poorly.  She also noted that she appeared yellow.  On Monday 1/25 her boyfriend took her to urgent care and she was subsequently sent to an ER at the hospital that referred her to our hospital.  There she was evaluated for gross hematuria with no evidence of urinary bleeding and found to be anemic due to hemolysis.  Her hemoglobin was in the 5&#39;s and she received 2 units of PRBCs.  She was transferred here to Medical Center for further management.  After the initial transfusion she did not require blood transfusion and her hemoglobin continued to increase until it was 10.4 on 2/1 which was the day of discharge.  At a follow up appointment on 2/8/2021 she was recovering and feeling well.   Her jaundice had resolved.   No treatment was given from the hemolysis aside from the blood transfusion and it was self-limited.  It is most likely that her acute hemolysis was due to the phenazopyridine as this agent is known to cause hemolysis and she took it for 3 days prior to the onset of hemolysis.  She has no prior history of drug induced hemolysis and had not taken this medication previously.  As this occurred just over a week following her second vaccination I cannot exclude that is could be related to the vaccine.

I never passed out but I felt those waves with a tingling to my face and my neck as I was going to pass out and I started shaking and my heart was racing and my BP was up and it lasted about 45 min before it started going down.  They gave me some Ibuprofen at the Employee health and they kept observing me and it started getting better after 45 min. I still felt the waves of feeling flush and hot and cold and very fatigued.

A contactable 38-year-old female Nurse (patient)  reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021) at single dose since 22Dec2020.  Relevant history and concomitant drug was none. The patient excepted Covid 19 vaccine could decrease the chance of contacting Covid 19 virus, while she stated she was getting a red patchy hives and itchy waves of red rashes all over the body just after received the vaccine. The patient (nurse) stated, &#34;I would if I can explain a little more, the day after I received the Covid vaccine I had noticed a big like what I would explain it like a red hives, like a raised red rash on my left hip it last like a day its subsided and next morning I woke up and I had a different flares that was the same on my other side of my body again went away. After a day when I woke up and I had two new spot on my knee that was the other thing, those went away on that day. This morning I woke up and I had another one on my shoulder and on my lower back. I am also thinking I am getting one may be on my ear like I said they pop up and they itch a little and they go away. I never ever experienced anything like it and I see the only thing that I have changed in my life or regimen or added to my body so I just wanted to make sure it was reported. I am nervous and curious if it is a potential side effect added if I should be careful before getting second one all those things.&#34;  No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of events was unknown. When probed for the Causality, the nurse stated, &#34;I have no idea, if it is something going on with me that is completely unrelated its just occurred right after I got the vaccine so I have no idea if this is a separate issue or not. I going to see dermatologist and physician but until then I just thought to report it to you all to see if anybody is experiencing this and to know if it is safe to go for second dose.&#34;

                                                I felt weak and with muscle fatigue the day after the shot. Also had a headache and neck muscle tension and mid back muscle tension. Joint pains as well. These subsided after 48 hours except for the neck and upper back muscle fatigue and mild soreness. This gave me a low grade headaches almost daily since the vaccine. I took ibuprofen a few times which helped. On the 6th I awoke at night and felt weak all over. I felt like I was falling in my bed. Mild dizziness.  I went to work and felt extremely fatigued with muscle weakness but no neuro deficits. I feared some terrible autoimmune illness and took Decadron that day- 4mg tab BID. This helped my muscle weakness but left me with insomnia. The decadron is now wearing off after 4 days and I still have muscle weakness/fatigue. It takes considerable effort walking up the stairs. Yesterday my masseter muscles became fatigued with little chewing. My arms feel heavy when I lift them. The strange thing is that at night when I lie down I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is being triggered. I will get palpitations and feel just strange- I can&#39;t describe it.  I took valium to sleep last night -5 mg tablets that my doctor gave me Saturday as there seems to be an anxiety panic component going on. I have no history of diagnosed anxiety or panic attacks- I have never felt this way before. Today I feel a little better but still have considerable muscle fatigue and neck and upper back muscle soreness and overall muscle tightness in my arms and legs- feels good to stretch kind of feeling. I have mild dizziness when standing up and turning too abruptly. But no considerable focal neuro deficits.

Experienced difficulty sleeping the rest of the night due to symptoms and restlessness. Following day, I continued to have fever averaging 100 degrees F, body aches, chills and headache that brought me to tears. That evening, began experiencing severe nausea and involuntary shaking. Reported to ER for management of symptoms. Received fluids, ibuprofen, Zofran and Reglan as well as potassium. It is currently the following Monday so 5 days post vaccine and I continue to have intermittent nausea and headache.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart began to race and I became very warm and sweaty. I was brought into another room for monitoring and my heart rate was above 100. After some breathing exercises, it came back down to the high 70s for a few minutes but then increased again into the 90s, at one point it was 113. My chest and throat then began to feel tight and I began sweating again. My face also felt funny on my right cheek. At that point I was first given 25 mg of benedryl then epinephrine. I was then taken to the emergency room via ambulance and was observed for approximately an hour. I was given an additional 25 mg of benedryl and discharged at 4:55pm. I was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and prescribed 25 mg of benedryl every 6 hours over the next 24 hours. The following morning, I experienced a hot flash with profuse sweating followed by chills. I was very tired and felt feverish throughout the day on 1/12 and stayed home from work. On 1/13 I still felt tired but was able to work. Today I feel mostly normal but still occasionally have had heart palpitations.

                                                When I got up at 0530 yesterday (1/19) my right arm was so sore I couldn&#39;t lift it. I got to work at 0700 and felt really drained and tired. I fell asleep without realizing it at some point and a coworker saw me and woke me up at 0930. I attended a lecture at 1000 and started feeling chills, aches, and was sweating. I tried to take notes but couldn&#39;t remember how to spell a lot of basic words and couldn&#39;t get my brain to focus.  My boss sent me home at 1145. I was driving home and when I got off the interstate I couldn&#39;t remember which way to turn at the light off the exit. I had to pull up a navigation app on my phone to remember how to get home.  When I got home I took my temperature and it was 98.5F. I slept for 3 hours, picked my kids up from school, and then slept for another 2 hours. I took my temperature at 1900 and it was 98.5F still. My chills and aches had lessened but not disappeared by the time I went to bed at 2100, but by the time my alarm went off at 0530 this morning I felt completely back to normal.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID). On 11Jan2021, within about 10 minutes of getting the vaccine she reported that her heart began to race and she became sweaty and uncomfortable. After another 5 minutes or so she began to have difficulty breathing as her chest and throat felt very tight and restricted. She also became lightheaded. Her heart rate was over 100, then dropped into the 70s, then shot back up over 100. Her face had a weird sensation as well. She was given Benadryl first and then epinephrine and had to go to the emergency room via ambulance for observation. She was released after an hour and had to take Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 24 hrs and diagnosed with an allergic reaction. On 12Jan2021,  she had a hot flash upon waking up and felt generally under the weather all day. Her arm was very sore at the injection site. She missed a day of work due to the whole ordeal. On 13Jan2021, she felt more normal but still have some tightness in her chest with a fluttering feeling. The outcome of event diagnosed with an allergic reaction was not recovered; for other events was recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known product safety profile, causality between event allergic reaction to vaccine and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 38-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 14Jan2021 15:30 to 14Jan2021 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing pernicious anaemia, a B12 deficiency diagnosed 2-3 years ago (she gave herself B12 shots and she cannot convert B12 through her food), and myomectomy (15 cm uterine fibroid, removed this past summer). Concomitant medication included ongoing cyanocobalamin (B12) for pernicious anemia. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 28Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and a flu shot (the MA gave it in the back of her arm, it was pretty significant). The patient was a nurse and informed that she received the second COVID vaccine the day before report (14Jan2021). She woke up on the day of report on 15Jan2021 03:00 with a nasty headache, she felt hot, had the creepy crawly shivers, was achy and when she talked, she felt like she had to close her eyes because of pressure, and she was nauseous. She figured this was probably normal but she couldn&#39;t get a hold of her doctor and the hospital she worked at did not know what to tell her. She was wondering if she can take Tylenol or ibuprofen and has even thought about drinking caffeine, that it might help her headache. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor as she got it at work. The first round of the vaccine she only had a super mild sore arm and a slight headache. She received the second vaccine at 3:30pm and then went to bed when she got home. She woke herself up at 3 am because her arm was hurting really bad. She started feeling like she couldn&#39;t keep her legs still. She felt hot, achy, and was shivering. She hasn&#39;t taken her temperature. When she woke up at 3 am she got on her phone, and her eyesight felt like she couldn&#39;t quite focus. It wasn&#39;t bad, but she felt like she was straining. Then her head started hurting at 5-7 am. She was very sensitive to light. She woke up and couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She had cold sweats, and was shivering. Every time she stood up, she was chattering. She felt achy almost like growing pains. She woke up with the arm pain, and then 10-15 minutes later, she started feeling that creepy crawly feeling. She got up and the cool fan hit her, and she realized how bad she was shivering. The shivering intensified at times but hasn&#39;t gotten worse. She had just called employee health and realized that when her eyes were open when she was talking was when she felt nauseated. She has noticed the nausea in the past half hour. She did not know if it was related to the headache or what. She had to cover her eyes, her eyeballs felt sore. When she talked with her eyes open, she felt a little queasy. She was just straining to see. Her vision was not blurry but she can tell she was straining. She did not know if it was because of the headache and nausea. When she got out of bed, the cold fan did not feel cold but it made her shiver. She was a nurse was trying to be socially responsible as she did not want to get COVID. She was a little suspicious because of the headache after the first one. She hasn&#39;t been around anyone in a couple of weeks and had been working from home. She has not been exposed to people. She kept feeling like she needed to stretch because she was sore. The patient was tested for COVID pre-surgery (myomectomy) and was negative. She was also tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any. She was vaccinated at a hospital facility. Patient received no other vaccines on that day. The adverse events did not require any visit to the emergency room or physician office. Patient did not receive prior vaccines in the previous 4 weeks. Outcome of the events cold sweat and &#34;tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any&#34; was unknown, nasty headache was reported as worsened (not recovered), and the remaining events was not recovered. The reporter considered the events serious due to medically significant events and related to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine in the development of the events cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                face started itching; throat was getting dry; face was starting too itch and be red; hives after second dose of vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other HCP reported for herself. This 38-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021 06:45 at single dose injected into left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from 2010. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT EJ1685, EXP 31Mar2021.) on 18Jan2021 at 04:00PM, injected into her right arm for COVID-19 immunisation, uses salbutamol (ALBUTEROL, NDC: 6699301968, LOT: VE7L, EXP: Nov2021) inhaler as needed for asthma and took inhaled steroids, but nothing recent. The patient got the second dose of the vaccine at 06:45AM, and the hives began on the 21Jan2021, she noticed them about 06:20AM and she had to be at work at 07:00AM. She said she treated that with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL, 25mg LOT: P120108. EXP May2022, UPC: 193968051518) because her face started itching and her throat was getting dry, so she took BENADRYL 25mg this morning about 06:40AM. She says she took one dose of this by mouth, because it seems to make her sleepy and she had to work. She says she got to work and started working, and her face was starting too itch and be red, and her throat was super dry, this was at 07:20AM, so she took prednisone (NDC: 20603-5338-31, LOT 8675217, EXP Dec2020) 60mg by mouth. She says this was expired, but she still took it, it is in a dose pack that has a box that says distributed by (Company name). She says she took Prednisone 60mg, one time today by mouth. She says she has asthma so she keeps a prescription of Prednisone at home that her doctor writes so she can have it, she says with asthma she keeps Prednisone around. She says she also applied equate Hydrocortisone cream 1% (LOT: 0JT0306, EXP Aug2022) that she got over the counter to the hives topically. She says that the label for that says underneath anti-itch it says intensive healing that it is mixed with vitamins, chamomile and Vitamins A, C, and E. Equate Hydrocortisone cream 1% UPC: Unknown, the tube has a barcode with no number, it did have a box that she did throw away. She thought hives was medically significant, but it is not getting worse, it is worrisome, but she is improving with the medicine she used for treatment. The outcome of hives was recovering. The outcome of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, contributory role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of reported events cannot be excluded.

Started out slowly late morning around 9am and got worse by the afternoon.  Took Motrin to relieve symptoms and slept.  The next day felt better but in the evening on 2/5/21 felt itchy starting from arms and neck.  Then after about 10 min of itchiness in that area and started itchiness down to my stomach and legs.  I took allergy medication prescribed by my physician: Cetirizine HCL 10mg tablet (1 tablet).  No issues after that. Had some issue with the itchiness from the first dose around the 3rd-5th day after the first vaccine was given.  Didn&#39;t take any allergy medications and had a tiny bit of dark circular spots on limps and torso but wasn&#39;t severe.  Thought that was from something I ate, or clothes detergent, etc. so shrugged it off.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I started to have a very mild headache. It felt like a pressure headache. I took Motrin. About 6 hours later that was gone. That night, about 8 hours after vaccine, I began to have muscle aches - whole body. I was very sore. I went to bed. Next day, I had severe joint and muscle aches and pains. The Motrin did not help that. Ice did not help, heat did not help and rest did not help. No headache. I wasn&#39;t red in face etc. Over the next week, I the muscle aches and joint aches were varying between moderate to severe. Some days it did restrict my activity completely. It started to get better week two - but still moderate to severe. I had some abdominal pain on upper left side and my right side (upper, as well) The upper right side pain would go away with ice but the upper left side wasn&#39;t helped with that. The only thing in those two weeks that helped was Celebrex (Motrin stopped helping). After two weeks - around 2/5/2021, I saw my Dr - a virtual visit. He told me to double up on the dose of Celebrex to help with muscle aches, joint aches and right side abdominal pain. Heart palpitations - irregular heartbeat. On 2/7/2021, I took a test for COVID and it was negative.  The joint and muscle aches were moderate to mild the third week. There was no more abdominal pain in third week. Week 4 - mild joint and muscle aches - only a few days that week and that was it. Last week was the first week where I had a few days that were fine. And this week, I have been completely fine. Had general malaise for three weeks solid. And now it&#39;s gone.

                                                2 hrs post injection sudden onset of severe dry mouth that lingered but gradually resolved. Still dry next morning and a couple hrs later it switched to increased salivation.  The evening after injection I had a headache and  just felt general malaise and fatigue, &#34;run down&#34;. Difficulty sleeping that night due to body aches. HEadache, neck and lower back pain. Skin sensitivity when touched, bed sheets kinda hurt my skin. The bodyaches and malaise persisted through out day 2. Tylenol seemed to help.  I slept better that night but woke up with night sweats, completely drenched.  Arm pain at injection site on day 2 that resolved by mid day.  Now 1 week later I have extreme fatigue yesterday and today. I do have hypersomnia but not even my adderall is helping. Not sure if this is related or not.

                                                I developed immediate flushing, sweating, rapid heartbeat (was around 110bpm, is normally around 75bpm), and lightheadedness.  I sat down and had a few sips of water.  Within a few minutes, I felt like I was having a difficult time getting a good breath in.   I raised my hands over my head and took slow deep breaths to try and keep my breathing  under control.  I stayed at the hospital for about 45 minutes, over which time I had a few bites to eat and some water.   The flushing and sweating resolved within that time.  The lightheadedness and &#34;feeling of doom&#34; lasted about 3 hours.  I had no anxiety going into this vaccine, nor have I had a reaction like this before.

Pain is in anterior shoulder and radiates down right arm. Pain is constant but worse with movement. Pain started the night that vaccine was given 1/2/2021 and has been persistent since then making it difficult to work. Pain not relieved with tylenol or ibuprofen. Pain is more severe that what would be expected from needle trauma. Of note, vaccine was given particularly high near subdeltoid bursa.

A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 24Dec2020 at 08:00 AM in the hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, has no known allergies, had no other medications in two weeks, and did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. At 3:00 PM of 24Dec2020, the patient developed a severe tachycardia with no other symptoms. She walked herself to the ER (Emergency room/department or urgent care), was nervous and kind of shaking. By the time they got to her, her heart rate was stable and was at 88. Transient tachycardia was at around 120-140 for 7 minutes and resolved with no intervention. Basic labs came back normal. She got discharged from the ER. The patient didn&#39;t think they reported it but she was willing to cooperate in any way. The patient was not treated for the adverse events. As per the patient, she reported her adverse reaction (after the 1st dose) on the website as recommended. She experienced &#34;very fast heart beat 8 hours after receiving the vaccine&#34;. The patient was inquiring if she would be contacted after. The patient also asked if the very fast heartbeat was related to the vaccine because the reaction did not happen right away like usual, she was not sure if it was an allergic reaction since it happened 8 hours later. Outcome of the event &#39;Tachycardia&#39; was recovered in Dec2020, while for the other events was unknown. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

I sat down, my heart rate was 110 on my I watch. I was breathing heavy and feeling sweaty. The healthcare providers had me lie down on a stretcher and gave me oxygen with my feet elevated. After about 20 minutes, I felt better. Later that day, I came home and slept for 2 hours. The next day, (today) I came home early from work because I feel very tired and having difficulty concentrating. But the other symptoms have gone away.

                                                I had a slight headache while at work but was fine. I was home and was a little cold and my throat was scratchy. . Then about 9pm all of a sudden I started to get waves of chills. My hand were cold and my feet were frozen. I layered up with sweater and sweatpants to go to bed with a heavy comforter. I just could not get warm. About 1am, I woke up and put on my thick winter socks on because my feet were still frozen. I kept reminding myself to breathe in deeply.  I checked my BPM and it was 80-82 and normally its about low  70s. I woke up about 5:30am and had a really bad headache, injection area and arm hurt, my  body hurt and felt like I weighed several tons making me so slow. I didn&#39;t go to work the next day. My husband took my son to school and I took ibuprofen and went back to bed. Woke up again about 12:30 and felt better.

At 36 hours, I was completely back to normal. I am currently 31 weeks. I was 29 when I received the vaccine.  Even with everything I experienced, I would do it again.

                                                Internal brain bleeding 10 days after 1st dose covid vaccine; Brain damage; confused; suffering memory loss; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician (patient). This 39-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 18Dec2020 14:30 at single dose (lot number: EJ1685) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. The patient experienced internal brain bleeding and brain damage on 30Dec2020 07:30 after 1st dose covid vaccine. Brain surgery received on 29Dec2020. Events were still recovering. Patient was confused and suffering memory loss on 30Dec2020 07:30. Events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Prolongation of existing hospitalization (vaccine received during existing hospitalization), Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. Days for hospitalization was 16. The patient received treatment for events as brain surgery due to internal brain bleeding. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination, no COVID tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported internal brain bleeding and brain damage with confused and memory loss more likely represented intercurrent disease, and less likely causally related to 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

My boss came to help walk me outside because I didn?t even feel like it was me walking. I don?t remember walking out of work.  I was there but ?not there?. I was not myself. I didn?t feel like i was in my body. I had to have my husband come get me from work, I slept most the rest of the day and night. Now I?m on day 2 and my joints still ache, my head hurts so bad, I am so tired I either am asleep on the couch or in bed. I have no energy. It takes everything I have to move just to go to the bathroom.
