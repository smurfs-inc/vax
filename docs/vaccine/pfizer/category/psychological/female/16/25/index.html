I was still experiencing chills despite also feeling hot at the same time.  After an hour, my temperature was 101şF.  I took 2 naproxen sodium tablets (440mg) to relieve fever.  Around 10:45am, my fever reduced but my body ache and headache stayed at the same pain level.  Around 2pm, I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen (400mg).  My headache stopped around 8:00pm.

The patient previously took first dose BNT162B2 on 21Dec2020 around noon, intramuscular injection in upper left arm for preventative (Lot: EJ1685). No other prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE following prior vaccinations. The patient got the second dose yesterday (reported on 12Jan2021) around noon and she was experiencing not so great side effects. The biggest thing was headaches that were pretty debilitating. She was experiencing confusion and muscle aches all over. Stated that all the side effects started around the same time around 9 pm last night. The patient reported that her fever was down a bit so she was a little bit more coherent.

A 20-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown ), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 at 10:30 AM (at the age of 20-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included allergy to eggs. Historical vaccination included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown ), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 10:30 AM (at the age of 20-years-old) in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The vaccine was administered in a hospital. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The reporter explained that the patient&#39;s adverse events &#34;started as expected&#34; with a  headache side effect (date not specified), however two days after the vaccine, while working as an EMT the patient became very dizzy and had to stop work. She remained dizzy, like vertigo, the next day but attempted to go to work. Her co-worker could see she wasn&#39;t right and took her to the hospital. The patient spent two days in the hospital, barely able to stand, getting a head MRI with contrast, evaluated for vertigo, blood tests, and they did not find anything and gave her vertigo medicine and sent her home. She has since had shifting symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, irregular heartbeat, severe upper back and neck pain. She has barely been able to move for several weeks and has seen an ENT doctor, another emergency doctor, and her regular doctor. None have found any other cause and have tried treating her with steroids. The events were treated with Meklazine and unspecified steroids. Lab data included SARS-CoV-2 test COVID 19 testing on 28Jan2021 which was negative. The clinical outcomes of headache, dizziness, vertigo, difficulty standing, swollen glands, irregular heart rate, back pain, neck pain and unable to more for several weeks were reported as not recovered.  The patient was tested for COIVD-19 after the vaccination, on 28Jan2021, and was found to be negative.

                                                Pt received Pfizer-COVID vaccine (under EUA) yesterday 16 Dec 2020 at approx 1700.  She did not have any immediate problems after vaccination.  .  She woke up today feeling achy and feverish, and measured her oral temp at 1000 as 101.4 at home.  She drank fluids, but took no meds -- repeat oral temp at 1200 was 99.0.  .  Other sxms include sore arm at vaccination site with min redness but no swelling.   .  She additionally reports nasal congestion and sore throat that began 1 day prior to vaccination, that she attributed to her seasonal allergies.  No meds for allergies.  No cough or SOB.  No headache or neuro sxms.  No GI sxms.  .  She was concerned about fever and went to drive-thru COVID testing at approx 1300... results due back in 24h.  She has no known COVID contacts.  .  She works in sterile processing at NMCSD with no direct patient contact usually; She is on night shift now.  -  Fever and achy symptoms, as above, in previously healthy hospital worker, with onset approx 18h after receipt of COVID-Pfizer vaccine, dose #1.  With questionable URI-like sxms one day prior to vaccination, COVID testing was very reasonable -- and results are pending now.  If COVID test negative, this most likely represents mild-moderate systemic reaction to vaccine.  Advised no work this evening, rest at home, increase clear fluids, and take Motrin 400mg q4-6h as needed for subjective fever or achiness -- use/precautions reviewed.  Will follow-up tomorrow with this team by phone.  If vaccine reaction, expect sxms to lessen rapidly and resolve over next 1-2 days.  Indications for urgent care -- including marked worsening of sxms or new sxms -- reviewed.  She also has number for 24/7 Immunization Support.  Will file VAERS, since work missed for sxms.  Will encourage enrollment in VSAFE as well.  Advised that, if mild-moderate systemic reaction determined most likely source of sxms, dose #2 of COVID-Pfizer vaccine will still generally be recommended.  Pt expresses understanding and appreciation of all issues.

                                                Immediately, I had increased  heart rate - 194 - I fainted to the ground. I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. This case is serious, the other one is non-serious.   A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EH9899) intramuscular at left deltoid on 22Dec2020 19:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccines given at the same time. The patient received a flu shot back between 27th or 28th Nov2020 in her left deltoid. Caller reported getting the COVID vaccine on the 22Dec2020 and feeling fine before that. On the 28Dec2020 she started feeling chills and not feeling very good and that hasn&#39;t gone away. The patient went and got a rapid COVID test and it came back positive, not sure if it was because of the vaccine having antigens in it or she came into contact with it or if she just weakened immune system from the shot. The patient wanted to know if that was true. Then stated she and her mom got the COVID vaccine and her mom received it on the 23Dec. On the 29Dec her whole family started to get sick and experiencing the same things she experienced. The patient was not feeling well at the time of the call. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : 2021001266 same reporter/ drug, different patient/event

This nurse reported similar events for 3 patients. This is the first of 3 reports.  A 23-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EK9231, intramuscular in the right deltoid, first dose on 27Dec2020 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma and reactive airway which she was diagnosed when she was like 5 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] for asthma which started when she was 8 years old or so. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of covid vaccine after experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction like rash, tightness in throat, and lump in throat. She wanted to know the ingredients and specific proteins in the covid vaccine. The patient received the COVID Vaccine and she developed a reaction. On 27Dec2020, she had a red rash on her chest, and her cheeks were flushed, and the rash was on her arms too, and she had a tightness and lump in her throat, it was not painful to swallow but she could feel the pressure with swallowing. She stated that she did not experience shortness of breath, but regardless, she was seen in the ER and she was given IV SOLUMEDROL, and BENADRYL, and she was watched for 5 or 6 hours and then she was sent home with an Epi Pen, around the clock Benadryl, and prednisone. She asked the ER doctors if they thought it was okay for her to receive the second dose of the product, and they told her to contact employee health for that question. She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did. Her primary care doctor instructed the caller to call Pfizer and gather some more information regarding ingredients, as the she may have had the reaction to a particular protein filler. She was also wondering if this is a known reaction to the product. She received the vaccine on 27Dec2020 at 2:15 PM. She reported that the red rash on her chest and arms, and her cheeks being flushed, resolved yesterday after receiving IV BENADRYL. Had a tightness and lump in her throat which was still ongoing, and it was kind of off and on and when the she takes Benadryl it goes away. She reported that this one is medically significant because even though she did not have shortness of breath, it could have affected her airway. She confirmed that she received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#39;had a tightness and lump in her throat&#39;, allergic reaction was not recovered (a s reported); while recovered on 27Dec2020 for allergic reaction like rash/red rash on her chest and rash was on her arms too and cheeks were flushed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events throat tightness, sensation of foreign body, allergy to vaccine, rash erythematous and flushing cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Dec2020 (at the age of 23-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: allergies to medications, food, or other products (unspecified). It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally. Some improvement was noted in hives; however, the patient began to state her tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; (both on 22Dec2020). Per doctor, 0.3 mg epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) given intramuscularly with rapid improvement in hives. The patient reported feeling some improvement as well. The patient was taken to the emergency department for ongoing observation. The patient was released from emergency department after observation. The clinical outcome of flushed, hives, tongue felt &#34;thick&#34;, and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events flushing, urticaria, tong disorder, sensation of foreign body are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

Then 12 Hours after vaccine my arm became VERY sore, took my ibuprofen and alternated with Acetaminophen.  Then my face became very flushed (I used ice packs) and I got a mild sore throat. That night I had difficulty sleeping. I kept waking up with terrible body aches. About 24 hours after the vaccine I just had fatigue, mild fever, and chills. I slept on and off throughout the day and then started to feel better. But at about 32 hours post vaccine I started to feel worse. My headache and sore arm came back and I became very light headed and dizzy.

I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient stated her hives began on the evening of 03Jan2021. She clarified she had hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable. She said she still had areas on her legs and ankles that were reddened. She said the reddened areas on her legs and ankles are not fully raised or itchy, like she had experienced with the hives on the rest of her body. The patient went to an urgent care on 06Jan2021. She saw a dermatologist for the hives on 07Jan2021, who suspected that since she did not have any prior history of hives, her hives are from the COVID-19 vaccine. She said the dermatologist told her there is no way to truly test if the vaccine caused her hives. The patient received an intramuscular unspecified steroid shot at the dermatologist and was prescribed methylprednisolone (MANUFACTURED BY: PAR PHARMACEUTICAL; Lot number: 1129091; Expiration date: Dec2021) 4 mg tablets in a taper dose pack. She also stated that she took the following over-the-counter medications: diphenhydramine hydrochloride (reported as: generic BENADRYL; MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN; Lot number: 0MR0456; Expiration date: Sep2022) 25 mg tablet, taken as needed; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC; Lot number: 1652346; Expiration Date: Dec2021) 10 mg tablet, taken as one tablet up to four times a day; and hydrocortisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) cream. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all of the events as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of broke out in hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable was recovering and of areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events.

Within minutes of receiving the dose on 20Jan2021 at 09:45 AM, dizziness, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, flushed, weakness, and shakiness. About an hour after receiving the dose on 20Jan2021, lethargy, chilled, in particular hands were very cold, pale color, mental fog, and slurred speech. The patient did not receive any treatment from events. The outcome of events was recovered in Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

                                                I am a third-year medical student. Since receiving the second dose of the COVID vaccine (Pfizer) on Tuesday 2/2, I have had persistent and worsening muscle spasms of the torso. I presented to the Emergency room on 2/6 due to worsening symptoms and was admitted until 2/7. The neurology team evaluated my condition was not able to make a firm diagnosis. They believe the vaccine has caused a dystonic reaction. I was given benadryl 25mg to continue for one week q6 hours prn. However, benadryl has provided minimal relief. They also strongly recommended that I be seen by a movement disorder specialist at hospital ASAP.  However, due to the fact that I have insurance I am not covered for care from hospital. My insurance said they will review the referral which will take another 5-7 business days from today 2/9. As a medical student, I have had to miss one week of clinic rotations and will continue to miss vital medical training as well as my board exam this Friday due to my worsening symptoms. It has created such a negative impact on my life including pausing my medical training, and physically being incapable of driving or performing many of my basic daily activities. I live alone and near hospital. I am urgently requesting if there is anyway CDC can help me, a medical student who has put in her all to fight the pandemic alongside you.   I am extremely concerned about my symptoms and the panic that it has created for my family and friends. I hope that a rapid response can help me and my loved ones find some answers during these challenging times.
