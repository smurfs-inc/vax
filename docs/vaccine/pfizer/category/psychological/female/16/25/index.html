                                                Patient reported feeling lightheaded status post first dose Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot: EW0167, expiration date: 08/31/2021) to medic. Medic noted that the client was CAOx4,  her skin was pale, warm and slightly moist, pupils were equal, round, reactive to light and accommodating (PEARRL), respiration rate (RR) was 20. The client&#39;s sister stated the client had a history of anxiety and that &#34;she gets this way whenever she gets a shot&#34;. Medic walked patient to the zero gravity chair. The client was given water to sip on. At 1213 baseline vitals were taken with client sitting: Blood pressure (BP): 110/82, heartrate (HR): 98, RR: 20, PEARRL. Medic  reports she coached the client on her breathing  to help alleviate her complaint of feeling lightheaded, mild nausea and anxiety. Client reported she felt anxious prior to her vaccination and that her last oral intake was 15 minutes prior to vaccine. Client denied headache, blurry vision and chest pain. At 1220 a second set of vitals were taken while standing: BP 108/80, HR 86, RR 16, CAOx4. Client stated her symptoms were diminishing. Client&#39;s RR slowed down to normal rate and rhythm, vital signs were trending to normal and client was negative for orthostatic pressures. Client was advised to stay for additional 30 minute observation. Client&#39;s symptoms resolved completely and she was able to ambulate away from observation site without assistance and with a steady gait.

Tylenol helped. It was better after the second day. For the second dose the symptoms were similar. My arm is still sore.

Concomitant medications in two weeks included ondansetron hydrochloride (ZOFRAN) taken for anti-nausea, start and stop date were not reported; doxycycline taken for acne, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took glycerol (GLYCERIN) and experienced allergies. The patient got her vaccine on 12Apr2021. Two nights after her vaccine (14Apr2021), she got shaky and feeling bad and burning sensation in her body. No fever at that time, but slight elevated temp (99.7F max) the day after the vaccine (13Apr2021).

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I did not experience any symptoms until the night following the vaccination.  Around 3:30am (01/14/2021), I was awoken by intense chills.  I was restless throughout the rest of the night, having hot and cold flashes.  I woke up around 8:20am and felt that I had a subjective fever.  I was also experiencing intense body ache and headache.  I took my temperature and it showed to be 100.6ºF.  I was still experiencing chills despite also feeling hot at the same time.  After an hour, my temperature was 101ºF.  I took 2 naproxen sodium tablets (440mg) to relieve fever.  Around 10:45am, my fever reduced but my body ache and headache stayed at the same pain level.  Around 2pm, I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen (400mg).  My headache stopped around 8:00pm.  My body aches stopped the morning of 01/15/2021.

                                                headaches; Confusion; Fever; muscle aches all over; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 19-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT#: EL0140), intramuscular in upper left arm on 11Jan2021 around noon at second single dose for preventative. Medical history included ongoing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, diagnosed when she was 14 or 15 years old), ongoing anxiety (Diagnosed when she was 16 years old), depression. Concomitant medication included ongoing methylphenidate (has been taking for about 4 or 5 years) for ADHD, to help focus and keeps her sane, ongoing primidone (has been taking less than a year) for hand tremors, ongoing fluvoxamine maleate (taking for about 4 years) for anxiety depression. The patient previously took first dose BNT162B2 on 21Dec2020 around noon, intramuscular injection in upper left arm for preventative (Lot: EJ1685). No other prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE following prior vaccinations. The patient got the second dose yesterday (reported on 12Jan2021) around noon and she was experiencing not so great side effects. The biggest thing was headaches that were pretty debilitating. She was experiencing confusion and muscle aches all over. Stated that all the side effects started around the same time around 9 pm last night. The patient reported that her fever was down a bit so she was a little bit more coherent. Fever was slightly improved at 101.5. The patient took a few medicines for ADHD or anxiety and was wondering if they could have interacted with the vaccine.

Treatment for headache inclued Ibuprofen. Outcome of event headache and fever was recovering, of event muscle aches all over was not recovered, of event confusion was unknown.

Thursday night, My heart started racing very quickly and it lasted for 30 minutes - my whole chest was hurting really bad and my heart was beating hard. I had a monitor  - 207 beats per minutes. Blood pressure was normal. ER - monitored my heart. I think they gave me some medication. They gave me a heart monitor to check my heart for next 14 days. There was not another occurrence.

Then I couldn?t stop my eyes from continuously rolling back into my head. That happened for about 4 minutes or so sometimes it would happen like 3 or 4 times in a row and sometimes it would be every 20 seconds or so. I was extremely confused and forgetful for the next 40 minutes and then I slowly began to be able to recall stuff.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date not reported), intramuscular on 23Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergies from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, it was unknown if the patient has been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine 60 mg taken for an unspecified indication, and an unspecified oral contraceptive. It was reported that on 23Mar2021, the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine and felt a little dizzy on 11:00. She also started noting mumbling, slurred speech, passed out for about 15 (unspecified) after using the bathroom, developed a &#34;static&#34; feeling in her head and then noted her left eye shutting and then weakness in her left arm and leg. She was taken to the Emergency Room (ER) for evaluation. Symptoms lasted about 5 hours. She fell asleep in the ER. Symptoms seemed to clear by about 8:30 PM. She had lab and head CT at the hospital which were essentially normal. She felt okay the next day, but had some nausea for a couple days starting on the 3rd day on 25Mar2021. She stated she feels fine at the time of report in the Student Health Clinic and asked whether she should receive her second Pfizer dose scheduled on 20Apr2021. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The outcome of the event nausea was recovered in Mar2021, and for other events was recovered on 23Mar2021 20:30.   Information about lot/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product BNT162B2 and the reported event Passed out.

I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

This is NOT how I usually experience my period. Many people I&#39;ve spoken to have said that after receiving the Pfizer shot, their period was heavier and earlier than normal. This information should have been included in the warnings, as this seems to be an EXTREMELY common side effect to people who mensurate. Please start including female-specific health outcomes in your research.

                                                My right arm was sore almost immediately after being vaccinated, but it wasn?t bad. Then later at night when I was trying to get to sleep I was horribly restless, shaking, and feverish. I had to bundle up in blankets because I was so cold. My whole body ached terribly, and I had a headache. It lasted a few hours and I couldn?t get to sleep. At one point I felt extremely nauseous and ran to the bathroom, barely holding back vomit, but then it went away and never came back. The day after that (April 15th) I was extremely fatigued and still had body aches and a headache. I took my temperature at 5 am on April 15th and it was 99.4°. I mostly just slept a lot and didn?t have much of an appetite. My arm was still a little sore during this whole time. As I?m writing this at 5 am on April 16th, I still have a headache.

                                                Pt received Pfizer-COVID vaccine (under EUA) yesterday 16 Dec 2020 at approx 1700.  She did not have any immediate problems after vaccination.  .  She woke up today feeling achy and feverish, and measured her oral temp at 1000 as 101.4 at home.  She drank fluids, but took no meds -- repeat oral temp at 1200 was 99.0.  .  Other sxms include sore arm at vaccination site with min redness but no swelling.   .  She additionally reports nasal congestion and sore throat that began 1 day prior to vaccination, that she attributed to her seasonal allergies.  No meds for allergies.  No cough or SOB.  No headache or neuro sxms.  No GI sxms.  .  She was concerned about fever and went to drive-thru COVID testing at approx 1300... results due back in 24h.  She has no known COVID contacts.  .  She works in sterile processing at NMCSD with no direct patient contact usually; She is on night shift now.  -  Fever and achy symptoms, as above, in previously healthy hospital worker, with onset approx 18h after receipt of COVID-Pfizer vaccine, dose #1.  With questionable URI-like sxms one day prior to vaccination, COVID testing was very reasonable -- and results are pending now.  If COVID test negative, this most likely represents mild-moderate systemic reaction to vaccine.  Advised no work this evening, rest at home, increase clear fluids, and take Motrin 400mg q4-6h as needed for subjective fever or achiness -- use/precautions reviewed.  Will follow-up tomorrow with this team by phone.  If vaccine reaction, expect sxms to lessen rapidly and resolve over next 1-2 days.  Indications for urgent care -- including marked worsening of sxms or new sxms -- reviewed.  She also has number for 24/7 Immunization Support.  Will file VAERS, since work missed for sxms.  Will encourage enrollment in VSAFE as well.  Advised that, if mild-moderate systemic reaction determined most likely source of sxms, dose #2 of COVID-Pfizer vaccine will still generally be recommended.  Pt expresses understanding and appreciation of all issues.

The next day I couldn?t walk, keep my eyes open, had a headache, my whole body was aching and sore. I ended up sleeping for over 20 hours that day, couldn?t eat my husband had to actually help me walk to the shower and bathe me because I kept almost passing out.

However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 09:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No family history relevant to adverse events. Patient has no concomitant medications. On 16Jan2021 09:20, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient felt like she was going to pass out reported as vasovagal reaction, and experienced heart beat was high, fatigue, woozy/dizzy, hard to concentrate, feeling hot, and felt as though she was on the verge of a headache but never got one/she felt like the blood was rushing to her head. On 16Jan2021 10:00, 1 hour after vaccination, the patient experienced had to fall asleep. On the day she got the shot she sat for a full hour with the nurse to be monitored. Then she went home. The events lasted from 09:20 until 18:00 on that day. 13 days after vaccination on 29Jan2021, 12:00 and ongoing until reporting time, the symptoms recurred about the same when they started. The patient was wondering if this could be a side effect 2 weeks after getting the shot or if she should look elsewhere on what could be causing these events. She is supposed to get the second dose on Friday and was wondering about getting the second dose after her experience. Patient wanted to know it is safer for her to have the 2nd dose. No physician office visit and emergency room visit. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was recovered on 16Jan2021 18:00.

                                                I received my shot at 11:47 and started to lose sensation in my hands in the waiting area. After about 25 minutes I felt dizzy and was about to stand up but my muscles started shaking. My heart rate was checked and found to be 140. This lasted for about another 30 minutes. My heart rate went down and I was taken to a private area and checked out by EMS they gave me water and concluded it was some sort of panic attack. However, these are the same symptoms I have whenever I am allergic to a medication, NSAIDS, dicyclomine, etc. It always starts with ascending numbness from my fingers to the rest of my body. Then I start to shake and my heart rate goes way up. Usually I start to cough then vomit and my airway closes. Thankfully this time we were able to slow the process and I never experienced some of the last symptoms.

                                                On March 7, 2021 my daughter experienced extreme tiredness.  I called 911 and paramedics said it may be the effects of vaccine.  I was concerned because this symptom came on 2 weeks later.  On 3/6/21, I took her to urgent care because I didn&#39;t feel comfortable with her extreme tiredness.  I was told the same thing. On 2/23/2021, the day that she was supposed to get the second vaccine, she awoke at 12 midnight and was having a full blown psychotic episode.  She was make loud noises, hitting the wall, etc.  I then took her to the emergency room. My major concern was because my daughter has Down syndrome, a seizure disorder and had heart surgery at three months old (atrio ventricular canal defect).

About an hour after that I vomited and experience diarrhea. Returning to bed I had trouble sleeping due to the chills and headache bordering on migraine. Once I did fall asleep I would wake up dripping in sweat and needing to go to the bathroom for more diarrhea. This continued for several hours and several trips to the bathroom. The whole day after my vaccine I was unable to eat food, even the smell made me want to throw up. I was cold and nauseous all day.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. This case is serious, the other one is non-serious.   A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EH9899) intramuscular at left deltoid on 22Dec2020 19:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccines given at the same time. The patient received a flu shot back between 27th or 28th Nov2020 in her left deltoid. Caller reported getting the COVID vaccine on the 22Dec2020 and feeling fine before that. On the 28Dec2020 she started feeling chills and not feeling very good and that hasn&#39;t gone away. The patient went and got a rapid COVID test and it came back positive, not sure if it was because of the vaccine having antigens in it or she came into contact with it or if she just weakened immune system from the shot. The patient wanted to know if that was true. Then stated she and her mom got the COVID vaccine and her mom received it on the 23Dec. On the 29Dec her whole family started to get sick and experiencing the same things she experienced. The patient was not feeling well at the time of the call. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : 2021001266 same reporter/ drug, different patient/event

Pain is mostly at top of my lungs, going across my chest. Deep breathing sometimes helps but there?s also pain upon inhalation.  * Took the next doses of Advair and my Dexedrine (ADHD meds). Nothing weird yet just drained.   They switched my Ventolin inhaler to ProAir, I have been taking it about five times a week so I can workout. When I was on Ventolin I didn?t have any of the side effects I have with ProAir.

                                                Patient is a registered nurse at facility.  She reported having slight itchy lips and scratchy throat after 1st dose.  Patient very much wanted full protection that 2nd dose offers in order to be safe and keep family members safe.  We discussed the possibility of an increased reaction, but she wanted to go ahead and felt the benefits outweighed the risk.  I considered the fact that she is a health care professional, was fully informed and that we were at a skilled nursing facility and were prepared in case she had any reaction.  About 10 minutes after vaccination she seemed to be coughing and felt like her throat was maybe swelling.  She seemed to be breathing ok, but I asked her to take a Benadryl, which she did.  Within 5-10 minutes after that she began shaking and seemed very pale.  She said her symptoms were getting worse.  I told her I was going to administer an epi-pen dose.  911 was called, I administered the epipen, we had heart rate monitor and pulse ox monitor on patient and she was stable, but scared.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported patient to ER.  She was later released with Benadryl.

I raised my hand to talk to a nurse and she said I was probably just nervous, got me a water, and said to continue to monitor symptoms. Then, after 15 minutes were up with no other symptoms I left the facility where I got the vaccine. The rest of the day I began to get a burning and cooling effect all around my sternum. It persisted through the day despite Tylenol 500 mg and worsened at night, keeping me up along with a slight fever and chills. The next morning I awoke with slightly lowered symptoms but the sternum pain would flare up on and off through the day and again was worse at night on Monday. So, I took a Benadryl and a 500 mg Tylenol and slept great. I woke up Tuesday feeling great with no fever and minimal chills and no sternal pain. I thought since I hit the 48 hour mark everything was going fine and I was recovering. I ran some errands and even went to the gym to do a mild workout. Then at about 6pm all the symptoms of the sternal pain flared up and was just as bad as Monday night. I took another 500mg Tylenol and 1 Benadryl again and they did not seem to work or help nearly as much as the night before. I woke up this morning with some pain in my sternum again and did not sleep much last night due to the pain as well. I have not taken any further medications at this time and I am also experiencing the worst fatigue I have so far today.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

                                                I got the usual cold-like symptoms the next day. I took a nap and woke up and felt pretty much fine after that. After the 1st, I started getting waves of dizziness. I would lay on ground and I couldn&#39;t get up. After a couple of days, I could do stuff but would get random waves of dizziness and would have to sit down until it went away. My doctor told me to take Allegra and I just kind of lived with it. It didn&#39;t help with symptoms. It started affecting my work because I&#39;m a CNA and I couldn&#39;t be having dizzy spells at work. I went to ER - on January 10th. They sent me to Hasboro because they were to busy at ER. The nurse said I had Vertigo - and they discharged me with Meclizine while I was in ER and it didn&#39;t help. I called me doctor a couple of days after. She told me to combine the Allegro with the Meclizine and that didn&#39;t help with either. I called my doctor back and she said that there is nothing else I can do because my bloodwork came back normal.  I&#39;m not currently taking anything and I&#39;m still getting random dizzy spells. I have returned to work and so I just have to take breaks at work when it happens.  I got the second vaccine on the 19th of January.

I woke up again around 5:15 am to intense involuntary shaking. My family members wrapped me in blankets and applied pressure to my body until the shaking stopped. Within the next 40 minutes I vomited and had diarrhea. At the time also had body aches, chills, fever, and mild swelling of various areas if the body. I slept most of the morning and ate lunch around 1:30 pm. I took Tylenol again at 2:00 pm with the symptoms lessening over the next 5-6 hours. After that fever, chills, and body aches returned.

                                                About five to ten minutes after I received my first shot, I started to feel like my throat was closing a little. I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

A 22-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), second dose intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 11:30 (lot number: EN6205) as single dose (at the age of 22-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rhinitis allergic. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen; cefuroxime; clarithromycin (MACROBID [CLARITHROMYCIN]); ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE); spironolactone; acetaminophen; origanum minutiflorum oil (OREGANO OIL); tretinoin; ondansetron (ZOFRAN [ONDANSETRON]) and &#34;Olly probiotic/prebiotic&#34;; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2.

This nurse reported similar events for 3 patients. This is the first of 3 reports.  A 23-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EK9231, intramuscular in the right deltoid, first dose on 27Dec2020 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma and reactive airway which she was diagnosed when she was like 5 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] for asthma which started when she was 8 years old or so. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of covid vaccine after experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction like rash, tightness in throat, and lump in throat. She wanted to know the ingredients and specific proteins in the covid vaccine. The patient received the COVID Vaccine and she developed a reaction. On 27Dec2020, she had a red rash on her chest, and her cheeks were flushed, and the rash was on her arms too, and she had a tightness and lump in her throat, it was not painful to swallow but she could feel the pressure with swallowing. She stated that she did not experience shortness of breath, but regardless, she was seen in the ER and she was given IV SOLUMEDROL, and BENADRYL, and she was watched for 5 or 6 hours and then she was sent home with an Epi Pen, around the clock Benadryl, and prednisone. She asked the ER doctors if they thought it was okay for her to receive the second dose of the product, and they told her to contact employee health for that question. She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did. Her primary care doctor instructed the caller to call Pfizer and gather some more information regarding ingredients, as the she may have had the reaction to a particular protein filler. She was also wondering if this is a known reaction to the product. She received the vaccine on 27Dec2020 at 2:15 PM. She reported that the red rash on her chest and arms, and her cheeks being flushed, resolved yesterday after receiving IV BENADRYL. Had a tightness and lump in her throat which was still ongoing, and it was kind of off and on and when the she takes Benadryl it goes away. She reported that this one is medically significant because even though she did not have shortness of breath, it could have affected her airway. She confirmed that she received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#39;had a tightness and lump in her throat&#39;, allergic reaction was not recovered (a s reported); while recovered on 27Dec2020 for allergic reaction like rash/red rash on her chest and rash was on her arms too and cheeks were flushed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events throat tightness, sensation of foreign body, allergy to vaccine, rash erythematous and flushing cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Dec2020 (at the age of 23-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: allergies to medications, food, or other products (unspecified). It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally. Some improvement was noted in hives; however, the patient began to state her tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; (both on 22Dec2020). Per doctor, 0.3 mg epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) given intramuscularly with rapid improvement in hives. The patient reported feeling some improvement as well. The patient was taken to the emergency department for ongoing observation. The patient was released from emergency department after observation. The clinical outcome of flushed, hives, tongue felt &#34;thick&#34;, and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events flushing, urticaria, tong disorder, sensation of foreign body are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after the vaccination the patient reported dizziness and possible rash on her upper chest. It was difficult to assess if the rash was truly a rash or it was simply skin lesions that were already present (patient claimed she did not know). It did not resemble a maculopapular rash. It marginally resembled minor hives/urticaria. Patient did not report any localized symptoms at injection site. Patient was informed to remain seated and that her vitals would be taken and she would be further observed. Then about 10 minutes after this (25 minutes after vaccination), patient reported difficulty breathing. Facial redness was noted at this point and patient&#39;s breathing sounded difficult. Emergency medical services were called and EpiPen was administered at this point. Patient began to tremble and pace of breathing increased. Emergency medical technicians arrived, took vitals / EKG, and assessed the patient. EMT assessment did not reveal urticaria. EMT instructed patient to control her breathing. The EMTs believe that it may not have been a true reaction but rather the patient may have been suffering from an anxiety attack. Patient was then taken to local ER for further evaluation.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

When waking up the next morning, I had felt a slight fever, chills, nausea, continuous fatigue, and headaches throughout the day. Once I woke up the next day, 2/1, my fever and chills had completely gone away, however I was still feeling fatigue, headaches, and nausea and have not stopped feeling these symptoms since. My fatigue most notably has been present enough to where I?ve needed to call out of work. Eating meals also does but subside the fatigue by a substantial amount.

I had a headache and noticed I had a 101.2 fever so I took Tylenol. I also had body aches. All day I was very weak. Later in the day about 4pm I became nauseous and threw up. Symptoms carried over into the next day. I am tired with a bad headache and nauseous.

I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

These symptoms subsided after 25 minutes. I then became on and off light headed through the remainder of the day. The day after receiving the vaccine I felt a lot of brain fog, forgetfulness, and fatigue. The night of day two I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache which only lasted 20 minutes. During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

                                                The first day I got my vaccine, I felt  fine, but my arm with the injection sight was very sore and body slightly achy. The second day I woke up and my arm was sore, but other than that I felt normal. Around 4pm on the second day, my back started to hurt where the break break in my spine is. It was just a normal amount of pain at first, but within an hour there was throbbing pain in my lower back, spreading into my legs. This is where I normally feel my chronic pain, but I had a spinal injection a little over 6 months ago and doesn&#39;t usually stop working until about a year. It is the normal pain I experience in the normal places, but the pain is worse and out of no where. That is not usually how the pain comes on when the spinal block wears off. It is much more gradual. It could be a coincidence, but the pain is not the way I have ever experienced the pain.  My back hurts too much to do things I need to do to function, which only happens to me when I have done something with a lot of physical activity that puts tension on my back like jumping, dancing, roller coasters. Before I started experiencing this pain, it was just a normal day for me where I didn&#39;t exert my back any more than normal, which is very little.

Later that night, I had very strong rigors, chills, severe headache and felt feverish. I took some Tyenol and felt a little better. I woke up at 5 AM to go to work, and my body was so fatigued and tired I couldn&#39;t move. My hands were shaking badly, and my whole body hurt. My joints hurt, my muscles, ect. I called out of work, as I work in the Micro lab doing COVID-19 PCR testing, I couldn&#39;t pipet correctly if I was shaking. I do not have any pre-existing conditions, and I have no allergies. I have never experienced an adverse reaction to a vaccine.

                                                I started to get a headache then became more fatigued throughout the evening. I went to bed around 9 pm and had some chills and mild body aches so I took some Tylenol. I woke up around 12pm with sore muscles and cramps/aches in my back, hips, legs, and neck. I also had a mild fever of 100.7 and was nauseous. I took some Zofran for nausea. I had chills and was flushed and sweating. That next day I felt like I had been hit by a truck, I was very fatigued, had little to no appetite, and had a pounding headache. I slept the entire day 1/25. The following day 1/26 I felt better but still groggy, I slept the majority of the day before heading off to work.

I explained that I would like to extend her observation time to 30 minutes, and perhaps longer if she didn&#39;t feel better then. I offered her water and food. She declined water and asked for &#34;a snack.&#34; I re-evaluated her approximately every 5 minutes over the next half hour.

A 24-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3247), intramuscular in left arm on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included generalised anxiety and allergies: Sulfa sensitive. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Jan2021, 45-60 minutes after vaccination, patient experienced hallucination, severe confusion, dizziness/light headedness, disorientation, fatigue, tachycardia, anxiety, full body weakness, then on 22Jan2021, 8 hours after, patient had full body muscle aches, headache, chills, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, anxiety, tachycardia, 16 hours after, experienced  confusion, full body muscle aches, headache, chills, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, tachycardia, anxiety, then 48 hours after, had confusion, full body muscle aches (TYLENOL helped), headache, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, tachycardia, anxiety, then 1 week after vaccination, patient was experiencing confusion, anxiety, and hallucinations throughout the entire week. Patient was unsure if she ever had a fever, as she did not check her temperature. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID saliva test: negative on 27Jan2021 and negative on 10Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of full body muscle aches. No treatment was received for the other adverse events. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported event hallucination cannot be completely excluded given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

                                                Sudden tingling and numbness in hands, I couldn&#39;t move my fingers for 2 minutes. My whole body started pouring sweat. My head got foggy and my vision got blurry and for a second. I vomited once and felt nauseous the rest of the night, and also felt like I had a migraine the rest of the night as well.

                                                Left deltoid pain began at about 2:30 pm, approximately 3 hours after vaccine was administered in that arm. Pain progressed throughout the next few hours but was moderate. Around 11:30 pm the pain became more severe, to the point where any deltoid movement caused extreme pain. I used an ice pack to try to alleviate the pain but it only provided mild relief. When changing my shirt around this time I touched the area lightly and saw it was slightly swollen with fluid around the site of vaccination. Continued using ice because I had not eaten recently and did not want to take ibuprofen on an empty stomach and cause heartburn. I was unable to sleep on my left side and woke up around 4:30 am in severe pain, put ice on it again and fell back asleep. I had a low grade fever of about 99.4 F at this time and some chills. On 3/16 I woke up around 9:30 am and pain was still fairly moderate-severe and swelling was present but less than the night before. Around 10:00 am I ate breakfast and took ibuprofen, and the pain and swelling have been more moderate since.

The sore muscles make it hard to walk. I did not develop a low grade fever, but I did have a few hot flashes. I?m more fatigued than normal and haven?t been sleeping well at night since the last dose of the vaccine.

A 24-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 24-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did have COVID prior vaccination and the patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced delirium at night of given dose in the morning. The patient was not feverish, but she was mumbling unintelligibly, shaking uncontrollably and not recognizing family members. The patient received ibuprofen and acetaminophen as the treatment for the events. the outcome of events, delirium, mumbling unintelligibly, shaking uncontrollably and not recognizing family members was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between event delirium and BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

Then 12 Hours after vaccine my arm became VERY sore, took my ibuprofen and alternated with Acetaminophen.  Then my face became very flushed (I used ice packs) and I got a mild sore throat. That night I had difficulty sleeping. I kept waking up with terrible body aches. About 24 hours after the vaccine I just had fatigue, mild fever, and chills. I slept on and off throughout the day and then started to feel better. But at about 32 hours post vaccine I started to feel worse. My headache and sore arm came back and I became very light headed and dizzy.

I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                approximately 5 min after receiving the vaccine, felt flushed and a swelling sensation in the throat. Felt like a globes sensation without itching or hives.   Nurses at vaccine site checked vitals multiple times. BP at start of symptoms 152/106, HR 140, O2 sat 99%. EMS was called but I did not feel symptoms were worsening, my lungs were clear without wheezing or stridor. I made the decision to not have EMS transport me to the ER. Symptoms improved so I decided to not go to the ER. Symptoms returned moderately for which I took 25 mg tab of Benadryl. As time progressed, symptoms waxed and waned, about 4 hours after the vaccine the globus sensation in the throat has improved, but there is a globs sensation in the lower esophagus, almost GERD-like in nature.

I then called him back 4 minutes later and failed to form words, and also could not type words. I felt like I was going to faint and have no recollection of 10 minutes during that time. I had to leave work to go to the emergency room.  I had a massive headache for 3 days following my TIA.

                                                Was driving home after waiting my 15 minutes. Throat started to close up, tingling sensation throughout entire body, rush of heat, dizziness, increased heart rate. Made it back to the site (closest medical professionals near me) where my throat still felt swollen but I could breathe. Chest hurt and was still dizzy. Was given 50mg Benadryl &amp; 20mg Pepsid. It seemed to come and go in waves but I still went to the ER. ER doc said what he saw I was experiencing was anxiety. Pharmacist who had been with me the whole time could tell that my neck and throat had been swollen but had gone down with the Benadryl. ER administered anti nausea meds and a steroid shot. Also prescribed steroids for a few days. Received the shot at 6:45, initial reaction occurred around 7:10, went to the ER around 8:45

                                                Five minutes after vaccine, I started having trouble breathing. Thought it was anxiety attack but I didn&#39;t feel anxious. I felt light headed and I don&#39;t get that with my panic attacks; At 15 minutes, my heart was beating really fast. They checked my vitals - pulse and BP was elevated. Pulse is over 130 and normally when I have an anxiety attack it doesn&#39;t go above 110. Went to the  ER . The breathing felt better after thirty min after being in ER and Blood pressure 1-2 hours later went down. No treatment. After about two weeks I saw my primary care doctor for check up.

She held her hand to calm down. gave her the vaccination and 5 mins later the patient said she has a headache, was upset, and started crying. She covered her eyes with her hands and started to shake. She also went to her bed and was rolling in it. The facility called 911 and they came within 5 mins. They did confirm that the patient wasn&#39;t having a seizure. Patient was calmed down but still went with the paramedics to be checked out. When I followed up with the facility, they said it was an anxiety event and the patient is back at the facility doing well. Let me know if you have any additional questions.

The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced broke out in hives all over her body on 03Jan2021, which was reported as medically significant. The patient also didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable and areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened on 03Jan2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received her first dose of the vaccine on 29Dec2020 and said 5 days later she broke out in hives. The patient stated her hives began on the evening of 03Jan2021. She clarified she had hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable. She said she still had areas on her legs and ankles that were reddened. She said the reddened areas on her legs and ankles are not fully raised or itchy, like she had experienced with the hives on the rest of her body. The patient went to an urgent care on 06Jan2021. She saw a dermatologist for the hives on 07Jan2021, who suspected that since she did not have any prior history of hives, her hives are from the COVID-19 vaccine. She said the dermatologist told her there is no way to truly test if the vaccine caused her hives. The patient received an intramuscular unspecified steroid shot at the dermatologist and was prescribed methylprednisolone (MANUFACTURED BY: PAR PHARMACEUTICAL; Lot number: 1129091; Expiration date: Dec2021) 4 mg tablets in a taper dose pack. She also stated that she took the following over-the-counter medications: diphenhydramine hydrochloride (reported as: generic BENADRYL; MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN; Lot number: 0MR0456; Expiration date: Sep2022) 25 mg tablet, taken as needed; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC; Lot number: 1652346; Expiration Date: Dec2021) 10 mg tablet, taken as one tablet up to four times a day; and hydrocortisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) cream. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all of the events as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of broke out in hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable was recovering and of areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events.

A 25-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number=EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at site of right arm on 20Jan2021 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medication included vitamin D3 and iron (SLOW RELEASE IRON) and daily multivitamin. Within minutes of receiving the dose on 20Jan2021 at 09:45 AM, dizziness, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, flushed, weakness, and shakiness. About an hour after receiving the dose on 20Jan2021, lethargy, chilled, in particular hands were very cold, pale color, mental fog, and slurred speech.

                                                I am a third-year medical student. Since receiving the second dose of the COVID vaccine (Pfizer) on Tuesday 2/2, I have had persistent and worsening muscle spasms of the torso. I presented to the Emergency room on 2/6 due to worsening symptoms and was admitted until 2/7. The neurology team evaluated my condition was not able to make a firm diagnosis. They believe the vaccine has caused a dystonic reaction. I was given benadryl 25mg to continue for one week q6 hours prn. However, benadryl has provided minimal relief. They also strongly recommended that I be seen by a movement disorder specialist at hospital ASAP.  However, due to the fact that I have insurance I am not covered for care from hospital. My insurance said they will review the referral which will take another 5-7 business days from today 2/9. As a medical student, I have had to miss one week of clinic rotations and will continue to miss vital medical training as well as my board exam this Friday due to my worsening symptoms. It has created such a negative impact on my life including pausing my medical training, and physically being incapable of driving or performing many of my basic daily activities. I live alone and near hospital. I am urgently requesting if there is anyway CDC can help me, a medical student who has put in her all to fight the pandemic alongside you.   I am extremely concerned about my symptoms and the panic that it has created for my family and friends. I hope that a rapid response can help me and my loved ones find some answers during these challenging times.

At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

It started in her scalp, moved to her face, and then onto her throat. She was at work at this time. I advised her to take a 25 mg Benadryl (which may cause drowsiness). Based on her size (145 lbs) employee did not recommend she take a 50 mg Benadryl. Patient did not know if she had a fever or not. She reported NO fever at that time. Employee called her back at 6:30 PM to check on her. She said she had to leave work around 2 pm; she was feeling bad, achey. She said she took some ibuprofen as she was feeling achey and feverish. she didn&#39;t feel the need to go to the doctor or urgent care at this time.

It was the kind of uncomfortable where I swear I could feel it in my bones. Laid in bed until 8:30 when baby boy woke up, promptly threw up, got so nauseated and dizzy that I could not move from the bathroom floor, and had to ask grandma to bring me my medicines. The mix of ibuprofen, migraine medication, and anti-nausea all combined made me feel no symptoms for several hours until they wore off and I lost all ability to stand. My legs just felt so weak. And now I?m finally starting to feel a little better, and it?s been 2.5 days now. Boy, those side effects are no joke. Still worth it though so I don?t bring a deadly virus home to my baby boy ?????
