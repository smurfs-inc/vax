Kept complaining that she felt like she was crawling in her own skin, all through her arms and her chest, like an itch from the inside.  NO HIVES. No difficulty breathing.  Kept her home from school and she slept a lot. Only vomited the one time. She was fine by late afternoon and all symptoms seemed to have resolved by then.

                                                Asthma Attack started at 1 pm while seated and attending virtual class. She was under no distress and was not in any way exerting herself. She described the attack as a feeling of someone sitting on her chest and began to hyperventilate. The color drained from her face and her hands felt numb. Her asthma attacks are generally exercise-induced, so this was highly unusual.  She took a dose of albuterol ( 2 puffs with a spacer) and followed her asthma action plan. She laid down and slowed her breathing. 20 minutes later her facial color returned to normal. Two hours later her hands returned to normal. She was disoriented for about 5 hours.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after patient was given the vaccine, she reported feeling slight lump in her throat. We brought her into the clinic room and sat her down. Never had trouble swallowing and did not have any swelling. Felt hot and bit sweaty and light headed. Reports has felt similar ways in past when had blood drawn. We laid her down and she immediately started feeling better. Mom and sister were with her. Refused ambulance or transfer to physician.  They were all comfortable her leaving on her own, after we have observed her for over 45 minutes from vaccine.

                                                Pt. received her second Pfizer dose at 3pm. By 11:30pm she had significant swelling on both of her eyes, mouth, and the start of red splotchy skin on arms and legs. We took her to ER. They gave her 50mg of hydroxizine and sent us home. 5min after leaving the ER at 12:30am on 4/23 she felt a golf ball sized lump in her throat and was having difficulty breathing. We brought her back to the ER.  At this time they gave her an ekg, and at around 1:30am gave her an epi pin and an oral steroid. Within 5min of the oral steroid and epi pin she no longer had difficulty in breathing and the lump in her throat was gone as was the res splotches. By 5am the swelling in her face had reduced drastically to 90% normal in her left eye and 70% normal in her right eye and 70% normal in her lip. She was released from the ER at 5:45am and went home to sleep. At 11:30am on 4/23 her swelling in her face remains the same and she is complaining of a headache. She was given 50mg more of hydroxizine.

                                                I got the shot at around 4 in the afternoon and after sitting in the waiting area for around 15 minutes I was allowed to leave. When I left I only had a slight headache, but nothing that seemed very noticeable. I felt a tad woozy but it was nothing serious so I went on with my day and went to my sports practice for an hour and a half. After I got home and had eaten, I was working and started to feel the effects. It started with an increasingly worse headache at around 9 and as the night went on it got worse and I constantly needed to lie down. My arm had started to feel sore but it was nothing much. I thought I could sleep it off but woke up feeling horrible. My stomach could not hold any food down and my headache had become really bad. I had to go to my sports game but on the car ride over (around 45 min) I got very nauseous. Throughout the course of the day my headache would get worse any time I tried to run and all I wanted to do was lie down and sleep. I was barely able to stand, let alone run and I felt sleepy all day. My arm had also gotten very sore and any contact on it made me flinch back. I was not able to eat or drink anything until about 4  in the afternoon and my stomach was not sitting right the entire time and I constantly was burping and feeling like I was going to vomit despite having only water in my stomach. After I was able to eat the stomach ache went away a bit but the headache lasted through the night and has finally started to subside two days later.

                                                An hour after Pfizer vaccine administration, the parents of the 16 year old patient returned to the pharmacy and reported that their daughter was complaining of trouble breathing in the parking lot.  The immunizing tech asked the parents to bring the patient back to the pharmacy.    The patient returned and while crying and gasping for air, she reported that it felt as if someone was constricting her throat.  She also complained of stiff fingers and feeling numbness/tingling in her upper extremities.    Assuming anaphylactic reaction, one dose of epinephrine was administered.  The patient said she felt slightly better after the first dose but then 2 minutes later, said her breathing was getting worse, and again described feeling her throat tightening.  Five minutes later, a 2nd dose of epinephrine was administered.   The patient was taken to the hospital by paramedics.

Patient&#39;s mother stated patient was experiencing extreme anxiety getting the vaccine and after 20 minutes was wheezing.  She brought patient inside and a Pharmacist came to check on her and her mother stated that she has had a reaction to a medication in the past and just needed Benadryl.  Benadryl was given to her and she took it orally.  Her pulse and blood oxygen were measured with a finger pulse oximeter and were both normal.  Shortly after she was panicking more and had a seizure.  Her mother reported that she has frequent seizures when she has anxiety/panic episodes.  Her seizures were persisting so 911 was called.  Paramedics arrived shortly after and took patient to the hospital.  A few hours later the patient&#39;s mother came back to us to inform us that she was released from the hospital and was feeling fine and back to normal.

                                                Patient reported feeling lightheaded status post first dose Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot: EW0167, expiration date: 08/31/2021) to medic. Medic noted that the client was CAOx4,  her skin was pale, warm and slightly moist, pupils were equal, round, reactive to light and accommodating (PEARRL), respiration rate (RR) was 20. The client&#39;s sister stated the client had a history of anxiety and that &#34;she gets this way whenever she gets a shot&#34;. Medic walked patient to the zero gravity chair. The client was given water to sip on. At 1213 baseline vitals were taken with client sitting: Blood pressure (BP): 110/82, heartrate (HR): 98, RR: 20, PEARRL. Medic  reports she coached the client on her breathing  to help alleviate her complaint of feeling lightheaded, mild nausea and anxiety. Client reported she felt anxious prior to her vaccination and that her last oral intake was 15 minutes prior to vaccine. Client denied headache, blurry vision and chest pain. At 1220 a second set of vitals were taken while standing: BP 108/80, HR 86, RR 16, CAOx4. Client stated her symptoms were diminishing. Client&#39;s RR slowed down to normal rate and rhythm, vital signs were trending to normal and client was negative for orthostatic pressures. Client was advised to stay for additional 30 minute observation. Client&#39;s symptoms resolved completely and she was able to ambulate away from observation site without assistance and with a steady gait.

                                                16 yo female came into our injection site today 05/05/21 to receive her first pfizer vaccine. She was accompanied by her father. Pt received vaccine IM to her left deltoid. Pt completed vaccine at 2:55pm at which she sat down for her 15 minute observation period. As soon as she sat down she called over the staff that administered the vaccine. She explained to her that she felt nausea and was breathing heavily. I then walked over to them and the attendee was very pale and breathing heavily. By that time I had RN getting attendees history from her father, She has no history of allergic reactions, not taking any medications and no current illness. She is &#34;slightly asthmatic&#34; but is not taking any rx.  RN was helping me by putting cold pack behind attendees neck. Pt then proceeded to explain that she felt nauseas and starting dry heaving. RN then brought over trash can and attendee started to vomit. I then started to proceed and take her vitals. first set of vitals were taken at 2:58pm BP: 90/60 HR: 132 RR: 24 O2: 100%. Attendee at this point was diaphoretic, pale, breathing heavily and vomiting. We continued to monitor attendee in which she started to feel better by 3:08 pm. She was no longer pale, diaphoretic or vomitting and was breathing normally. We provided attendee with water and continued to monitor her. Now that pt was calm, I was able to ask her some questions. She stated that she had a smoothie and an avocado toast about an hour prior to vaccine. She explained to me that she does have a phobia to needles and was feeling very anxious prior to appointment. I then repeated her vitals at 3:16pm BP: 98/60 HR:89 RR: 20 O2: 99%.  I had attendee stand up off chair and walk at 3:22pm. She felt fine and did not feel dizzy at all. No signs of distress noted. She was then discharged and walked out with her dad at 3:25pm.

                                                My 16-year-old daughter, very healthy without any health conditions, got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday evening, April 10th, at around 5pm. On Wednesday, she started complaining of shortness of breath, chest pains, which she described as a feeling of someone stubbing her heart. By Thursday, she began blacking out repeatedly throughout the day, each blackout lasting about a minute. These progressed and whenever she blacked out, she would not remember what happened. At first, she and I brushed it off as maybe lack of calcium since she rarely drinks milk. But as they intensified, I began to become more concerned. I told her I cannot leave her by herself in the house as I prepared to go pick up her young siblings from school then schedule an appointment with her doctor. On our way back home, she blacked out again, however, it was for more than a minute. Straight away, I drove to the  ER close by. The doctor came back to inform me that her heartbeat was irregular and concerning based on her age. In that same moment, she began complaining of excessive pain like someone punching her heart out, and then she passed out again. Still with my two other children, the whole ordeal began to frighten them and illicit some heavy tears.  Being that this ER was general admission, the doctors insisted they call in the paramedics to transport her to another ER for children. However, after being transported to the other ER, her condition began to intensify rather quickly and the pediatric doctor at the second ER informed us we would have to be transferred to Childrens intensive care unit where the cardiologists could check her heart, find the ultimate cause, and monitor her closely. In that moment, as a mother, I was speechless and extremely terrified. Seeing my daughter being transferred from ER to ER, made it even tougher on me so much that I could no longer hold myself together. Here she was in terrible pain and being moved around with no clear diagnosis and treatment.  From there on, we spent a couple days in the Cardiac ICU waiting and praying with friends for answers and the best treatment she could get to ease the pain. By about the third day of being in the ICU, the cardiologists informed me, she had Acute Myocarditis. This was so shocking in a sense that both sides of the family have no history of heart issues. Secondly, she is a very healthy child.

                                                The patient felt tired and describes her eyes going dark, then passed out a few minutes after vaccination.  She was vaccinated and then left the immunization room to sit down for a 15 minute waiting period.  When she went to sit down, she collapsed on the floor.  Her mother assisted her into a chair.  She continued to be incoherent and have her eyes rolling back into her head for a few minutes.  We used a cool cloth on her forehead and the back of her neck.  The parents requested that we call 911.  EMS arrived shortly and evaluated her.  Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse ox, blood sugar and chest sounds were all within normal range.  The patient stated that her arm felt heavy and &#34;funny&#34;.  She then stated that her tongue felt funny.  EMS evaluated her tongue and said it looked normal.  To err on the side of caution, she was taken to the hospital to determine whether or not she was having a delayed onset anaphylactic reaction.  This patient has no history of seizures.

She remained seated in the room and closed her eyes a couple times but never appeared to lose consciousness.  Her dad joined us in the room and confirmed she was really nervous before the vaccine.  We kept her seated for several minutes and then she said she felt sick and vomited.  After that she started to regain her color and was able to move to the waiting room.  She sat there for about 5 more minutes and then felt well enough to leave with her dad.

                                                is a 16-year-old female patient admitted with tachycardia.  Starting 1-1/2 weeks ago, mom notes that she has had episodes where she feels her heart racing.  It began 1-1/2 weeks ago with her crying and her watch that her heart rate was 208.  They went to the ED, where she was given some fluids and her heart rate improved so she was sent home.  She had had prior episodes of mild tachycardia up to the 140s in the past but which has always improved with fluids.  Mom states that she used to have a lot of trouble maintaining her hydration and would not drink a lot of water.  Since the last 1-1/2 weeks, she has been having these episodes 1-2 times a day that last about 1 to 2 minutes with a max of 5 minutes.  When it comes on, she feels dizzy and lightheaded, and after the episode she feels a big rush of blood to her head.  She also has some associated shortness of breath.  She denies having any episodes of chest pain at all.  She has never passed out, she has never felt like she was going to pass out, she has never felt like she was out of balance.  She denies any nausea or vomiting during episodes.  She denies any headaches during the episodes.  She does have history of migraines, but has not had one in the last couple weeks.  Her prior resting heart rate was in the 80s per her watch, and lately it has been in the 110s to 120s while awake in 80s while asleep.  Along with the episodes, she also feels some pulsating sensation in her abdomen.  She does not have any abdominal pain.  Today, her heart rate was again in the 200s, but it was worse than before because it lasted about 30 minutes total.  Lately they have been using an app that continuously monitors her heart rate.  Since these episodes started, she has cut down on her caffeine intake and she has increased her water intake.  Does not feel that this helped. She has never had syncope in the past and has never had seizures in the past.  Patient was started on carvedilol which has helped control heart rate and was encouraged to drink fluids. Per primary care team, her current episode of tachycardia was not due to the vaccine.

A 16-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0167, expiry date: Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left deltoid, on 30Apr2021 15:30, as 1st dose, single, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a pharmacy/drug store. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On 30Apr2021 15:30, the patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and was very anxious. She wanted her mom to be present. On the same day, 30Apr2021 15:35, five minutes later, the patient was shaking, and she fainted. The reporter did not know if she was having a convulsion or a seizure. A few minutes later, the patient was sitting and becoming more alert. The patient was given water and one dose of Benadryl. The patient&#39;s vital signs were checked (unknown result). The reporter talked to the patient&#39;s mother and contacted the patient&#39;s pediatrician. The events resulted to emergency room and physician&#39;s office visits. Later in the evening, the reporter followed up with the mother and she confirmed that the patient was doing well and better. The mother asked the reporter if the patient should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of the events fainted, shaking,  &#34;didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure&#34; and &#34;was very anxious&#34; was recovering. The reporter assessed the events fainted, shaking,  &#34;didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure&#34; as serious (medically significant). The reporter considered that BNT162B2 has a causal effect to the adverse events.  Follow-up (18May2021: New information received from a contactable pharmacist includes: reporter information, lab data, suspect drug details (vaccination site and vaccination time), event details (onset time provided, outcome updated to recovering, causality and seriousness assessment provided).  Follow up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, and on a reportedly closed temporal association, the company assessed that a reasonable possibility could not be excluded that the reported events (fainted;  didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure) were related to the suspect product BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

My joints were hurting, I had somewhat severe nausea, my head started throbbing. At about 6:40 AM my migraine started, my arm felt hot to the touch, and I got dizzy so I took some acetaminophen. At 10:00 PM I noticed the area under my left armpit was a little swollen and really sore, my throat and right tonsil was also sore and it hurt to swallow. The next day (today) I have another migraine, my throat and left armpit are still sore,  and my muscles hurt. I?m getting better though.

                                                The patient was previously well then shortly after the first COVID vaccine she began experiencing fatigue slowing to her swim times ( she is an high level swimmer) and felt &#34;Off&#34;. She presented to my office on May 6, 2021 three days after her second COVID vaccine  I examined her and heard a slight hint of a wheeze and in addition to labs did a CXR which was Abnormal with evidence of a LLL consolidation and a pleural effusion.  We then did a CT scan with contrast and started her on antibiotics  and I called Pulmonology to get her in quickly since swimming trials were approaching and we had to do our best to get her in shape to compete.  We also did a rapid COVID test which was negative at my office on May 7, 2021-- The pediatric pulmonologist repeated the CXR 5 days later and there was more fluid and she was now having more sx of cough and feeling  worse so she was Admitted to the Hospital on May 11th and had a Chest tube placed and drained 950 cc of serous fluid .  Pulmonology, oncology and rheumatology consulted to rule out various other causes of the pleural fluid in an otherwise healthy girl.  Surgery  did the procedure and followed up outpt.   She was in the hospital for approximately 4 days.  Proximity of sx onset to doses  and other sources being essentially ruled out lead to concern for vaccine complication.

She has history of neurological problems from chemotherapy. She also has down syndrome. She has headaches since the vaccine. She is non speaking, non-verbal. After her Pfizer vaccine, my daughter repeat things over and over, at night she cries, moves her hands a lot, yells when she is at school. My daughter did not have a fever, body aches after her vaccine. I feed her, bathe her and take care of her and since receiving the Pfizer vaccine she is not the same person. Before the vaccine, my daughter was sociable, respected, educated but since the vaccine she has been out of control and acting crazy.   My daughter received the Pfizer vaccine at a clinic and the doctors there said that she should not get the second dose. At this time, my daughter is scheduled for an MRI appointment on 06-18-2021.

                                                atient was in for 2nd covid-19 (Pfizer lot was EW0167, exp 8/31/2021):  It was her and her brother receiving the vaccine. Brother went first and was fine. She was second. After receiving the vaccine (~30-60sec) she appeared to lose conciseness (not sure if complete or partial) she said she didn&#39;t remember all of it, but it was more like a dream. During that she had some twitches/spams (involving circular motions with her arms and leg, leg extended and then retracted, but her head rolled back). Upon coming out/waking she appeared sensitive to light and was nauseous. Left her in the room with her mom to get an ice pack, water, paper towel. Total episode lasted less than a minute, but took about 10-15 minutes (estimate, unsure of full time spent) before she felt good enough to use a wheelchair and get in her mom&#39;s car to drive home.

The second period is a total surprise given the she is taking her birth control regularly.  Also the heavy bleeding and extreme cramping is not normal for her on her birth control.

                                                EVENT: 5 minutes after receiving 2nd Pfizer vaccine, patient reported she wasn&#39;t feeling good. she was already seated, so we had her bend forward with her head between her knees. That wasn&#39;t providing enough relief so we had her grip fingers into a fist and tense her arms. Got the patient cool water bottle to put on her neck. After approximately 2 minutes, patient was recovering and drank some water. She sat up again and her eyes started to lose focus and she said her ears were ringing. Had her put her head back down. She was too unstable to have lie down on the floor so we had her elevate her legs on another chair. Syncope symptoms resolved but patient said she was starting to have what she believed was a panic attack. Tried to have patient list 5 things she could see, hear, etc, but she was too anxious to do so. Asked patient about school/summer break and she started to relax. After 15 minutes of additional observation, patient was able to stand by herself. Guardian walked with her through the store for a few minutes before leaving.

His reported inability to move her arms and legs does not seem consistent with a neurologic etiology of this complaint and more likely consistent with anxiety/conversion reaction in the setting of a vasovagal episode.  Will give zyrtec at mother and patient&#39;s request, PO challenge and reassess.

She stated she could &#34;hear the lights&#34;. Her temperature was normal at 96.2 degree Fahrenheit. She stated that these same symptoms have happened before with other vaccines, Within another 20 to 25 minutes she felt better and left with her mother. I checked in 5 hours later via the phone and she was feeling better. She only reported a sore arm at that time.

Patient reports pain extends armpit and left side of upper back. -Symptom onset was 4/12/21 after receiving the vaccine. She was unable to sleep that night due to the pain.  -Yesterday 4/13/21 symptoms persisted and went to ER where she was given a dose of oxycodone for the pain which helped her to sleep.  -Today 4/14/21 symptoms continued. I spoke with her rheumatologist who recommended holding her Meloxicam and starting Ibuprofen 600 TID for a few days until symptoms resolution.

                                                Felt dizzy at work the next day after the second shot. Passed out and then was sitting down and I felt nauseous. I threw up 5 times and my arms started to get numb. I had a fever when I got home and I couldn?t move because my body hurt so badly. Migraine and dizziness has been persistent ever since and is interfering with my daily life. Been treating with tylenol which helps a little but not completely. As soon as I stand up and move I feel like I?m going to pass out.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

                                                Recipient is a 17yo who presented for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. She reported some anxiety related to receiving dose #2, and had some nausea after dose #1. She was alone as a driver of her own POV.  Consent was obtained from the recipient and her custodial grandparent by phone, witnessed by doctor. She initially did well after the vaccine, but after approximately 5 minutes began to complain of feeling nauseated, lightheaded, and tingling extremities (hands and feet). She was noted to be hyperventilating, and was placed in a supine position but continued to feel some lightheadedness and difficulty breathing. Breath sounds were clear without wheezing noted, HR 70s with RRR. She was noted to have ongoing anxiety, nausea and symptoms progressed and although she remained normotensive to hypertensive (initial BP 128/74), she had repeated episodes of syncope.  She was transferred to the ambulance and further vitals and EKG were obtained. She had some confusion after episodes of syncope and some seizure-like activity with syncope, with very brief episodes of LOC, with noted tachycardia with HR up to the 140s during episodes of syncope.  BP ranged 129/86 to 140/84. IV access obtained and she was given NS and started on oxygen at 2 liters, but saturations remained in the 98-99% range. She was ultimately transferred to the local ER for further evaluation and management given ongoing symptoms, evaluated at hospital.

                                                After a few minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported dizziness, light headedness, and blurry/dots in vision. She then became more upset leading to hyperventilation and crying. She then said she had tingling in her fingers, which progressed to difficulty moving her fingers/stiff fingers, and coldness and redness in tips of fingers. She then reported she was loosing sensations in her feet and legs. 911 was called. We tried to have the patient take slow deep breaths. We offered an ice pack and water up front and a heat pack for her fingers. Paramedics arrived. Her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, glucose were within normal limits. She was given oxygen and the paramedic was able to help her slow her breathing. Her fingers went back to normal and she felt fine before leaving. She did not feel the need to go with the paramedics.

                                                Patient was very anxious and breathing heavy. About 5 minutes after the vaccination they started to hyperventilate and ended up throwing up. After letting them sit and relax for 5 minutes, the patient then had to throw up again and told their mother they felt like they were going to faint. Mother and myself stood by, while patient did end up fainting. We slowly lowered them to the ground, and on the way down their body got stiff and patient had uncontrollable movements and was hardly responsive. Mother and myself finally got her safely to the floor as they came to and was responding to verbal ques and stimulation from mother. Mother went to get water and i stayed with the patient to ensure no other things happen. Patient ended up doing alright after relaxing for a few and then i walked them and mother to their car and ensured they were feeling good enough to go home. I then advised the mother to seek medical attention.

Later on that day, I was feeling my neck and I felt a giant lump on the left side of my neck. I thought that I had slept on it wrong. Later on, it wouldn&#39;t go away - even with massage. It was painful. It caused disturbance, I wasn&#39;t comfortable when I was sleeping. It had gotten bigger the next morning. Our doctor said that it was lymph nodes and it was a response of immune system to injection. To make sure, I&#39;m getting an ultrasound. It has gone done but I still notice another smaller lump there still as well. (The two lumps are side by side.)  For the pain and swelling, the doctor prescribed me ibuprofen. This has calmed it down. It was still a little swollen - about two weeks after. But it&#39;s going down little by little. I still feel it, but it&#39;s now very small.

                                                At around 9:25 am on Thursday, June 17th, 2021, seventeen-year-old patient walked into the vaccination site. She was accompanied by two guardians, along with 14 other minors. The minors came in for their 2nd shot of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines.  Patient signed all necessary consent forms and pre-vaccination checklist requirements with guardian and entered the vaccination section at around 9:35 am. The Pfizer vaccine was administered at 9:39 am.  Observation nurse reported that around 10:06 am the patient complained about having a severe headache, ?seeing stars?, feeling very dizzy, and not feeling well. Nurse assisted patient to lay down on the mat in case the patient may faint. Charge nurse obtained a pulse oximetry reading of 95% and a pulse of 96.   Charge nurse checked if the patient experienced any symptoms of hives/redness, shortness of breath, or any difficulty breathing or swallowing. The patient complained to observation nurse that she was having a hard time breathing, severe headache, and chest pain.   Observation nurse instructed patient to be calm and to relax. Charge nurse instructed the patient to take deep slow breaths to help increase O2 levels but the patient complained to the observation nurse that she cannot breathe through her nose.   At 10:15 am charge nurse continuously monitored the patient?s B/P, pulse, and O2 level readings. The BP reading was 117/64 with a pulse of 78 and an O2 level of 100%. At approximately 10:16 am, patient started showing signs of change in LOC and lost consciousness for a few seconds. First responder paramedics from the first minor incident were still at the scene waiting for the 2nd ambulance to arrive. The first responder paramedic did a sternum rub using his knuckles with a closed fist to the center of the patient?s chest and immediately after the patient gasped for air and regained consciousness. The patient remained in a sitting position on the floor to be able to breathe easier. At approximately, 10:18 am charge nurse took another BP reading of 121/76, a pulse of 96, and O2 level of 99%.   At approximately 10:20 am, patient started exhibiting a change in LOC and was very disoriented again. Observation nurse kept calling the patient?s name but did not get a response. This lasted for around 30 seconds while the patient gasped for air before becoming responsive again. At this time observation nurse observed that patient could not recall her name and did not know how she got there.   At approximately 10:22 am, charge nurse took another BP reading of 165/133, a pulse of  122, and an O2 level of 96%.   At around 10:24 am, the charge nurse took another BP reading of 112/78 and pulse of 112 with an O2 level of 96%. The second ambulance arrived at approximately 10:26 am and took over.   The second ambulance?s first responder paramedics left with patient at approx. 10:29 am and took her to hospital for further observation.

                                                This was the patient&#39;s second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine. The patient came with her mother. She was slightly nervous before getting the vaccine. The vaccine was given to her; she was pleasantly surprised that it barely hurt and even said &#34;wow that was nothing!&#34;. Her mother did mention that the patient got her first dose at a clinic where the pharmacist who gave it to her gave the vaccine very roughly and the patient and her mother were in tears after the FIRST shot at clinic so they were so thankful that it barely hurt for her SECOND dose. Then we started talked about traveling and everyone was engaged in a pleasant conversation for about 5 minutes. Then suddenly the patient almost fell to the side but thankfully the chair that the patient was in had armrests and her mother caught her. We gave the patient a bottle of Sprit soda for her to drink. The patient was still in her chair and resting against her mother and said &#34;I&#39;m fine&#34; but her mother insisted that we call 911. So 911 was called while a pharmacy team member stayed in the room to help keep and eye on the patient. After 911 was called that patient didn&#39;t need to rest against her mother anymore but she looked very pale and looked like she wanted to throw up. Shortly after the fire department and EMS came and took over the situation. When EMS came they said it probably sounded like a vasovagal reaction. Afterwards they cleared the situation and the patient and mother were fine afterwards (patient regained color in her face and looked and sounded normal).

This resulted in an approximate 8 lbs weight loss, an acute drop in school performance &amp; psychiatrist increased her SSRI medication dosage. She went to the doctor for blood work and a celiac disease panel, all of which were grossly normal. Unsure if she was tested for epstein-barr virus. Her escitalopram dose was increased.  After the second dose of the vaccine the patient became lethargic, lost interest in things she used to enjoy, had poor tolerance for conflict and activity. She began having panic attacks, severe abdominal pains with worse nausea and intermittent vomiting. Her menstrual periods were lasting twice as long (10 days) and she was fatigued to the point of exhaustion.  As the symptoms progressed the patient started having thoughts about hurting herself, definitively not suicidal, but so overwhelmed she felt the need to hurt herself.

A 17-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 30Jun2021 15:30 (at the age of 17-years-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EW0172) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient had been a healthy child, she had not ever had any problems. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine(s). There was no AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jun2021 (at the age of 17-years-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EW0150) for COVID-19 immunisation and with the first dose she was aright. The patient was 17 years old and got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine last day (30Jun2021) and was currently experiencing sleepiness and fever. With the first dose she was aright this second one was hitting her hard. She had came down with a fever and she was pretty much been sleeping all day. On 01Jul2021, morning at 4:30 AM, the patient got her mother up telling that her arm was hurting and that she didn&#39;t feel good after that mother gave her some Tylenol. She felt her and she was pretty warm so she gave her the couple Tylenol and they would go from there and she had been asleep ever since. The patient woke up at 4:30 AM this morning (01Jul2021) and it was hitting her hard, she woke up and the caller gave her Tylenol to break the fever. She confirms the fever started 01Jul2021. The fever seemed to have broken with the Tylenol but when she checked on her she was dazed, she had been sleeping all day she has never had her sleeping like this. When asked when sleepiness began she said, they all went to bed around 10 or 10:30 last night and her daughter had been asleep ever since then, it was ongoing. She had been a healthy child, she has not ever had any problems with her being sick. Her fever had improved but the sleepiness it seems had gotten worse. They wanted to know if sleepiness and fever are included among the commonly reported side effects after the 2nd dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She wanted to know if that was a normal situation. They were referred to HCP. The AE(s) did not require a visit to: Emergency Room/Physician Office. There were no relevant tests and investigation assessment done. Outcome of the event fever was recovered on 01Jul2021, sleepiness was not recovered and other events was unknown.  Follow-up actions are needed. Further information has been requested.

                                                Pt.initially had acute onset left arm pain with left sided chest pain worsened with deep breathing with nausea and vomiting.  She gave herself her stress dose hydrocortisone, but when she did not improve she presented to the ED on 4/25/2021.   EKG was performed and was normal.  She was discharged with ad vice to rotate tylenol and ibuprofen and to stress dose her hydrocortisone. She, however, continued to be very symptomatic and developed tachycardia and symptoms of orthostasis. Large workup was done to assess the status of her endocrine diseases and to assess for onset of new autoimmune endocrine conditions.  Laboratory evaluation was normal. troponin testing was not sent. She was referred to her primary pediatrician for further evaluation.   Her pediatrician did a full evaluation and could find no cause for her symptoms. Arm pain gradually resolved but palpitations, mild sinus arrhythmia with tachycardia and symptoms of orthostasis continued.  She tolerated wean of her hydrocortisone poorly and required large doses and slow weaning. Symptoms were still present and bothersome on 5/17/21 but had slightly improved, although she remained unable to attend full days of school (she is an excellent student).  Case was discussed with infectious disease, who recommended delaying the second COVID vaccination, so this was done. Eventual working diagnosis was marked vasomotor instability of unclear origin, likely  post inflammatory, concern for triggered by COVID vaccination. cardiology referral was placed. She was seen by cardiology 7/6/2021.  EKG showed sinus arrhythmia and borderline right axis deviation, unchanged from ED presentation 4/25/2021. echocardiogram revealed only previous PDA closure. Cardiology placed event monitor and noted low suspicion for myocarditis, but consideration of cardiac MRI in future if no improvement.

A 17-year-old female patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 vaccine, formulation: solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0198), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Deltoid Right on 29Jun2021 (17-year-old at the time of vaccination) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medication(s) included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) 40 mg once daily taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. On 30Jun2021, the patient experienced Vomited, got really shaky, not able to drive and bad headache. The patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine but tested positive to covid 5 days after sars-cov-2 test positive on 05Jul2021. The reporter stated her daughter received the first dose and then ended up testing COVID positive. She received her first Pfizer Vaccine and she ended up with Covid positive, 5 days later. So, my question is with her second vaccine, do they recommend any way or not, should we, because she had the first one and became infected. She also had side effects from the first vaccine. Side effects: Pharmacist stated,&#34; I know she vomited, she got really shaky, really bad headache and she was not able to drive.&#34; Laboratory test: Pharmacist stated, &#34;No lab but she tested COVID positive e on 05Jul2021 from &#39;PCR&#39; (Not spelled) COVID test. The outcome of the events were unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included PCR sars-cov-2 test: positive on 05Jul2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

                                                12 hours after receiving the second dose of Pfizer I felt fatigued and my injection site was red and swollen. 24 hours after the vaccine I was experiencing abdominal cramping, headache, and fatigue. 48 hours after I developed a severe full-body rash/hives/welts. It started as a small patch on my left arm and progressed to my hips, legs, arms, chest, back, and face - my whole body. The rash is extremely itchy and has caused me to bust blood vessels from scratching so hard and frequently. I began rotating Benadryl and Zyrtec, but it seemed to make it worse. I visited the ER in the middle of the night on 4/18 where I was given steroids and Benadryl IM along with Pepcid. The rash went away a few hours after, but has since then reappeared and I am currently running a low grade fever of 100.2. I am taking Prednisone 20mg 3x a day as prescribed by my doctor along with Benadryl 50mg every four hours and Pepcid twice a day. Despite these medications the rash continues to persist.

I spoke to the patient and when she said she was ok I had her sit down on the chair. After about 15 minutes patient and father left and confirmed that she was doing ok.  Next morning patients dad called and said she was doing fine, that we might need to fill out paper work regarding the incident to submit it at patients school so she would not have to take the second dose.

                                                within 34 hours of the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid shot, patient began to break out in welts/hives behind her knees. She woke up in the middle of the night with her scalp itching and her ears hot as well as the welts behind her knees. Given Benadryl which helped a little for about 2 hours but then the hives just kept spreading and growing into huge swollen itchy patches on her body. By Friday afternoon, she had tried Benadryl and calamine lotion only to have it continue to get worse. We ended up with the Urgent care by 4pm Friday, 4-30-21. They gave her Prevacid and prescribed steroid cream. They told us if it got worse or affected breathing to go ER. We went home and kept taking the benedryl every 6 Hours and using the steroid cream. as one welt would begin to disappear, others would pop up. the steroid cream did not help in that regard. the benedrul would give about 50% relief for about 2 hours before the itching got very bad. Unable to sleep to do anything, we took patient to the pediatrician that Sat morning 5-1-21. She examined her and told her to take Claritin in the morning and Zyrtec at night to help. She was hestiant to prescribe any steroids due to unknown interaction or affects with the Covid shot. She told us to keep checking in with her and also if it got worse or spread to her face/mouth or any trouble breathing to go to the ER. We went home and tried to take an oatmeal bath. It only made things worse. By 10pm that Sat night 5-1-21, the hives had spread to patient&#39;s face and lips and were affecting her throat. Her voice got very raspy. we decided at that point to take her to the ER. They started her on steroids that night. She continued taking the steroids for 5 days after that. The steroids did help make her hives go away. However, within 2 days of finishing the steroids, patient noticed that she still did not feel 100%. That Saturday 5-8-21, She began to feel light-headed and off. She also began to feel fatigued. She came home from an errand needing to lay down and feeling dizzy. A few days after that, she began to have gas and indigestion, feeling like something caught in her throat and feeling nauseous. She also noticed that there a few nights in all of this that she would wake up shivering for no reason. The shivering would continue until she woke up in the morning. This report is being filed on 5-30-21. Since her 2nd shot and after the hives, we have been dealing with ongoing dizziness, fatigue, tiredness, lightheadedness and nausea to varying degrees. She has not been able to resume regular activates of being active or working out. WE have been back to the dr.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; formulation solution for injection; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on an unspecified date as 2ND DOSE,SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s Disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on 31Mar2021 for covid-19 immunization and experienced severe indigestion, vomiting and did not feel well. On an unspecified date (36 hours after receiving the second dose of vaccine), the patient broke out with hives and patches all over the body with extreme itching, her ears turned red and became very hot, the hives spread to her face and into the throat. The patient was prescribed steroid creams, and she self-administered three antihistamines included Zyrtec, Claritin, &amp; Benadryl. The hives went away. After that on an unspecified date, the patient had gastrointestinal (GI) issues, she had very gassy feeling of something stuck in the throat, and had nausea to the point of being unable to eat. Also, she shivered and shakes out of the blue, felt lightheaded and dizzy with extreme fatigue. The patient received treatment with steroid creams, and antihistamines included Zyrtec, Claritin, &amp; Benadryl for the events 36h after &#34;broke out with hives and patches all over the body with extreme itching and her ears turned red and became very hot, the hives spread to her face and into the throat. The caller (reporter) mentioned that she heard that the vaccine causes problems in fertility hence caller asked for information on fertility studies with regards to the vaccine in response she was explained reports on the possible side effects, mentioned no information found for non-reported AEs, and referred to health care professional (HCP) for further guidance. Further, caller asked for information on how to treat or go about with the side in response she was informed that Pfizer was unable to make treatment recommendations specific for individual patients and referred to HCP for further guidance. Again, Caller asked, &#34;how the vaccines work&#34; in response she was explained about vaccine mechanism and CDC information. Caller asked if there was a way to measure the spiked proteins in the body as caller wanted to know how to measure/assess immunity after vaccination in response she was being explained about CDC recommendation, and referred to HCP for further guidance. Moreover, caller asked if there were other proteins in the body/organs/cells that were similar to the spike protein that our body could possibly react to in response mentioned that no information found on body components similar to the SARS-CoV2 Spike Protein, and she was referred to HCP for discussion. Caller complained and mentioned &#34;reporter don&#39;t think all this information is being made public, it just seems to me like the issues for the vaccine is much worse for her than as if she got COVID19. Reporter really hope that the Doctors/ CDC / Pfizer and all organizations would reconsider this, especially on the possibility on the issue on the body attacking its own self.&#34; The outcome of the event hives was considered as resolved while the outcome of all other reported events was unknown at the time of this report.  Information on Batch/Lot number has been requested.

An 18-years-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8736, expiration date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation (Age at Vaccination: 18years).  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) 10mg/day (as medications in two weeks) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. No known allergies and no other vaccine in four weeks. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 15May2021, the patient felt dizzy, had cold sweating, was scared, and thought she was having a panic attack but felt more sick than usual. On 15May2021, the patient stood up from couch, walked 15 - 20 steps and then fell straight over on her face, hitting her chin and splitting it open; she was conscious when rolled over by her parents but had significant memory loss (knew her name but not her school grade or which classes she was taking). She was taken to the hospital, computerized tomogram (CT) Scan, electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal, and no evidence of seizure were there. On 15May2021, the patient was diagnosed with mild con-cussion and got stitches on the chin as therapeutic measure for her chin splitting. Doctor suggested dehydration may had been a factor, also insufficient food intake (had not eaten yet) (start date: 15May2021). The patient stayed home from school for a week with memory improving each day and still did not remember completely a period of 48 hours starting around time of vaccination however, other symptoms had resolved. The patient had never fainted before. The treatment for rest of events was unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan and EKG both as normal, both on 15May2021. The outcome for mild con-cussion and significant memory loss was recovering; and rest all events were resolved.

But later that night I couldn?t go to sleep and began to shake all over my body. I did not have shortness of breath, or heart pains- I just couldn?t stop shaking. I tried to control my breathing to help but it did nothing.  After the shaking stopped I tried to sleep again but I threw up twice and could not fall back asleep.

                                                The patient was in her usual state of health until the morning of Saturday 5/29/2021, when she woke up with an acute-onset right-sided headache and started screaming, followed by encephalitic presentation with urination on her mom&#39;s office desk and altered mental status. She also had right-sided facial droop. Patient was not oriented to person, place, nor time.   The patient was started on acyclovir 650mg every 8 hours for 14 total days (day 1 = 5/30/2021) and had relatively rapid improvement over the course of the first 2-4 days  despite negative HSV 1/2 PCR. She was continued on this treatment for the duration of her hospitalization as well as for one week as an outpatient via PICC line (final day = 6/11/2021).   She has not had another episode of altered mental status since the onset of treatment and is now symptom-free with mild, transient headaches lasting a matter of seconds to minutes.

Her mother, who was next to her, caught her in her chair and told us that this happens often when she is anxious. We immediately called 911. She was in and out for a few moments so we placed out a mat for her. When she came back to conciseness, she reported pain in her joints and acid reflux. We were able to give her fimotidine for the acid reflux.

About 5-10 min later she had developed a red, slightly raised blotch area around the injection site and down her left arm.  She said it did not itch, but felt warm and slight burning feeling.  Patient complained of being hot and nervous, but breathing was normal no chest tightness.  We had her get up and go outside (with 2 nursing staff members) to see if fresh air and no mask would help calm her.  On coming back in, the rash was still present and a small patch developed on her other arm.  WE gave her a cold compress and measured out 75mg of liquid diphenhydramine.  She took the diphenhydramine.  After about 5min, we saw the rash spread to her chest and connect the upper right and upper left arm area rashes.  We then called EMS to come assess the patient.  After assessment by the EMT and speaking with her PCP the patient decided not to go to the hospital for observation.  Rash was still present 1 hour later when patient left.  Breathing remained normal throughout the entire event and no swelling of face/tongue.

I was out of breath and would feel excruciating pain whenever I would move around. I thought I was dying or going to die because of the pain I felt and spent the next 3 days resting in bed.

However, at 5 in the morning on July 21, 2021, the second day after receiving my shot, I was not able to leave my toilet, or I was going there every ten minutes. With a trash can in front of me puking out anything I had ate the day before and earlier that morning, and having explosive diarrhea on the other end. This lasted all day to the point I couldn?t eat and was sore. The next morning still having diarrhea, but fortunately able to hold down a cracker because it went right through the other end. I had COVID-19 in February 2021, and there is nothing given for these side effects, and honestly, cannot make it away from home or the toilet to make it to the doctor. I have missed now three days of work instead of the expected 1 due to these side effects.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I did not experience any symptoms until the night following the vaccination.  Around 3:30am (01/14/2021), I was awoken by intense chills.  I was restless throughout the rest of the night, having hot and cold flashes.  I woke up around 8:20am and felt that I had a subjective fever.  I was also experiencing intense body ache and headache.  I took my temperature and it showed to be 100.6ºF.  I was still experiencing chills despite also feeling hot at the same time.  After an hour, my temperature was 101ºF.  I took 2 naproxen sodium tablets (440mg) to relieve fever.  Around 10:45am, my fever reduced but my body ache and headache stayed at the same pain level.  Around 2pm, I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen (400mg).  My headache stopped around 8:00pm.  My body aches stopped the morning of 01/15/2021.

Thursday night, My heart started racing very quickly and it lasted for 30 minutes - my whole chest was hurting really bad and my heart was beating hard. I had a monitor  - 207 beats per minutes. Blood pressure was normal. ER - monitored my heart. I think they gave me some medication. They gave me a heart monitor to check my heart for next 14 days. There was not another occurrence.

                                                Around 7-7:30 PM, I started to feel weird tingly feelings run up and down all of my limbs at the same time but it was over in about 2 minutes. Then I couldn?t stop my eyes from continuously rolling back into my head. That happened for about 4 minutes or so sometimes it would happen like 3 or 4 times in a row and sometimes it would be every 20 seconds or so. I was extremely confused and forgetful for the next 40 minutes and then I slowly began to be able to recall stuff.

I examined patients tongue and it did not appear swollen. Patient denied and shortness of breath or trouble swallowing. Patient states she had a reaction in the past to a medication that caused severe swelling of her tongue in which she now has a prescription for epi pens Vital signs were taken and were normal (BP 110/70, HR 80, O2 SAT 100%). Patient was given water and asked to sit for an additional 30 minutes. Patient reports itchy sensation had gone away and she believes it was more anxiety related.

                                                Upon resting later the day of my vaccine at home, my left arm because extremely painful and sore. Which I found to be normal and expected. However, I became very exhausted suddenly and ended up falling asleep 2-3 hours before my normal bedtime.  I woke up 12 hours later unable to motivate myself to get out of bed. Finally, I did and went to go take a shower. I had chills as soon as I got out of bed and had to sit down in the shower for 10 minutes out of exhaustion and had the water running extremely hot but I was still cold. My arm was still in extreme pain. Finally, I arose from the shower floor and began showering when I started to feel as if I was going to puke right away. I laid down in the shower quickly becoming dizzy, and tried to puke. I dry heaved once to no avail. Immediately after dry heaving, my ears went numb and the shower noise was barely audible. My hands went completely numb. Home alone, I knew I needed to get out of the shower before I passed out. I managed to step out of the shower before immediately falling and possibly blacking out for some seconds and fell to the floor and laid there for a minute. Finally, I was somehow able to grab a towel and struggle to my bedroom and laid there numb for about 10 minutes.  This episode ended at about noon but for the rest of the day, I had to sleep on and off, it exhausted me to try and eat,  I had hot flashes, more dizziness, arm pain, and nausea. I called the doctor and they said there was nothing they could do and my symptoms were normal since I had COVID-19 in December.

It never went away even while I was sleeping. I know this because I woke up multiple times throughout the night because of it. Tylenol, an ice pack, and peppermint oil did not help it. I get migraines often and these always work for those but didn&#39;t work for the headache caused by the vaccine.

                                                While talking to my parents I started to say things completely opposite of the conversation we were having. My speech began to slur and then I passed out/fainted and was unconscious for approx 1 minute. Once I came to I was disoriented and nauseated.

                                                Patient slumped into chair in the observation area. I rushed to her. She was hyperventilating, but not wheezing or making any high pitched sound while breathing. Patient was conscious, and could answer my questions coherently. Patient was told to take off her mask so she can breath more easily. Patient kept saying &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; and was told there&#39;s nothing to feel sorry for, and we wanted to make sure she was fine. Pulse was slightly elevated. Hands were warm and sweaty. Patient asked for a bottle of water. After drinking some water she felt better. It was likely a panic attack episode. I checked on her five minutes later. She just finished talking on the phone with a family or friend. She was a lot better at this point. She agreed that that was likely a panic attack. I advised her she should be able to receive the 2nd dose later, but should consult her PCP.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date not reported), intramuscular on 23Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergies from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, it was unknown if the patient has been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine 60 mg taken for an unspecified indication, and an unspecified oral contraceptive. It was reported that on 23Mar2021, the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine and felt a little dizzy on 11:00. She also started noting mumbling, slurred speech, passed out for about 15 (unspecified) after using the bathroom, developed a &#34;static&#34; feeling in her head and then noted her left eye shutting and then weakness in her left arm and leg. She was taken to the Emergency Room (ER) for evaluation. Symptoms lasted about 5 hours. She fell asleep in the ER. Symptoms seemed to clear by about 8:30 PM. She had lab and head CT at the hospital which were essentially normal. She felt okay the next day, but had some nausea for a couple days starting on the 3rd day on 25Mar2021. She stated she feels fine at the time of report in the Student Health Clinic and asked whether she should receive her second Pfizer dose scheduled on 20Apr2021. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The outcome of the event nausea was recovered in Mar2021, and for other events was recovered on 23Mar2021 20:30.   Information about lot/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product BNT162B2 and the reported event Passed out.

I advised her to sit and I would get help.  as I turned she was standing next to me holding her chest saying she isnt feeling right.  they put her on a bed and was looking for a blood pressure cuff.  they placed a pulseox on her finger which showed 100.  then they placed another clip on her other finger and it showed her heart rate increasing to 138 from 93 in seconds. her face was red her neck was red and she said her heart was racing.   they finally found a BP cuff and her blood pressure was 148/94 which they said this was normal.  it was not. they they told us to seek medical attention.  She continued to complain about chest pain and racing and her face and next continued to be red.  the nurse then gave her 50ml of benadryl with no relief.  She was taking out by wheelchair to a waiting ambulance then to the Hospital Emergency Room.  They treated her with a Steroid and IV.  She was released after about 3 hours.  we came home and 2 hours later went back to the same Emergency room for the same chest pain and racing  at which point  she now had a rash on chest and neck.  this time they gave her medicine to slow down her heart which made her feel better.  she was then released.   Since then she continues to have heart papatations and rashes, and a heard time swallowing with a continue feeling something is stuck in her throat.

                                                At 7:40 pm on 04/27 I received my second Pfizer COVID19 shot. I felt okay for the rest of the night and went to bed around 2am that night. The next day, I woke up around 10:30am and was sore until about 12pm when I began to feel completely awful. I was tired and no pain reliever helped with the muscle aches in my shoulders and back. I felt like my chest was being weighed down and it felt like a horrible chore to even breathe. About 24 hours after the shot, under my jaws began to hurt terribly and ice didn&#39;t do much to help it. I finally fell asleep on 04/28 around 2am and woke up on 04/29 without any pain.

She came up to the counter to tell us and by the time we got to her with a chair she fainted into the technicians arms.  We sat her down and she was only unconscious for about 3 seconds.  We called 911.  She asked for some water and we also gave her some OJ.  By the time the paramedics got here she was pretty much back to normal and said she knew it was because she was anxious.  She signed a refusal for the paramedics and sat for a few more minutes before she said she felt fine to leave.

A 19-year-old female patient received bnt162b2, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received a call saying that her first dose was invalid because it had not been properly stored, there was a quality assurance measure that was done and the cold chain temperure had been broken. She believes she got some immunity from the first vaccine though because her arm hurt and she slept for 12 hours after the vaccine. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                After receiving my first vaccine on 4/13/21, I had a small asthma attack after about 20 minutes that went away quickly. After my second dose, I started feeling out of control of my muscles almost immediately. I also noticed the injection site was bleeding more than the first shot. 30 minutes later, the shaking became extensive and uncontrollable. I returned to clinic and the paramedics told me I was having an anxiety attack. The shaking continued on and at about 4:00pm I felt that my throat was puffing up. I went to the hospital and they put me on a variety of medications (Benadryl, Pepcid, and methylprednisolone). I felt better soon after. The next morning I have a sore throat, feel feverish and have a headache.

After about 5-10 minutes, she slumped in her chair, then fell to the floor. She seemed to hit her head on the concrete floor. She was unresponsive at first, but had pulse and clear airway. Staff turned her on her side and protected. Her eyes were fluttering and rolling back. Within 3 minutes, she was able to respond to questions with her name, though she was disoriented. EMS was called at that time. She stated she had not eaten anything today, so she was given small sips of apple juice. After 5 more minutes, she was more oriented and responding to commands. EMS arrived and assisted her to a seated position. She was transported by EMS to hospital.

                                                Dizziness and fatigue in head developed and lasted for two weeks after the shot that was administered on April 25th..  About 5 days after the shot in the evening, I experienced hot, shooting pain in left leg that felt like a band around my thigh but would sometimes shoot down into my calf and feet. My feet would feel tingly and sore. I experienced shooting pain on and off again in my left and right arms as well as my right leg, but the pain in my left thigh stayed for over a week. The feeling in my legs made it difficult to sleep.  Two weeks after the shot on Wednesday May 12th at 11am, the dizziness and fatigue made me lightheaded and I could not keep my eyes open. My head got really hot and my vision blurred and I could feel my heart beating in my head loudly and all over my body. I tried to walk to my thermometer to take my temperature but struggled to hold things in my hands or walk properly. My sister called my mother who took me to the Emergency Room around 11:50. The doctors took urine and blood samples, X-rayed my chest and did an EKG but could not figure out what was wrong with me and discharged me at 3pm.

                                                As soon as patient exited the vaccination room and sat in the waiting room chair she started to feel lightheaded and slumped over and fainted.  She lost consciousness for less than a minute.  She lost color in her skin and was confused when she woke up.  Her mother and brother were with her and called for help.  The pharmacist and a technician also went out to assist.  Patient was seated in the chair and assisted the whole time not to fall out or get up and walk after waking back up.  She was given a cold compress and water.  Her blood pressure was taken and was WNL. We asked them to stay in the pharmacy an additional 15-30 minutes after to watch over her.  Her mother and brother were able to stay with her in the waiting room.  After resting for an additional 20 minutes patient was able to walk out on her own and color returned to her body.  Her mother felt comfortable taking her home at this point.  Patient is very nervous about shots and had little to eat today.

                                                My daughter was fine on the first day.  She woke up the next day with a weird headache that her scalp hurt.  She went into work and started to feel poorly throughout the day.  When she came home, she went to bed at 4:30 pm as she had aches &amp; pains, continued headache, felt nauseous, tired, and noticed her left leg where she had surgery previously was bothering her with pins and needles. I told her to go to bed and she would be fine the next day. On 5/26, her leg was giving her increased problems where she could not flex her foot, nerve pain in her leg along with numbness, and she still had the headache. I told her to call her primary care physician and the nurse had her go the the ER.  They ran no tests, but consulted with neuro on call and surgeon who performed surgery on her leg two years ago.  She was instructed to follow-up with a neuro and start PT.  We got her into a PT. The next day she continued to have same issues, but her leg pain increased.  She followed up via phone twice to primary where the nurse told her to go back to the ER. She had blood work, ultra sound and x-ray.  She saw neurologist on  6/2 and is scheduled for follow-up with an EMG on 6/14.  She has seen physical therapist 6x since 5/26 and still has numbness, nerve pain, etc.  The form from neuro office said left foot drop and parathesia. She has had headaches this week including a migraine on 6/8.

When I looked in a mirror, I noticed a red splotch on my forehead that felt slightly raised like it was swollen. Sunday morning I checked and it was mostly gone. It?s now a very pale red almost normal skin color and less sore but still is to touch.

                                                So I had some on and off chest pain for the week after I got the vaccine, I didn&#39;t think it was because of the vaccine initially. It started to get consistent and then 2 weeks after the vaccine it became very intense pain to where I could not carry anything or sit or stand comfortably. About three weeks after my vaccine I was able to get in with a PCD and she did not attribute it to the vaccine, she put me on 600MG of Motrin every 8 hours and that managed the pain pretty well. She wanted me to take the meds for a week but the pain continued so I am now still taking the medicine. I saw my own PCD a week later and she ran a lot of tests, still no definitive answers.

                                                1. My period, which I got on April 20th (18 days after dose 2), resulted in extreme and debilitating cramps, which are lasting to this day. They&#39;re so bad I can&#39;t get out of bed for the first two days of my period - then I have infrequent occasional pangs of pain on day 3, and I&#39;m okay days 4 and 5. I have never had cramps during my cycle before April 2021.   2. On April 16th, I was driving my car and I noticed that when I had my foot on the the brake, it was shaking uncontrollably in almost every position I put my leg in. The frequency of this leg tremor during driving became more frequent, and I started noticing heightened anxiety, trouble focusing, weight loss of 7 pounds thus far (my weight has not fluctuated more then 3 pounds in the last 4 years so this was a surprise to me), lightened period, increased heat intolerance, heart palpitations that keep me awake at night and tachychardia, muscle weakness, and fatigue. I had a really stressful semester in school so I chalked these symptoms up to anxiety.  Then, in the first week of June, I went to the gynecologist to get the cramps situation checked out. She told me she wanted me to check out my thyroid for the rest of the symptoms. When my blood test came back, my Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) result came back as 0.03 (lowest acceptable range is 0.4). My primary care provider ran T3 and T4 tests, which came back as 15 and 5, respectively - which are both quite elevated for their range. So, I went to an endocrinologist at my primary care provider&#39;s referral, who ran more tests. This time, they found TSH to be 0.006 (got lower), T3 and T4 were elevated, very slightly lower than they were before. My endocrinologist then ran a test for Thyroglobulin antibody, which came back as 53.3, when the highest reference value was 0.9. Thus, my endocrinologist determined hyperthyroidism, but wanted to figure out the what I had so she sent me for a thyroid uptake scan. In the scan, they found my thyroid to be working at 51%, when the highest value after 24 hours of receiving the radioactive iodine was 33%, and my endocrinologist determined that I had Graves&#39; Disease, an autoimmune hyperthyroid disease.   I am now on Methimazole and Propranolol for Graves&#39; Disease.   I don&#39;t know if the vaccine caused my horrendously painful cramps and the onset of the autoimmune disease, but I just wanted the CDC to know! I am curious to know if there is a correlation.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

The next morning she woke up with a stuffy nose and head and lethargy. Her symptoms progressed to fever, chills and body aches by the afternoon. She didn&#39;t feel well enough to eat through the evening and at midnight she became nauseas and had stomach cramps. She was then simultaneously vomiting and having diarrhea with moderate-to-severe stomach cramping for approximately an hour. After, the chills were even worse and the nausea continued. The second day after the  vaccine she continued to have an upset stomach and lethargy. The lethargy and slightly upset stomach continued into the third day after being vaccinated. I cannot report further because this is the third day.

Pt was sitting in chair and was lowered to the floor when she slumped and started to have a seizure.  As soon as she was on the floor she snapped awake.  She was disoriented for a moment but was aware.  After a few minutes she sat back down in chair and her blood pressure was taken.  it was 139/81 with HR of about 79.  The fire department came in at this point.  Eventually, the fire dept released her as she was with her mother.

I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

                                                Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. Upon administration, patient reported she felt as though she was having an anxiety attack. She then fainted and started falling forward in her chair. The pharmacist and technician caught the patient as she fell forward and as they were leaning her back in the chair she began seizing in their arms for approximately 5-10 seconds (no more than 20-30 seconds). At this point, the patient spoke and stated that was weird and said she felt lethargic. Another technician was on the phone with 911 at this time. We gave her a bottle of water and kept the patient seated in the immunization room until EMS arrived. She was complaining of being very hot and lethargic. EMS arrived and checked her vitals and recommended the patient go with them to the hospital due to B/P and pulse being very low (exact vitals were not communicated to us). She agreed to go to the hospital and we will be following up with the patient tomorrow.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine was injected, I felt like I got slugged in the arm. I also had a momentary hot flash. Then, I went to go sit in the waiting area, and I continued to get warmer and warmer. After 5 minutes, I went up to the front desk, and told them I didn?t feel well and that I felt like I was overheating. They put me in a wheelchair, and I immediately passed out and hallucinated for a minute or two. I felt incredibly weak, and I had sweat completely through my shirt. A paramedic came and put me in a stretcher in a cornered off area of the clinic. After 30 minutes or so, I started feeling better, but I got several spirts of cold flashes. All of my vitals came back normal.

I woke up around 2:40am 4/14 trembling as if I was having a seizure (it did not feel like chills) and extreme aches. I took my temperature and was at 100.8. I took another extra strength tylenol and tried to calm down. At around 3:30 the trembling stopped and I was finally able to relax a bit. I fell back asleep around 5am and woke up at 9:00am with more extreme aches and pain. I switched to ibuprofen (400mg) and that worked way better. My fever was at 101.8 when I woke up. Around mid morning and afternoon I was feeling fine just a bit achy and fatigued and my fever broke to 99. I took a nap around 2pm and woke up feeling bad again with a fever of 100.6. I took another 400mg of ibuprofen and that got me through my class and the evening feeling okay. Before bed, I was feeling achy and fatigued yet again. I took 200mg of ibuprofen and went to bed just fine. I woke up at 4:30am 4/15 for my clinical feeling back to normal. I have been fine ever since.

                                                My right arm was sore almost immediately after being vaccinated, but it wasn?t bad. Then later at night when I was trying to get to sleep I was horribly restless, shaking, and feverish. I had to bundle up in blankets because I was so cold. My whole body ached terribly, and I had a headache. It lasted a few hours and I couldn?t get to sleep. At one point I felt extremely nauseous and ran to the bathroom, barely holding back vomit, but then it went away and never came back. The day after that (April 15th) I was extremely fatigued and still had body aches and a headache. I took my temperature at 5 am on April 15th and it was 99.4°. I mostly just slept a lot and didn?t have much of an appetite. My arm was still a little sore during this whole time. As I?m writing this at 5 am on April 16th, I still have a headache.

                                                After I was administered the vaccine at the University, after spending a few minutes I began to feel a sensation in my throat as if it were swelling, scratching and when I swallowed I did not feel it. Every time the minutes passed I felt it more. After the 15 minutes passed, I notified him and a paramedic gave me all the vital signs which had an elevated blood pressure and an elevated pulse. They took me to the ambulance where I was under supervision. I continued with the sensation of throat and dizziness. I took the medicine that the doctor had prescribed: benadryl and prednisone in case of having an allergic reaction. I continued with the symptoms and my mother was watching me in case of having difficulty breathing and when I got home I got a little nauseous. Present tiredness and pain in the area that disappeared on Sunday. From Sunday until today I have presented insomnia since it is difficult for me to sleep and I manage to sleep a few hours.

The next day the body soreness was severe enough to where it was painful to clench my fist or walk even a small distance. I also experienced nausea, loss of appetite, migraines and light sensitivity, and was unable to do normal tasks around the house for about 3-4 days. The full body soreness was the most debilitating symptom and certain aresa like elbows, knees, wrists and hips were painful to the touch. I think my joints were most affected. The soreness and pain can be compared to a flu but it was more intense than anything i have experienced before.

                                                During the second vaccination I was on my period. After 3 hours of  getting the vaccine I started having large emotional spells. It made me start to have suicidal thoughts, a panic attack every other hour and overall get overwhelmed very quickly. The suicidal thoughts specifically started 6 hours after the vaccine and lasted through the whole night and day after receiving the vaccine. Thankfully I was able to reach out to other people in my support system, but I was not expecting to feel that way and get those thoughts and feelings right after receiving the shot.  I think that there should be more research done with females who are on their periods when getting the shot because I cannot be the only one who was affected by that factor.

A 20-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3248) via unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 18jan2021 09:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history includes recurring history of croup since she was young with her last croup diagnosis during Christmas of 2018. Concomitant medication reported as COLECALCIFEROL (NATURE MADE VITAMIN D3 2000iu, UPC Number: 3160403183, Lot Number: 2404901 and Expiration Date: Oct2023) continued taking both the first and second Covid-19 vaccine dose. After second vaccine she only took 2 ibuprofen 200mg tablets on first day. The patient historical vaccines included: flu vaccine in mid-Nov2020 and first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EK5730, Expiration Date: Unknown) via intramuscular route of administration in left upper arm on 28Dec2020 09:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had Injection site pain, Flu-like symptoms (clarified as flu minus vomiting), Headache, GI symptoms, Weakness, Fever, Muscle fatigue and leg shakiness with the first dose. There were no other vaccines administered within four weeks. On 18Jan2021 she experienced more interesting side effects. She had injection site pain the afternoon of 18Jan2021 by 20:00 that night (18Jan2021), she had laid down in bed, and she felt like she was being stung by wasps at the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. The injection site pain was not bad but the pain was constant and by the second day the injection site pain had faded. The bad injection site pain clarifying the injection site pain was a burning sensation. She said if she puts her hand on the vaccine injection site now, she can still feel a burning sensation. She said there is not swelling or redness at the vaccine injection site. She said she developed extremely swollen left axillary lymph nodes after her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said the left axillary lymph node swelling was so extreme it inhibited her left arm movement. She said she developed numbness and tingling in her left elbow and left wrist as well. She said the left axillary lymph node swelling has gone down, so the swollen lymph nodes are not impeding her left arm movement now. She said the left axillary lymph node remains swollen enough that her bra hits the swollen lymph node, making the left axillary lymph nodes painful. She said the numbness and tingling in her left elbow and left wrist is less frequent, but not gone. She said her side effects after the second COVID-19 Vaccine didn&#39;t improve for probably 4-5 days after they developed. She said the left axillary lymph node swelling has improved marginally, and the vaccine injection site burning sensation is less, but the left elbow and left wrist numbness and tingling is persistent. On 23Jan2021 or 24Jan2021 she developed fatigue, persistent diarrhea, weakness, headache, and very mild chills and muscle aches. She said she had no fever. Her symptoms lasted 2 days and then completely resolved on Jan2021. She said her left elbow and left wrist numbness and tingling is persisting. She said the vaccine injection site still hurts (burning sensation), and her left axillary lymph nodes are still swollen. She said the burning sensation at the vaccine injection site has her concerned. She feels an increase in the burning sensation if she touches the vaccine injection site. The clinical outcome of the event vaccination site pain, swollen lymph node, numbness, tingling, Limb discomfort reported was recovering, outcome of the event burning sensation was not recovered, outcome of event Feeling abnormal and Lymph node pain was unknown and for other events it was recovered on Jan2021.    Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

I took the patient vitals at 10:25 am heart rate is 66, 02 100 and BP 105/71, again at 10:30 am heart rate 73, o2 100 and BP 101/69. I asked the patient how she was feeling. She stated that she was feeling better so i had her sit up the rest of the way and then stand up and then i made sure that she was not dizzy or light headed. The patient stated that she was back to her normal self. I released the patient home with mom and other sister at 10:35 am.

I?m a college athlete who normally works out find, but due to the shot even now (2 1/2 weeks later) I cannot lift any weight with my left arm. I?ve taken Tylenol almost every day since the shot. The first week my arm throbbed all night long. It?s not as bad now as the first week, but I still cannot lift with my left arm and wake up with a very fatigue arm.

A 20-years-old female patient (daughter) received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8733, Expiry date: Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in right upper arm on 20May2021 13:30 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medication was not reported. Patient historical vaccination was Flu vaccine on an unknown date in Sep2020 for immunization and first dose of BNT162B2 lot Number ER8733, Expiry Date: Jul2021 on 29Apr2021 at right upper arm for COVID-19 immunization and patient experienced little sore arm but it was no big deal. On 20May2021 patient experienced sore arms, had chills, her hands were very cold and her fingernails were purple. For a 3 hour period she had low grade temperature of 103.2F. Her heart was racing very fast. The mother gave her Tylenol in 15ml liquid form at 04:00 am and the temperature went down to 2 degrees. Her heart was still racing very fast at 5am. 3 hours later at 08:00 am her temperature was 101.5 F more Tylenol was given but her heart was still racing fast. Later that day it settled down. Her temperature went down to maybe a hundred and heart rate was slowly settling down. The mother said that it was really scary. They had call the doctor on Friday and talked with the nurse two times and the nurse said that they never heard anyone experienced a fever that high with the vaccine. She is asking if this was normal and if anyone has experienced this before. She is asking if ever there would be a third or booster dose, can her daughter take it after experiencing side effects after the second dose. She went back this past Thursday 20May2021 around 1:30pm for the second dose and she felt fine. About 10 hours later that night, she started not feeling well. She had gotten her second dose 3 days before and had a low grade fever, body aches, chills and didn&#39;t feel well for 24 to 48 hours. She started not feeling well and started getting chills. She was shaking really bad at 1:00 in the morning. She really didn&#39;t feel good. She took her temperature and it was 100.5. Her hands were freezing and her finger nails were purple. Her hands were cold and she was getting a fever. She guesses that can happen. Lasted a little longer from 1:00 until about 3:30 in the morning. Caller was up with her the entire night. Her fever went up to 103.2. Her heart was beating really fast. Caller was getting really scared and was thinking about taking her to the emergency room. She thought this was really weird. She gave her Tylenol trying to hold off. She was trying not to give her too much because there are dozens of interactions. She needed to give her something. Within an hour, it brought her fever down about 2 degrees and was then around 101.5. Her heart rate was still pretty fast. Was still a bit concerned but was glad her fever went down. Other than that, she seemed fine. Her daughter was drinking a lot of water to keep hydrated and was peeing a lot because she was drinking so much water. She seemed okay after that but her heart was still beating faster. Her daughter got up, she didn&#39;t sleep very much, and got up around 8:00 am, about 4 hours after taking the Tylenol. She didn&#39;t have a high fever but it was still around 101. She gave her more Tylenol and her heart was still beating fast. Reporter did not time it to see how fast it was. She could just tell that it was beating fast, like she was doing aerobics or something. Her daughter got the shot in her right arm. It really felt lumpy under her arm pit. Caller had read that some people get that, their lymph nodes get inflamed. Consumer only gave those 2 doses of Tylenol, her daughters fever got better. Her heart rate went back to normal and she seems fine now. She said her lymph nodes under her right arm seem like they are feeling better- before, she couldn&#39;t even put her arm down because they hurt so bad. She does seem to have improved; This was last Thursday and this is Tuesday. She did call the doctors office and talked to the nurse who said she hadn&#39;t heard of a fever that high. Said that sometimes when people get a fever, their heart rate can increase and that it is not unheard of. She didn&#39;t think that she had to be seen because she was improving. It bothered her the next few days. She heard on TV that kids were getting heart inflammation. Heart beating really fast: Reporter felt her wrist and felt her heart beating really fast. Lasted a little longer, until about 3:30 in the morning. Her daughters heart was beating so fast, it felt as if she were exercising but, she was sitting still. Her daughter seems fine now and caller has been checking her every day. Arm sore and lumpy under arm pit: This happened the next morning, Friday. Her daughter felt like she couldn&#39;t move and wanted to take a shower. She felt so sweaty and she couldn&#39;t touch her arm pit because it hurt so much. Reporter had read that some peoples lymph nodes get inflamed. It seemed better as the day went on. Treatment: Had  only 2 doses of Tylenol. Her daughter doesn&#39;t swallow pills, so she had given her Children&#39;s strength Tylenol that is for children ages 2-11. She had only given her 15ml, which for her wasn&#39;t a lot. It says it&#39;s for up to 80 pound kids. Gave her 15ml at 04:00 am and it did bring it down 2 degrees. She gave her the same dose at 8:00 am. It wasn&#39;t even an adult strength dose. Fever: Her daughter&#39;s fever went away. She went back to bed, she had only slept from 05:00 am to possibly 08:00am, and didn&#39;t even sleep well then. After the second dose of Tylenol, her daughter went back to bed. Later in the afternoon, when her daughter got up, it seemed like she had a fever but a low grade fever, probably around 100. She hasn&#39;t seen it go back up. It seemed like it had settled down. Caller has been checking every day. Chills: Occurred after the second dose, maybe about 10 hours after on 20May2021. Called the CDC yesterday but was not able to talk to a person. She left some messages with the vaccine adverse something but no one ever called her back. Tests: She hasn&#39;t had any blood work done recently. She had her yearly check up last September.

After two hours, the chills stopped but my fever was still at 102. I went back to sleep at 3:00 am and woke up without a fever but still felt very tired and groggy for the next two days. Also, am not sure if it is related, but I am usually very regular on my menstrual cycle, but was 20 days late after getting the first vaccine. I know this because I track my menstrual cycle. Also, when my period did finally come, it was the most painful period that I have had in a while. The cramping was very painful and I bled very heavily.  Although, I got my second shot on the 27th of May and had no symptoms. I also, to my knowledge, did not have covid prior to getting either shot.

The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ongoing Tri-lo-sprintec (started taking it to regulate her cycle as she had an irregular period; she started this birth control 2 or 3 years ago). On 22May2021, the patient waited 15 minutes after the shot and felt fine, but later on that day (a couple of hours after) she got chills (about three hours after the vaccine). She stated she had normal side effects and did not think anything of it. On Sunday (23May2021), she had difficulty breathing (trouble breathing) and felt weak (feeling very weak and has no energy). She voiced it&#39;s hard for her to wear a mask. When she had to put a mask on it really felt like she could not breathe, and the air feels stuffy especially if she wears a mask; every couple of seconds she had to wear the mask under her nose because she could not breathe. Caller stated that she did not have this problem before receiving the COVID vaccine. On Monday (24May2021), she felt like she was coming down with a cold. Caller stated that she thought that might be her trouble breathing was from her cold-like symptoms, but she does not think it was, because she was not experiencing any cold-like symptoms on Sunday and was only having trouble breathing. She experienced coughing, sneezing, itching eyes/nose, chills, and headache. On Wednesday (26May2021), she started feeling nauseated (got very nauseous), not feeling good, she was getting a headache and had caught a cold. Caller stated she did not know if it was from vaccine shot but her eyes got itchy, her nose got itchy, and she kept sneezing and coughing. Yesterday (26May2021), the chills went away, she has not had any chills today, but she does not know if she will have any from this point on. She believed that she has recovered with lasting effects. Caller stated that not feeling well was ongoing and persisting, but then stated that she feels it was worsening. Yesterday, she just felt nauseous, today she woke up with her stomach hurting very badly and abdominal pain; her weakness has continued. Yesterday she took pantoprazole for the abdominal pain and Tylenol for the pain and headache. She stated that she had a slight headache that is now coming and going, clarifies that it is persisting. Caller thought the reason that her stomach is hurting was because of her stomach acid problem. She deals with a strict diet that she must follow for things she was not supposed to have. Since she had the COVID shot, she believes it was affecting the acid problems in her stomach. Caller clarified that she was calling to see what she should do, if she should go see a doctor or if this is normal. The outcome of events Dyspnoea, Asthenia, Sneezing, Headache, stomach hurting, Itchy was not resolved. The outcome of events of Nausea, started not feeling good, Cold like symptoms was resolving. The outcome of events chills was resolved with sequel on 26May2021, and Cough resolved with sequel on 25May2021. The outcome of Abdominal pain was unknown.

It lasted until about 06/14/2021 and then I noticed the lymph node protrusion on Sunday and I went to the urgent care  Clinic on Monday  06/14/2021and they just said it would go away. At the Doctor they did blood pressure test and an EKG and they did EKG because I had vasovagal response after touching lymph node. There was a few nights in a row about a week after the vaccine, where I had insomnia and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep at all and had to take sleep aid. Lymph node swelling did go down and isn&#39;t inflamed anymore.

                                                On both my first and second shot I got really bad brain fog. I went to the ER after my first shot on June 29, 2021 but they told me it was a psychological thing and that I was freaking myself out and that it was not vaccine related but I knew the at wasn?t the case. After my first shot the pressure in my head remained for about a week and the brain fog and vision/auditory issues only occurred on the first day mainly. On my second shot today (07/20/2021) it occurred again and so I know it?s vaccine related, not psychological. On both shots it was an immediate reaction. As soon as the person began to inject the vaccine into me I would feel immediate pressure in my head (on the first shot it felt like the vaccine literally traveled to my fingertips in my left arm and up into my head, it was very strange). Then about 2-5 minutes after I got the vaccine on both occasions my vision became filled with floaters and my coherency decreased. The first vaccine was the worst as the floaters stayed longer and my vision would go in and out of bluriness more. On the second shot the floaters were very obvious for the first hour and then slowly decreased over time but it is currently 6 hours after my shot right now and I still see a couple. On my second shot my vision did blur but not as bad. Both times I felt tremendous pressure in my head and I couldn?t think straight or focus. My speech was very slow and the ordering of my words were inaccurate. My texting was bad because I couldn?t spell and the structure of my sentences was incorrect. I have issues putting words together to say what I want to say and I can?t concentrate. Both times I have stared at a wall in fixation for hours which is not normal. It?s not so much as a headache, just a lot of pressure and I?ve never experienced it with anything else in my life. After my second dose I was also extremely exhausted but could not sleep because of the pressure in my head. My memory is also affected as I cannot remember things very well. It takes me about 30 seconds to understand what someone says because I just can?t think. I feel like my cognitive processes are faulty. It?s like a very intense brain fog that affects my vision and on the first vaccine also affected my hearing as stuff sounded muffled.

This cramping slowly increased in discomfort and pain throughout the rest of the evening and into the night. Despite taking one caffeine 200mg pill (Equate Stay Awake), I was even more tired and feeling lightheaded. I didn&#39;t have diarrhea but I frequently went to the bathroom (unusual for me). I had really bad chills all throughout the night. I kept waking up in pain and vomited quite harshly. I felt like I had a fever. I took my temperature a total of three times after the worst of my symptoms had pasted. Once I was able to sit up without feeling too dizzy. I was extremely nauseous (this morning). I took my temperature. The first one at around 11 am said 98.4 (I&#39;m usually at 95.4 on a normal day). And I took it again (twice) at around 2 pm: the first one was 99.1 and the second was 99.2.

                                                Pt received Pfizer-COVID vaccine (under EUA) yesterday 16 Dec 2020 at approx 1700.  She did not have any immediate problems after vaccination.  .  She woke up today feeling achy and feverish, and measured her oral temp at 1000 as 101.4 at home.  She drank fluids, but took no meds -- repeat oral temp at 1200 was 99.0.  .  Other sxms include sore arm at vaccination site with min redness but no swelling.   .  She additionally reports nasal congestion and sore throat that began 1 day prior to vaccination, that she attributed to her seasonal allergies.  No meds for allergies.  No cough or SOB.  No headache or neuro sxms.  No GI sxms.  .  She was concerned about fever and went to drive-thru COVID testing at approx 1300... results due back in 24h.  She has no known COVID contacts.  .  She works in sterile processing at NMCSD with no direct patient contact usually; She is on night shift now.  -  Fever and achy symptoms, as above, in previously healthy hospital worker, with onset approx 18h after receipt of COVID-Pfizer vaccine, dose #1.  With questionable URI-like sxms one day prior to vaccination, COVID testing was very reasonable -- and results are pending now.  If COVID test negative, this most likely represents mild-moderate systemic reaction to vaccine.  Advised no work this evening, rest at home, increase clear fluids, and take Motrin 400mg q4-6h as needed for subjective fever or achiness -- use/precautions reviewed.  Will follow-up tomorrow with this team by phone.  If vaccine reaction, expect sxms to lessen rapidly and resolve over next 1-2 days.  Indications for urgent care -- including marked worsening of sxms or new sxms -- reviewed.  She also has number for 24/7 Immunization Support.  Will file VAERS, since work missed for sxms.  Will encourage enrollment in VSAFE as well.  Advised that, if mild-moderate systemic reaction determined most likely source of sxms, dose #2 of COVID-Pfizer vaccine will still generally be recommended.  Pt expresses understanding and appreciation of all issues.

However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                The morning after my second dose of Pfizer?s Covid-19 vaccine, I woke up feeling freezing (at 9:00 am) and suspected I had a fever.  After waking up again later (around 12:30 pm), I took my temperature and found that I have a fever of 101°F.  I still have a fever and chills (2:50 pm).  I have not taken any medication to treat the fever yet and plan to just take it easy.  If I begin to feel worse, I might take an ibuprofen.  After getting the vaccine, my left shoulder was sore, and is still sore, but it?s my understanding that this is normal, and just as my arm was sore with the first vaccine, it may be 2 days before my arm feels better.  I am not concerned about the soreness of my arm.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 09:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No family history relevant to adverse events. Patient has no concomitant medications. On 16Jan2021 09:20, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient felt like she was going to pass out reported as vasovagal reaction, and experienced heart beat was high, fatigue, woozy/dizzy, hard to concentrate, feeling hot, and felt as though she was on the verge of a headache but never got one/she felt like the blood was rushing to her head. On 16Jan2021 10:00, 1 hour after vaccination, the patient experienced had to fall asleep. On the day she got the shot she sat for a full hour with the nurse to be monitored. Then she went home. The events lasted from 09:20 until 18:00 on that day. 13 days after vaccination on 29Jan2021, 12:00 and ongoing until reporting time, the symptoms recurred about the same when they started. The patient was wondering if this could be a side effect 2 weeks after getting the shot or if she should look elsewhere on what could be causing these events. She is supposed to get the second dose on Friday and was wondering about getting the second dose after her experience. Patient wanted to know it is safer for her to have the 2nd dose. No physician office visit and emergency room visit. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was recovered on 16Jan2021 18:00.

Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

                                                I received my shot at 11:47 and started to lose sensation in my hands in the waiting area. After about 25 minutes I felt dizzy and was about to stand up but my muscles started shaking. My heart rate was checked and found to be 140. This lasted for about another 30 minutes. My heart rate went down and I was taken to a private area and checked out by EMS they gave me water and concluded it was some sort of panic attack. However, these are the same symptoms I have whenever I am allergic to a medication, NSAIDS, dicyclomine, etc. It always starts with ascending numbness from my fingers to the rest of my body. Then I start to shake and my heart rate goes way up. Usually I start to cough then vomit and my airway closes. Thankfully this time we were able to slow the process and I never experienced some of the last symptoms.

                                                On March 7, 2021 my daughter experienced extreme tiredness.  I called 911 and paramedics said it may be the effects of vaccine.  I was concerned because this symptom came on 2 weeks later.  On 3/6/21, I took her to urgent care because I didn&#39;t feel comfortable with her extreme tiredness.  I was told the same thing. On 2/23/2021, the day that she was supposed to get the second vaccine, she awoke at 12 midnight and was having a full blown psychotic episode.  She was make loud noises, hitting the wall, etc.  I then took her to the emergency room. My major concern was because my daughter has Down syndrome, a seizure disorder and had heart surgery at three months old (atrio ventricular canal defect).

About an hour after that I vomited and experience diarrhea. Returning to bed I had trouble sleeping due to the chills and headache bordering on migraine. Once I did fall asleep I would wake up dripping in sweat and needing to go to the bathroom for more diarrhea. This continued for several hours and several trips to the bathroom. The whole day after my vaccine I was unable to eat food, even the smell made me want to throw up. I was cold and nauseous all day.

She laid there for about 5 minutes and started to feel better so she sat on the chair for about 5 minutes before EMT&#39;s arrived as a precaution.  After getting check out she left on her own accord. She stated while talking that when she gave blood in the past this has happened.

My symptoms were gone within 24 hours of receiving vaccine. However my symptoms came back on Wednesday at 4pm (5 days after receiving vaccine). My arm was all of the sudden sore again and hot to touch. I had chills, couldn?t sleep through the night, and was nauseous for another 24 hours.

Eventually, at 48 hours after the injection, the headache, muscle soreness, and fatigue no longer lingered.

After 10 minutes, her body began to seize/shake for about 10-15 seconds and then she went completely limp in the chair she was seated in. I removed her mask to help with her breathing and lifted her head slightly. She began to seize/ shake again and then woke up. Patient was disoriented and reported of head pain, feeling  hot and rapid heart rate. We called 911 and EMT arrived a few minutes later, checked her vitals, which all came out normal, and spoke with the patient for a few minutes. Patient refused to go to the hospital and wanted to wait for her mother to arrive. She has no history of seizures and only takes Zyrtec OTC. The patient&#39;s mother arrived and spoke with the EMT personnel and I spoke with her as well. I recommended that the patient does not receive the second dose until she has been checked by a doctor and has been given approval to receive it. The patient recovered after about 20-30 min since the event and went home with her mother.

The patient had a heavy feeling in her chest and it felt like a lump in her throat. She was not having trouble breathing. I had her sit down next to her mother to monitor further. After about 5 more minutes, she felt like her symptoms were getting worse. She stated that she was feeling cold and shivering. I had her lay on the floor. I had my technician call 911. I stayed next to her to monitor. I had her also sit up to drink some water. She complained of her jaw starting to hurt and her head was throbbing. The paramedics arrived shortly after.

It was hard to focus on doing work and bright lights and loud noises made the headache worse. The next morning, I felt very fatigued and got very tired after even walking short distances. The headache was much lessened but still present. Advil was taken for the headache that night and the next day and helped a bit. Just rest was the most effective. My arm was sore for a couple days after each dose and went away over time. Period was late, as it was due in-between the doses but did not arrive until the day after the second dose (This could have been stress related but is very abnormal)

Over time they became less frequent and now, on week three, I&#39;m fine. However this has made me. Nervous about the second shot. I did not see any warnings of long term dizziness which is apparently not that uncommon.. This should be listed on the warnings for the vaccine. If this occurs again after my second dose I will file another report.

                                                A few hours after my shot I started to feel dizzy and nauseous. I threw up about 3 hours after I got it and had a fever. I went home where I had chills, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, and pain all over my body for most of the day. I took 2 ibuprofen. Both of my arms broke out in hives/rashes and were extremely itchy. At bedtime I was so cold with the chills that I had uncontrollable shaking and shivering even though I was completely bundled up. I took 2 more ibuprofen (6 hours had passed since I took the last 2). I could not sleep because my body was in so much pain and I couldn&#39;t eat or drink because, if I even took a sip of water, I would throw it up. I was getting up to vomit all night long. Eventually I could keep food down but I still couldn&#39;t sleep because my body was in so much pain. I took 2 ibuprofen (again, 6 more hours had passed) and I did fall asleep. The next morning I woke up and took 2 ibuprofen as I was in so much pain all over my body that I couldn&#39;t get up and out of bed. I stuck to the BRAT diet because my stomach was still upset and I didn&#39;t want to vomit again. After that I slowly started feeling better. I am not at 100% yet but huge improvement.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number and expiration date were not reported) on the left arm on 23Apr2021 (10:00) as a single dose, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included type 1 diabetes; peripheral neuropathy; autonomic neuropathy; and clinical depression. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included propranolol, gabapentin, metformin and duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA). On 23Apr2021 (18:00), the patient had neuropathy; had felt crazy; was irritable; had depression; and had felt extremely agitated and unstable. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient had no COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested post-vaccination.  Information on lot/batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                The patient stated that she had not received a vaccine in several years but that the last time she did, she blacked out for maybe 30 seconds and felt dizzy. She states she thinks it was because she did not eat that day and stood up too quickly because she felt ok after. I notified (pharmacist) to be on stand by in case any incidence occurred and we had smelling salts and epipen on hand. I had the patient sit in the vaccine chair afterwards and about 3 minutes later, she started screaming to the top of her lungs that she felt like she was going to die. She screamed that she couldn&#39;t breathe and that her chest and head were &#34;killing her&#34;. She kept screaming to remove the vaccine out of her arm (the liquid). Her eyes were starting to roll, but I knew she was breathing because she was screaming to not let her die. Her mother was with her and was very nervous and wanted emergency services, so We called 911. I took the girls hands and asked her to look me in the eyes and follow my deep breaths, because I began to think it was more of a panic attack. She followed by breaths and regained some composure but was sweating profusely, so I began fanning her. After a while of talking her through taking deep breaths and assuring her she was breathing and we had emergency services on the way, she began to calm down. EMS showed up about 15-20 minutes later and she declined to go with them. I stayed with the patient the entire time. She did not faint. I believe she just had a panic attack from working herself up about the vaccine. She was a little scared since she had fainted with the last vaccine.

I had horrendous heart burn but the vomiting was so bad I couldn&#39;t even finish chewing a tum before it came up. I had body aches, chills, was over heating, and had lots of horrible pain from heart burn and vomiting. I couldn&#39;t keep fluids down end till 3:30 in the afternoon, I wasn&#39;t able to eat anything end till the next day.

                                                4 days after first shot, she called me complaining of bad back pain. She was going to her family doctor the next day for her 21 yr old well visit and was going to get it checked out then. She had a complete physical and was cleared even her lungs were clear and she was good. Tuesday night April 13th at  10pm, she told me she had &#34;air bubbles&#34; in her chest. I said you mean indigestion, take tums I said. She said not mom, actual air bubbles and they are popping in my chest. I said you just got your physical, you are fine. They Thursday night April 15th she started having difficulty breathing and was out of breath. She went to urgent care on April 16th because she felt awful and they saw in an X-ray that she had a &#34;cyst&#34; in her upper right part of her lung and her lung was about to collapse. Sent her home on bed rest with a stereos and 2 inhalers. We got her Friday night from college because the pain in her back and now her chest was worse. Took her to ER and she had a collared lung and pneuomothroax. She was admitted to the hospital and they tried to see if the lung would heal itself.  It did not. They had to do surgery to repair the hole. When they were in there they saw a cobblestone texture where the hole was an they removed that texture and repaired the hole. She has never had a lung issue. Ever. She is also the 3rd person in my family to have had an adverse reaction to the shot. 6 of us vaccinated and 3 with injuries.

I could not sleep that night because I was shivering so much. I felt regular fever symptoms the day after like many people but even though those symptoms disappeared by the end of the day my rash got worse. I got the shot on my right arm because I am left handed but the rash is the most severe on my left arm. The rashes go all along from the back of my hand to above my elbows and are mostly crowded around the underside of my arm. I have had this rash for over a week now and it is still painfully itchy and sensitive. Only recently the swelling and itchiness around my left eye got better but my arms are still the same and look as if its still slowly spreading.

She described it as light in pressure, pain 4/10, in the right upper chest/right breast area.  The patient believed her chronic anxiety may be playing a role since she has recently started a new job that involves public speaking and she had stopped her paxil due to adverse effects.  No pleuritic pain described, no pain on exertion described.  Differential diagnosis included low risk for ACS, PE given oral contraceptives, anxiety.  Given no evidence of abnormality in labs/work-up, the patient was discharged home with instructions to follow-up with PCP for any ongoing symptoms/anxiety.

I don?t remember where I am or what happened while this was happening, then my whole body goes numb and my vision goes extremely blurry and my chest is tight, then apparently I pass out again because I have EMTs waking me up after. My bp dropped extremely low, my chest and throat was tight, it was hard to breathe, my tongue felt weird, I was anxious, could hardly see for a while and it was hard to hear. I was so out of it for a while it was hard to talk. EMTs took me to the hospital. Was released that evening, but had continuing dizziness, body numbness, chest pain etc for several days before it got better.   (Doctor at ER said he couldn?t fully say if it was an allergic reaction because it?s so new he didn?t have that information, but the paperwork I have from the Walgreens RX lists Several of the events I experienced as allergic reactions)

                                                The vaccination went as expected the day after with fever and chills. But the second day after the vaccine I woke up with welts on my arms and legs the grew until they encompassed my legs fully and inner arms full. It spread to my entire body in big parts. The third day is spread to everywhere it hadnt the first (chest, stomach, outer arms, feet and hands). But it swelled my hands to the point that I can&#39;t make a fist. The fourth day the welts and rash cleared up everywhere else but I woke up with it on my feet and they swelled to the point where I can&#39;t walk today. So day 3 it swelled my hands and day 4 is swelled my feet but its going away within a 24 hrs period. I am currently unable to use pens and small objects in my hands to hold due to the swelling. I am also unable to walk. The ER says to wait it out because its an allergic reaction and I intend to. But even the pharmacy said that out of their 9000 patients done i have been the only one thst has had a worse adverse effect on the second dose. Nothing occurred on the first dose, just the second. I hsvebeen taking benadryl and tylonol but they don&#39;t seem to do much ut just is taking time, but there has been no improvement on my hands or feet.

I went to speak to patient and patient said she &#34;couldn&#39;t breathe&#34; then lost consciousness shortly thereafter. I injected her with an epipen in her left hip. She regained consciousness about 90 seconds later. Her lips were blue, she was pale, her pulse was strong, and heartbeat rapid. She expressed a phobia of shots before the shot and her mother said she has high anxiety about shots. Was taken away via ambulance.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. This case is serious, the other one is non-serious.   A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EH9899) intramuscular at left deltoid on 22Dec2020 19:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccines given at the same time. The patient received a flu shot back between 27th or 28th Nov2020 in her left deltoid. Caller reported getting the COVID vaccine on the 22Dec2020 and feeling fine before that. On the 28Dec2020 she started feeling chills and not feeling very good and that hasn&#39;t gone away. The patient went and got a rapid COVID test and it came back positive, not sure if it was because of the vaccine having antigens in it or she came into contact with it or if she just weakened immune system from the shot. The patient wanted to know if that was true. Then stated she and her mom got the COVID vaccine and her mom received it on the 23Dec. On the 29Dec her whole family started to get sick and experiencing the same things she experienced. The patient was not feeling well at the time of the call. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : 2021001266 same reporter/ drug, different patient/event

And body ache and muscle pain today and then I&#39;m feeling down, and kind of like a lump like at the bottom of my neck, like to the side, on the left side, the arm that I got the (incomplete sentence). It feels may be like it&#39;s a knot in the muscle. I don&#39;t know if that is normal.&#34; The patient asked and stated, &#34;If anybody else has had any of those symptoms? I know that the headache and the muscle pain is normal, I don&#39;t know about the like a lump or anything.&#34; The patient further stated, &#34;It&#39;s been pretty constant headache, second day was body ache and right now just like muscle soreness.&#34; The patient stated, &#34;I took some Tylenol, acetaminophen. And I think I had one Ibuprofen last night.&#34; The outcome of the event headache was not recovered and the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

Pain is mostly at top of my lungs, going across my chest. Deep breathing sometimes helps but there?s also pain upon inhalation.  * Took the next doses of Advair and my Dexedrine (ADHD meds). Nothing weird yet just drained.   They switched my Ventolin inhaler to ProAir, I have been taking it about five times a week so I can workout. When I was on Ventolin I didn?t have any of the side effects I have with ProAir.

                                                Patient is a registered nurse at facility.  She reported having slight itchy lips and scratchy throat after 1st dose.  Patient very much wanted full protection that 2nd dose offers in order to be safe and keep family members safe.  We discussed the possibility of an increased reaction, but she wanted to go ahead and felt the benefits outweighed the risk.  I considered the fact that she is a health care professional, was fully informed and that we were at a skilled nursing facility and were prepared in case she had any reaction.  About 10 minutes after vaccination she seemed to be coughing and felt like her throat was maybe swelling.  She seemed to be breathing ok, but I asked her to take a Benadryl, which she did.  Within 5-10 minutes after that she began shaking and seemed very pale.  She said her symptoms were getting worse.  I told her I was going to administer an epi-pen dose.  911 was called, I administered the epipen, we had heart rate monitor and pulse ox monitor on patient and she was stable, but scared.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported patient to ER.  She was later released with Benadryl.

                                                About 5 mins after the shot I received on Sunday, I got a cooling effect in my chest and began to feel a bit off with an elevated HR of 132. I raised my hand to talk to a nurse and she said I was probably just nervous, got me a water, and said to continue to monitor symptoms. Then, after 15 minutes were up with no other symptoms I left the facility where I got the vaccine. The rest of the day I began to get a burning and cooling effect all around my sternum. It persisted through the day despite Tylenol 500 mg and worsened at night, keeping me up along with a slight fever and chills. The next morning I awoke with slightly lowered symptoms but the sternum pain would flare up on and off through the day and again was worse at night on Monday. So, I took a Benadryl and a 500 mg Tylenol and slept great. I woke up Tuesday feeling great with no fever and minimal chills and no sternal pain. I thought since I hit the 48 hour mark everything was going fine and I was recovering. I ran some errands and even went to the gym to do a mild workout. Then at about 6pm all the symptoms of the sternal pain flared up and was just as bad as Monday night. I took another 500mg Tylenol and 1 Benadryl again and they did not seem to work or help nearly as much as the night before. I woke up this morning with some pain in my sternum again and did not sleep much last night due to the pain as well. I have not taken any further medications at this time and I am also experiencing the worst fatigue I have so far today.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID vaccine around 12:30 pm. At around 4:00 pm, I noticed that my lips were slightly swollen. I went and bought liquid Benadryl. At around 5:45 pm, I took 20ml of the liquid Benadryl. I proceeded to sleep the rest of the night. I woke up around 8:20 am the next morning and noticed that my lips were significantly more swollen. I took 20ml more of the liquid Benadryl and noticed that my tongue was a little swollen as well. At around 9:40 am, I took 20ml more of liquid Benadryl.  I noticed no change in my swelling and my throat started to feel like there was a lump. At around 10:20 am,  I drove to the emergency room. The doctor noticed swelling in my lips and some in my tongue and throat. I was given cimetidine and methylprednisolone through an IV, which reduced the swelling. I was discharged 2 hours later after the swelling went down and was given 2 prescriptions to take the next 4 days, which were prednisone 20mg  (three tablets once a day) and famotidine 20mg (twice a day). There is some swelling in my lips in the morning (for the last two days) until I take the steroids, then it reduces the swelling. The overall cost of the emergency room visit was $1669.17.

                                                8 hours after the second vaccine dose, I suddenly experienced body aches, chills, and a fever. This lasted throughout the night (lasted 24 hours after vaccine administration). I had a lot of trouble sleeping due to the pain and temperature fluctuations (I would wake up hot and sweating, then an hour later cold and shivering, multiple times throughout the night). I treated the symptoms with Acetaminophen 500mg throughout the evening and the day after. The day after (24 hours later), I was fatigued and had stomach pains, with not much of an appetite.

                                                Fever of 102 and dehydration contributed to a syncope collapse early the morning after vaccination (7:15 AM  02/20/21). Just before collapsing, I experienced nausea, dizziness, confusion, weakness, and seeing all black in my field of vision. Emergency Room doctors say it was very likely related to an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer Covid vaccination. Treatment included Tylenol and Ibuprofen, rest, and fluids.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

                                                I got the usual cold-like symptoms the next day. I took a nap and woke up and felt pretty much fine after that. After the 1st, I started getting waves of dizziness. I would lay on ground and I couldn&#39;t get up. After a couple of days, I could do stuff but would get random waves of dizziness and would have to sit down until it went away. My doctor told me to take Allegra and I just kind of lived with it. It didn&#39;t help with symptoms. It started affecting my work because I&#39;m a CNA and I couldn&#39;t be having dizzy spells at work. I went to ER - on January 10th. They sent me to Hasboro because they were to busy at ER. The nurse said I had Vertigo - and they discharged me with Meclizine while I was in ER and it didn&#39;t help. I called me doctor a couple of days after. She told me to combine the Allegro with the Meclizine and that didn&#39;t help with either. I called my doctor back and she said that there is nothing else I can do because my bloodwork came back normal.  I&#39;m not currently taking anything and I&#39;m still getting random dizzy spells. I have returned to work and so I just have to take breaks at work when it happens.  I got the second vaccine on the 19th of January.

So I was okay after the 30 minutes but when I started driving I felt like I was high on strong drugs. Like as if I?d taken an extremely strong marajuana edible and it just hit me. I had to pull over because my eyes wouldn?t stay open, my whole body was feeling very heavy and I was extremely tired and out of it. I didn?t have another way to get home (I had traveled about an hour) so I just kept driving and taking 15 min rests along the way. When I got home I fell asleep as soon as I sat down and slept for about four hours. I feel better now that I?m awake, still light headed but not near as bad.

                                                I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at 9:15 AM on March 9, 2021.  I then returned to work. At about 4:30 PM on that same day, I started feeling dizzy. I felt like I was going to faint at work. Every time I would stand up, I would feel like I was going to pass out.  I had someone drive me home because I felt that I was too dizzy to drive. I arrived home at 6:00 PM and began to vomit profusely. I threw up all night and had the chills.  In the morning, I felt better but still had a dizzy feeling. The dizziness and vomiting completely  subsided by March 11,  2021.    On March  12, 2021, I noticed that I had floating black spots in my left eye accompanied by a painful migraine. I have never had eye floaters or migraines previous to this vaccine. My migraine lasted for 5 days straight and I had to be off work to go to the emergency  room because I started to loose vision in my left eye. They were unsure of the cause because I did not have any pre-existing health conditions.  The migraine finally subsided after the 7th day. I have had eye floaters every since I got the vaccine. I?ve been to an eye doctor and my primary and they all have told me that it could be from this vaccine because I have never had the problem until I received it.

Felt very restless and sick during night, by the next morning symptoms really sat in.  March 24, 2021: Went to Urgent Care due to fever. Had COVID-19 test (negative). Very close to passing out there (put head between knees and did not). Was sent to emergency room immediately due to heart rate (high 140s-150s. Highest known was 152 BPM). ER performed following: portable chest x-ray, blood tests, urine tests, EKG. Was told results were all normal with the exception of EKG (not told anything about it, form listed as abnormal). Passed out 2x at hospital. Was given one IV rehydration solution and released that night. Symptoms below lasted for several days: Headache Aches Nausea Aggressive shakes Shortness of breath Confusion Dizziness Site pain (also developed bump under arm) Fever - 103.8 (after 2 Advil, 2 Tylenol, 3 ice packs and eating frozen grapes) Heavy sweats Racing heart Restless  March 30, 2021: Still having frequent heart palpitations (they come and go but happen several times during the day. Keep having very high heart rates). Went to doctor. While there, nurse noted irregular heartbeat that sounded like it was ?skipping a beat? and heart rate was also jumping all over the place (high pace, low pace, high, etc.). It was clear something was abnormal. Doctor gave EKG approximately 20 minutes later, EKG looked normal. Was told to come back next morning for blood work and to cut out caffeine.  March 31, 2021: Came in for blood work to check thyroid.  April 6, 2021: Thyroid results were normal. Still having palpitations among other symptoms (see April 12 for more info) so was told to come in. Was given ?work from home? note and referred to cardiologist.  April 12, 2021: Appointment at cardiologist. Still having severe palpitations, occasional dizziness/ lightheadedness, nausea, shortness of breath, exhaustion and chest pain. Heart rate was recorded this day to have gotten up to 139 BPM-- was very high majority of the day. EKG was normal (with exception of high heart rate) but 30 mins later doctor observed high heart rate and abnormal rhythm. Was told to come back in a week and one day for a heart ultrasound and heart monitoring for three days. Still no caffeine intake since 3/30/21. Previous heart rates taken at doctor&#39;s visits over the years for comparison below. Never had any prior heart problems whatsoever:  8/29/18: 70 BPM 9/17/18: 88 BPM 10/17/18: 64 BPM 10/31/18: 73 BPM 1/21/19: 78 BPM Note: At this point, I have missed over a  week and a half of work, and worked from home for over a week. I&#39;m not any better heart wise at all over the course of three weeks post vaccine.

Got her in vaccination room and got 2 Benadryl from Emergency Bag down her - pt was able to talk but her wheezing was getting progressively worse so we called her emergency person (because she wanted to take herself to ER) to take her and let them know what was happening then I called 911 because even I could tell it was getting worse (Pt was reluctant to take an EpiPen - wanted to wait til it was worse) Dispatch highly recommended EpiPen and since I felt it was getting worse also I gave an EpiPen from Emergency Bag as well. Within 5 minutes pt was clearly doing better. Kept her in room just to stave off gawkers since we had 5 other shots waiting in waiting room - took ambulance about 15 minutes to arrive ...  but that gave pt mom time to get to the store and accompany pt to ER with ambulance.

I woke up again around 5:15 am to intense involuntary shaking. My family members wrapped me in blankets and applied pressure to my body until the shaking stopped. Within the next 40 minutes I vomited and had diarrhea. At the time also had body aches, chills, fever, and mild swelling of various areas if the body. I slept most of the morning and ate lunch around 1:30 pm. I took Tylenol again at 2:00 pm with the symptoms lessening over the next 5-6 hours. After that fever, chills, and body aches returned.

In the morning, the feeling was still there and it worried me so I went to  Urgent Care, but they just told me to monitor my symptoms and make sure that I don&#39;t start to feel weak. It persisted through the day. The next morning I woke up and it was mostly just on my right side in the leg, feet, hands and arms. Around 9:00 AM the right side of my face began to go tingling-- felt like I had Novacane injection. No pain. Because of my anxiety, throughout the day I got nauseous and warm, but never had a fever or anything like that. Been drinking lots of fluids.

I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

                                                I got the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at the Medical University. Approximately 10 minutes after administration, an allergic reaction began while I was driving alone in my car. Most notably my blood pressure dropped suddenly, causing me to almost pass out. I stopped driving and my symptoms worsened. Symptoms included shaking, sweating, nausea, confusion, rapid heart rate, red blotchy face, slightly labored breathing, itching and slight swelling of my tongue and lips, anxiety. I could still breathe, so I did not seek treatment, but sat in the parking lot of a medical building for at least an hour for symptoms to subside. Symptoms were acute for about 45 minutes and gradually decreased over four hours. The rest of the day and the next day I felt extremely weak. The following six weeks I continued to have swollen, dry, painful lips every single day and a very itchy rash on my hands and wrists. Occasionally I would wake up with swelling around my eyes. I also had an unusual reaction after eating a salad where my lips swelled even more and became numb, along with an itchy mouth. These long lasting symptoms did not go away until I got a steroid cream from a dermatologist, who denied that my reactions were from the vaccine after talking to me for only five minutes. I just believe that there are many more cases of reactions to the vaccines that have not been reported.

                                                Patient received the 1st COVID vaccine (Pfizer, Lot #: EW0173, and expiration date: 08/2021) at 2:55 PM. Patient received the vaccine while sitting in the zero gravity chair, due to a history of feeling lightheaded and passing out with needles. After a few minutes in the zero gravity chair, patient expressed that she was feeling good and wanted to sit in the observation area next to her boyfriend. She got up and walked to another chair without assistance and with a steady gait.  EMT made contact with the patient at 3:12 PM, while she was sitting in the observation area. Patient was conscious, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation but complained of &#34;lightheadedness.&#34; EMT grabbed a wheelchair and patient was then transferred to wheelchair, without assistance. At 3:15 PM, baseline vital signs were taken, while patient was sitting: blood pressure: 136/82, heart rate: 108, respiratory rate: 18. Skin was cold, dry, and normal for ethnicity. Patient claimed to have anxiety and explained that fainting and lightheadedness was &#34;common&#34; for her after receiving a shot. Patient denied taking any medications or having any allergies. A second set of vital signs were taken at 3:20 PM: blood pressure: 136/86, heart rate: 108, respiratory rate: 18. Skin was moist, warm, and normal for ethnicity. Patient was negative for orthostatic pressures. EMT advised patient to stay an additional 30 minutes for further observation. Around 3:50 PM, patient was asked how she was feeling and she stated &#34;good.&#34; EMT educated the client on what to do if additional signs and symptoms developed and when to contact her provider. EMT also explained the use of V- safe to the patient. Patient then left the vaccination site, unassisted and with a steady gait.

A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Apr2021 (at the time of 22-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included chronic migraines. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took acetylsalicylic acid/caffeine/paracetamol (EXCEDRIN) for chronic migraines. On an unspecified date it was reported that patient had the first dose of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine yesterday, 21Apr2021. She has underlying health issues. She was feeling antsy which only started today. it was not like her heart was racing or beating really hard, just she cannot relax even though she was tired. She has chronic migraines and took Excedrin earlier. It was also reported that maybe the ingredients of the vaccine do not coincide with the caffeine in the Excedrin. She has muscle and joint pain bad today, but her arm was fine. Tiredness and headache very much so. The headache was worse today. She took fiorinal with codeine for the bad headache because the RPh (registered pharmacist) said it was ok. she read side effects and asked the agent if agent was saying that feeling antsy is not a side effect of the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2.

                                                April 25th (within 24 hours of vaccine) I felt the typical fever, severe chills, fatigue, etc that I&#39;d often reported. No soreness. This was gone by the end of the day. April 26th I began feeling some light-headedness and feeling faint. My heart was fluttering every time I stood up, my vision went blurry, and I was very unstable (had to hold something to keep from falling). This feeling was bad enough to cause me to become uncoordinated and fall down the stairs while home alone. That evening I went to the ER where they verified that I was &#34;stable&#34; and checked for bigger issues, and sent me home without treatment.  These symptoms continued for the next week. Improving a little each day.  It is now May 10th and I am still experiencing some light headedness and clumsiness. Still needing to rebalance myself on something if I stand up quickly. At some point over this time, I&#39;ve started making mistakes in my words and sentences. Just odd things like omitting words from phrases or confusing &#34;up&#34; with &#34;over&#34; etc. I did not notice this at first, but my co-workers did. Before the vaccine, this is not something I ever did. Correlation?  Causation?  Regardless, I&#39;m still a little unwell and a little worried. But the ER seemed unconcerned, so I&#39;ve been continuing about my life.

The reporter reported for her twin daughters. This is one of the 2 cases.  A 22-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 20Apr2021 3 pm (Batch/Lot number was either EW0150 or EW01S0, caller not sure, there was not an expiration date, NDC number, or dosing information on the vaccine card) as single dose in the right arm at the age of 22-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included her thyroid surgically removed on 17Sep2020 and taking medications for it (they thought it was cancerous but it turns out it was not), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome from Mar2021 and ongoing. No family medical history relevant to events. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number ER2613) in left arm on 30Mar2021 11 am. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No events occurred following prior vaccinations. On 20Apr2021 since vaccination the patient experienced sick as a dog since, hot and cold, feeling weak, achy, nauseous but can not throw up, arm hurts,  she got in the right arm and now it hurts, events were described by the patient as she was dying. No event required a visit to Emergency Room or physician office. No relevant tests performed. The outcome of events was not recovered, events were still ongoing.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                around 1.5 weeks after 2nd vaccine dosage, I began experiencing severe, debilitating pain in my arm/shoulder. With no prior injury, sickness, history,  accident, or physical activity, I had no idea where the pain was coming from. I&#39;ve never broken a bone,  I&#39;m healthy, and I hadn&#39;t done any strenuous activity in the past year. The pain continued and worsened to the point I was unable to use my arm, sleep laying down, and act without pain medication. Almost 2 weeks and no pain subsiding, I went into a walk in ortho clinic where they found abnormal x rays of my arm/shoulder. My humorous bone was in the wrong place because the muscles were weighing down &amp; there was no fracture/anything wrong with the bone.   After a visit to an orthopedist, I was treated for **parsonage turner syndrome** and put on steroids. Currently scheduled for physical therapy and still only have limited use of my arm.

A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer covid-19 vaccine, Solution for Injection, Lot Number: EN6205, Expiration date: Unknown), via an unspecified route in the right arm on 07Apr2021 (age at vaccination: 22-year-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included extreme immune system and seizures that only lasted about 2 years when she was a baby. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had issues when she was born, she was 3 weeks post term, she was adopted and when all the kids would get sick, she would always get the sickest. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On an unknown date, few days later she felt something and thought it was anxiety, 2 weeks after vaccination from 15May2021, she woke herself up threw up and saying that her heart was racing around 8:30 in the morning, so she went and got their finger monitor, and her heart rate was out of control, so they took her to the emergency room. They tried to get her heart rate down with medications and sent us to an electro physicist, and the rest is history. Patient has been an athlete her whole life, has been in great shape with no heart problems. She was taken to the ER and they captured flutter on the EKG and AFIB issues. Later she was hospitalized and ended up having cardiac surgery about a week ago at 13:00 (16Jun2021 to 17Jun2021). Caller states that her daughter was doing really well, they had to do an ablation. Caller states they saw the cardiologist today, her daughter may have bouts of palpitations, but has had nothing since 3 days after the surgery. Caller wanted to know if AFIB has been reported as a reaction. She received her second shot of BNT162B2 (Pfizer covid-19 vaccine, Solution for Injection, Lot Number: EN6199) in the right arm on 28Apr2021. They said she will recover completely, but it will take about 3 months. She will have to be followed by a cardiologist. The patient underwent lab test and procedure on 15May2021 which included flutter on the EKG. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

I could not drive so I waited for a ride. I slept until 4PM and 1AM and went back to sleep until 9AM the next morning. I felt very weak and nauseated and threw up acid even though I had an empty stomach. I had a headache and fever and slept more. 3 more days passed and I was still feeling awful. 46 hours later, I saw the doctor in my clinic until I got back to normal which they prescribed me Tylenol, 650mg.

Patient also reported vision changes (seeing spots)  Flushing resolved in about 5 minutes and nausea/dizziness in about 10-15 minutes while patient was monitored by pharmacy staff.  Patient reported heavy breathing at this time believed due to anxiety but was continued to be monitored by staff.  After about 20 minutes patient was able to stand briefly and moved to another chair to relax and to continue monitoring.  At this time most symptoms had resolved but patient still reported feeling uneasy and a little disoriented.  Water was provided and pharmacy staff continued to sit with patient until patient felt that she had calmed down and reported no further adverse conditions.  After sitting for another 10 minutes patient stood on her own, was stable and felt comfortable returning to work.

                                                I have been having trouble breathing since I had the vaccine done. I get really bad chest pains just from laying down and it is a daily struggle to do everyday things like walking because I get short of breath really easily after I had the vaccine done. It has been 3 and a half months now and I am still struggling trying to recover.  My treatment right now is that my pulmonologist put me on Symbicort to see if it could give me a little bit of relief and I am still being seen by the cardiologist as well, and I am also using my rescue inhaler Albuterol HFA more often than before. I am taking Singulair and I was also put on a heart monitor for 2 days to check my heart rhythm to see if that has anything to do with the chest pains I have been feeling

                                                Around 2-3 weeks after receiving the vaccine, I was sitting and noticed my heart was racing really fast. The next morning it did not stop. On 5/1, I went to a doctor who said I was having an anxiety attack and was sent home. On 5/2, I was having palpations around 145/150. I went to the ER and they took my blood, and did a chest X ray. I checked in with my primary care who said I might have PAP. I went to a cardiologist who did a stress test and a 2 week and 24hr Holter monitor. No conclusive results were found so they did a tilt table test with no conclusive results. An echo of my heart was also conducted. I also get fatigued easily, headaches, dizziness, and heat flashes. I was prescribed propranolol which I did poorly on so I was put on cardanol which seems to be helping.

This nurse reported similar events for 3 patients. This is the first of 3 reports.  A 23-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EK9231, intramuscular in the right deltoid, first dose on 27Dec2020 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma and reactive airway which she was diagnosed when she was like 5 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] for asthma which started when she was 8 years old or so. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of covid vaccine after experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction like rash, tightness in throat, and lump in throat. She wanted to know the ingredients and specific proteins in the covid vaccine. The patient received the COVID Vaccine and she developed a reaction. On 27Dec2020, she had a red rash on her chest, and her cheeks were flushed, and the rash was on her arms too, and she had a tightness and lump in her throat, it was not painful to swallow but she could feel the pressure with swallowing. She stated that she did not experience shortness of breath, but regardless, she was seen in the ER and she was given IV SOLUMEDROL, and BENADRYL, and she was watched for 5 or 6 hours and then she was sent home with an Epi Pen, around the clock Benadryl, and prednisone. She asked the ER doctors if they thought it was okay for her to receive the second dose of the product, and they told her to contact employee health for that question. She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did. Her primary care doctor instructed the caller to call Pfizer and gather some more information regarding ingredients, as the she may have had the reaction to a particular protein filler. She was also wondering if this is a known reaction to the product. She received the vaccine on 27Dec2020 at 2:15 PM. She reported that the red rash on her chest and arms, and her cheeks being flushed, resolved yesterday after receiving IV BENADRYL. Had a tightness and lump in her throat which was still ongoing, and it was kind of off and on and when the she takes Benadryl it goes away. She reported that this one is medically significant because even though she did not have shortness of breath, it could have affected her airway. She confirmed that she received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#39;had a tightness and lump in her throat&#39;, allergic reaction was not recovered (a s reported); while recovered on 27Dec2020 for allergic reaction like rash/red rash on her chest and rash was on her arms too and cheeks were flushed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events throat tightness, sensation of foreign body, allergy to vaccine, rash erythematous and flushing cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

                                                flushed; hives; tongue felt &#34;thick&#34;; the lump in my throat feels bigger; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable pharmacist. A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Dec2020 (at the age of 23-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: allergies to medications, food, or other products (unspecified). It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally. Some improvement was noted in hives; however, the patient began to state her tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; (both on 22Dec2020). Per doctor, 0.3 mg epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) given intramuscularly with rapid improvement in hives. The patient reported feeling some improvement as well. The patient was taken to the emergency department for ongoing observation. The patient was released from emergency department after observation. The clinical outcome of flushed, hives, tongue felt &#34;thick&#34;, and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events flushing, urticaria, tong disorder, sensation of foreign body are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after the vaccination the patient reported dizziness and possible rash on her upper chest. It was difficult to assess if the rash was truly a rash or it was simply skin lesions that were already present (patient claimed she did not know). It did not resemble a maculopapular rash. It marginally resembled minor hives/urticaria. Patient did not report any localized symptoms at injection site. Patient was informed to remain seated and that her vitals would be taken and she would be further observed. Then about 10 minutes after this (25 minutes after vaccination), patient reported difficulty breathing. Facial redness was noted at this point and patient&#39;s breathing sounded difficult. Emergency medical services were called and EpiPen was administered at this point. Patient began to tremble and pace of breathing increased. Emergency medical technicians arrived, took vitals / EKG, and assessed the patient. EMT assessment did not reveal urticaria. EMT instructed patient to control her breathing. The EMTs believe that it may not have been a true reaction but rather the patient may have been suffering from an anxiety attack. Patient was then taken to local ER for further evaluation.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

When waking up the next morning, I had felt a slight fever, chills, nausea, continuous fatigue, and headaches throughout the day. Once I woke up the next day, 2/1, my fever and chills had completely gone away, however I was still feeling fatigue, headaches, and nausea and have not stopped feeling these symptoms since. My fatigue most notably has been present enough to where I?ve needed to call out of work. Eating meals also does but subside the fatigue by a substantial amount.

                                                The night after I was vaccinated I experienced knee and ankle pain as well as soreness at the vaccination site (left arm/shoulder).  I experienced this throughout the night and this made sleeping difficult. The next morning, I took 2 500-mg tablets of acetaminophen. This relieved my pain for several hours. At about 1 pm, I became very fatigued. I slept the whole afternoon, ate dinner, took 2 more 500-mg tablets of acetaminophen, and slept for 11 hours. The next day, I felt good and have not had any symptoms since

                                                On 2/10/2021, two days after my 2nd dose, I started experiencing mild abdominal pain at around 10am. I knew it was a side effect from the vaccine for I had been experiencing severe chills, fever, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and nausea the day before (2/9/2021) and those symptoms except for the fever had subsided on the 10th. I had been unable to eat all day on the 10th due to the pain but it was manageable. At 2pm the abdominal pain got worse. At 4:30pm the pain became unmanageable and I could not walk erect without severe pain. I was crying and bend over trying to walk. I had a family member drive me to the ER and arrived at around 4:40pm.  Lying down with my knees up seemed to help the pain a bit but was exacerbated when lying flat or ambulating. I was given Pepcid, zofran,  and toradol all IV push  at 8pm and the pain subsided within 15 minutes. Today I still have mild abdominal pain but I would rate it at a 1/10.

I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

These symptoms subsided after 25 minutes. I then became on and off light headed through the remainder of the day. The day after receiving the vaccine I felt a lot of brain fog, forgetfulness, and fatigue. The night of day two I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache which only lasted 20 minutes. During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

                                                The first day I got my vaccine, I felt  fine, but my arm with the injection sight was very sore and body slightly achy. The second day I woke up and my arm was sore, but other than that I felt normal. Around 4pm on the second day, my back started to hurt where the break break in my spine is. It was just a normal amount of pain at first, but within an hour there was throbbing pain in my lower back, spreading into my legs. This is where I normally feel my chronic pain, but I had a spinal injection a little over 6 months ago and doesn&#39;t usually stop working until about a year. It is the normal pain I experience in the normal places, but the pain is worse and out of no where. That is not usually how the pain comes on when the spinal block wears off. It is much more gradual. It could be a coincidence, but the pain is not the way I have ever experienced the pain.  My back hurts too much to do things I need to do to function, which only happens to me when I have done something with a lot of physical activity that puts tension on my back like jumping, dancing, roller coasters. Before I started experiencing this pain, it was just a normal day for me where I didn&#39;t exert my back any more than normal, which is very little.

                                                After receiving vaccine at 3 pm I started to have anxiety and my heart rate went up. This was presumably because I also have a needle phobia but I did almost faint and had to have on site EMT asses condition and observe for 30 minutes. At 4 pm one hour after injection face felt itchy and irritated and noticed hives on neck and jawline. Immediately administered benadryl 50 mg which made the hives subside.

Patient received vaccine and about one minute later the patient passed out and fell forward. I was able to catch her and lower to the ground safely. I called for pharmacist on duty to assist in the care of the patient. Less than a minute after the patient passed out she was awake and alert.  The patient was asked multiple times if she needed to go to the hospital and asked if she was okay to drive home.  She insisted that she faints frequently from vaccines and denied any further care.  She stayed in the waiting area while being checked on several times. The patient left after she said she was &#34;100% good.&#34; She thanked us for taking care of her and apologized for what happened.

                                                The second the person gave me the shot my index finger went numb, stiff and my range of motion decreased.  Within less than 24 hours day my whole hand and lower arm were stiff, numb,  painful, and tingling. I also have overall weakness and doing basic tasks like writing essays for school has become painful and difficult. My hand is stiff and looks like a claw. While it has gotten a little better after taking medications that my doctor prescribed my fingers are still weak stiff, numb, tingling, and painful.  The vaccine was administered too far up and too far to the left which has most likely caused nerve damage.  There is also a small bruise at the injection site and the injection is still visible 5&#43; days later. This could have been prevented through better training of health officials working at state-run vaccine sites. I hope this hasn&#39;t caused lasting damage.

It felt like things were moving in slow motion, frame by frame, when I woke up at 3am. Was light headed, couldn&#39;t stand, chills and shaking. I vomited from 3-4 am and then again at 8am when I woke up, with my visual disturbances limited to the 3-4am hours. I took Advil and was able to go back to sleep for most of the day, sleeping from around 9am to 1pm. Nausea, fever, and vomiting have all have cleared. Now I just have a headache and muscle aches, especially near the injection site. Almost 24 hrs after my vaccine now and I feel drastically better than I did overnight.

She never lost consciousness but was non-verbal, only moaning, shivering and crying. EMS was immediately contacted and arrived to the scene.  Her blood glucose was  checked by EMS and was 52.  She was given fluids via IV and recovered shortly after.

                                                The day following the vaccination I woke up with severe arm pain 2 inches down from the injection site. My arm had swollen about 3 inches in diameter. It was so painful that I could not roll over, I could not lift my arm, and I was in inconsolable tears. It was a deep stinging pain, as though I was repeatedly being stung by a hornet. My left hand was going numb off and on. I went to the doctor because I was incapable of lifting my arm, and the doctor identified that my lymph nodes and my left ear were swollen and enlarged. He recommended ibuprofen and ice for the lump. The second day after receiving the vaccine I had a mild headache, and my arm was only slightly swollen. The third day after receiving the vaccine my arm was still slightly swollen and sore, but the pain was manageable without pain medication. The fourth day after receiving the vaccine I woke up with a deep cough and dizzy spells lasting throughout the day.

                                                I received the Pfizer second dose on May 5th and started to have an allergic reaction on May 6th at 02:32. I was not able to attend classes due to muscle pain, headache and nausea. I was having some sort of fever where I felt hot but my body was cold. I slept for the majority of the day.  Around 16:35, when I woke up, I noticed a rash and that my body was feeling swollen. I took 2 Benadryl gel pills at 18:03. I felt some difficulty breathing, and itching sensation all over my body and still had a lot of tension on the left side of my jaw.  I went out to eat with my boyfriend, because we had plans and he had also complained of having some cold chills from the vaccine, and he noticed that I had red marks on my hands.  By May 7 10:05 I called off of work to go my doctor, because I had massive splotches of raised itchy hives all over my body.  It was confirmed that I was having an allergic reaction and I received a steroid shot in my upper gluteal muscle, as well as Famotidine 20mg twice daily for 5 days and Prednisone 20mg twice daily for 5 days.

                                                From ED note:  Briefly, this is a 23-year-old female with past medical history of not allergies, asthma who presents for evaluation of shortness of breath, nausea and chest discomfort following Covid vaccine 30 minutes prior to presentation.  Patient received her first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine this morning, was observed and ultimately started to drive home with mother when she developed shortness of breath, nausea and chest discomfort.  These have been progressive.  She reports she is not taking her Flovent.  No vomiting, no rash, no weakness, headache or dizziness. Remainder of history per note above.   Vital signs as noted above (tachycardia, tachypneic).  On physical exam, the patient is anxious appearing, hyperventilating; HEENT exam with MMM, clear conjunctivae, normal TMs &amp; clear oropharynx without uvular swelling or edema; neck is supple; cardiovascular exam is stable with regular rhythm, mild tachycardia, no murmurs; pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally, good aeration, no wheezes; abdomen is soft, non-tender &amp; non-distended; neurologic exam nonfocal, moves all four extremities, 5/5 strength in upper and lower extremities, carpal spasm of bilateral hands (L&gt;R).   My impression is that this patient is having a panic attack given her rapid onset of hyperventilation, chest discomfort, and bilateral carpal spasms. Carpal spasms improved with controlled breathing. Considered anaphylaxis given patient&#39;s history, but absolutely no wheezing, rash or significant GI symptoms; no hypoxia; no hypotension. Epi-pen at bedside, but not given. Considered asthma, but no wheezing - patient is not wheezing and has good aeration on exam, she is requesting albuterol, which I think will help with her anxiety surrounding this - 2 puffs given. No evidence of persistent tachycardia to suggest PE (no OCPS). Initial ECG with sinus arrhythmia, one PVC, slightly prolonged QTc 477 - will check repeat. Patient briefly on NRB for comfort - slowly able to be weaned off and during observation in ED, symptoms improving but not completely resolved. Repeat ECG w/ NSR, slightly prolonged QTc 460. Given persistence of symptoms, patient given epi-pen and had almost complete resolution of symptoms within 10 minutes. We will plan to observe for 4 hours post-epi administration. Recommended discussion of second COVID vaccine with primary care provider but may have to avoid given this could have represented a serious allergic reaction. Recommend follow-up with PCP/cardiology for repeat EKG.   Admit to Ed Observation Status  Diagnosis: Allergic reaction  Goals of observation: (1) Ensure continued improvement of symptoms, (2) Improved HR  Interventions: (1) CRM, (2) Close monitoring, (3) Frequent exams  5/7/2021  15:00   23-year-old female received COVID-19 vaccine today and after which developed shortness of breath.  Initially felt this was anxiety however symptoms persisted.  Treated with albuterol as well as epinephrine and observed.  Developed shortness of breath and complaints of chest pain after approximately 3 hours of observation.  Repeat EKG obtained and is normal.  Labs were obtained which demonstrated normal CBC.  Normal D-dimer.  Normal electrolytes but an elevated TSH (known hyperthyroidism).  Treated with cetirizine and steroids with improvement of her symptoms.  Discharged with PCP follow-up in 2 days.

Patient reports to have started experiencing an increase in symptoms of paranoia and thought disorganization in the days immediately following her first injection of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine.   Patient was medically evaluated by myself via teleHEALTH 16 days later and found to be increasingly paranoid, with somatic preoccupations, increased thought and speech disorganization  that may require additional antipsychotic medication.  This mental status examination represents a significant worsening compared to the patient&#39;s baseline.

I was not anxious prior to getting the vaccine and felt terror afterwards. 5/1 - I developed severe depression and suicidal ideation. I reported to those around me that I did not feel safe. I am not diagnosed with depression and did not experience depression prior to the vaccine. I felt suicidal, completely hopeless, anxious, and was uncontrollably bursting into tears without an identifiable trigger. 5/2 - I developed shooting pain in my legs and arms. It felt like a pulsating, stabbing pain that throbbed. It was unlike any pain I had experienced ever before. 5/3 - I developed a metallic taste in my mouth that could not be washed away with water or food. It was extremely noticeable. 5/4  - My period came a week early. I have been on birth control for seven years and have never experienced any changes in my menstrual cycle. I made no other lifestyle or health changes other than the vaccine. The period was extremely heavy, full of clots, and was painful. It lasted longer than usual, until about 5/9. 5/16 - I developed another period only a week after the first period. This period was equally as heavy and long-lasting. It remained until about 5/21.  Following the vaccine, I began suffering from heart palpitations, leg cramps, and random pains. I did not experience these prior to the vaccine. I cannot identify the date these symptoms began, but it was within the first week of taking the vaccine.

Symptoms began roughly 3.5 hours after second dose and are still continuing in waves nearly 8 hours later. I have had my menstrual cycle for nearly 15 years and have never experienced anything like this. Recently I had a well-women?s check-up/PAP and results were normal, so no reason to suspect any health issues that may suddenly cause this. I have tried applying heat, taking a magnesium supplement, and massaging my stomach to no avail.

                                                Pt had a negative response to the Pfizer injection. This was her 2nd dose. When doing the Covid injection screening in her chart, she did mention that she had some itchiness and a rash after the first injection. I had FNP assess her and clear her to have the injection. Pt was cleared and vaccination was given. Pt stated she didnt even feel the injection and looked well. I told her to wait the allotted 15 mins and left the door open. I told her that if she felt anything coming on, to say something,  as we had staff in ear shot. Pt understood. By the time I was finished giving the next 2 injections to the next 2 Pt&#39;s on the schedule, 2 staff members were holding and supporting Pt because she was not able to hold herself up. Pt was no responsive in the physical sense but when I asked her if she was scared, she started to cry. Which  indicated to us that she could hear us and understood. BS was low at 79. Juice was given. She was able to take small sips when strongly encouraged.  BP was 148/78 at one point but eventually leveled out. Pulse was around 120 but then lowered. We had tried to cool her down with a cool pack, as she was sweating. Temp was  normal at 98.2 degrees. AED was obtained and  911 was called. I told Pt that I had called her emergency contact/Husband of what had happened and to meet her at  Hospital. Her husband didnt sounds distressed on the phone. Pt was taken by ambulance with all of her belongings. the Supervisor was informed of the situation and agreed to call Pt on Monday to do a wellness phone check.

This cycle repeated every 20 minutes or so for approximately 3 hours until eventually each cycle would have more time in between each one and I rested for longer each time. I did not fully go to sleep until shortly after 2 am.   I was also supposed to get my period a week or so after I got the vaccine and it never happened. It is now 6/24/21 and I have still not had a period since receiving the 2nd dose of the pfizer vaccine. According to my cycle pattern, I should get my next period next week, but have yet to have any PMS symptoms that I usually get. If I don&#39;t get in by the end of June, I will be consulting medical help.

                                                Severe, full-body muscle pain beginning the morning following my second vaccination. This was tempered only a little with 600mg of ibuprofen, but the aches worsened around 3pm, a full 24 hours after my shot. On Saturday morning I was unable to leave the bed due to how painful it was to move. My legs hurt the worst, I couldn&#39;t lift, bend, or walk on my legs in the morning. I also had severe pain in my lower back, my hands, wrists, and forearms. I forced myself to walk through tears and agony which eventually helped &#34;loosen&#34; my legs. Throughout the day the mobility in my legs came back and the pain eased slightly. I continued to need to either support myself or rest often.  On Sunday the same symptoms as described above came back with a vengeance. I didn&#39;t have to even move to be in agony all of the time. Forcing myself to break through the stiffness and pain seemed to help awaken and revive my muscles slightly. Ibuprofen didn&#39;t help much, I was taking a maximum of 800mg doses about three times a day.  Monday is the first day the pain is not unbearable, though it is extremely painful and difficult to move. I struggle to go up or down stairs, I struggle to get up from a sitting position, I struggle to put my pants on, and I struggle to walk. If I stand for too long of a duration my legs shake and I feel like I might collapse.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 23-year-old non pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot/batch no: ER 2613) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 19Mar2021 at 02:00 PM (at the age of 23-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. Medical history and concomitant medication were not reported. On 21Mar2021 at 20:00, the patient experienced rash, irritating and red spot. No therapeutic measures were taken as result of the events. The events did not result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, and emergency room/department or urgent care. The clinical outcome of rash, irritating and red spots were unknown at the time of this report.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Two days after the vaccine, I felt fatigued, had a very rapid heart beat (130 bpm while sitting), and had hypertension (BP: 182/92). I had to go to the emergency room twice due to high blood pressure and a very rapid heart beat (both visits were on the Staurday two days after my vaccine). For 9 whole days after the vaccine, I felt fatigued, no appetite, I was not able to sleep, and I felt lots of chest paint.

A 23-year-old female patient (daughter) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: ER8737 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 07Apr2021 at 11:00 AM (age at vaccination: 23 year) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included anemic, eczema, gastric reflex, known allergies: citrus food, latex gloves, Compazine, Augment, and headaches from concussions. Concomitant medications included Ferrous Sulfate, Diethylpropion HCL, and glucose, sodium chloride (DNS). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. There was a product complaint to report.   On 07Apr2021 12:30, the patient experienced swollen neck/neck was swelling, nauseated vomiting/nausea and vomiting, entire body swelling all extremities, itchy red rash: face, neck, upper chest, forearms, thighs, back eyebrows, severe frontal occipital lateral stabbing headache, sore, tender body and chills. On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced right upper shoulder discomfort with swelling that goes into her neck, light sensitivity, having a rash, rash is itching, her skin is peeling, redness and severe headache. On 09Apr2021, the patient experienced motion sickness and numbness of right forearm. On 12Apr2021, the patient had tachycardia and scaling. When probed to determine when the tachycardia began, the caller mentioned that the tachycardia was noted at the doctor&#39;s office. She confirmed the tachycardia began Monday, 12Apr2021. She clarified it was her second doctor&#39;s visit so if the caller gave the wrong date, they were able to find it by her records on her second doctor&#39;s visit. Caller confirmed with her daughter the tachycardia was still intermittent, it comes and goes. It seems to be that it has improved. She could consider it was medically significant because they didn&#39;t know what the root cause was. Her daughter has never experienced tachycardia before being dosed with the Pfizer vaccine. There was not treatment for tachycardia. Her daughter was still having a rash; she was breaking out intermittently. She confirmed she did not report online that her daughter was intermittently breaking out. At that time when she filed the report online, the rash just broke out. At that time, she didn&#39;t know if her daughter&#39;s rash was going to abate and then re-appear. If so, then she would have had to re-open a new event with a new date and time and rate it. She just looked at her daughter&#39;s skin, it&#39;s peeling. These were very itchy. Caller then clarified most of these events started the day of the vaccine, 07Apr2021 at 12:30 PM. She confirmed some of these events were reported online on the date of the incident and were still present. The severity of each event was on a grading scale, and right now her daughter&#39;s grading scale was 10. Online, the patient couldn&#39;t even tell how they really were feeling. The severity of each event needed to be asked. By the lack of getting all the information and the less Pfizer has, the better it looks for Pfizer. When probed for outcome, the caller confirmed the rash was still ongoing and it was medically significant because she was going to have to take her to dermatologist. She has been using hydrocortisone cream as treatment of the rash and it&#39;s not working. She did not have the NDC, LOT,EXP for the cream. She explained the skin peeling/scaling has been ongoing. Her skin breaks out in a rash and then becomes really scaly and then it peels. She clarified overall, she had a rash, but the rash was itching, had redness, scaling, and her skin was peeling. On scale of 1 to 10, the caller would rate this event as a 10. She confirmed and that it&#39;s continuous/ongoing and had not improved. Stated the rash was not to any localized area on her daughter&#39;s body, it&#39;s all over. She clarified further the rash can appear on her daughter&#39;s eyes, chin, cheeks, forearm, wrist, and leg. The severe headache was reported on the day of the vaccine as well as the rash, too. The severe headache was ongoing; caller gives it a grade 10&#43;. She confirmed the headache was medically significant. It did prevent her daughter from driving a car, reading, or doing activities. Caller added that the headache was also disabling because it disables her daughter from functioning at her normal capacity, she&#39;s been hindered. Her normal activities she could not perform if the headache was present. The headache was described as stabbing, excruciating pain and burning sensation. When probed for the outcome of her daughter&#39;s severe headache, the caller explains it&#39;s in between persistent and worsening. On a good day, it&#39;s a grade 8.5. On a bad day, it&#39;s a grade 10&#43;. No medical treatment for headache, she was not really allowed to do anything. She was waiting for Pfizer vaccine to wash out of her daughter&#39;s system. She explained her daughter was laying low and not introducing any more drugs to enter her body since she had a reaction. Caller again stated they were waiting for Pfizer&#39;s vaccine to wash out of her daughter&#39;s system because they feel as though something was triggering the rash that keeps appearing and the headaches were still there on a grade level of 10&#43;. Her daughter was afraid to take medications, so they were having to do treatments like hot compresses to her daughter&#39;s head and neck, massaging her head/neck/back and turning the lights off. The Nausea and vomiting began on 07Apr2021 and was still ongoing. No treatment for nausea. Her daughter just gets still and goes to sleep. When the headaches were excruciating, it brings on nausea and vomiting. Also, she noticed motion sickness. When her daughter was riding in the car and she was experiencing a headache, she had terrible motion sickness. Caller confirmed the caller never had this motion sickness prior to the vaccine. The motion sickness was still ongoing. Her daughter was not treating the motion sickness in any way. She states maybe her daughter has taken one Zofran because it was so bad. No further details provided. The numbness of the right forearm started on 09Apr2021. She confirms the numbness is still ongoing, it comes and goes, intermittently and did not receive any treatment. On 07Apr2021, her entire neck was swelling, left and right side. The left side was better but the rightnside had intermittent swelling, there was ongoing swelling on the right side of her neck and did not receive any treatment and just rubbing of her daughter&#39;s neck. Her daughter also has right upper shoulder discomfort with swelling that goes into her neck that was ongoing. She confirmed this event to be medically significant and it has hindered her daughter&#39;s normal activity if her shoulder was swollen too bad and she was hurting. Her daughter just started physical therapy. The light sensitivity was still ongoing. If her daughter was not experiencing a headache, the light sensitivity was pretty good and treatment included dark rooms/ black out. Her daughter was following up with an allergy testing by the allergy doctor. She has to find out if there were any active ingredients in the Pfizer vaccine that triggered her daughter&#39;s reaction. Caller stated, &#34;something in the COVID-19 vaccine triggered her daughter&#39;s body to react the way that it did&#34;. Her daughter also was following up with a dermatologist. Her primary care physician requested her daughter to be followed up with her allergy doctor and to be tested. Caller requested Pfizer&#39;s adverse team or someone to call and let the caller know how Pfizer follows up with their patients and how well Pfizer&#39;s values each patient. The patient&#39;s symptoms have not abated. The events of swelling, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, motion sickness, hypoaesthesia, musculoskeletal discomfort, photophobia, rash, rash pruritic, skin exfoliation, erythema and headache were considered to be medically significant. The events caused the patient to visit emergency department and physician&#39;s office. The patient received IM Benadryl 50mg and IM Solumedrol steroid as treatment for the events. The outcome of tachycardia was recovering and for burning sensation it was unknown, and for all the other events, it was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events nausea, vomiting, pruritic rash, erythema, and severe headache were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile and close temporal relationship. The association between the events swelling, tachycardia, motion sickness, hpyoaesthesia, musculoskeletal discomfort, photophobia, skin peeling, and scaly skin with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded based on temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Heart palpitations 2 weeks after 2nd dose - diagnosed as iron deficiency. Started taking multivitamin/mineral pills with iron and had horrible reaction (felt like it was hard to breath, extreme fatigue and couldn?t even sit up, extreme nausea) went to ER and blood/ekg/chest X-ray all normal. Let go and during the night had blood rushing, neck swelling, flicking lights when eyes closed. Tried 2 different iron pills, same reaction. Went to Er again and all tests negative. Trying to supplement iron through food (week 4-now). In beginning, week 4 - not getting enough iron from food and constantly feeling short of breath and blood rushing (felt like a lot of blood was being pumped at a time even though pulse was normal). Found iron fortified cereal and it helped shortness of breath, but re-triggered flashes. Flashes getting worse in intensity, length, and frequency. Exertion also shortness of breath and not oxygenating properly walking fat and doing anything more exertional.

No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.On 09Jul2021, she tested positive for Covid-19. States that she does not know the exact strain that it was. She is trying to get genome sequencing done so that they can find out. She has one but, she is (withheld) and has a PCP back home. She hasn&#39;t given them any info about her having Covid yet. She hasn&#39;t called her physician. She saw someone in the clinic. She hasn&#39;t told them yet, so she wants to call them first. In the clinic, they assumed it was as sinus infection and the prescribed her with Amoxicillin. She was taking it last week when she didn&#39;t know that she had it yet. She is still taking it right now. They gave her nasal spray and she did that for 2 days completely and it is clear now. She had every possible symptom she can think of. On Tuesday, 06Jul2021, she woke up with a horrible stomach ache and diarrhea. When she got to campus, she was more exhausted on 06Jul2021 and just felt ill and run down, not herself on 06Jul2021. Her voice was so gone. She did not feel good on 06Jul2021. She felt like that is probably because she took the vaccine while she was sick. She had all this work to do, so she went through it. She took her Vyvanse medication instead of resting and it almost masked the symptoms but, she felt ok for an hour, then all of a sudden she had to go to bed because she felt so sick. She just thought it was food she had eaten because of her birthday. She had eaten cake and a whole lot of junk food. She usually eats really healthy. She went to clinic that morning to see patients. She also had no voice and it was very crackly/ Voice was gone and was very cracky on 06Jul2021. Her throat didn&#39;t hurt, it was just very sore and her vocal chords were hurting on 06Jul2021. It hurt to talk. Those were the only 2 symptoms she had the first day. She felt ill, fatigued and her body started to hurt and she felt really tired. She came home and didn&#39;t feel like she usually did. She just felt really sick. She could taste and smell, it was all still there. She is still getting the runs though out the day. She was with family and 2 friends and did not pass anything on to them. They are all vaccinated. That night, she was exhausted and went to bed early, then she was freezing cold, had the chills but didn&#39;t take her temperature in Jul2021. She took Nyquil and Dayquil. She woke up again at night and was freezing and shaking and Woke up in a puddle of sweat and hair was soaking wet and dripping in Jul2021. She felt horrible. She thought she caught the flu and was not thinking that it was Covid in Jul2021. That day, she kind of tried to get though school and do work online. She was feeling really crummy. All of those symptoms, she had the next couple of days. Then her Nose really runny and super congested in Jul2021. her throat didn&#39;t really hurt but she had a kind of deep cough in Jul2021. This was the last night before she saw the doctor. She had tried going for testing the day before but the lines were 3 hours. She booked a test and a doctor&#39;s appointment for the next day because she thought she caught the cold or flu. One night, she woke up again and it was the same, with chills and sweat but, her chest was really sore. It felt like pressure on her chest in Jul2021. It felt not normal, like it was maybe a variant. She was super contagious and vaccines may not be fully effective against them. She felt horrible in her chest and it was hard to breathe in Jul2021. When going up and down the stairs, she would get really tired and was out of breath. She tested at the Drive through. It was a nasal swab in each nostril. That night, 08Jul2021, when she had dinner, she couldn&#39;t taste anything or smell anything on 08Jul2021. She thought, it must be Covid. The next day, she went to the clinic and saw a Nurse Practitioner. She made her put her head down to see if there was pressure in the sinuses. She tested her breathing and her lungs, everything was clear. She didn&#39;t really think it was Covid. She put her on amoxicillin and has been taking that ever since. She tested positive (09Jul2021) was when she was starting to feel better but really, she was still tired and exhausted. Her energy was very low in Jul2021. She was only really sick for 3 full days. On Saturday, she was really lethargic  on 10Jul2021 and fatigued. She knew she was getting better, just not 100 percent. When she knew that it was Covid, if it wasn&#39;t for the vaccine, she didn&#39;t think she would be able to tough it out. She still can&#39;t taste or smell at the moment. She is in self isolation. She feels completely normal. If she hadn&#39;t gotten the Covid test, she would have never thought that it was Covid. She feels 90% right now. She is back to studying. Horrible stomach ache and Diarrhea: Did not last very long, would say, like 30 minutes and then it passed.  Still has diarrhea every morning but it may because of the amoxicillin. Lethargy and fatigue and all of the other symptoms: They were all on 6Jul2021, 7Jul2021 and 8Jul2021. On 9Jul2021, she started to get better.

Her nose was really runny through out the time and super congested. The only thing is that her stomach feels a little nauseous and has a little cough. Her cough has gotten way better, so much better. The nausea/ Feels nauseas didn&#39;t happen that often in Jul2021. She didn&#39;t have an appetite the first couple of days in Jul2021. Just today, she is a little nauseated but, it may not be Covid.

                                                I woke up the morning after receiving the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine with a severe headache, nausea, vomiting, fever of 101.3, body aches, fatigue, and a sore throat. I took Tylenol twice that day and felt a small amount of relief. I woke up the following day, 2 days after the vaccine, still feeling nauseous, had a headache, temperature 100.4, fatigue, and body aches. I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. 3 days following the vaccine I am still having nausea with vomiting, body aches, and fatigue, my temperature day 3 is 100.1. I had to call into work because of my symptoms and the screening tool used to get into work flagged me.

When I got home the body aches got worse and I started getting severe chills and could not stop shaking. That night was difficult to sleep because of the pain I was in. When I woke up the next day, 01/30/2021, I was dizzy, severe fatigue, had severe migraines, I could not breathe when standing up and moving around, my heart was racing, and it felt like I had a sun burn all over my body. I called the nursing coordinator for that day and asked what to do and she said to go to the ER. When I arrived at the ER, they said I had 100 degree temp., I was tacky. They gave me medicine for the pain and the doctor said I was having a adverse reaction to the vaccine but by the next day I would feel better. I went home and slept after the ER all day and night and by Sunday 01/31/2021, I was feeling better after excedrine and advil

                                                Diarrhea and Cramping : I felt fine on Friday I was doing well. My arm was sore but over the course of Saturday it started to go away. The one thing that I have been clocking is diarrhea. I would have a cramping cramping feeling in my stomach on my left side it would feel like it?s coming from my uterus. I had first thought it was because I was in a sitting position and the 90° angle wasn?t great for my body and so I thought I just had to leave straight because even as I?m talking this right now like I feel a little bit of cramping sitting in a 90° angle. But the diarrhea is still ongoing it?s been waking me up at five almost 6 AM and I woken up at least three times in the middle of the night going into Sunday. I was actually fine during the whole entire day of Saturday because I was able to like be on a long meeting call but after that was done my body just needed to expel things. I did eat a tiny bit while I was in a meeting I ate cake   chocolate, A bunch of sweets. Also after I?ve woken up right now at 6 AM I drink some water and the water felt like it was sitting in the top of my stomach and I have to slowly very very slowly go down not in my esophagus in my throat in my stomach like it bloated me and as I was walking around it slowly went away I am trying to drink a lot of water because I?m conscious that I?m having diarrhea.   Is the diarrhea an an allergic reaction? Is the diarrhea a reaction to an active ingredient in the vaccine? (polyethylene glycol)

I explained that I would like to extend her observation time to 30 minutes, and perhaps longer if she didn&#39;t feel better then. I offered her water and food. She declined water and asked for &#34;a snack.&#34; I re-evaluated her approximately every 5 minutes over the next half hour.

My heart rate was consistently in the 110s-120s and my blood pressure was in the 100s/40s. My highest temperature was 103.5. My fiancé is a nurse who took care of me at home. I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen for the aches and fever. I slept the majority of each day and was unable to perform my activities of daily life or exercise. I lost my appetite for about 1 week. I had no sense of taste in Sunday, which slowly returned over the next week. I was concerned about the loss of taste so I scheduled a COVID-19 swab which came back negative on 1/11.

A 24-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3247), intramuscular in left arm on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included generalised anxiety and allergies: Sulfa sensitive. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Jan2021, 45-60 minutes after vaccination, patient experienced hallucination, severe confusion, dizziness/light headedness, disorientation, fatigue, tachycardia, anxiety, full body weakness, then on 22Jan2021, 8 hours after, patient had full body muscle aches, headache, chills, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, anxiety, tachycardia, 16 hours after, experienced  confusion, full body muscle aches, headache, chills, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, tachycardia, anxiety, then 48 hours after, had confusion, full body muscle aches (TYLENOL helped), headache, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, tachycardia, anxiety, then 1 week after vaccination, patient was experiencing confusion, anxiety, and hallucinations throughout the entire week. Patient was unsure if she ever had a fever, as she did not check her temperature. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID saliva test: negative on 27Jan2021 and negative on 10Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of full body muscle aches. No treatment was received for the other adverse events. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported event hallucination cannot be completely excluded given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

                                                Left deltoid pain began at about 2:30 pm, approximately 3 hours after vaccine was administered in that arm. Pain progressed throughout the next few hours but was moderate. Around 11:30 pm the pain became more severe, to the point where any deltoid movement caused extreme pain. I used an ice pack to try to alleviate the pain but it only provided mild relief. When changing my shirt around this time I touched the area lightly and saw it was slightly swollen with fluid around the site of vaccination. Continued using ice because I had not eaten recently and did not want to take ibuprofen on an empty stomach and cause heartburn. I was unable to sleep on my left side and woke up around 4:30 am in severe pain, put ice on it again and fell back asleep. I had a low grade fever of about 99.4 F at this time and some chills. On 3/16 I woke up around 9:30 am and pain was still fairly moderate-severe and swelling was present but less than the night before. Around 10:00 am I ate breakfast and took ibuprofen, and the pain and swelling have been more moderate since.

The sore muscles make it hard to walk. I did not develop a low grade fever, but I did have a few hot flashes. I?m more fatigued than normal and haven?t been sleeping well at night since the last dose of the vaccine.

After about 36 hours it had resolved itself. strange feeling that I can best describe as &#34;trippy&#34; - lasted from about two hours after the vaccine until I went to bed that night - The cheese I ate with dinner tasted abnormally strong, I kept feeling like everything around me was moving even though it wasn&#39;t (felt like the floor / walls were moving - similar to when I&#39;m super tired and / or severely jet lagged), and somehow colors seemed a little off.  When I woke up the next morning this &#34;trippy&#34; feeling was gone.

He left to get water. Another RPH saw pt. falling over in her chair. Patient&#39;s eye were open and tears were coming down but she could not speak. Her eyes began to close and she kept trying to pass out. We took pts mask off and fanned her and kept talking to her. After about 3 minutes, she was able to focus her eyes and could say her name. After about 3 more minutes, she was able to count to 10 backwards. Her dad returned. She drank water and was feeling much better after about 20 more minutes.

                                                I started to feel out of it around 10pm the same day, and developed a fever. I felt dizzy and hot/cold.  The next day I had bad nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea. I wasn?t able to keep food in my stomach, and kept having to use the bathroom. I was very tired and went to sleep around 4pm. I woke up about 30 mins later and had a fever of 103. I was shaky and out of it. I had diarrhea throughout the night, and still do today. I still feel shaky, but the fever has come down though I think it?s a low grade one still.

                                                7 AM  (about 21 hours after I received the second dose) I woke up having the most intense nausea I have ever experienced. I went to my kitchen to get water and passed out, dropping the glass I was in the process of getting from the cabinet, and I crashed. I felt so horrible I just tried to get back to my bed at that point without getting water. I passed out again trying to get back to my bed, bruising my right knee and my ribs.  One the most horrible feelings I have experienced. I stayed on the floor for a bit recovering the second spell. My sister heard the commotion and quickly brought me water and Tylenol.  My head felt full of pressure that I couldn?t get rid of by holding my nose and blowing. Eventually that went away. I stayed in bed for the rest of the day drinking water and Gatorade. I felt like I had an intense flu for the remainder of the day with chills and fever. The following day I needed more sleep but felt better.  Now today, Saturday I feel better, but I still feel shocked at how intense my body?s reaction was to the second dose.

Minimal pain until around 3 am, woke up with severe muscle pain that continued to worsen into the next day- 4/14/2021. I could barely move my arm, the pain had me in tears a few times. Accompanied by inflammation surrounding injection site. Used a cold pack on the area within the first 24 hours, it did not help nor did ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or acetaminophen. Used a heating pad on low on the area to help with muscle stiffness, it helped minimally. Today, 4/15, the pain and inflammation is improved greatly but hives developed along with a very mild temperature. Symptoms improving overall

                                                The patient received the Pfizer vaccine, given by HCP. After the vaccine, the patient felt a little anxious with increased heart rate so she asked HCP for a bottle of water. HCP went to get the water and informed the pharmacist on duty. Both pharmacist and HCP came back to the patient. She got the bottle and was about to open the bottle, but closed her eyes  and started shaking like having a seizure and passed out. She came back right after passing out but didn&#39;t know what happened. She then started shaking again for a few seconds but didn&#39;t pass out. Everything happened so quickly when she remained sitting on the chair. We called 911 and paramedics came. She mentioned that the seizure happened to her before, maybe once or twice a year. When paramedics came, they checked her blood pressure and it was ok. We asked her and she wanted to come to the hospital to check out to make sure that she is ok.

                                                4/4: Woke up Easter Sunday with the following symptoms: sweats, chills, uncontrollable shaking, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Went to Urgent Care, but it was closed for the holiday, so instead went to ER. See Item 19 for details. I was discharged within an hour because there was nothing seriously wrong with me, doctor wrote it off as a stomach bug and ordered me to rest and hydrate.  4/4 - 4/10: Virtually every day for this week went the exact same. I would wake up between 6-7am, feel nauseous, weak, no appetite, and shaking. Walking around my apartment would leave me utterly exhausted. I would nap from 9am-12pm, then again from 2-4pm. Ate very little, drank water and sports drinks when awake. Breathing was still shaky. Occasional diarrhea.  4/10: Although slightly less ill than the previous 6 days, I still felt weak, shaky, and exhausted. I went back to Urgent Care this time, and the doctor examined me. She noted my left ear was very inflamed and suspected an ear infection. She prescribed me a week of amoxycilin and told me to rest and eat bland foods.  4/12: After 2 days on the antibiotics, some of my symptoms cleared. I was no longer shaking or having shortness of breath, and although still tired, I did not sleep for half the day as I had the previous week. My appetite was not fully there yet, and in the mornings of this week I would wake up feeling nauseous for about 2 hours. On this day 4/12 my period also started, which is unusual. It was not due to start until around April 17th. My period is very regular and light due to being on birth control, so I consider this abnormal. The flow was also very heavy.   4/17: Heavy flow of my period slows significantly and is now just a slight pink/brown color. I only need a liner to contain it. This is also my last day of antibiotics, so I buy a probiotic supplement in the hopes that it will help settle my gut.  4/17-present (4/20): The morning nausea and lack of appetite are still present despite being off the antibiotics. Occasional discomfort in abdomen/chest. Unexplained muscle soreness in hips, legs, back, and chest. My bowel movement schedule has also completely changed. Normally I do not experience a bowel movement until late morning, after 10am. But for the past 2 weeks I have been woken up around 5:30am with a sudden urge. At the beginning of my illness it was diarrhea but now it has transitioned to slightly more solid feces. It is not really diarrhea anymore.

                                                Received 2nd vaccine at 1:30pm on a Sunday afternoon. Woke up in the early hours of Monday not feeling great, didn&#39;t sleep well. Woke up at 8am for work with extreme chills, aches and pains. Tried to get up to get water, was so nauseous and lightheaded, I felt like I was going to pass out. Could barely stand up straight. Walked back to room and collapsed onto bed. Dry heaved into a trash can for a few minutes, feeling like I was about to throw up. Did not throw up. Took 2 Tylenol layed in bed, unable to move as I was extremely dizzy, nauseous and generally unwell. Fever of 99.?? (I forget). Fell asleep and woke up 2 hours later feeling better. Tylenol wore off around 5pm. Extreme chills and body aches came back. Fever of 100.4. Did not want to eat but had a few pieces of bread. Went to bed like normal that night. Felt almost back to normal the next day, still a little nausea with low energy but no fevers.

These symptoms have lasted for over seven weeks and are so bad to the point I cannot eat or sleep and have sought out emergency medical attention. In this same time period, I got what my doctors believe is Eosinophilic Esophagitis where my throat is now chronically inflamed, making it difficult to swallow. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue, anxiety, and mood swings when I never had a history of this.  I have tried taking several medications and PPI&#39;s with no success as well as trying every type of diet and lifestyle change possible with no success. I have not recovered from this and expect it will be some time before I do.

                                                This incident occurred at a mass vaccination clinic.  After the individual received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccine, she walked over to the monitoring area and sat down.  After a few minutes she became dizzy and disoriented, and then fainted. She woke up face down on the floor surrounded by a RN, EMT, and Paramedic.  Baseline of vitals obtained, registering a low BP.  Patient was monitored until VS were all WNL.  After patient was considered in stable condition, she was asked to walk a lap around the indoor venue to ensure she was well enough to leave.  She did so without issue and stated she felt &#34;back to normal&#34; and was ready to leave.  Patient was released at 15:07.

                                                Injection site started feeling sore after about four hours. The following day, my arm hurt much worse and the rest of my body began to ache throughout the morning. I developed a fever at 99.5°. Took Advil which helped a lot. Advil started to wear off at about 1:30. At that time, I became nauseous and a little dizzy. I ended up going home early from work because of it. That night, I had such intense pain around my midsection I could barely move and deep breaths such as a yawn hurt way more.

Managed to sleep for a few hours before waking up with the worst headache- it felt like someone had wrapped something around my head and was squeezing. Moving made it worse. Could barely stand and head was foggy.

A 24-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 24-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did have COVID prior vaccination and the patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced delirium at night of given dose in the morning. The patient was not feverish, but she was mumbling unintelligibly, shaking uncontrollably and not recognizing family members. The patient received ibuprofen and acetaminophen as the treatment for the events. the outcome of events, delirium, mumbling unintelligibly, shaking uncontrollably and not recognizing family members was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between event delirium and BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Tremendous headache; sore arm; exhaustion. My arm was sore somewhat from when the moment I got my vaccine. My headache started around 5:30-6:30 pm but was terrible from 6:40 pm for almost exactly 24 hours to the minute. I was so tired I laid around all day and slept from 8:30pm until 3:50am, when I woke up in a lot of pain and aches in my head. I?d also sweated through my pjs and sheets. Once I got back to sleep at around 5:30am, I slept until around 9:00am. I still felt very tired and had a very bad headache until around 4pm I took some Ibuprofen which helped with the aches somewhat. Then at around 6:40pm I had a moment where all the sudden I could open my eyes more &amp; could handle light (I?d shut all windows and turned off all lights when my headache began).  Storms were coming in so I started to feel a sinus headache which I think was coming from that, so I took Sudafed and Ibuprofen at around 8:30pm.

After work slept for 11 hours, woke up and ate, then slept for 2 more hours. Continued to be fatigued for the next 5 days, making it hard to work.

Couldn?t sleep because of chills but fell asleep around 11:30pm. Woke up around 2:20am because my fever broke. I went downstairs to get water and realized I was starting to get a headache similar to the one I had when I was diagnosed with Covid. Woke up at 10am with a pounding headache and couldn?t get out of bed. Wound up taking ibuprofen around 10:30am and felt so much better the rest of the day. No symptoms since.

I woke up on the floor, I woke up to my roommate and boyfriend standing over me. They were on the phone with 9-1-1. I was out for about a minute and unresponsive. According to them, my arm was flailing and seizure-ish. I went to the ER, I was taken by EMS services. They gave me fluids and ran bloodwork and monitored me. They sent me home, I did have another episode of what I think was an episode of memory loss/passed out. I just remembered waking up in a room alone. I was at the ER for about 4-5 hours. They gave me IV fluids and I don&#39;t remember what else, some sort of supplement. It was magnesium oxide they gave me. When I left the ER I was really exhausted, and feverish and gross and I was pretty sick for the remaining two days. I didn&#39;t sleep well that night, I had a fever the following day and into the second day upon returning home as well.

On the day of vaccination, I had a panic attack and nearly blacked out after vaccination, something that had never happened to me after a vaccination. Once the pain started a few hours after vaccination, it significantly increased. I experienced excruciating pain in my left arm like I had never felt after any other vaccination. Complete inability to move my arm without pain; the pain persisted even with zero movement whatsoever. Within the first 12 hours the pain spread to my entire left shoulder, and within 24 hours the pain spread to my neck, and general upper left quadrant of my body to the point where inhaling deeply would cause chest pain on my left side. This extreme pain persisted for about 3-4 days. After about the 5th day, my left arm still felt different and weaker than my right arm but little pain remained. After the 7th day, pain started back up whenever I tried to use my arm in any way. The days went on and the pain and arm weakness is not passing. It is minor pains, aches, and occasional throbbing compared to those first few days after vaccination but chronic pain nonetheless. My left arm continues to feel weak and I have a concentrated area of pain directly where the vaccination site was, it&#39;s as if I could still feel exactly where the needle went through my body. My arm feels okay pain-wise upon waking most days but I am unable to do anything as simple as chopping vegetables or washing dishes without feeling pain for the rest of the day. I am unable to even wear a backpack for more than 10 minutes without my left shoulder hurting and feeling fatigued.

Felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. couldn&#39;t lay down. had a sharp pain in the left side of my chest. This lasted almost the whole day Monday the 26th, would get a little better then woke up again on the 27th with the same pain.  My pain was at about an 8.5/10. I would take tylenol and ibuprofen to control the pain. After about 5 days the pain had gone completely away.

I was unable to draw in a breath or breathe at all. I shook my boyfriend awake and he could see I was passing out. My head began to fall back as I passed out from lack of oxygen. After this I was weak and was short of breath. An ambulance was called. I also ended up going to the ER. Throughout weeks after I had other heart episodes and tests. It was believed to be possible heart arrhythmias. I had a heart monitor for about two and a half weeks for testing. We have still not found answers and I still have episodes where my heart will randomly take off and race uncontrollably and I will get faint. I deal with chest pain on a regular basis. I have no history of heart issues and previously was always told I had a healthy heart. My current medications I have been on for some time and have never caused me issues. Ever since I received my second vaccination my heart hasn?t been the same.

Short bursts of dizziness lasting no longer than 20-30 seconds occurring about 1-3 times a day at most.  Did nothing about it because it was extremely manageable. From 5/08-06/18: Dizziness continues in small time frames throughout this period of time. Doesn&#39;t get better but also does not get worse. 06/18/2021: Dizziness worsens slightly and finding it hard for eyes to focus at work.  Did nothing about it because it was manageable at the time. 06/22/2021: Dizziness has become unmanageable. Eyes won&#39;t focus, room is spinning, feel slightly nauseous, feel like I&#39;m going to pass out, can&#39;t do my work properly.  Go to walk in clinic right after work.  Taking a ride share because I am so dizzy I am nervous to drive.  Find that I have an impacted ear-clean it out and go back home. 06/23/2021: Go back in to work. Think I&#39;m feeling better. Almost pass out at work, dizziness is worse than before. Leave work early and spend the rest of the week working from home. 06/24/2021: Dizziness does not improve. Barely able to get work done. Dizziness progresses into a headache and feel nauseous all the time. Go to walk in clinic again and get referred to an ENT. 06/26/2021: Do some digging on the internet and find antihistamines provide some relief for vertigo. Take 1 10mg dose of Zyrtec and feel some relief about 2 hours later. 06/28/-7/02: Return to work for the week because Zyrtec has provided enough relief that it is relatively easy to get work done. Manage to get things done enough. 06/30/2021: Go to ENT. Do hearing tests, etc. and Dr. says ears are not the cause and everything looks good. Get referred to a neurologist. 07/02/2021: Pass out. Feel so dizzy I can&#39;t figure out which way is up or down. 07/06-07/09: Continue to work out of the office. Feeling same as previous week. Zyrtec still providing some relief. 07/09/2021: Pass out again. Super dizzy again. 07/12-07/15: Work out of the office again. Zyrtec starts to feel like it is not providing relief anymore.  07/15/2021: Leave work early and work from home the rest of the week. Go to pharmacy and buy Claritin, Allegra, and generic brand Claritin 07/16/2021: Take Allegra and think it provides relief. It works well enough. 07/17-07/19: Allegra is no longer working and back to square 1.  Pushing through symptoms and trying to manage at work. No clue what is causing symptoms. 07/17/2021: Take Allegra

                                                February 2021 I received my 2nd dose of Pfizer. A day later I experienced flu like symptoms which went away within 3 days. About a week later I experienced dizziness and nausea. I did not have an appetite and could not eat well for about 3 weeks. I got an upper endoscopy which found mild acid irritation to my stomach (gastritis) and I was placed on medication. I then proceeded to get a gastric stomach emptying test, HIDA scan for constant nausea.  I went to PT for dizziness. This is now July and I have been to an ENT doctor, received CT scan for dizziness checking my sinuses. Went to a neurologist for an MRI for headaches and dizziness. Everything came back fine but I am now to the point I can barley work and it is July. I have gone to acupuncture as well but nothing is working. On Friday I ate gummy bears and my heart rate went to 160, chest tightness, tongue itchy and shaking. The hospital did not find anything and reported this as an anxiety attack. I ate gummy bears again on Sunday and the same thing happened. I am wondering if the shot trigger this and how can I get help? I was fine before this and I am looking for answers. I am not blaming the shot, I would just like feedback on how to help. Thank you.

A 24-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EW0173), 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 30Jun2021 (at the age of 24-years-old) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included, fluticasone propionate (FLOVENT), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) to an unspecified date, at for an unspecified indication and it was like a steroid inhaler like I Quit taking after I got vaccine because I had feeling maybe that was why I was getting those such effects. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On unknown date, she experienced confusion and trouble with walking straight and vertigo that lasted for 1 week. It was the first dose and I had got the shot I started feeling tired which was expected, I started having fever, chills and then I started feeling like a brain fog and I got a little bit of confusion and I began to dizzy and so, like I supposed it does not need to be in order but so I started out and felt tired which was expected and I started to get chills and fever, again kind of expected that, then I started to get, I was in like brain fog, where I can&#39;t think clearly and I had a bit of few visions and then I was having a lot of trouble in walking straight for 3 hour. That continued for few hours and then I still had dizziness for a week and now I feel fine, that was my experienced. The reason for transfer would be that the caller had very severe case of side effects after her first dose of COVID Vaccine 10 days ago and she was also trying to get the information as much as possible regarding what side effects are to be expecting from her second dose which was going to be soon. Consumer stated, I just want to make sure I did not had a reaction that I was not supposed to had and now like it was okay. I know you can not give medical advice probably but I just want to make sure it was safe for me to get second dose. Consumer was informed about the role of Pfizer drug Safety and also informed that Pfizer Medical Information was the right department answer the question consumer have regarding the vaccine and offered the number. Consumer stated, I experienced with first shot of Pfizer (Covid-19 Vaccine) and if it was different from anybody else got, I want to know that I am safe to get the second shot and I do not if someone had side effect like that or something. Patient received vaccination facility in: Consumer stated, It was like, made like a building inside of our shopping centre specifically for getting vaccinated but it was through the hospital. So, it was a walk-in clinic type of thing. Patient received treatment as Tylenol for fever, but other than that I think I just took some vitamins like zinc, vitamin C and vitamin D3. I did not get like any other treatment. The outcome of the events dizziness, vertigo, difficulty in walking, confusion was reported as recovered on unknown date and while for other event was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible.

I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

Then 12 Hours after vaccine my arm became VERY sore, took my ibuprofen and alternated with Acetaminophen.  Then my face became very flushed (I used ice packs) and I got a mild sore throat. That night I had difficulty sleeping. I kept waking up with terrible body aches. About 24 hours after the vaccine I just had fatigue, mild fever, and chills. I slept on and off throughout the day and then started to feel better. But at about 32 hours post vaccine I started to feel worse. My headache and sore arm came back and I became very light headed and dizzy.

                                                Almost exactly 12 hours after receiving the second dose of COVID vaccine, I woke up from sleep curled into a ball, covered in sweat, absolutely freezing, teeth chattering, and all my muscles were shaking violently. I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Headache, Body aches, Chills/trouble regulating body temperature, nauseous. Unsure how long it lasted because it was in the middle of the night. I was able to fall back to sleep and felt okay the next morning. I am still feeling a little nauseous and I am very tired because I didn&#39;t sleep well as a result of the symptoms but I felt fine enough to go to work.

I then called him back 4 minutes later and failed to form words, and also could not type words. I felt like I was going to faint and have no recollection of 10 minutes during that time. I had to leave work to go to the emergency room.  I had a massive headache for 3 days following my TIA.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events.

                                                approximately 5 min after receiving the vaccine, felt flushed and a swelling sensation in the throat. Felt like a globes sensation without itching or hives.   Nurses at vaccine site checked vitals multiple times. BP at start of symptoms 152/106, HR 140, O2 sat 99%. EMS was called but I did not feel symptoms were worsening, my lungs were clear without wheezing or stridor. I made the decision to not have EMS transport me to the ER. Symptoms improved so I decided to not go to the ER. Symptoms returned moderately for which I took 25 mg tab of Benadryl. As time progressed, symptoms waxed and waned, about 4 hours after the vaccine the globus sensation in the throat has improved, but there is a globs sensation in the lower esophagus, almost GERD-like in nature.

                                                Was driving home after waiting my 15 minutes. Throat started to close up, tingling sensation throughout entire body, rush of heat, dizziness, increased heart rate. Made it back to the site (closest medical professionals near me) where my throat still felt swollen but I could breathe. Chest hurt and was still dizzy. Was given 50mg Benadryl &amp; 20mg Pepsid. It seemed to come and go in waves but I still went to the ER. ER doc said what he saw I was experiencing was anxiety. Pharmacist who had been with me the whole time could tell that my neck and throat had been swollen but had gone down with the Benadryl. ER administered anti nausea meds and a steroid shot. Also prescribed steroids for a few days. Received the shot at 6:45, initial reaction occurred around 7:10, went to the ER around 8:45

                                                Five minutes after vaccine, I started having trouble breathing. Thought it was anxiety attack but I didn&#39;t feel anxious. I felt light headed and I don&#39;t get that with my panic attacks; At 15 minutes, my heart was beating really fast. They checked my vitals - pulse and BP was elevated. Pulse is over 130 and normally when I have an anxiety attack it doesn&#39;t go above 110. Went to the  ER . The breathing felt better after thirty min after being in ER and Blood pressure 1-2 hours later went down. No treatment. After about two weeks I saw my primary care doctor for check up.

She held her hand to calm down. gave her the vaccination and 5 mins later the patient said she has a headache, was upset, and started crying. She covered her eyes with her hands and started to shake. She also went to her bed and was rolling in it. The facility called 911 and they came within 5 mins. They did confirm that the patient wasn&#39;t having a seizure. Patient was calmed down but still went with the paramedics to be checked out. When I followed up with the facility, they said it was an anxiety event and the patient is back at the facility doing well. Let me know if you have any additional questions.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid, on 29Dec2020 at 18:40 (at the age of 25-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced broke out in hives all over her body on 03Jan2021, which was reported as medically significant.

The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received her first dose of the vaccine on 29Dec2020 and said 5 days later she broke out in hives. The patient stated her hives began on the evening of 03Jan2021. She clarified she had hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable. She said she still had areas on her legs and ankles that were reddened. She said the reddened areas on her legs and ankles are not fully raised or itchy, like she had experienced with the hives on the rest of her body. The patient went to an urgent care on 06Jan2021. She saw a dermatologist for the hives on 07Jan2021, who suspected that since she did not have any prior history of hives, her hives are from the COVID-19 vaccine. She said the dermatologist told her there is no way to truly test if the vaccine caused her hives. The patient received an intramuscular unspecified steroid shot at the dermatologist and was prescribed methylprednisolone (MANUFACTURED BY: PAR PHARMACEUTICAL; Lot number: 1129091; Expiration date: Dec2021) 4 mg tablets in a taper dose pack. She also stated that she took the following over-the-counter medications: diphenhydramine hydrochloride (reported as: generic BENADRYL; MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN; Lot number: 0MR0456; Expiration date: Sep2022) 25 mg tablet, taken as needed; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC; Lot number: 1652346; Expiration Date: Dec2021) 10 mg tablet, taken as one tablet up to four times a day; and hydrocortisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) cream. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all of the events as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of broke out in hives all over her body and didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights because she was so uncomfortable was recovering and of areas on her legs and ankles that are reddened was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events.

The patient did not receive any treatment from events. The outcome of events was recovered in Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported temporary mental fog/mental impairment was likely related to first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.

                                                I am a third-year medical student. Since receiving the second dose of the COVID vaccine (Pfizer) on Tuesday 2/2, I have had persistent and worsening muscle spasms of the torso. I presented to the Emergency room on 2/6 due to worsening symptoms and was admitted until 2/7. The neurology team evaluated my condition was not able to make a firm diagnosis. They believe the vaccine has caused a dystonic reaction. I was given benadryl 25mg to continue for one week q6 hours prn. However, benadryl has provided minimal relief. They also strongly recommended that I be seen by a movement disorder specialist at hospital ASAP.  However, due to the fact that I have insurance I am not covered for care from hospital. My insurance said they will review the referral which will take another 5-7 business days from today 2/9. As a medical student, I have had to miss one week of clinic rotations and will continue to miss vital medical training as well as my board exam this Friday due to my worsening symptoms. It has created such a negative impact on my life including pausing my medical training, and physically being incapable of driving or performing many of my basic daily activities. I live alone and near hospital. I am urgently requesting if there is anyway CDC can help me, a medical student who has put in her all to fight the pandemic alongside you.   I am extremely concerned about my symptoms and the panic that it has created for my family and friends. I hope that a rapid response can help me and my loved ones find some answers during these challenging times.

                                                Within 15 minutes my vision began to blur, I became shaky and disoriented. My heart rate increased and it felt as though my blood pressure decreased rapidly. After 30 minutes my symptoms had worsened and I was so disoriented I was not able to seek medical attention while being observed. I exited the building and once I got into my car my face (specifically under my eyes and on my cheeks) began swelling and a red burning rash appeared. By the time I got home (10 more minutes) I needed Benadryl immediately, I was not able to complete my sentences and all other symptoms had become more intense. I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours for the next few days due to the symptoms consistently rebounding. I had one episode of throat tightness but it passed without use of my epipen. I checked my pulse and blood pressure frequently with the lowest reading being 93/60. Lethargy, shakiness, confusion, high heart rate all are still present after 5 days. The rash went away after 48 hours.

                                                At 7:00am the morning after receiving my second dose of the vaccine, I arose from bed and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

At around 6:00 am on 2/14, I woke up with some brain fog and my skin being incredibly sensitive to touch and textures. Even just the sheets or blankets touching me was painful. After sleeping for a couple more hours the sensitivity has decreased but is still significant. The sensitivity is all over, not restricted to one area.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

It started in her scalp, moved to her face, and then onto her throat. She was at work at this time. I advised her to take a 25 mg Benadryl (which may cause drowsiness). Based on her size (145 lbs) employee did not recommend she take a 50 mg Benadryl. Patient did not know if she had a fever or not. She reported NO fever at that time. Employee called her back at 6:30 PM to check on her. She said she had to leave work around 2 pm; she was feeling bad, achey. She said she took some ibuprofen as she was feeling achey and feverish. she didn&#39;t feel the need to go to the doctor or urgent care at this time.

I remained dizzy for the next 4 days feeling like I was on a boat. By the 6th day it was even worse. It has lasted over 3 weeks now and is ongoing. I have been trying the epley maneuver as I was instructed to do so by my doctor and take my allergy medication (Flonase) to potentially decrease inflammation as well as take tylenol. I will be going to see an ENT specialist next week to try to get some relief. It has been horrible and I haven&#39;t been able to work full time for the last 2 weeks.

                                                I&#39;d had Bell&#39;s Palsy (BP) twice in my life (once in 2013 and once in 2015). I have not had it since 2015 until I got vaccinated on 3/29/21 and began to develop BP symptoms on the evening of 4/6/21 (headache on right side of my head/temple, odd sensation on right side of my tongue, almost like I burned it on a hot beverage) but I didn&#39;t think anything of it. I went to sleep and then, on the morning of 4/7/21, I woke up feeling extremely fatigued, brain fogged, and weak. I didn&#39;t notice any of the BP symptoms until I went to brush my teeth and realized I had lost motor function in the right side of my mouth. I immediately made a telehealth appointment with an Urgent Care doctor in order to get an Rx of Prednisone. I began taking the Prednisone around 3pm on Wednesday, 4/7/21. I also have been taking vitamin B-12 and a Women&#39;s Multivitamin to help regenerate nerve function.  However, since starting the prednisone, my symptoms have continued to develop. Symptoms currently include: right side of my face is extremely swollen; I have lost mobility on the right side of my face, the right side of my tongue still feels numb; right eye tearing non-stop; some mild ear pain in right inner ear; slight pins-and-needles sensation in my fingers on my right hand; difficulty eating and drinking; still feeling fatigued.  I have recovered from BP twice before so I am not too worried about having it again. I just think the FDA needs to put out a warning to the public that there may be a correlation between the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and Bell&#39;s Palsy recurrences. I know this is not a coincidence, and my BP relapse was a result of my body experiencing an immune reaction from the vaccine.

Patient was unconscious briefly, but woke up after less than a minute a little disoriented.  She was sweating and felt very hot, except for her hands that were cold.  We gave her water and an ice pack to cool her down and waited with her until paramedics came to treat her.  She seemed alert and that the issue had mostly resolved as she left with paramedics approximately 15 minutes later, but it is unknown what happened after she left with them.

                                                The first dose of the Pfizer vaccine was taken on March 15th at 8:30. Within a week I started feeling weak joints, headaches followed by a sharp pain on the occipital lobe. I started my period for the second time that month, which was odd because it never happened to me before. I went to work that week, but by Friday (March 30th) I was not able to handle the pain so after work I went to the doctor and they took blood to see if there was anything going on. The result came back the following day and everything was normal. I was given medicine (muscle relaxers) for the occipital pain, but it was not enough. At that time I was not sure what was the cause of it, I thought it was a bad flu, but I didn&#39;t come to the conclusion that it was because of the vaccine, because a week had passed by, so I thought it was impossible. The doctor asked for me to take an X-Ray for the occipital pain, so I did (March 30th) and it resulted in everything being fine. She also recommended for me to get an abdominal ultrasound to see if my uterus was fine due to the second period. I currently took the second Pfizer dose in the same location, but this time around I felt all of these symptoms within 3 hours of the vaccination. I started feeling lightheaded and dazed, my joints started feeling weak, my mouth and tongue started feeling sensitive (fever blisters and sensitive to anything that is acidic, spicy, etc).  I have not visited the doctor this time around because the pain is tolerable. I have noticed in increase of joint pain as the days go by.

                                                Extreme change in menstrual cycle. I got cramps the same day as the vaccine, more than a week early, which has never happened before in my life. I have already had my period for over 9 days, and it is not done yet, which is already much longer than normal. Stronger cramps and stronger flow. It also started differently than normal, with light bleeding for days at the beginning. I also felt much stronger depression than I have ever felt in my life before. It was overwhelming. I was about to change my birth control method before I put the two together because the pain, flow, and depression were so bad it was unbearable. I was unable to work. I did not report these symptoms on my follow-up survey that I received every day for a week after because I did not know it was connected to the vaccine. I feel so relieved to understand what is going on.

A bad migraine, unable to stand because it caused so much pain in my head. at 8:00PM I went to bed due to the pain. at 1:15 AM, my body was in pain. My right rib cage hurt so bad that I couldn&#39;t sleep on my right side. My legs, back, and pelvic bones were in so much pain as well. I felt as if my bones were going to break or I had severely bruised my bones. Breathing, coughing, sneezing hurt because of my rib cage hurting. My migraine had not gone away, and my lymph nodes were really swollen. Couldn&#39;t put my arms down, my neck was swollen and walking hurt because my legs were swollen. This occurred for 24 hours. Next day, migraine is gone and left a headache. Swelling is still prominent and bones still hurt.

After noticing some blood coming from the injection site patient became very worried and said she felt lightheaded. She was offered a chair to sit on but within 5 minutes of sitting down she said she was not feeling any better. While I was talking to her she seemed to have a mild seizure-like episode which lasted less than a minute. After she became alert she said her thumbs were cramping up and asked us to call 911 for her. Paramedics took her to the hospital.

                                                I have trouble swallowing solid food. Specifically, after chewing the solid foods finely (i.e. eggs, spam, meat, edamame), the throat will not swallow. It just feels like the throat forgets how to swallow, which should have been a natural response normally that does not require conscious thinking. If I forcefully swallow it, it feels like the food did not go down well and some pieces were stuck in the trachea and I want to spit out mucous. When I spit out, there were nothing strange, mainly just saliva. I had no issue swallowing liquid or soft foods (i.e. yogurt and steamed egg). I do not feel pain or swollen on throat but do sometimes feel there was something at the back of the throat. But again when I spit out mucous there was nothing abnormal. I went to the Purdue student health center and they did not find any abnormal in the throat, only seemed a little red but nothing abnormal.

As of today (04/28/21), a red circle with the diameter of more than 1 inch, slightly tender on my left arm. Gradually increased in size over the last 2 weeks. My whole body is itchier than normal. I&#39;m now using a body lotion daily so I have not experienced much itchiness since. I&#39;ve been very fatigued &amp; irritable. My headaches have gotten worse and I haven&#39;t had much of an appetite.

It was the kind of uncomfortable where I swear I could feel it in my bones. Laid in bed until 8:30 when baby boy woke up, promptly threw up, got so nauseated and dizzy that I could not move from the bathroom floor, and had to ask grandma to bring me my medicines. The mix of ibuprofen, migraine medication, and anti-nausea all combined made me feel no symptoms for several hours until they wore off and I lost all ability to stand. My legs just felt so weak. And now I?m finally starting to feel a little better, and it?s been 2.5 days now. Boy, those side effects are no joke. Still worth it though so I don?t bring a deadly virus home to my baby boy ?????

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at age of 25-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The caller stated her daughter had the vaccine on Thursday and was having bad side effects. She stated her lymph nodes in her neck were severely/extremely swollen and painful where she could barely turn her neck and her neck was sore. She was having severe lower abdominal pain that started that evening, bad first two days and had subsided. The patient was really tired. She had a sore throat, a headache, and overall feels horrible. She stated 3 days ago there were reports of hundreds of women in her age group having these same symptoms and this information was not available to them prior to the vaccine. She stated there were woman dying in Norway from thrombosis, 20 women in their reproductive years. Woman this age were getting severe reactions and there is no available information on this. She asked, how long will these symptoms last. How to make the swelling and pain go away. Stated that she was fine before the vaccine and currently she was not fine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                I had joint and muscle pain throughout my body, dizziness and weakness three days after my vaccine after giving blood that Saturday at 11 am. The pain was throughout my body so much that I couldn&#39;t do my normal functions.  I also developed stomach pain a day after I gave whole blood. These symptoms lasted 5 days, after which I still had some muscle pains and weakness but not that I couldn&#39;t continue on in my normal activities. The muscle pain and weakness symptoms lasted another week before I felt more normal, although, the stomach pain went away after about 5 days.   After my second dose on April 7th, 2021 with Pfizer lot number ER8727 in my left arm, I was tired and had a little bit of muscle pain right away but these symptoms only lasted 24 hours after my shot at 9am that Wednesday I received that dose.

Then the &#34;weird&#34; or uncomfortable soreness that feels to her like cold nerve pain or just super mild discomfort did not go away completely and has still not gone away so far 5 days after the vaccine.. Patient also leg discomfort (super mild but also not totally normal) for 1-2 days after the vaccine. She is not sure if the neck moderate pain  that radiates to the back is associated and it started on Tuesday or 4-5 days after the vaccine. Like a cold numbness is how she would describe it.

                                                I woke up with severe vertigo &amp; nausea on Sunday, May 2nd. Continued to experience severe vertigo until Wednesday, May 5th. I had trouble walking, moving my head &amp; eyes to the side or vertically, and couldn&#39;t tolerate bright lights or loud sounds. Vertigo symptoms mainly subsided on Wednesday evening, but I have been experiencing other symptoms since then. I have felt very &#34;off&#34; as if I&#39;m floating, or high on drugs (I have not taken any medication for this). I&#39;ve experienced a headache and felt lightheaded, and dizzy if I make certain head movements. I have never experienced anything like this before. I&#39;ve had vertigo once before this, but it only lasted several hours and I did not experience any other symptoms. I also experienced slight vertigo (only a couple of seconds) as the first symptom of COVID when I had it in March 2020.

                                                1st shot only experienced an expected amount of soreness around the injection site. 2nd dose: experienced mild flu symptoms (body aches, fatigue, headache, lack of appetite) the day after the shot and the symptoms only lasted 24 hours with just some slight soreness leftover the next day. That same week on Friday I woke up with an intense migraine that came in and out even after taking Midol. This migraine started shooting pain from the top of my head, down through my neck, into my arms, and all the way down my back. These were sharp sudden pains that I would feel. I started to have muscle spasms in my face and felt a bit nauseous/didn?t have an appetite. I felt very foggy, like I was just floating around but also that my body weighed 1000lbs. I?ve been experiencing these symptoms for 4 days now. I?m mostly still struggling with headaches, some fatigue, and muscle aches. I?ll get these aches randomly throughout my body. Sometimes it feels a bit flu like, the same as it felt on the day after I had got my 2nd dose. I don?t know if these symptoms are related to the vaccine or not.

                                                Patient reported  symptomatic heart palpitations after receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine on 5/11/2021 at 1pm which lasted a few hours. She then presented to her urgent care clinic around 3pm and was transferred to the Hospital ED. She was found to be in sinus tachycardia to HR 140s-150s. Work-up as described below was largely unrevealing. Plan for TTE on this hospital admission. Overall believe that severe anxiety is a the driving factor behind her sinus tachycardia, and that the SARS-CoV2 vaccination was just coincidental in time course.

                                                On May 11 (ten days after second shot), I broke out in full body hives (face, arms, legs, entire abdomen). Extreme itchiness all over body - unable to sleep. Body was entirely red with raised white welts.  Visited urgent care doctors, dermatologist, and allergist. Landed on a treatment plan with the allergist with a strong dose of steroids and antihistamines, which have mostly resolved the symptoms as of 5/18 (Biaxin, Medrol, Probiotic, Pepcid, Xyzal, Allegra, Benadryl). I was prescribed a Prednisone taper along with Zyrtec from Urgent Care on May 12, but my symptoms did not improve until starting the allergist&#39;s plan on 5/15.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 12Feb2021 12:30 PM (at the age of 25-year-old) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccine facility type was reported as hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history included depression and anxiety, both from unspecified date. No known allergies and no COVID prior vaccination were reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications reported as within two weeks from vaccination included amfetamine aspartate/amfetamine sulfate/dexamfetamine saccharate/dexamfetamine sulfate (reported as generic ADDERRAL), duloxetine hydrochloride (reported as generic CYMBALTA), both from unspecified date. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number not provided), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on unspecified date as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks from vaccination. On 13Feb2021 12:00 AM the patient experienced lethargy, swollen and painful arm and armpit, chills, nausea, headache, muscle aches all over body, restlessness in muscles (feel like she had to flex everything). Treatment for the events were received and reported as patient took lots of extra strength paracetamol (TYLENOL). Patient had not been tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not resolved.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (11May2021): Follow-up attempts completed. No further information is expected.

                                                After receiving my second dose, I was seen by my primary doctor for suspected Celiac disease (which came back positive). I had a strange medical episodes during the bloodwork (April 15th) that they originally assumed was anxiety. Symptoms were shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and loss of feeling in extremities. I?m a first responder and did not feel this was anxiety, but didn?t argue and forgot about it until it happened again.   I had my second episode on April 20th, and debated going to the ER for it. A third episode on April 23rd did put me in the ER. I proceeded to have more episodes on almost a daily basis after that and started monitoring blood pressure, pulse, blood sugar, and food intake at home (some of my bloodwork levels were off due to the celiac). I purchased a heart rate monitor, a blood glucose meter, and a smartwatch to monitor some of my symptoms. Both devices (monitor and watch) would later flag me as having a suspicious heart rhythm (heart monitor could be for fast/slow rhythm or for arrhythmia, smartwatch flagged me as Afib twice). I could not recreate these results when my husband wore the devices.  Episodes could be as brief as 45 mins or last more than 12 hours. I have a high pain tolerance and illness tolerance, and had to leave work several times due to my symptoms (extremely abnormal for me).   After several more appointments with my primary doc and another visit to the ER (where they did another EKG, an X-ray, and more bloodwork), things were still coming back inconclusive.  After about April 28th, I started having significant chest pain with my episodes. The ER checked me for possible clotting related to the heart issues and my birth control pills. My arrhythmia could not be captured on their devices.   My doctor has since diagnosed it as suspected myocarditis (pending more testing). We?ve ruled out all possible things related to my Celiac diagnosis, and can?t seem to find a cause for this. I had a few things I brought to her attention that may be the cause (pinched nerve at chiropractors, covid vaccine) and she says it may be the vaccine, and said I should report it to you.

She quickly came through. Pt says she felt tingling in her hands, arms, and legs. Throat felt a little scratchy. Gave her some water and got some frozen water bottle because her skin was clammy. It took her about 20 minutes to come back to normal.  Paramedics were called but by the time they arrived she felt better. Patient refused the paramedic ride. She stayed and extra 30 minutes to call down. She says the tingling in legs was gone but the arm and hand she receivied the vaccine in were still a little tingly. Informed pt that if she felt and worse or anything out of the ordinary to go to ER.

                                                Received my second shot on Friday 4/30/21 at 12:15pm, had chills and body aches that night and felt fatigue through to Sunday morning 5/2/21. On Sunday morning when I woke up my vagina felt sore, later in the day the pain intensified and was extremely painful Sunday night, barely slept because of constant burning and itching feeling. There was also a brownish discharge leaking out. Monday morning I made an appointment with my gynecologist, and a nurse practitioner did an exam showed me the genital ulcers and told me it was most likely herpes. They swabbed one of the ulcers and gave me a prescription for Valacyclovir for 10 days. I also took a blood test for HSV1/HSV2 IGG and IGM the next day. For the first 5 days the pain was horrible, worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt, couldn&#39;t walk, stand, sit or sleep. I got my period Wednesday morning which made it even worse.  On Friday morning 5/7/21 I got a call from the nurse practitioner and she said the swab and blood test came back negative, I went back the same day so the doctor could look. They still thought it was herpes and told me to take another blood test in a month. I did not have a prior diagnosis of herpes and showed no symptoms before. My partner of the past 1.5 years got tested for herpes and was also negative. After a month I went took another blood test and it came back negative again for HSV-1 and HSV-2.  The only thing different in my medical history is that I got the vaccine and 36-48 hours later I had herpes symptoms.  These symptoms lasted for 2.5 weeks until I started to no longer feel any pain.

I was irritable, in pain, and needed to use feminine products for the first time in years. Since this vaccine, I have had spotting and cramping randomly. This did not happen pre-vaccine. No treatment known (other than removal) that is preferable. Slowly this is going back to normal but still having random days of spotting.   Filing a report in case there is a reaction found between hormones (birth control) and vaccine ingredients.

                                                Second vaccine dose was on Monday, Friday night started with severe tremors, cold chills, severe heart palpitations, extreme rapid heat beat, heart pounding. Very scary, couldn&#39;t sleep. After 24 hours it hadn&#39;t gone away so I sought medical treatment at an emergency room. They did tests and said everything as normal. They sent me home with an antihistamine to take as anxiety medicine. Heart palpitations lessened but extreme symptoms persisted for 3 more days.  It has been 10 days since my hospital visit and symptoms have mostly gone away. Terrible experience.

                                                Burning pains everywhere that come and go at random, sometimes lasts days. Neurological. First day of &#34;adverse event&#34; was July 3rd, but the night before I had thrown up but felt fine. On July 3rd, had first time bad Acid Reflux, took OTC Prilosec which helped over the course of a few days. Someone suggested trying Claritin for the random burning, but it does not help. Strong back pain. Random bouts of nausea (trying not to throw up to avoid Acid Reflux again). Difficulty eating and drinking as a result of symptoms. Sleeping a lot more than usual. Weak in general. A few days ago started to feel better, still kept diet specific to avoiding Acid Reflux. Overnight, horrible burning in limbs and random parts of body came back. Slept and napped for about 18 hours yesterday as burning was ongoing. Can sleep through pain. Pain is instant upon waking up. Sometimes (like right now as I write this) burning is tolerable, sometimes it is unbearable and crying hurts too. Muscle spasms and twitching occasionally, sometimes in frequent in a session. Primary doctor agrees that all of these symptoms are from the vaccine.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EWO172, Expiry date: unknown, at the age of 25-year-old), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 08Jun2021 10:30 or so as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unspecified date and ongoing (She has had it her entire life), insomnia from an unspecified date and ongoing (She was diagnosed in high school), Borderline anemia from an unspecified date in May2021 and ongoing (It began in the beginning of May), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity, Cholesterol (Her grandpa had high cholesterol. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine at 20 mg from 20May2021 and ongoing and ascorbic acid, folic acid, iron, lysine hydrochloride, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin, thiamine, zinc sulfate (MULTIVITAMIN IRON) pill from an unspecified date and ongoing (every other day) for Borderline anemia. She had taken it for a couple weeks back in May and was eating foods to try and boost her iron and with the iron pill was overdosing. The patient experienced pain at the injection site and was feeling fatigue on 08Jun2021. She wanted to hold on getting the second dose because she is not feeling well. She has been doing better than she has been over the past week. Pain at injection site was really bad the first and continued throughout the rest of the week. It was her second week, and she couldn&#39;t lift her arm, sleep on that side, and had trouble with everyday things. That is when she started to get concerned and annoyed. She put ice on it last night and over the past week has been trying Dayquil and Nyqui. She took Daytime Cold and Flu Multi Symptom Relief, lot: 9LKO654, expiration date: Apr2021. The lot has either an O or 0. She doesn&#39;t know where the Nyquil. She doesn&#39;t remember when she took them. In the first week she tried to make use of the medications she had. When she tries to do exercises, she still gets pain. Her arm wanted to go to sleep like it did not want her to use it. It has lightened up. It was definitely worse in the first 7 to 10 days. She can move her arm now. When she touches her arm it does hurt, but the pain kind of gets less throughout the day. It kind of goes like a numb thing and wants to go to sleep. On 15Jun2021 or 16Jun2021 she thought she was good to go, and the next day she was nauseous on 08Jun2021, her arm was hurting, she had a headache on an unspecified date, and she had a sore throat. She thought she was doing better, but normally she doesn&#39;t take naps and yesterday and today she took a 3-hour nap. In the middle of something she will fall asleep. The first week she was watching a movie with her siblings and they said she fell asleep in the middle of it but was talking in her sleep and pointing at things. It is a very heavy fatigue. Sore throat would be the first thing she noticed when she woke up in the morning. It was definitely the morning after she had the vaccine, and for the first week it was every day she woke up with a sore throat and later had a nose-bleed. She chalked it up to being dehydrated and drank coconut water. Another symptom she noticed only for the first week that started on 08Jun2021 was nosebleeds. That does not commonly happen. She tries to stay hydrated and drink water. It was the first 7 to 10 days where she had a nosebleed al-most every day. She has a pain that causes headaches where the muscle between her shoulder has been very tight since she had the vaccine on the left side. She tries to put ice on it, and it does cause a headache every now and then. She tries to take cold showers and an ice pack to relax the muscle. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. The outcome of events Pain at injection site, It was definitely worse in the first 7 to 10 days and nauseous was Recovering and for Fatigue, Headache was Not recovered and for rest of the events it was unknown.
