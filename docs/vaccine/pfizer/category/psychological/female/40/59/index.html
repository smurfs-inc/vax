I also had some numbness on the top of my thigh.  I sat for monitoring for a couple hours and was sent home.  The tingling moved to the back of my head for a little while last night and seemed to had resolved before I went to bed around 10p. The tingling seems very minimal this morning...on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the most noticeable, yesterday was a 10. Today seems to be a 1 or 2. Only noticeable if I am sitting still and be more along my ear and not my head or shoulder. There is still the weird feeling (similar to numbness) in my face and my thigh. My face is getting better.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0930 am 1/6, about 6 hours later I started feeling extreme fatigue and a slight sore throat. I left work early at that time. When I got home I couldn&#39;t stay awake and fell asleep around 6pm. Then starting having GI distress cramping, pain and diarrhea around 9pm-11pm. At 2 am I woke up with chills and fever, I took a Tylenol around 3-4 m and then broke out if huge sweat, then finally fell asleep. 1/7/21 I mostly have soreness, headache and fatigue now.

                                                Received vaccine at 1730, then just before midnight my heart began to pound hard and very fast, and it made me feel short of breath or as though I had to cough. After about a minute I thought it might be SVT so I did a valsalva maneuver and it stopped.  I was resting in bed, no alcohol or caffeine, and this has never happened to me before. Since then, I have felt at least one heart palpitation per day, sometimes many more. The last few days I have felt extremely fatigued and have had an odd sensation in my chest. On 1/7 I developed a dry cough, and was swabbed for Covid because I felt so bad. It was negative. This made me wonder if the odd sensation in my chest was related to my heart and not my lungs. I am due for my second vaccine today, and am unsure if I should get it.

Approximately 6 hours after getting the shot I started feeling tired and a couple hours after that I felt crummy and the chills started.  Mine weren&#39;t nearly as bad as some others have experienced.  I didn&#39;t sleep well that night and woke up with a mild headache and body aches.  Approximately 10AM on Thursday I noticed I had swelling in my upper lip and later my jawline with slight numbness.  My eyes started feeling puffy that evening, approximately 6:30pm, and the symptoms began to improve after taking a Benadryl around 7:15pm.  The swelling and numbness didn&#39;t seem to move down towards my throat nor did I experience any difficulty breathing or swallowing.  I sl

Extreme shoulder pain started a few hours after vaccination and developed loss of range of motion, weakness, inability to lift arm, tingling and numbness down the length of arm.  Severe pain prohibiting ADLs; needing assistance with every day functions.  Pain is incrementally improving but after 4 days still without recovery.   Suspect nurse placed too high, injecting into bursa instead of deltoid muscle. RN seemed concerned after injection. She also was not sitting during injection, increasing the likelihood of injecting too high.

                                                Anxiety; Headache; Seeing stars; Chest tightness; Hand tremor; SOB; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 40-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1284; Expiration date was not reported), intramuscularly on the left arm on 06Jan2021 (10:15) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital. Medical history included migraines; heart murmur with surgery; grand mal seizure that has resolved; and contrast dye allergy. Concomitant medications included sumatriptan and norethindrone [norethisterone]. The patient previously took phenytoin, iodine, terconazole, tramadol and cetirizine; and had allergies with these medications. On 06Jan2021 (10:15), the patient was seeing stars; had chest tightness; hand tremor; and shortness of breath (SOB). The patient was referred to the Urgent Care Clinic due to these events. On 06Jan2021 (12:30), at the Urgent Clare Clinic, the patient had anxiety and headache. The patient had received acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, ibuprofen and water as treatment for the events, &#39;seeing stars&#39;, &#39;chest tightness&#39;, &#39;hand tremor&#39; and &#39;shortness of breath&#39;; and was provided with education on managing anxiety. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021 for &#39;seeing stars&#39;, &#39;chest tightness&#39;, &#39;hand tremor&#39; and &#39;shortness of breath&#39;; and was unknown for &#39;headache&#39; and &#39;anxiety&#39;. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested post-vaccination.

It is fine unless I touch it, but if I do bump it or make contact with it, it hurt like the area was very bruised or recently injured.  The pain has improved but it is still very sensitive. I didn?t think it was related to the shot, but I could not recall any injury.  I can  function like normal.  My dr suggested I do a round of steroids, but to contact her immediately or go to ER if it worsened.  I am to follow up with her in 2 weeks.

Overnight I was restless and unable to sleep well, body aches and hot and then chilled and cold.  By morning my arm was so sore and swollen it was difficult to move it, continued with all over body aches, fatigue to the point of unable to sit up, no fever but alternated chills/cold and hot/sweat.  I did take ibuprofen every 4-6 hours throughout the day.  This is the same type of reaction I had to tetanus when a teen.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:45 at a single dose for immunization. Medical history included benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, but the patient has not had a flare of this condition in 3.5 years. The patient has no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient who has a history of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) had not had a flare of this condition in 3.5 years. Previously, it has only been brought on by scuba diving, then she woke up the day after receiving the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, on 23Dec2020 at 06:30 with an episode of vertigo consistent with prior episodes of BPPV. She has associated nausea and vomiting, and her symptoms mostly resolve with doing home exercises, rest and time. On 29Dec2020, that is day 7 after the vaccine and she still have mild vertigo. She has no fevers, chills, or myalgias. She stated that perhaps it was a coincidence but thought it might be worth reporting, and she fully intend to get the second Pfizer vaccine when available. No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, and since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine, and no other medications were received by the patient within 2 weeks of vaccination. The events nausea and vomiting resolved in 2020 while the rest of the events was resolving.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140/ELO140), via an unspecified route of administration, at the left arm on 30Dec2020 06:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital.  Medical history included seasonal allergies and doesn&#39;t take medications. On the same day of 30Dec2020, about an hour after vaccination, patient got a very metallic taste in mouth, which lasted for about 12-18 hours and did sleep a lot, which she expected, but woke up about 11 at night and still had it and it was gone. Patient knew she slept longer than she normally does, went to bed at 1PM and slept until 11PM, which is not usually normal. Was up for about an hour or two and then went back to bed until 8AM of 31Dec2020. Patient was concern was if it was some type of reaction that it would mean she was going to have a stronger reaction to the second one and stated it was irritating but not a huge deal. Patient also felt tired and expected it as she worked five 12-hour shifts in a row. Patient was not sure if the metallic taste was connected to the COVID-19 vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfa antibiotics. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took meperidine (DEMEROL) and experienced allergies. Within an hour of receiving the vaccine, the patient had a sharp intermittent pain in her left jugular/carotid neck area and felt a little &#34;tipsy&#34;. This continued for about one day. Then last week (approximately 28Dec2020), her upper left molar started aching (toothache). This subsided within about 2 days. Then on 30Dec2020, she developed a severe earache, which began to subside within about 2 days. Around 31Dec2020 through 04Jan2021, she had intermittent numbness and tingling in her left jaw area. Last night (05Jan2021), she developed a sharp pain on the back side of her left neck area. She went to the doctor on 04Jan2021, and no treatment was prescribed. She began self-medicating with an old prescription of prednisone on the evening of 04Jan2020 due to being fearful of developing Bell&#39;s Palsy. Most of her symptoms have now improved after beginning the prednisone. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering.

She is now having ringing in her ears, feeling lightheaded, hot, nauseaus, and &#34;I feel like I am in a cloud.&#34; She denies allergies or past hx of vaccine reactions. Denies hx of anaphylaxis.

Within minutes, I felt tingling sensations along all my fingers and thumbs.  Then numbness at the tips.  Then, both my hands were very cold. At about 2- 3, I fell groggy, tired.  Then came the chill and fever, also light headaches.  The numbness was gone.  1/13 I hit my right funny bone and my pinky, ring, and middle fingers were locked up tight.  I tried to uncurl them.  But they stayed locked.  It lasted about 1-2 minutes.  I got stomach pain around 5. 1/14 I have excessive phlegm at around 3pm and currently still have excessive phlegm.  Then at around 10 pm, I had bad warped vertigo.

                                                I started itching while being monitored post vaccine administration within the 5 minutes of the vaccine being administered. The itching was everywhere including my tongue and throat, since this is my workplace and I was working I had to go home and was given Benadryl to take upon arrival, the Benadryl did not help so I did a virtual visit with a physician who recommended that I increase the dose of benadryl at the same time I called my PCP to inform them of the issue they ordered, Atarax 25 mg every 6 hours plus taking an over the counter antihistamine.

                                                This is a 41 y/o woman with who received her second COVID-19 vaccination today. Following this immunization, she appropriately stayed in the waiting area for the 30 minutes. She then got in car and 15 minutes after, she noticed that her tongue was feeling full/swollen and that was experiencing neck swelling. These symptoms persisted and resembled a prior allergic response to Tetracycline and Aleve. Wheezing and breathing difficulty ensued and EMS was activated.   On arrival to the emergency department she was found to have wheezing with stridor.  A dose of epinephrine was administered and she was monitored in the emergency department with an initial improvement in symptoms. Approximately one hour and 30 minutes after initial epinephrine administration patient reported that she was having continued difficulty swallowing and she was starting to feel a little worse.  At this point a second dose of IM epinephrine was administered.    The patient was subsequently  admitted to inpatient medicine team for further monitoring.

Wen to bed and woke up next morning it was broken out with blisters all over body, itching everywhere. I went to see my doctor and she hadn?t seen anything like this. I went to the dermatologist they took 3 biopsy?s and came back with a diagnosis of Sweets Syndrome which is an auto immune disorder, paperwork from dermatologist states that it would be favored more likely due to the vaccine. Now I have no job because I cannot work like this, it breaks out or flares up any my allergies flare up or anything that causes my white blood cells to go up.

                                                About 5 minutes after the shot, I started to feel a tightness in my throat.  It lasted a couple of minutes and then passed. Then about 45 minutes after I started to feel a heaviness/ache in my upper chest. This feeling continued for days. Around day four I began to have a feeling of great pressure in my throat, particularly when swallowing. I noticed that my heartrate was elevated, but that might have been because the feeling was very stressful.  The feeling would increase when I turned my head to the side or put my chin down.This feeling persisted for 3 days. After three days the feeling changed slightly and started feeling more like the sensation one gets when you have food stuck in your throat. As I type this, it is 8 days after the vaccine and I still feel this sensation in my throat.

                                                I had visual aura with migraine which is a normal event for me. This time, however, it was accompanied by confusion and memory loss that lasted about 15 minutes. I couldn?t say names of people known to me or read a list on my counter. In 25 years of migraines I have never had these symptoms with my migraine.  I took an over the  counter migraines medicine which resolved the symptoms.

I went to sit in the waiting area to be monitored and my tongue and lip started itching. I then started w/ a red rash to the R side of my neck. My body started to itch all over.  I was brought into a treatment room and my vital signs were being taken when I started to have an increase in coughing, shortness of breath and vomiting. I was given an epipen and brought to the emergency room when I received Benadryl 50mg IV, Solumedrol 125mg IV, and Pepcid 20mg IV. Approximately 1 hour after receiving the medication my face again began to itch and I was given an additional dose of 25mg of Benadryl. My reaction resolved and I was discharged home with a prescription for prednisone.

A 42-years-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK5730, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the right arm on 31Dec2020 at 10:15 AM, at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthma, allergy, hypothyroidism, and some fish allergy. There were no concomitant medications (no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks). Patient previously took ibuprofen and experienced allergy. The patient is not pregnant. On 31Dec2020, after ten-15 minutes (10:30 AM) of receiving the vaccine, she was light headed and dizzy with some nausea. Monitored in the emergency room (ER) with high BP 140&#39;s and heart rate (HR) 110s to 120s. After an hour of saline bolus, she was better but she got nasal congestion and swelling of the face with sore throat. On 01Jan2021, after 24 hours, she got some soreness at the injection site with generalized body aches. Also she got some shortness of breath which lead to her asthma attack and difficulty sleeping. On 02Jan2021, after 48hours, she was feeling still light headed with some sore throat, chills, body aches and severe headache which lead her to go to the ER and got herself tested for flu, covid and strep, which came back all negative but her signs and symptoms (s/sx )still after discharge was getting worst especially the headache and generalized body aches. As well as congestion and sore throat. The patient had given &#34;Ivf&#34; for the events. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I went to work because it was too late to call in sick, I managed to stay the whole day and then I was off some days due to the holidays. The nausea and vertigo lasted 11 days the headache lasted 2 days.  I decided to go to the walk in clinic (day 7 - 12/29) because the vertigo and nausea would not go away.  They run bloodwork all normal. They told me to take OTC meclizine.  It took the edge off helped a tiny bit. I woke up 01/01 symptom free.

                                                The day of vaccine: sore left arm. Took Ibuprofen to be able to sleep. Woke up in the middle of the night with pain. The day after: moderate to severe pain on the left arm that radiates to the neck and back. Took Ibuprofen in the morning. Pain was getting better as the day pass. At night, around 6 pm started to feel that something is not OK. I am not the same as before. My legs are not very strong (feeling it, not a problem that I can?t walk - it feels like). Feeling dizzy at times. Went to bed and pain on the left arm is much better. Two days after the vaccine: woke up with body aches, feeling dizzy at times, weak, nauseous. Not feeling OK. It is now around11:30 am  two day after the vaccine and I am starting to get worried. Please contact me for advise. Thanks

I started sweating and my skin was turning red. I notified staff and they kept me an additional 30 minutes. I started getting hives and my body felt hot. The fire fighters asked the nursing staff for Benadryl they advised they did not carry it and could not give it to me. I carry Benadryl in my work bag due to my list of allergies. Fire assisting at location advised me to take Benadryl. I notified my employer because Benadryl makes me sleepy. They sent me home and I continued Benadryl and missed work for three days. At this time I went to prestige emergency  about 1200 pm because the hives, heat in my body did not go away.  I was treated and placed on an iv cocktail and sent home with several medications. Diagnosed with urticaria allergic by DR. symptoms did not improve my skin was still red I felt hot, confused, dizzy and returned back to the same ER 01/09/2021 I was also involved in an unrelated motor vehicle accident earlier in the morning so got treated for that and continued my explanation and treatment of how my body is not doing well with the Covid 19 shot.

Remained out from work and continued bed rest.

Could not do normal daily things without feeling wiped out . 3 Advil did nothing- sat 1/9.  Next day felt better.- sun 1/10.  That evening low grade fever 99.6 and achy again., mostly eyes and head.  Went to bed.  Monday okay. But noticed right armpit a pit puffy.- same side as injection.  Tuesday 1/12 woke up at 6:00am and had dull joint/bone pain bilaterally.  Ranging from neck ache, to sternum/upper back, shoulders, triceps.  Injection site still sore- slightly red off to the side.  Did some stretches in bed and eventually got up.  I am very in tune with my body- something is off.  I never wake up feeling ?bad?.  Fit, healthy and active normally.  Almost like a bad nights sleep with a poor mattress but only affected my upper body.  Took two Advil and hot shower- feel better but can tell something doesn?t feel right.

                                                joint pain and muscle; joint pain and muscle; Vertigo; an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms; developing swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area/ swollen left subclavian lymph nodes; developing swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area; extreme fatigue; Runny nose; Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (RN) reporting for herself. A 42-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose on 23Dec2020 h 09:00 intramuscularly in left deltoid (left arm) lot number: EK5730 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications were not provided. Patient stated that she has had double mastectomy, and missing a lot of lymph nodes, states she got the first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 23Dec2020, states it made her left subclavian lymph nodes swollen and hard. States that when she gets the flu vaccine at her hospital every year, she gets swollen lymph nodes ever since she had a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. She originally was wondering if she could get the vaccine in another large muscle group. States she even went as far as to cross reference flu shot ingredients with the Pfizer Covid ingredients to see if something in the vaccines were causing the swollen lymph nodes but was unable to come to any conclusion, the only think in common is the Sodium Chloride and she does not feel like that would cause any issue. States the swollen lymph nodes occurred after the Sanofi brand flu vaccine (no other information known or provided). Patient is on day 15 post vaccination and they are still swollen and hard, she is wondering if there is any data on how long this side effect can last. She made an appointment with her oncologist, she knows that the swollen lymph had the first dose, lymph nodes are still swollen and hard, knows it can cause swollen lymph nodes but wants to know what is the typically length of the event. Patient also experienced other side effects, on 30Dec2020 (last week), she developed vertigo that lasted through the weekend intermittently, states she at first thought she was having a stroke. States it seems to have subsided as of 05Jan2021 (yesterday). Patient also reported she had an itchy rash twice as part of her side effects reported from the COVID 19 vaccine. She noticed an itchy rash and it went away but she is unsure exactly the day or time. Stated she definitely remembered the rash on 28Dec2020 as she took pictures. It was gone in about three hours on the same day. She did not treat the rash because it was gone and not itching. The rash came and went and had not come back. It was mostly on the bends of the arms, bilateral arms. Patient reported developing swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area the day after the injection, on 24Dec2020. They were not as tender at the time of the report but were continuing and this was 15 days from her vaccination. Patient also experienced an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms that occurred twice and only lasted a few hours each time, onset date reported as 25Dec2020. She was advised to take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) for it however she did not take it. On 23Dec2020 patient experienced headache. On 24Dec2020 patient experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes and runny nose. On 30Dec2020 patient experienced joint pain and muscle and vertigo. The events headache, experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, runny nose, joint pain and muscle and an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms were considered serious as medically significant events. Patient had not recovered from swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, joint pain and muscle, extreme fatigue and swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area, she was recovering from headache, runny nose and vertigo and recovered completely from an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Causality between the events, headache, experienced extreme fatigue, swollen left subclavian lymph nodes, runny nose, joint pain and muscle and an itchy rash bilaterally on her arms, and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine cannot be denied based on the reasonable temporal association.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

Took 50mg of Benadryl PO and went to the ED, about a 15 minute car ride. Had tingling and numbness of the tongue and back of throat by arrival but still able to breath with focus. Exertion of just walking into the ED greatly increased the SOB. Was triaged, Benadryl starting to help, was able to speak a little better, 3-4 words without too much SOB caused. Was walked to a room, SOB milder with that exertion. Seen by Dr. Given IV Sol-u-Medrol and 50mg Benadryl. Was observed on cardiac monitor/Q15VS for a few hours and discharged home around 5:30. Given Rx of Prednisone 20mg -3tabs x2 days, 2tabs x5 days all once a days and told to take 50mg of Benadryl Q4H for the next 24 hours at least and to return prn.   I did need to stay on Benadryl, as the Sol-u-Medrol wore off some of the swelling in thr throat did return but not severe, Benadryl did help, along with taking my Asthmnex I already had. I also continued my normal HS antihistamines.  I had SOB on exertion, progressively better from the 6th-10th with it mostly resolved to yesterday. Body aches have continued but also progressively better.  Yeasterday1/12/21 the Rx of prednisone was completed and I did have some mild swelling /tingling in the throat/face/mouth return in the evening, took Benadryl 50mg again and inhaler used. I have an appointment today to seek further care at my primary doctor&#39;s office.  Asthmnax used again this morning as well, only mild tightness in the throat currently with mild body aches this whole time.

Overnight, I started to experience chills followed by extreme perspiration and weakness to the point that I struggled to open a bottle of water I had by my bed.  Tuesday, 1/12/2021:                       Headache, weak and tired but attempted to work.  I had to leave shortly after arriving because my symptoms were becoming progressively worse to the point I almost passed out from standing.  Upon arriving home, I started to experience nausea and vomiting x 3. Intense chills followed by the extreme perspiration still existed.  Most of these symptoms subsided by 9:30p that evening.  Wednesday, 1/13/2021:                Intense headache, weakness and dizziness.  Of note, my left underarm/armpit (the arm where the vaccine was administered) is sensitive to touch.

At minute 45 after shot, I began to feel light tingling under my skin near the injection site, which slowly progressed to my elbow then my shoulder then my wrist, then to my neck and chin (all on left side) at which point I asked the HCP who gave the shot if I should take an antihistamine, she asked me if I was having trouble breathing and I said no, she recommended I take 500 mg of Benadryl 3x every 8 hrs. I took the dose about 75 min after my shot, by which time I felt tingling in my foot and pain in my wrist, slight feverishness. Fell asleep, woke up 4.5 hrs after the shot. The tingling sensation was gone. Only some drowsiness and pain in my arm. Applied ice pack to arm, took 250 mg Benadryl at 9.5 hrs after shot and woke up next morning with negligible symptoms, mild arm pain.

That did not subside until 4 days later. Day 5 it still hurt but was getting better. She reports she is still not sleeping well at night. She said she can barely put her sports bra on or pull up her pants without it hurting. She did try Motrin, and it helped with the throbbing pain but not with her range of motion. Ice does help a little bit.

Also on 15Jan2021, she fell down the stairs and thought she broke her arm and was in severe pain. The has been taking iron supplements as concomitant medications. The patient reported having hallucinations, body aches, fatigue and dizziness on Jan2021. On 22Jan2021 09:00PM, she started smelling smoke, like cigarette smoke, like her home was filling with cigarette smoke, and no one in her house even smokes. On 22Jan2021, she also had severe stomach cramps like she was going to have diarrhea, but she never did. She says she was bowed over with the worst cramps like menstrual cramps, and her left arm was in pain, more pain that it had been. She says she could feel blood surging in her legs, it was almost surreal, she could feel the blood going through her body, which she never had felt something like that before. She says that the pain was in her scapula, her left arm, all of her joints. She says she could not get comfortable, and she was crying she was in that much pain. She says she does not typically cry and has a pretty good pain tolerance. She says she was getting freaked about that, and the next morning she was exhausted (Jan2021), she would assume since she was up all night in pain (Jan2021). The following day she laid around and felt extremely fatigued and dizzy, then by Sunday she was feeling better. For pain treatment she took Ibuprofen though her doctor also prescribed her another pain pill for her arm, she was scared to take it, so she took Ibuprofen 600mg which was also prescribed to her. The patient said that she did not think it was an allergic reaction but her doctor thought it might have been. The action taken in response to the events for ketorolac tromethamine was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Two days after the 2nd injection I started to have chest pain and not feel right. I went to the Station where I volunteer. I did and EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I went to the ER. They gave me 4 baby aspirin to take and some blood work. I was told the blood work showed elevated levels consistent with a blood clot as well. I had a CT scan to rule out a clot in my heart or lungs. Which it was negative. I was released and told to see a cardiologist in the next few days. I saw the cardiologist two days later who said I ended up with Pericarditis and that it should resolve on its own. I was feeling better until two days ago when I developed chest pain again. I again went to my fire station I volunteer for and did an EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I am currently waiting for treatment from my cardiologist.

                                                I received the vaccine on Friday evening at 6:45 p.m. . Starting early morning on Saturday around 3:00 in the morning I begin to have extreme body aches causing me to wake up and my whole body was aching and I was shivering and it was difficult to move my right arm, which is the arm that took the injection. I was barely able to prop myself up to take Advil. I was down for the rest of the weekend in bed in pain. On Sunday the 10th of January the pain was less but it was more focused as a headache and I was extremely fatigued and slept the whole weekend.

                                                I almost blacked out around 8:30 AM the morning after my vaccination. I took my dogs outside and started feeling woozy and seeing spots. By the time I got back into my house, I had tunnel vision and could not see directly in front of me. I went to lay down, but ran into a piece of furniture because I was so disoriented and hit my shin on it. I collapsed on my bed. I stayed there for  few hours and then I was ok. I had severe, flu-like symptoms for most of the day - fever, chills, low energy, joint pain (specifically back and hip) - that waxed and waned. I finally felt almost back to normal approximately 50 hours after the injection.

                                                I had had minor intermittent teeth pain off and on for several weeks. With in a day of getting the vaccine the pain began increasing to the whole left side of my face and neck and increasing in intensity. I was unable to sleep 12/24 and 12/25 and ended up going to urgent care on 12/26. Despite not having sinus fullness/drainage they diagnosed it a sinus infection and gave me antibiotics. At the end of the 5 day course my symptoms had improved some but were not gone and I was still requiring frequent Tylenol for pain so the course of antibiotics were extended. I do not know if this was caused by the vaccine, but it coincided with the vaccine.

A 43-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# either GL0140 or EL0140, Expiry date and NDC number were not written), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  There were no medical history and concomitant medications. Patient pregnant: No. She has had No positive test for covid before the vaccine, and No Antibody test before the vaccine either. She has had No issues with vaccines in the past. The patient had the vaccine on 23Dec2020 and then on 01Jan2021 she began to experience eye twitching and it hasn&#39;t gone away and it&#39;s very bothersome. It&#39;s still happening. Her first dose was on 23Dec2020. The eye twitching began on 01Jan2021, it&#39;s just the left eye, she can see the eye lid moving when it twitches, she felt it, like the eyeball itself was twitching or spasming. There were no issues with the vision in that eye. She did feel she was getting sleep, she was conscious about seeing if she was tired, both eyes felt as if she had cried for a long time but she had not cried at all and the eye that was twitching she felt it more in. She thought it was getting better in the morning because at that time she didn&#39;t feel it, but by mid-afternoon it was consistent. The twitching happened often sporadically every couple of minutes, and she was annoyed of it. Investigation Assessment: No. The outcome of the event left eye twitching was not recovered, outcome of other events was unknown.

The rash it itchy and burns. She still has the rash today. The next day after vaccination she experienced headache and aching that subsided within 3 days. This employee has a history of Lupus and breaking out in a rash is not uncommon for her, it is actually sort of common. When asked if this is the same sort of rash she experiences after too much sun exposure or stress (due to the Lupus) she says she would describe it as the same. She did miss one day of work due to the headache, aching, and just being miserable with the rash on top of it. She did not experience hives, trouble breathing, or swelling.

                                                Around 11:30pm 1/25, I muttered &#34;I don&#39;t feel good,&#34; which reminded me of being a child getting sick. within 30 minutes of then end escalating over the next hour, I had a severe headache, bilateral, occipital, pressure in entire head and neck. The headache as also in my eyes and in my ears.  Back was also painful - not as bad as neck, but i can&#39;t explain how horribly a hope a massage could fix me.  There was no comfortable position to alleviate any of that.  I also got the chills, constantly, suddenly switching from shivering cold to so hot i needed to take blankets off - but soon as i took the blankets off I&#39;d be freezing cold again. I was also super nauseous, though i didn&#39;t vomit. I pretty much couldn&#39;t get out of bed much for 24-36 hours. During that time, i was unable to sleep as well, i think mostly due to the chills, constantly having to move about to keep warm or cool off, but not sure.      I did take acetaminophen around 10pm 1/26 (36 hours after injection)- i felt like I knew you&#39;re not supposed to, but I couldn&#39;t take it any more and it might have less anti-inflammatory impact than ibuprofen.  It dulled the pains some, but didn&#39;t make it stop. the chills and nausea mostly stopped and was able to sleep more the second night, last night.       I&#39;m now up and trying to work today (1/27). Head still has pressure headache throughout. Neck is still sore, like a pressure headache. I feel generally foggy and heavy.

A 43 years old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EL3248, Expiration Date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 at 13:22 at single dose on right arm for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included vasovagal (she did have a history of vasovagal. She talked to her doctor about this prior to the vaccine. At first when she had it her previous doctor felt a little confused. She was unsure if it was vasovagal or a blood clot in her lungs. She did get it checked out with a cat scan and there was no clot. They had to have tested her for anaphylaxis at that time. It was not a clear diagnose. Then she saw a cardiologist. She was diagnosed with vasovagal at that time. It lasted only a few months and she was fully recovered). Concomitant medications included ongoing ergocalciferol (VIT D) and ongoing vitamins NOS (MULTIVITAMIN). Patient received the vaccine on Tuesday, 12Jan2021. Her appointment was at 12:54, but she got the vaccine at 13:22. She was looking at her phone to re-schedule her second dose. She felt totally fine. At 13:27 she had this weird very hot rush down her right arm that was vaccinated and went up the back of her neck only on the right side. She looked up from her phone and was very dizzy. She stood up and as she did her heart started to race. It was a really weird feeling that she has never felt. She was a little out of it. She had no trouble breathing. Within 30 seconds she was completely fine. She did feel a little out of it, as it produced a little bit of anxiety. She had no other symptoms. She stayed at the facility for 30 minutes. As she was leaving one person asked how she felt and she was told to let the EMTs know. She let them know what happened. One woman working there said it could have been an anxiety attack. She did not have a lot of anxiety but she did have some. It did not feel like that. She had never had the warm sensations or heart racing. She was totally fine when talking to the EMTs. They did not seem concerned and they let her schedule her second shot. She read on Pfizer about allergic reactions. She was assuming this was what happened. A mild allergic reaction. She had no breathing issues or hives. Her arm was very sore- it was difficult to lift it. She had also never had this type of soreness with vaccines. Dizziness: She has had the dizziness a couple of times. Twice now. One when she had gotten home. It was very mild and nothing compared to what she had when she got the vaccine. Then another last night at bedtime. It was a woosh of dizziness.  Arm soreness: very improved now. felt like she would normally have after getting a vaccine. The first day was intense but after a few hours was less. The next day she woke up and it was pretty much gone. She still had a little but it has mostly improved. Caller stated she would still like to get the second dose but she was a little nervous. She had it maybe once or twice since then and it has been mild with no extreme pressure drops. They thought maybe it was a virus that affected her. Her reaction to the vaccine was different. The difference was pretty significant. Vasovagal felt like her heart will stop and she will pass out. After the vaccine she felt dizzy but didn&#39;t feel faint, and had a racing heart. Nobody seemed concerned about her reaction and getting the second dose. But she read that Pfizer does not recommend getting the second dose even if you had a mild reaction. She was wondering what she should do. Her second dose is scheduled for 02Feb2021. Outcome of hot sensation/weird very hot rush down her right arm that was vaccinated and went up the back of her neck only on the right side and heart racing was resolved on 12Jan2021, dizzy was resolved on 13Jan2021, outcome of anxiety was unknown, outcome of her arm was very sore- it was difficult to lift it  and a mild allergic reaction was resolving.

This happened a second time and then it was finished. I felt really tired and not myself.  Then later that night my arm began to hurt so bad that I could not lift it. I began to rub the area that was hurting and noticed that I now had a nice size lump there . I took a Tylenol 500mg and a hot shower. When I woke up the next morning my arm was still hurting but not as bad. When I went to use the bathroom I had began to start spotting again. This continued throughout the day and now I am bleeding as if I was having my period. I am super tired. It is to the point that i cant function at work.

                                                Driving home 18-20 mins post injection, my heart started racing, my hands were shaking, it became hard to breathe, my fingers were tingling and my mouth got very dry. I pulled over and called 911. The paramedics stated my BP was within normal limits of around 140/80. My normal is closer to 90/65. Once symptoms resolved I attempted to drive home. Once again, the same symptoms returned. I pulled over. I then made my way to a safe location and waited for family to come. Since the event I have had times of mild labored breathing while walking. While driving I become very anxious and the feelings of an anxiety attack return. I saw my nurse practitioner 2 days ago who referred to the driving anxiety as a form of PTSD and prescribed Prozac and Xanax. I have not take the Xanax, but have taken two nighttime doses of Prozac. Yesterday, I did not feel as though I had taken medication. My drive to work was uneventful. My drive home involved tightening of the chest, labored breathing and anxiety. This morning I cannot tell if I am feeling the vaccine or Prozac in my system, but I feel off. Swimmy headed, watery mouth, heaviness in my arms and shoulders. I need guidance on taking the 2nd vaccine or if I should seek further medical treatment. I have added a vit B vitamin a day to my regimen since the date of the vaccine.

                                                Patient was extremely anxious prior to vaccine.  She told me she did get seizures but she took medication for it and I informed her that it would still be recommended to get the vaccine.  She was visibly anxious even after vaccine.  Immediately after she began crying to her friend and said she &#34;was just SO afraid of needles&#34;.  I told her to take some deep breaths and after a minute or two she went to the observation room.  Approximately 15 minutes later she rushed back into the room looking like she might hyperventilate or have hypoglycemia (shaking, cold sweats).  She sat down and I tried to calm her down.  I asked someone to get her orange juice.  During the next couple minutes she did not seem to be getting any better and started shaking.  I requested someone call 911.  Another staff was helping so I moved to get and administer an epi-pen injection.  By this time the patient was not responsive, but was still breathing.  I instructed staff to help move her to the floor for monitoring and if needed, cpr.  She regain partial consciousness.  Her breath and pulse were always present, so there was no need to begin cpr.  After a few minutes EMT arrived and transported patient to local hospital.  During all of this, other employees at the facility were attempting to contact family members, which they were eventually able to do. About 30 minutes later the staff informed me they had spoken to family members who were at the hospital and that she was improving, but they had not seen her yet.

Viral infection in FEB that was like COVID-19 sx, I did AB test as soon as it was available, and negative.  ---The Event: Monday morning (1/4/21), after getting out of shower, I was talking to my husband (who is MD)and started having BROCA&#39;s aphasia sx (could not get words out coherently), then fell into bed and started right wrist and right foot posturing. This lasted 10 min. I have non-memory of it, but my MD husband witnessed it. After 10 minutes, I was back to normal, except shaky and some word finding difficulties. After 30 min, totally back to normal.

It helps with the fever and also for the headache. 1/9/2021 woke up at 4:00 am with vertigo plus the above side effects. In addition to the Tylenol, I had taken dramamine in the morning and had been taking Meclizine 25-50 mg for the dizziness/vertigo. I also had done epley maneuver to help get rid of the vertigo since I am more dizzy turning on my right side and thinks that it is positional vertigo. 1/13/2021 still dizzy and taking Meclizine because it helps for the dizziness. I don&#39;t have anymore fever, the pain at the injection site is now mild, still moderate pain for the headache, some body aches but not as much as before. I had gone to the urgent care at this point to be seen since the vertigo is still there since Saturday 1/9 and it is now Wednesday 1/13. The doctor at the urgent care told me to continue taking Meclizine, hydrate and rest for a total of one week since the onset of the vertigo.

A 44-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included cutaneous t-cell lymphoma from 2017 and ongoing, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing thyroid, covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date not ongoing (lasted about 1-1.5 months; she did not have any breathing problems) and blood cancer. Concomitant medication included bexarotene ongoing for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, rosuvastatin ongoing for cholesterol, levothyroxine ongoing for thyriod. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID 19: positive in Nov2020, found out tested positive around holiday. Clinical course: onset about 26 hours after administered the first dose; onset as soon as she got back to work next day: 06Jan2021. The side effects were at their worst for at least 24-48 hours. Further described as all side effects occurred only on left side of her body: whole left side of face swelled up on 06Jan2021; left eye turned red on 06Jan2021; whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb on 05Jan2021; eye went black/left eye looked bruised on 05Jan2021; pressure in head on 06Jan2021; felt like someone squeezing her eyeball out on 06Jan2021, within the first 24-48 hours, her &#39;left leg went numb&#39;. She called to talk to physician and nurse who advised her to take Benadryl; which she did take and the Benadryl stopped the side effects; but she could not take a lot of Benadryl or anything because she was at work. She stayed at work because at least there were healthcare professionals, adults in case she passed out; at home she has 7 young children and is also raising her grandchild. The side effects did not completely go away. The arm thing was normal; The next day she was at work and had the swelling on left side of face; blackness around the eyes; arriving home she had headaches on 07Jan2021 and then her leg went numb for like 20 mins; the whole left side of her body went numb including even her vagina; left side of her body was so numb and weird and tingly feeling that she started panicking because she was driving on 06Jan2021. She calmed herself down thinking it&#39;s only the left side; you can drive with your right side to get home and be fine. It was more like left side of her body was asleep, tingling, she has never had that happen before. Everything else like the headache, flu feeling was about 48 hours later (on 07Jan2021). She had COVID already back in Nov2020 for about 1-1.5 months; the next side effects she had were like the COVID symptoms she had, like the chills and everything on 06Jan2021. She had the lethargic feeling again, her head was hurting, she felt extremely weak on 06Jan2021. Patient also felt nausea on 06Jan2021, Dizzy on 08Jan2021. Another doctor said it sounded like the side effects she experienced with the vaccine sounded like allergic reaction or Bell&#39;s palsy. Patient was asking the doctor if she could get like an Epi-pen or prescription Benadryl or something because she is afraid to get the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine and not have something to respond to side effects with. The outcome of event whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb was recovered on 07Jan2021, for headaches was recovering, chills and nausea was recovered on 08Jan2021. Outcome of other events was unknown. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 44-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0140), intramuscularly on the arm on 19Dec2020 11:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tachycardia and stroke from 2019 and diabetes mellitus diagnosed in summer of 2020 and ongoing. Family medical history included father had type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medication included metformin hydrochloride, sitagliptin (JANUMET) for diabetes. The patient previously took regular flu shot and had body aches; it did not happen at the year of report but in years past she did have it. The patient took the COVID vaccine for precaution as she was a healthcare worker/paramedic and stated there was no prescriber. She received the vaccination at a health department facility, not a military facility. She had no previous immunizations and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date as COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Dec2020 and after nine days, she tested positive for COVID-19 on 30Dec2020 and had an inpatient hospital stay. She mentioned she was so happy that she did not have any symptoms for those days. She stated that she got the shot on the 19th and later that evening was when she started having symptoms. She tried to sleep and it woke her up, she felt sleepy, tired and experienced headache on 19Dec2020 20:00 to 21:00. On 28Dec2020 23:00, she had an increased cough. She initially had increased cough from wearing mask and was having post nasal drip, then she got wet cough and that was when she decided to get tested. She went back and forth on dates; stated she was confused with the dates because of being in the hospital, it had been a while and the dates were all meshing in together. Her specimen was collected and they did the test on 29Dec2020 then found out that she tested positive for COVID virus with a COVID test nasal swab on 30Dec2020 17:30. She mentioned she lost weight after she got COVID, had no sense of taste or smell on unspecified dates. She did not know if it was related to her thyroid but she started losing hair and her heart rate started increasing on Monday, so they took her off all her meds and said the COVID was doing crazy things to the body. She had to go on Carvedilol for the sinus tachycardia and had high blood pressure now. This was all new after she tested positive. She has had bouts of tachycardia before and did have a heart monitor as she had a stroke last year. So those have never been persistent or symptomatic. If she did have a high heart rate, it always went down. This one was symptomatic. She did fine the whole week after the shot, just had that little bit of sleepiness, was tired, and had a headache. The patient reported near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism on 08Jan2021 14:30 to 15:00, which required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 10Jan2021 (2 days). ER or physician&#39;s office was required. She never went to the ER for the vaccination, it was just for the near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism that she went and was then admitted to hospital. She just got out of the hospital the day before report (10Jan2021), was there for two days and was still recovering. She was supposed to receive her second vaccination on the day of report however her doctor did not know if she should get the second dose due to double antibodies. She did not ask if she still had the virus or it went away. She has not been to work in two weeks. Outcome of the events tested positive for COVID virus was not recovered; near syncope with sinus tachycardia due to COVID-19 and hypothyroidism was recovered with sequel; sleepy, tired and headache was recovering; while the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

I had pain in the wrist arm, joints and fingers. I determined it was due to the swelling.  I had some lymph node enlargement, and was really fatigue and slept most of the day. (36 hours).  I did not have a fever.  I&#39;m a doctor and did some evaluations  on myself. I didn&#39;t have trouble breathing of swallowing.  If I wasn&#39;t medically trained I would have gone into the doctor.  I did see an ENT for hearing test to make sure there was no damage and there was not.

                                                Around 6pm I started with a slight headache and by 8pm i had trouble keeping my eyes open.  (headache is not uncommon for me but the extreme drowsiness is).   I slept solid through the night (unusual) and the puppy woke me around 5am. (ususal)  I felt that i had a heavy? head.  My thoughts seemed clear but my head had a fullness to it.  Its difficult to describe.  I was not stuffy.  I had trouble staying awake, to the point I was nodding off at times I should have been able to stay awake.  I did not feel safe to work and felt obligated to call in.  I slept solidly for the next 5 hours.  Later in the day, my affected arm began to have pain radiate from the injection site to my wrist.  (probably not unusual).  600mg of Ibuprofen did not seem to help much.  By the time I went to bed last night (24&#43; hrs after receiving the vaccine) I noticed my axillary nymph nodes were extremely tender to the touch and remain so this morning.  The pain in my arm still continues to radiate to my wrist but not as intense.

She also had chills with no fever from 03Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. She took Tylenol for the first 2 days, but it did not help her at all. She is feeling a little better today, but not much. Her question is, how long will these side effects last? Tylenol: She says it did help a little bit. She think she would just sleep because she was uncomfortable. The Tylenol just did not make her symptoms go away completely. LOT/Batch: AA46487, EXP: Apr2022 UPC: The consumer says the number under the barcode is: 5187536. Feeling super tired and body aches: Has improved about 20%. She says these are all medically significant as she is not able to do what she was able to do before getting the vaccine. She is super tired with no energy and she is confined to her bed most of the time. The consumer confirms this is her first dose of the COVID Vaccine. She thinks she got the standard dose. Vaccine card does not have the expiration date or NDC written on it. Unknown causality. She said that she could be positive for COVID. She is unsure. The outcome of the event Chills with no fever was recovered. The outcome of the event Cramping in legs was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of  reported events cannot be totally excluded.

                                                The day after the injection I had a itchy red knot appear at the injection site. Starting 27 hours after injection I had chills, anxiety, slight shortness of breath, headaches, body aches. Today I have had nausea that comes and goes, the red knot is still present on my right arm and the redness has increased a small amount from the marking placed last night. The injection is not in my deltoid muscle or even close and I am wondering if that is at the least what created the redness and the knot.

Jan. 01, 2021- Woke up/laying down when the dizziness/room spinning began lasting about 10 seconds. Dizzy/spinning episodes continued from 01/01/2021-01/05/2021 (decreasing in episodes on 01/04/2021- 01/05/2021). The dizzy/spinning episodes would happen randomly when I first woke up, through out the day/night, about 6-7 times a day, and lasting  about 10 seconds. A few times I felt like I would faint. Treated with rest, sleep, drinking water, and took off work for 1 week due to the danger of driving or going outside the home.  3. I would randomly wake up with hot sweats and nausea from 01/01/2021-04/01/2021, treated by drinking water, and resting.  4. I experienced the general feeling of being unwell, fatigue, and foggy mind that lasted about a week after the 1st COVID-19 vaccination. Treated with rest and was off work for 1 week.

                                                Fever @103 average, chills, headache, fatigue for  Tuesday 1/12. Upon waking 1/13 low grade fever, went away before returning in the afternoon 99.8, felt tired, took a nap. Woke up from nap @1600 feeling like nothing ever happened. Today, woke up feeling great.   Am actually pleased that I had this reaction. Was told by employer to complete this form. My immune system is working.  Actually feel bad for doing this report, because I don&#39;t want the anti vaccine community to take this report the wrong way.

                                                I took the first dose of the Covid vaccine Saturday, Sunday I woke up with pain in my injection arm, the worse headache ever, feeling nauseous and my body was so sore. Throughout the day I felt weak, sleepy and got light headed and went to bed. I had no appetite but I was very thirsty. I didn?t eat Sunday. Today (Monday) I woke up with those same issues and more. I have a sore throat it feels tight, I?m dizzy and just feel sick all around and still have no appetite but I?m thirsty and my finger tingle.

                                                I&#39;d heard about these side effects, was more than I expected, couldn&#39;t go to work that day since I was in bed with side effects. Felt like more than any vaccine I&#39;d received in my life, so decided to report just since this is a new vaccine.   About 10 hours after vaccine, chills and fever started, fever up to 101, body weakness, lack of appetite, headache/migraine. Insomnia that night, up all night due to symptoms. . All symptoms except migraine resolved over the next 24 hours. Migraine continued so I took 50 mg imitrex x 3 over the course of the next 36  hours until that finally resolved . So all symptoms gone after around 2.5=3 days.

A 45-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), intramuscular in left arm on 31Dec2020 at 08:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a workplace clinic.  Medical history included mild asthma and known allergies to bee stings.  There were no concomitant medications.  Within a few minutes of the vaccine on 31Dec2020, the patient felt a &#34;closing in&#34; sensation and then her pulse and blood pressure went up. She developed a severe headache and hot flushing with chest tightness. The medical team gave her epinephrine in right thigh and she felt a bit better. Then she started getting pale, sweating, and peripheral perfusion worsened so she was given a second dose of epi. She started feeling better, but had a headache, palpitations and &#34;brain fog&#34; for about 5 days after and she still having intermittent dizziness (unspecified date). The patient received epinephrine IM and benadryl IV push for the events. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient has no COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks and other medications in two weeks. The patient recovered from the events with lasting effects. The patient had not yet recovered from the event dizziness, while the patient recovered with sequelae for the remaining events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to plausible temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 45-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on the right deltoid, on 04Jan2021 at a single dose as she wanted added protection (Covid-19 immunization). The patient medical history was not reported. The patient has no heart issues but has a family history of heart disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient was asking if it is okay to take second dose after experiencing side effects of fever, body ache, joint pain, probably anxiety, chest heaviness 8-10h after (not wheezing, 98% O2 saturation) which returned next day and subsided. On 04Jan2021, the patient got her first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine, she was one of the lucky people who had joint pain, body aches, and a fever for about 3 days. She noticed about 8-10 hours after she got the vaccine that she started feeling heaviness in her chest, chest felt tight and heavy; not shortness of breath, harder to take a deep breath. She had no wheezing. In Jan2021, her oxygen level was 98%. She was chocking it up to anxiety in Jan2021. It went away. She had it the same day and the next day intermittently. It was short and passing. She is still having joint pain and muscle aches in her knees and lower legs. It is intermittent and mainly at night. She is supposed to get the second dose next Friday and asking should she go ahead and get the second dose. The joint pain had went away intermittently on Tuesday, then hit her harder on Wednesday. Thursday she felt okay but the Friday again was having the pain. It is still occurring. It is mainly at night. In the day she feels okay. It is when she lays down to relax that it kicks in. It is mainly irritating but she would say it is medically significant as it has lasted for a while, almost 2 weeks now and she is still having issues.  She takes 1000mg of acetaminophen (TYLENOL) to knock it out. The heaviness in her chest lasted about 1.5 hours the first day, and then went into Tuesday intermittently. The patient recovered from anxiety in Jan2021, body aches and fever on 07Jan2021, heaviness in her chest recovered on 05Jan2021, while other events were not recovered.

                                                COVID-19 pneumonia; COVID-19 pneumonia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient) from a Pfizer-sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs). A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EK570), via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was none and there were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated that she felt yucky afterwards on 23Dec2020, experienced shortness of breath on exertion and coughing on 26Dec2020; chills, dizziness, headache, muscle pain, body aches, fever on 28Dec2020; loss of taste, loss of smell and COVID-19 pneumonia on 07Jan2021.  All the events were reported as being medically significant.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: positive on 29Dec2020.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of COVID-19 pneumonia and included: started on bronchodilator, cough elixir, steroids and azithromycin (ZITHROMAX).  The outcome of muscle pain, body aches and COVID-19 pneumonia was recovering and of loss of taste and loss of smell was not recovered.  The causality of the suspect vaccine to the events was reported as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

                                                In discussion with Dr., medical director at Detox, she  arrived night of 2/3/21 was quite intoxicated so was not going through any  withdrawal.  She was getting vitals and CIW  checked regularly.  First dose of  chlordiazepoxide 25mg was 2/4 at 1:25pm for CIWA 9.  She had repeat vitals at  5:50pm, CIWA 1, vitals: P 67, 118/79, 94% on RA, T 98.3.  she had complained of  some &#34;pressure in her head&#34; and feeling anxious, but otherwise denied other  complaints.  she was talking with others in the group, then other patients report  she suddenly started having seizure like activity around 6:45pm, med techs came  to help and found her stiff, gurgling.  they tried to get vitals on her, called  911, noticed that at 6:54pm she had lost a pulse and they started CPR.  paramedics arrived at 7:08pm and she was brought to ED.   Pt BIBA in cardiac arrest. Pt was at Detox Center when she  was reported to have seizure-like activity followed by collapse. She  was found to be pulseless and CPR initiated by staff members. EMS  arrived and performed approx 15 min of CPR and gave pt epi x 3 and  bicarb. No shocks administered but they did not report a rhythm.   In the emergency room the patient arrived and was found to be pulseless with PEA arrest, CPR was initiated, patient was intubated. ROSC ultimately achieved, patient remained very acidotic despite ventilator adjustment, head CT revealed cerebral edema. Pt also found to be profoundly anemic with a hemoglobin of 5 and platelets of 37, she was thought to be GI bleeding so medications for this were initiated. Patient then became more hypoxemic with bradycardia, consultation with neurosurgery and critical care medicine at tertiary care center deemed ongoing CPR futile. Patient arrested at 2:30AM on 2/5, pronounced dead at 2:48AM.

She smells metal on Dec2020. She has no sense of smell other than stinky metallic smell. Her taste is fine. Outcome of the headache was not recovered, of the metallic smell was unknown, of the remaining events was recovered on 30Dec2020 13:00.

                                                15 minutes and 21 seconds after shot was given, I felt suddenly very hot, lightheaded and I could feel my pulse escalating. Nurse in the post-shot monitoring tent took vitals to confirm pulse at 95, when typically 68. I was laid down and BP dropped to 110/78. Chest tightness that I am familiar with from asthma started to develop and my neck and throat and upper shoulders felt very tight and constricted. I had some trouble swallowing water as though my throat was constricted and my breathing felt shallow. Nurses provided care and I was asked to get up and sit in a chair again. Within a minute, I felt dizzy and disoriented again and heart rate went up. The tightness in my chest and throat and shallow breathing continued along with my voice becoming hoarse.  The doctor on call asked if I?d had these symptoms before and I said I had after eating shrimp years ago. He decided to transfer me to the ER for monitoring . I stayed at the ER for about an hour and a half and was monitored. The constricted throat and asthma  chest tightness did not subside but did not get worse. Doctor recommended Benadryl every 6 hours as symptoms persisted. Within a half hour of taking 25 mg of Benadryl, I started to feel improved breathing and less throat constriction and easier swallowing. After the second dose of Benadryl, symptoms were much 70% gone, except for hoarse voice abs very slight tightness with swallowing.  I had informed the injection staff prior to receiving my vaccine that I am a person with a history of anaphylaxis (not to a vaccine) that required and epi pen and overnight hospital stay in the past .

                                                About 5 min after receiving vaccine - had just sat down after vaccine and had a weird sensation: like felt like rushed through my body and then instantly my heart started racing and I felt it thump into my throat. Let nurse in attendance know and she took me to another area secluded from others and told me to relax. Sat down. Hooked me up to monitors; blood pressure cuff  and  finger pulse and she left to go get someone and she brought EMT back with her. Felt tight in chest; in neck felt like there&#39;s tightening; but could still breathe; felt heavy: chest. Neck felt tight. Felt like I needed an inhaler. I don&#39;t have it with me as I only have asthma in spring and fall. They kept telling me to calm down and I wasn&#39;t feeling nervous. I was trying to relax. EMT asked questions and he said that the same thing happened to him. He told me I couldn&#39;t leave  Event Center until things calmed down for me. Released her when I felt fine but was just really tired and kind of shaky. I felt so exhausted. Told EMT that and he told me he would feel that way if he had just ran a marathon. I had slept 12 hours the night before. He didn&#39;t tell me what my heartrate went up to.  I left event center  at 9:49 pm. Started feeling strange again when doing errands and was at store afterwards (about 30 or 40 min later) - nauseous; dizzy; sweaty, clammy. Heart was racing again. I told husband I didn&#39;t feel right. Felt like I needed to sit because I was shaky. Left and went to vehicle. As we sat in car, I told him something wasn&#39;t feeling right. Mouth was so dry. He started driving. I felt like we were driving down a tunnel.Husband looked at me and said you don&#39;t look right either. Took me to ER in nearest hospital: blood pressure high; heart rate elevated; ER           (Hospital) The doctor did lab work. Triponin levels elevated; potassium levels low - sign of a heart episode and needed to get in control. Gave me potassium and took  more blood work and troponin levels started coming down. Dr advised me not to go back to get second dose. Personal Care Dr confirmed that I shouldn&#39;t get the 2nd dose - put in my records that I am allergic to this vaccine.  The next day I had severe diarrhea and terrible pain in my arm that went all the way down and up into my neck and whole right side head hurt. (really bad headache). Extreme fatigue. Went back to work on the following Monday evening and was exhausted doing my job. When I say family Dr on Tuesday, I didn&#39;t want to be taken off work because I was in the right place where people could take care of me and I&#39;d taken time off at holidays. That entire week was a lot of exhaustion and tiredness.

                                                After waiting in the waiting area for about 20 minutes following the vaccination, I left to return to my car and go home.  While walking through the hospital, I started to feel weird - almost light headed and fuzzy.  By the time I got to the hospital entrance, my tongue had started to tingle and swell (I don&#39;t know that it ACTUALLY swelled, but that&#39;s how it felt) and I was concerned about losing the ability to breath.  I started going back to the vaccination site, but the feeling started to subside.  After about another 15 minutes, the feeling was gone.  I did NOT report this to the vaccination site and instead just proceeded home.

                                                The day after I received a vaccine, I had higher than usual blood pressure and pulse rate. I also had a muscle pain in the arm and I felt tired during the day and in the evening. My pulse rate continues to be high. My pulse rate was 100 on the second day and for number of days it is around 95. Today it was 95 most of the day. I have not been regularly checking my pulse rate before, but based on what I found in some information in my medical record, it is most likely around 75. I notice the higher pulse rate through pulsation in the chest and temples. I have a hard time concentrating on work and reading things on the screen.

                                                Hello,   When I received my second Covid vaccine, I was asked to report my side effects to this email address.  They are as follows:   After Vaccine 1 (12/22/20):  I had the vaccine at around 1:30pm.  I only had arm-stiffness at first.  Approx. 24 hours after however (1:30pm the next day), I started having chills and feeling like I had a fever.  My entire body ached but I did not have a headache.  These side effects lasted through the night for approx. 14 hours.   The following day I woke up with a surge of energy and felt very much like I had been given a shot of adrenalin.  I?m not sure that I have ever felt as good.   After Vaccine 2 (01/11/21):  I had much more severe side effects after the second vaccine.  I had this vaccine at approx. 1:30 pm and within a couple of hours I started to feel a bit tired.  At approx. midnight that night, I started having body aches and a headache that woke me up.  I had chills and was oscillating between feeling very cold and feeling very hot.  Through the night I had to change my clothing several times due to sweating.  These symptoms lasted for the entire following day.  The second day after the vaccine I felt much better but still a little tired.    Of greatest concern is that I have a lingering pain deep within my left arm (the arm into which the shots were given).  Having a hard time extending my arm and doesn;t seems to be going away.  Sometimes it feels tingly and I sometimes have loss of grip and/or weakness in the entire arm.     Hope this helps you in compiling the side effects.  Thank you.

A 46-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EH9899) injection intramuscularly in right arm on 21Dec2020 around 11:00 am at a single dose of COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type was at medical center. Relevant medical history included acne, migraine, and chronic neck and upper back pain; all were ongoing, and breast implant, tennis elbow in left arm and she had the flu shot in Oct but she never got any reaction. She thought a side effect of spironolactone. Concomitant medications included rizatriptan benzoate (MAXALT, strength: 5mg, tablet) at 5mg tablet as needed for migraine, naproxen sodium (ALEVE, strength: 500mg, tablet) at 500 mg tablet, one tablet as needed for pain, and spironolactone (strength: 5mg tablet) (if her skin was breaking out she will take two tablets that night and if her face was not bad she will take one tablet) from Aug2020 for acne, breaking out; all were ongoing. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was reported as none. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect was reported as none. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and AE(s) following prior vaccinations were reported as none. On 26Dec2020 she started feeling breast discomfort. She described the breast discomfort as a contracting feeling of encapsulation, reported it kept her up at night, she would have a heard time falling asleep or get no sleep at all that night. Her breast comfort started to lessen. The patient was breast discomfort or tenderness but she did not experience any breast discomfort till after she got the covid vaccine. She stated the breast discomfort was like a feeling that something was crawling inside, states it is like creepy crawlers. She also experienced a wet and cold sensation on her chest on 29Dec2020 and was still occurring once in a while, intermittently. At first it was just on the left breast, and the next night she felt the sensation across her chest, it felt like she spilled water and felt wet but it was not wt. She felt it while she was bed. She had breast implants. Last week she contacted her primary care doctor and she was sent to get a mammogram and ultrasound. She went to have the mammogram and ultrasound on Friday 08Jan2021 and everything was fine. She was thinking what she was experiencing was from the vaccine. The patient declined any treatment. No emergency room and no physician office required for the events. The outcome of event breast discomfort was resolving, of wet and cold sensation on chest was unknown.

It did not require any doctor visits. She did not have a rash or anaphylaxis. The patient was a physician and well versed in terms of symptoms. By evening of 05Jan2021, she developed tinnitus, which she had never had and has been there ever since. She was on day 13 post vaccine and still having bilaterally, every day and it never went away. She had a physician visit on 12Jan2021 and hearing test performed that day. They did find sensory neuro bilateral hearing loss worse on one side, her test confirmed bilateral hearing loss at 11:00 on 12Jan2021. It was mild so far in the high frequency ranges. So, they gave option to start 14 day course of high dose steroids with steroid injections into the ear, because in some cases of acute hearing loss, it can curb or reduce it. She decided to do that. Now she was going to be on steroids. She would be temporarily immunosuppressed. She did not know if that will affect the vaccine. She had not decided if she will get second shot. It is due next week, but she was a little nervous. She was considering delaying the booster a couple months out to see if more information develops. She provided her weight as between 175 to 180lb. Right now, the hearing loss was mild and it won&#39;t be that bad, but normally, it was permanent, which would be disabling hearing loss. She was going 20Jan2021, for the steroid injection in the ear canal. That would be the first injection. She was taking oral steroids now. They would see if this limits the progression. The events outcome was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The possible causality between the reported tinnitus/sensory neuro bilateral hearing loss and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, cannot be fully denied based on the reasonable temporal association.

                                                Within a few minutes of vaccine, I got a severe piercing headache and nausea / vomiting which we attributed to nerves and I went to go home without reporting. During the drive the headache and nausea got worse and my extremities and face began to tingle. My chest felt tight. My body was shaking. My colleague noted weak pulses and pale complexion. I am a doctor and gave myself epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and within 60 to 90 seconds the symptoms improved dramatically. I had my husband pick me up at the office and went home. The headache and nausea worsened on the drive but then settled down significantly. I rested for a few hours, then took oral pred 20 mg at about 2:45. I noticed that my headache was back and very intense at about 3:15 pm. No nausea this time, but my left eye began itching and it was very tight / hard to breathe. My extremities began tingling and I had spasms / tremors of my muscles. I injected another 0.3 mg epi into my thigh and followed with dex sodium phosphate 4 mg IM. Symptoms resolved within about 2 to 3 minutes. I took 40mg more of oral pred. I also took 10 mg of pepcid PO.   I am still feeling well now with no headaches or other symptoms at this writing (7:30 pm), but I have another doctor with me and we are 2 minutes from the ER if needed. I am marking unknown below since it has only been a few hours without symptoms.

A 46-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9262, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 29Jan2021 11:15, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, at an urgent care center. There was no medical history. The patient has no known allergies. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medication included probiotics. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date: unknown) received at age 46 years, via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 08Jan2021 11:15, for COVID-19 immunization. On 30Jan2021 at 07:00, the patient experienced body aches and slight throbbing in head which became worse by midday; was very tired; returned to bed within 30 minutes and slept all day, and all night; had eye pain which was triggered by light and eye movements; body chills and hot sweats of and off.

                                                Summary: Abdominal pain (similar to that experienced years previously, but not experienced approx. 2 years previous to Pfizer COVID-21 vaccination) recurred after first vaccination, worsened after second vaccination, leading to 2 ER admission and hospital admission. Ultimate cause still not determined or successfully treated; pain continues treated by opoids, gabapentin, anti-nausea medication.  Patient has not been able to work since March 4th, 2021 (currently March 23rd, 2021).  Details: The day after the first vaccination, abdominal pain similar to that the patient had previously experienced, but which had not presented severely for around a two years, recurred quite severely for 4-5 days.  Missed 2 days of work. Pain reduced enough to resume work after 4-5 days.  The day after the second vaccine dosage (2 Feb 2021), the abdominal pain worsened again, becoming more severe and more prolonged than after the first dosage. Missed four days of work (not consecutive).  Pain worsened. 12 March 2021 visited PCP, who recommended immediate ER/hospital admittance.  ER could not any definite cause of pain (though 8cm fibroid present, thought to be causing lower abdominal pain but not upper abdominal) and released patient.  Abdominal pain became somewhat better but still continued.  March 6th, abdominal pain greatly increased, leading to ER visit and hospital admittance March 6th-March 9th, 2021.  CT scan 6 March 2021.  Relevant results:  Bowel: Multiple dilated loops of distal small bowel with fecalization of small bowel contents and a slow transition to normal caliber at the terminal ileum. The appendix is not visualized. The stomach is unremarkable. The colon is not dilated.   Mesentery/Peritoneum: Small indeterminate density fluid adjacent to dilated loops of bowel in the right lower quadrant.   Nodes: Scattered small abdominal nodes, none meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.   Pelvis: Large uterine leiomyoma.  Uterine fibroid identified as probably source of pelvic and lower abdominal pain.  Mid and upper abdominal pain thought not to be related, however, and may be related to dilated loops of distal small bowel and adjacent fluid.  Pain treated with opoids, gabapentin, anti-nausea drugs, patient released 9 March 2021.  Abdominal pain continues, partially controlled with pain medications.  Lower pelvic pain has not recurred (birth control pills started at end of hospital visit).  Patient has been been able to work since March 4th (currently March 23rd, 2021).  Patient is applying for short-term disability due to extended absence from work caused by these issues.

I was very groggy and then I was discharged from  ED about 9:30 pm.

                                                About 36 hours after vaccination, I experienced incredible &#34;brain&#34; fatigue/fog. My physical body did not seem affected by the fatigue but my brain/head felt very &#34;fuzzy&#34;. I had a hard time getting words out. Similar feeling to etoh intoxication. I was a bit off balance and dizzy. I remember shaking my head to try to clear it. I also had a very&#34;plastic&#34; taste in my mouth and felt nauseous. At the 48 hour mark (almost exactly) I felt better. At 60 hour mark brain/head symptoms completely resolved. Only experienced a very slight nauseated feeling.

                                                Debilitating lower back pain beginning mid-morning on the day following the vaccine administration. It came on quite suddenly.  I left work early due to the pain. It feels like a deep twisting pain that seems to decrease strength in the back area.

I went back to taking Claritin and it worked I did get relief when the Claritin wore off I had more intense itching. I tool Claritin around the clock the 24 hours and it stopped after two days. It was a delayed reaction, caught me by surprise. I had no new foods, medications.  I did call the after hours Dr to maybe get a steroid injection but he didn&#39;t feel it was the best choice and told me to continue the Claritin

After the third day, symptoms subsided and I was back to normal activity. On the 7th day following the vaccine, I began having pain in the armpit of the left side. It was painful to have pressure on the area and to raise the arm overhead. It progressed on the the 8th day with increased pain and tenderness to touch. On the 9th day, I had severe pain with palpation and could feel a lump in the armpit. I have no redness, heat, or rash in the area. I went to my physician with concern because I have had a double mastectomy two years ago.

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL0140), intramuscular in left arm on 20Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination was administered in a hospital. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Medical history included hypertension, overweight, and known allergies to bee stings and hair dye. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included multivitamins. On 20Dec2020, within 15 minutes, the patient began feeling dry throat, then itching, then it felt like she had a lump inside her throat. Then she began to have difficulty swallowing her saliva. And then the lump inside her throat started to feel larger and larger. By this time, the doctor had already injected the patient with Epipen and the pharmacist injected her with Solumedrol and she still felt as if she was having difficulty breathing and then she was taken to ER and she really can&#39;t remember too much after that. The patient was very groggy and then was discharged from ED about 9:30 pm. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date. Treatment for the events included epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of feeling dry throat, itching, felt like having lump inside her throat, having difficulty swallowing saliva, difficulty breathing and very groggy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At the time of the first injection on Dec 28th I noticed I began itching a few days later.  I did not put the itching together with the injection due to the dry weather.  As time went on I noticed the itching mainly on head and upper torso.  I had pain by the injection site but lasted only 2 days and was not that bad.  The itching improved over the past week but noticed after my second injection that the itching has started back full force.  I wake up scratching during the night.  The pain in the arm was worse this time and did interrupt my sleep.  Today at work I noticed my arm being sore and increased itching and decided to check the site.  I found the site to be sightly swollen, red and warm to the touch.  Was advised by provider that I work with to take Benadryl which I cannot do at this time until I am off shift as it makes me drowsy.

A 47-years-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in Left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Sinus infection, Kidney stones, pink eye when she was a kid. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She reports the following side effects: itchy, red and swollen eyes, itchy throat, runny nose, clear mucous (post nasal drip). The patient experienced Right eye itching, red and swollen eyes/right eye swollen, Right eye pink on 08Jan2021 with outcome recovering, right eye shut on 09Jan2021 with outcome of received on 09Jan2021, itching throat, mucus from throat, clear mucus, Right eye weeping on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered/resolved with sequel on 11Jan2021, Left eye itching on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 09Jan2021, runny nose, clear mucous (post nasal drip) on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Jan2021, right eye red/ right Eye being Red on 09Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 09Jan2021. The patient got her First shot on Thursday morning at 7:30AM, then on Friday night 08Jan2021 at 7 in the evening her right eye was itching and weeping, it felt like something was in the eye but there wasn&#39;t. The right eye was swelling as well on Friday. On Friday the itching of the throat started.  She is also having scratchiness in the throat. Her eye is scratchy also. When she woke up Saturday 09Jan2021 she couldn&#39;t open the right eye, it was glued shut completely and red. When she was a kid, in the past she has had pink eye, and there was green stuff coming out the eye but this was not like previously. She had to pull the eye lids apart, maybe this is viral.  With her throat, she has had sinus infection in the past before in which she couldn&#39;t breath out of the nose, but with this she is experiencing Mucus that is clear and thin from the throat. Her left eye itching started Friday night, but it was only slight itchiness and by Saturday the left eye was normal. She is purely doing this report to help, in case other people have this happen. Early today, she did use a Neti pot and it did help a little, she has had horrible sinus infections in the past but this is not it. In the past, once you get a sinus infection you are prone to getting them, thankfully she has not had one in a few years, she would get thick crap in the sinuses, in this case her eye was draining going into her nose, therefore making her have a runny nose, and she also had scratching in the throat. She is breathing clearly through the nose. Itching in the right eye was ongoing but less intense. Right Eye Swollen: She was looking at mirror hates looking at herself but the eyelid was back to normal, however the white part of eye is still swollen. Right eye being Shut: It is open now, that was a one day occurrence. Itching in the throat: She noticed that today at noon around 1 is when she last had it, it is 5% still there where she feels something. Mucus from Throat: She used the Neti pot a couple hours ago, at about 1:30 PM. Since then she has had some drainage but it is 95% better. Her Right Eye ball is still pink looking like as if she was hung over. The Left eyeball is white. Right Eye Weeping: She left work because her right eye was weeping so much, going into her nose, and she is running at work, she has glasses, goggles, face shield, and so she cant wipe the liquid. She came home and iced her eye which helped. Right Eye Pink: On Saturday the right eye was red. Right now it is pink, like an eye lash is in the eye. The right Eye being Red was only for Saturday, like sclerosis, it was red and swollen. The left eye was swollen, but it is better now from this morning. She was super congested on Friday (08Jan2021), barely being able to sleep, she couldn&#39;t breathe through the nose. Weird, she barely slept but it wasn&#39;t a sinus infection. She couldn&#39;t sleep because of nose running and the eye running then Saturday into Sunday she was able to sleep with eye running. The runny nose got better with the neti pot. She is schedule for the 2nd dose on 28Jan2021. The outcome of other events was unknown. Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

A 47-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot Number EL3249, via an unspecified route of administration from 25Jan2021 14:00 (at the age of 47 years old), Dose 2, as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included she had her tonsils out on an unknown date. She was a nurse that works with COVID patients; she got tested twice last week (Jan2021), both were negative. She had no pre-existing medical conditions. She has never had a problem with vaccines. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously received dose 1 of BNT162B2 on 04Jan2021 (Lot # EX9231) and experienced no reaction then. The patient had the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine around 2 PM yesterday (25Jan2021) and she kept moving around in bed and feeling sick last night. That night she was just tired and achy but she thought that could just be from working. She went to bed early and she woke up around 1:50 or 2 AM with chills so she went and got a thermometer. She woke up at about 2 AM (26Jan2021) with a 103 fever and chills and her right carotid on her neck felt swollen and her face felt swollen, but her right carotid hurt. Her skin just burns; she went to take a shower. With the skin burning she knew it was sore to touch but when she got in the shower, that was when she noticed it hurt. She was really achy; her legs were aching and she was having shooting pains in different spots. She commented that she called out today (26Jan2021), she never calls out; all she wanted to do was take a shower and she wondered if she needed to go to the doctor. Her skin burns even when she was showering; every part her skin burns. She was also having muscle and joint pain and cough and the back of her ribs hurt (Jan2021). The other thing was nausea (Jan2021).  The fever and chills were persisting and were about the same. She was hoping for it to go down so she could go to work to tomorrow (27Jan2021). The clinical outcome of the fever, chills, and her right carotid on her neck felt swollen and hurt was not recovered.   The clinical outcome of feeling sick, tired and achy, face feels swollen, skin burning, muscle and joint pain, cough, back of her ribs hurt, nausea, and shooting pains in different spots was unknown. The reporter states she thinks what she is reporting was directly related to the product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of the reported events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Porphyria symptoms responded to porphyria-specific treatment (IV infusion with hemin (Panhematin) on both 2/10/21 and 2/11/21; analgesics). Porphyria symptoms lasted until 2/12/21. -On 2/10/21 also typical COVID-19-vaccine side effects: muscle and joint pain, fever (101.2F), chills. These resolved within one day.  Previous mild COVID-19 (8 months prior to vaccination). Infection is a known trigger of porphyria attacks. Vaccination does not usually trigger porphyria symptoms.

                                                After monitoring for 15 min post-vaccination, I drove away. On the 17th minute, my face got hot, then I headache started. A minute later fatigue hit and I was starting to fall asleep at the wheel. I live 1 mile away so I made it home. Now my head was getting fuzzy.  Called a co-worker to tell her what was happening and she said my speech was slurring. I felt drunk and hungover at the same time.  I went to bed and slept for an hour. I woke up and felt very fatigued. I  finally went to bed for the night then was awoken with severe arm pain. My entire upper arm felt so tight but I it was soft upon palpation. I fell asleep and awoke to terrible arm pain again. I started crying in bed but fell asleep again. I woke up in the morning with severe upper arm pain and minor headache. I couldn&#39;t rotate my arm back to put my bra on so I took some ibuprofen. That had immediate relief for my arm and headache. I ran one errand and was wiped out. The fatigue hit again.  The arm pain came back so I took another ibuprofen with relief. I had no energy so laid around for the rest of the day. I woke up on Sunday and finally felt normal with  just pain at the injection site.  The 2 other medical people that have had similar reactions like mine with dizziness and feeling light-headed have one thing in common with me...we are all vegetarians. I don&#39;t know if that makes a difference with protein metabolism or other enzymatic activity, but we are the only 3 that I know of out of all of our co-workers who have received the vaccine to react like this.

A 48-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) Lot #EH9899, via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 at single dose by injection in the right deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included borderline hypertension from 2018 and ongoing.  Concomitant medication included olmesartan medoxomil (BENICAR) from 2018 and ongoing for borderline hypertension. The nurse reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine last 16Dec2020 but tested positive via Nasal Swab test on 24Dec2020. She said this kinda weird. She received the COVID vaccine on 16Dec2020. She tested positive for COVID on 24Dec2020. Obviously she was exposed to COVID prior to the vaccine. She was scheduled to have the 2nd dose on 05Jan2021 but her hospital deferred it to 23Mar2021. She was asking if this was what&#39;s recommended.She said this was another weird thing, regarding the weight last week she was 167 and this week she was 180 (in Dec2020). She was very bloated in Dec2020, it was bizarre. He husband did not receive the vaccine and had symptoms on 24Dec2020. She had normal seasonal allergy symptoms. She did not think much of it. She took her Xyzal and her normal things.She took her husband to get tested and he tested positive, so she got tested, and was positive. She worked at (address withheld), and all of her patients were immunocompromised. She was shocked. She did not think this had anything to do with the vaccine. If anything, it has helped her fight the virus.By Christmas day 25Dec2020 her fever was 102, she had body aches, she went into overdrive. She had headaches and lots of gas in Dec2020.She went into overdrive from partial recognition from the vaccine.She was very very weak, almost lethargic. Her O2 saturation have stayed good around 98% in Dec2020. She has done really well. Yesterday or the day before she felt really bad again. She did a virtual visit with (name withheld), and the doctor started her on steroids and gave her an inhaler just in case she needed it. She felt better on 30De2020. On 29De2020 she was so bad and bloated, she only had one dose of the steroids, but had unusual weight gain. Then 2 pounds were gone this morning on 30De2020.She had no pitting edema or edema period. She was very fatigued, but had more energy this morning, probably because of the steroids. She had the vaccine, even though day 7 post-injection, instead of day 10, which was about 50%, her body reacted more so than her husbands because her body recognized it. The outcome of the events was unknown. She was unsure of the outcome. It was up and down. She has felt worse and she has felt better. The reporter considered the event Tested positive for COVID was Not serious and unrelated to the BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: While reporter causality is noted, a possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

                                                On January 4th we were made aware of the following: A few minutes after receiving the vaccine at 8 am on 12-23-2020, the associate suffered from a severe headache 8/10, tingling sensation, BP checked Systolic in 180s, Extremely weak and tired, Severe nausea and dry heaving. Rapid response called, and associate was sent to ER.   Headache 7/10.  1 gram Tylenol. Associate states ?Shaking, and I experienced delayed response when questioned by staff. 1 liter saline. Hives treated with Benedryl. In ER from 8am to 11:30am. It was determined that this was not an anaphylactic response. Associate went home with a headache 4/10. Groggy all day from Benedryl. I still have headaches constantly in frontal lobe. The headache pain Can rise from 2 / 10  to 8 /10. The constant headache is in the left frontal lobe. When the headache increases, It radiates into the temporal area as well.  Dec 31, I went to Patient First. I was given Toradol IM, but the headache didn?t go away. I was given Flexeril, but it doesn?t help the pain. I am now using Excedrin to take the edge off. Associate is awaiting physician?s return call, but Dr. is out of town. Another doctor in the clinic would not see associate, as they don?t cover other physician?s patients.  No fever, no respiratory symptoms.

                                                Initial event was soreness at site which resolved on its own within a few days.  2 days after receiving vaccine, I began having an allergy reaction  to the same brand N95 that I had been utilizing since the beginning of the pandemic. Symptoms are swollen cheeks and welts , sudden itchiness at the site of my mask placement. The reason for this report is a sudden onset of excruciating and debilitating pain throughout my body specifically pain of my right shoulder radiating down my sprightly arm. I have been receiving testing and treatment for ongoing neuropathy due to Longhauler syndrome, however This recent pain is so debilitating, I spend most of my time in bed.  I have been experiencing chills then profuse sweating.  I also so fatigued, I sleep much of the day.  I have been having episodes of tachycardia with chest tightness which has increased since after having the vaccine. I also become short winded on exertion. I?ve been waking up in a panic and sweating.

Patient was laid flat on a couch, but then passed out and was not responsive to sternal rub.  After a code was called, the patient woke up.  At no time was there a loss of pulse or SOB.  Patient was transported to the ER and was subsequently discharged same day.  Patient did report that prior to the vaccination, she ran 13 miles in the morning, which may have had something to do with the reaction.

A 48-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) via unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included depression, had hip surgery last year (from 2020) and anxiety. Concomitant medication included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) for anxiety and depression. esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM [ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM]), on regular basis naproxen sodium (ALEVE) and paracetamol (TYLENOL) because of her hip. Patient was calling because she was vaccinated yesterday, 03Jan2021. Patient was a nurse and she got the COVID Vaccine yesterday. she wanted to go into the symptom checker or whatever because she was having, she woke, she wasn&#39;t (incomplete sentence). she had a difficult time sleeping last night. She woke up like with all her joints start just achy and she did not have a great time. she wanted to report her symptoms. patient have other things. No really big co-morbidities, like, she had depression. she had some body issues like she had a &#34;torn labor&#34; and stuff like that but that needs to be repaired but not like blood pressure, diabetes, none of those things. she had hip surgery last year. she took two Aleve in the morning and two 500 Tylenol. And she took one more Aleve in the evening and two more Tylenol. As of causality, patient stated she believe so. It&#39;s much more intense than it was, than she was feeling yesterday. she definitely could feel it after she had the vaccination. she got like this aching all up her spine and sort of the weird headache for about (incomplete sentence). it was for the rest of the day about an hour after she got the vaccination. She was a little too un-tuned with her body aching. Consumer stated, &#34;Is there, I mean, more I was calling to register with that CDC thing or whatever to report, you know just what&#39;s happening. I figured it was probably, kind of part of the research study or whatever for symptoms and tracking and all that. Is that what I am doing as well too by doing this or is that something separate?&#34; When probed if reported through CDC questionnaire, consumer stated, &#34;No, I went onto the website and it said that on CDC website the worst thing and it said that you needed a code or something a key code to get into the program and I don&#39;t. Is this where the reporting is going or how do I register with the (app Name) or whatever? Is that what I did by telling you what&#39;s going on?&#34; When informed about the role of Pfizer Drug Safety, consumer stated, &#34;I did not understand that safety report or I figured that we were like also assisting in some kind of research trial type thing too. Are they going to call me or no? Is this the last time I&#39;m hearing from anyone?&#34; No investigation assessment. No Lab Work. No Treatment. Outcome of the events was unknown.

I then  got in my car and I felt little bit sick and I picked up food and I started to feel sick. I went to work and my symptoms got worse and I sat in my desk and I felt like fainting.  I just felt so sick and I thought it was my diabetes.  A coworker saw me and told me i looked deathly pale and felt fainting and they took me to a ER room. They gave me Benadryl and IV fluids. I started seeing the floor and ceiling warped out, I was hallucinating.   My legs felt numb as well.  My eyes were twitching constantly. My blood pressure 147/95 and pulse was 112.   I went home, ate and went to sleep. On Saturday I felt better and went back to work 12-28-2020,  I  felt weak and stayed working at my shift. On Tuesday I worked 1  hour and still felt super weak.  Today I am starting to feel like myself again.  I will not get my second dosage due to my symptoms I have experienced.

A 48-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid, on 18Dec2020 07:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism and hysterectomy. Concomitant medications included estradiol (taking after hysterectomy) and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, both ongoing. The patient has no any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient stated that she received the Covid vaccine mid- Dec2020. She stated she was supposed to receive the 2nd dose 2 days ago, 06Jan2021. On 03Jan2021, she started feeling bad the day before testing positive, went to urgent care to be tested, thought she had the flu.  She tested positive for Covid on Monday 04Jan2021, so she has been in quarantine. She was unable to receive her 2nd dose because she was in quarantine. She wanted to know if it&#39;s ok to delay the second dose or if she needs to re-start the series. The reporter assessed the event relatedness was unknown, patient stated that she doesn&#39;t know the causality, she has not been in contact with anyone that was known to be positive, but she is a healthcare worker who sees multiple patients a day, so one of them could have been asymptomatic. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is too limited to make a meaningful medical assessment hence, the events are conservatively assessed as related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 until further information becomes available.

A 48-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 07:50 at a single dose on Left Upper Arm Muscle for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid disorder and antidepressant therapy. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid disorder, duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA) as Antidepressant and multivitamins. The patient stated that she is calling about the COVID Vaccine, she just had the shot at 7:50AM this morning. After getting the shot she heard that she is not suppose to get the shot if she had tested positive for COVID before the vaccine. She wanted to know if this was true or a rumor. Back around Nov2020 she did test positive for COVID. It was the week before the holidays on Wednesday 18Nov2020 when she lost taste and smell, she then got tested on 19Nov2020 Thursday then got results Friday or Saturday morning, the weekend before the holidays that she was positive. The test was a nasal swab. The girls in the office said she was not suppose to get the shot if it had not been 3 months. When she had COVID shot they didn&#39;t tell her if she could take it or not. This morning she woke up everything was fine, she drove over to get vaccine, after they put the vaccine in, they made her wait 15- 30 minute, while waiting she was getting a headache, then the headache went away and she then felt funny in the head. She was a little nauseous then that went away. Then she had this overwhelming feeling of tiredness like she could go to bed. She felt bad a little bit. When she then drove back to work at the school she had this funny taste in the mouth. Her boss wanted to call and see if this is all normal. The date of first dose was 13Jan2021, all the symptoms she experienced occurred within half hour of receiving the vaccine. She thinks she is fine. At the moment she does not have the taste in mouth any longer and her headache left. She still feels funny in head as well as she just feels bad inside, she has the feeling of overwhelming tiredness, she just feels like something is coming on, like she knows she is getting sick. She has no Lot or Expiry to share, she vaccine CDC card is outside in the car and not physically with her. Her drive to get the vaccine was an hour away to a Hospital and all the medication was taken an hour before. She went to the hospital to have the vaccine administered. Then she drove to work at a school. She has had an antibody test, in which they draw blood, it was negative but that was even before she caught COVID, it was back in Aug2020 or Sep2020. She has had no issues with vaccines in the past. The outcome of the event headache, a funny taste in the mouth, and nausea was recovered on 13Jan2021, tiredness/overwhelming feeling of tiredness was unknown, feeling &#34;funny&#34; in the head was not recovered. The events were assessed as non-serious.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                My right shoulder had intense deep muscle and surface soreness around the injection site  that kept me awake the first night of receiving the first vaccination.  The site was slightly swollen and warm to the touch with a few red dots that did not itch.   I did use 500mg of Tylonal to help alleviate the pain.  Within 35 hours of the first injection, my arm was not as tender or sore to the touch and did not keep me awake at night.  Although still sore, 48 hours later, there is no more swelling and the redness and red spots are gone.

I did have a hematoma and bruising, No fever On Jan 1st, I started feeling fatigued again and noticed round reddening approximately 2 inch in diameter appear about a inch under vaccination location which is still bruised.  There is no pain or itching at reddened site. Jan 2, 3 and 4th-Fatigue worsened and developed low grade temp never surpassing 100. My throat developed allergy reaction feeling, same reaction I get with nuts.  Throat did not swell and benedryl managed the reaction on Jan 3rd.  My eyes began swelling and I could not stop sneezing.  Developed laryngitis from the post nasal drainage.   I was up whole night but still went into work as normal on Jan 4th.  Struggled through the days but swelling and itching subsided.    I experienced the muscle aches on the 3rd and 4th. On Jan 5th, started feeling better and rested.  Still have reddened reaction on arm but is fading.  It is faintly visible today on Jan 6th, I feel better, just have the sneezing currently and a mild headache.  Benedryl is the only medication besides daily meds I took during the past several days.  I did not want to interrupt the immune system&#39;s work.

                                                I did let the nurse know right after I got the vaccine It did feel like  a huge water balloon was sitting on my arm and very heavy at the site. I went to the waiting area and the last 5 minutes and I started feeling weird, kind of getting dizzy and my heart started racing really fast. Am I can tell I was getting really hot and my face was flushed and my heart was racing and my hands started shaking, trembling almost like I couldn&#39;t control it. I&#39;ve never experienced something like this. The part that really scared me was my heart racing like it was going to come out of my chest. They called a code, put me in a wheel chair and took me to the ER (where I work).  They took my blood pressure which was really high, they did EKG, blood work and urine test. They kept me there for about five hours, while watching me. And the last weird thing that happened at one point I felt like liquid was running thru my body and my feet were really cold for several hours, It felt like someone was pouring liquid over me. I kept asking the nurse if this is normal and no one knew what to tell me.  After everything started slowing back down and it had been a couple hours and the next day i felt like I had a slight head ache and felt out of it, kind of  like I had a hangover and of course my arm was really sore.  The Doctor in the ER did advise me not to get the second dose as it will be worse than the first one.

A 49-year-old female received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 30Dec2020 10:40 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included from Feb2020 and ongoing she is currently a breast cancer patient/she had breast cancer, has lymphedema in the right due to breast cancer and on 31Oct2020, she tested positive for COVID and that ever since she was positive, her joints and skin, shins and upper arms and legs are really tender, and hips, wanted to know if that is normal.  Had joint pain and fatigue ever since her COVID-19 diagnosis in October. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took H1N1 shot and her arm got really big and they watched for cellulitis discomfort.  The patient stated on Dec2020, &#34;received the COVID-19 vaccine on 30Dec2020 and is reporting 100.7 temperature, dull headache, tenderness at the injection, chills, joint pain and fatigue. She reported that she has had joint pain and fatigue ever since her COVID-19 diagnosis in October. The patient contacted COVID, she tested positive on 31Oct2020, and still has no taste or smell, and the biggest thing right now, that ever since she was positive, her joints and skin, shins and upper arms and legs are really tender, and hips, wanted to know if that is normal. She wants to know, where it has gone into the joint, the arthritis has flared from it, from her testing positive, it will be 9 weeks tomorrow since she had COVID, and she is not 100%, and yesterday she had the COVID vaccine, her first dose, and she was up all night, her joints and muscles were in a lot of pain, but she had been like that, and this morning she took her temperature and it was 101.7. Does it mean can&#39;t have the shot in 3 weeks? She has had health issues this year, she had breast cancer, and her oncologist wanted her to have the vaccine, but it concerns her with all the pain in her joints swelled, and wanted to know if it is a side effect due to COVID. States she is still coughing, she wants to know if Pfizer thought this was a side effect of COVID, since she tested positive in October, will she have to live like that? It is very painful. Her shot went fine at 10:40 yesterday morning, fine, but she has been experiencing stiffness and joint pain, and she contacted COVID in October, thinks this doesn&#39;t have to do with the shot, this has been this way since October, and her husband said to ask- will it be like this since she contacted COVID, and the only thing, this morning she had a headache, but she didn&#39;t sleep and she gets migraines it she doesn&#39;t sleep, and she took her temperature, she felt warm and it was 101.7. Her temperature was 101.7 about a half hour ago (31Dec2020), she takes her temperature now, states it is now 100.8. Stated that she probably needs to speak to her doctor for her questions.  Got up a 1am and took Ibuprofen. Her joints were so sore from when having COVID and so she went back to sleep and slept off and on. Got up at 4am this morning with the dull headache, it was not enough to be considered a migraine, so she took another 800mg Ibuprofen. Headaches: states it is just a dull headache, she hasn&#39;t taken Ibuprofen yet this morning, she is not a big medicine person, she is trying to see if it will go away, but if it is worse she will take migraine medicine&#34;.

                                                fever of 2-3 degrees; slept most of the day; didn&#39;t feel well at all; headache; achey; tired/exhausted; sore arm; woke her up briefly; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 49-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot/batch number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 31Dec2020 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated in a hospital facility. Medical history included spending 4-6 hrs/day face-to-face with Covid patients for months since early Apr2020. The patient has no known allergies. The patient has no covid prior vaccination, and she was not tested for covid post vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included multivitamin. The patient did not receive other vaccine in last four weeks. The patient was vaccinated on 31Dec2020 at 10am for her 1st Pfizer vaccine. No symptoms for 6-8 hrs. By bedtime at 06:00 PM, she experienced headache, achey, tired, and sleeping on her sore arm woke her up briefly. Next day on 01Jan2021, more achey, exhausted, fever of 2-3 degrees, slept most of the day and didn&#39;t feel well at all. She could tell that her body was fighting something, but she is much better 48 hours out. The patient did not receive any treatment for the reported adverse events. She stated she had no regrets. She stated that she loves Pfizer, because it has given hope. She just wasn&#39;t expecting any side effects after the 1st vaccine, only for the 2nd. Anecdotally, it seemed her hospital coworkers who have had Covid react more to the 1st vaccine, possibly for them, 1st vaccine is like the 2nd. She doesn&#39;t know if she has had Covid, but as an Acute Care PT on Covid units, she spends 4-6 hrs/day face-to-face with Covid patients for months since early Apr2020. She stated that possible her immune system already recognizes Covid. She is curious. No complaints, only curious. Again, she said thank you. She stated that she has seen too many good people die this year, thus, she didn&#39;t hesitate on the vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2021. The report was considered non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                positive for Covid; positive for Covid; pneumonia; fever; This is spontaneous report from the Pfizer sponsored program, IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs) via a contactable nurse (patient). A 49-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EKS730), via an unspecified route of administration in deltoid left on 22Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 22Dec2020 and a week later she was tested positive for COVID on 29Dec2020. She was due for the second dose the day before the time of the report. She was concerned about the immune system before getting the second dose. She got a significant pneumonia on 29Dec2020 with COVID infection that her coworkers did not get and she was worried about the condition of her lungs and getting the second dose of the vaccine. She had done her research and read what the CDC said about waiting longer for the second dose. Patient had a fever on 26Dec2020, 4 days after getting the vaccine, she was scheduled to get the second dose on 12Jan2021, but she did not go in, since she couldn&#39;t get straight answers from anyone about the second dose, her question was: when could she get the second dose?  Patient was feeling better, she didn&#39;t get a repeat chest X-ray, but she felt, like she didn&#39;t have fevers, she felt like much better. Her fevers started 4 days after the vaccine on 26Dec2020, and lasted 5 days, maybe 2 days into the antibiotics it stopped. She had recovered completely from fevers. Stated her first test, she tested negative, on 27Dec2020, then tested positive on 29Dec2020. She had no test since then, since one could shed the virus for months, and she didn&#39;t feel the need to retest, she was past the point on quarantine. Lab data included Chest X-ray: Pneumonia on 29Dec2020, COVID 19: Negative on 27Dec2020, COVID 19: Positive on 29Dec2020. Outcome of event fever was resolved, and of other events was unknown. Causality: She couldn&#39;t say for sure no, but she questioned if put her in a more vulnerable state.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of suspect BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded for reported &#34;positive for Covid&#34; and pneumonia. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

My body ached all over and had a hard time sleeping due to all of this the entire evening.  I woke up and tried to get ready but quickly realized I was weak, my joints hurt, body ached, headache and couldn&#39;t do it.  This continued throughout the morning and part of the afternoon.  Then around 2pm, I was still tired and achy but my joints didn&#39;t hurt as bad and I was able to manage the headache with ibuprofen.  The body aches continued through most of the next day (Jan. 23) as well.  By Jan. 24th I was perfectly fine and back to normal.  I had covid early in the year on Nov. 6 which kept me out of work for almost 3 weeks.  These few days were very similar to how I felt when I had covid but not as intense.

This 49-year-old female nurse reported for herself that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL8982) at single dose for Vaccination on 14Jan2021. The vaccine was injected to left deltoid/shoulder about 2:15 pm. Relevant medical history included ongoing uterine fibroids since Dec2019, ongoing obesity since Oct2000 and COVID-19 from Dec2020 to Dec2020.   Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. The patient had surgical procedures when she had her first child. No Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s).  Her mother got the shot a couple of days before caller did and she had no problems. The patient was administered her first dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 14Jan2021. She reported that she became sick (Medically significant) about 12 hours later on 15Jan2021.  The patient Went to sleep and woke up about 12 hours after she got the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with a body temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit and arm pain. She could not really go back to sleep. When she got up it went away. She tried to go to work that day, and did go to work but she was really tired. When she finally got home she got in the bed and really had not been out of bed since then except for today she was sitting in a chair; so she thought maybe she had improved a little bit at on the reporting day. She had maintained a constant fever since 15Jan2021 that had gotten as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At the reporting time her temp was 100.5. She had alternated Tylenol and Motrin for the fever. She was sweating profusely so it may be the temperature trying to break, but she had been struggling since she had it. This was so unlike her, she did not just stay in bed. She could not kick it. She had been unable to work since 15Jan2021 and she had to work tomorrow.  She believed this was medically significant because she cannot work.  The patient did not have vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine(s).  No Additional Vaccines was administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Relevant Tests was None. The patient did not visit the emergency Room nor Physician Office due to the events. The outcome of event being sick was resolving. The outcome of event temperature had gotten as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit was not resolved. The outcome of other events was unknown. The patient thought the causality was yes 100% because her COVID-19 symptoms were not even this bad; she never had a fever with COVID-19; and she had never before had a fever this high for this long.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible chronological association between vaccine administration and onset of the event; causality therefore cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I saw my doctor on January 27 and we tried steroids, lorazepam, and phenergan.  I saw a physical therapist for vertigo and continue to do exercises to treat vertigo.   I did have a previous incidence of vertigo a couple weeks after a flu vaccine about 3 years ago.  I just wanted to report my symptoms as the Covid vaccine is new.  I have currently not recovered from this episode of vertigo and cannot work at this time.

A 49-year-old female (not pregnant) patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: ek9231) second dose on 06Jan2021 on left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism and allergies to penicillin. Concomitant medications in two weeks included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), liothyronine, magnesium carbonate (MAG 2), trimebutine maleate (MOTRI), zinc, curcuma longa (CURCUMA).

At approximately 9pm I began to experience whole body chills, teeth chattering, and extreme fatigue. I took Ibuprofen and went to sleep. I experienced chills until approx 3 AM. My watch alerted my heart rate rose above 120 bpm three separate times during the night in the 1, 2 and 3:00 hours. Upon review of the summary it appears to have been sustained at just over 120 for that entire time. I awoke at noon, with a temp of approx 99.5 F, I felt extreme fatigue and a sense of cold but body was warm to touch and I was very sweaty this entire time. I slept most of the day and at 5 pm awoke with a temp of 102.4F. I contacted my physician who directed me to use tylenol and Benadryl. I took a dose at 5 pm, anther at 9 PM. Upon waking the next morning I was afebrile. At that time I felt slightly dizzy and lightheaded but also dehydrated. Forcing fluids relieved symptoms. I experienced a very mild headache and very mild queasiness as well.

Reported the COVID-19 Vaccine was offered through her employer. She said the COVID-19 vaccine was optional and offered to all employees if they work at the hospital. She experienced the tachycardia at 11:00 PM last night, 29Dec2020. She said her normal resting heart rate is between the high 60s to low 70s. She said her heart rate at 11:00PM last night was at around 100, clarifying she was not running a fever at that time. She stated after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she was not feeling right, so she took the day off from work today, and slept in. She said when she woke up this morning (in Dec2020), she still didn&#39;t feel right, saying she felt weak and wobbly, and when she checked her pulse it was 115. She said she does have a past history of tachycardia. She said a year ago she had major surgery, and she had tachycardia after the major surgery. She said the tachycardia eventually went away, but she did have to see a cardiologist and take a beta blocker. She said she took a tiny dose of the beta blocker this morning, and called the cardiologist to let him know what was going on. She said she has not heard back from the cardiologist yet. She said the tachycardia went away once she took the beta blocker this morning. She said she took the beta blocker because her heart rate was going higher, and higher. She said she didn&#39;t want to end up like last year after her major surgery with a heart rate in the 170s. She said the tachycardia she was experiencing after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine was not normal for her. She said once she got over the major surgery last year, her heart rate was fine. Reported her employer was making employees wait around for 15 minutes after the employees received the COVID-19 Vaccine to make sure no one had a major reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine, she waited around longer than the 15 minutes. She said she felt weird after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and thought maybe she was experiencing anxiety. She said she was lightheaded on 29Dec2020 after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and completed a report right then on the website. She said the website is for reporting adverse events, and she was sent a website link to complete the adverse event reporting. She said she signed into the website link while she was still at the hospital. She said one of the website&#39;s first questions asked was how she was feeling. She said the question made her wonder if her lightheadedness was due to her heart rate being up because she becomes lightheaded when that happens. She clarified she reported only the lightheadedness on the website, and not the tachycardia. She said her lightheadedness got better and she was fine, and then at 11:00PM the tachycardia hit her like a switch. Reported this morning she felt fine, and then all of sudden she wasn&#39;t fine. Tachycardia Treatment: Reported she took a 8.5mg dose, or one quarter of a 25mg tablet (as provided by the reporter) of the beta blocker Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning and called her cardiologist to let him know. She said she split the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning, and only took a quarter of the 25mg tablet (reported as a 8.5mg dose by the reporter). Reported she believes 100% that her tachycardia was caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine, saying she has been fine up until receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she got the COVID-19 Vaccine because she was afraid of getting the COVID-19 Virus with her asthma. She said she has no other preexisting conditions besides the asthma. Reported she is not going to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said it was scary when her heart rate shot up out of nowhere. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine is the only thing different she has done. She said before the COVID-19 Vaccine, she was completely fine. Patient asked if the Pfizer DSU agent had heard of anyone else who has experienced tachycardia after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. The outcome of the event tachycardia was recovered in Dec2020, event lightheadedness was recovering and unknown for the other events. The reporter assessed the event &#39;tachycardia&#39; as Serious (Medically Significant).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tachycardia with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded. The medical history of tachycardia and asthma medication may be contributory as well.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Most symptoms lasted about 7 -10 days. However, it is now day 20 after the initial vaccine and I still have joint pain that has not gone away. esp in hands, wrists, and feet. When I sleep I still wake up with all my joints hurting it gets better as I start moving but the wrist, hands, and feet pain has not gone away. This pain will wake me in the night when I change positions.  I called my doctor today to inquire if it is a good idea if I should take the second dose because the first dose made me so dibiliated. Awaiting for a response. I am due to take the second vaccine on 2/9/21.

                                                First night had fever (102.4), chills, body aches, fatigue and slight headache. My arm was sore but my armpit was so painful (felt like stabbing sensation).  This lasted until around 2:00 pm Saturday.  I felt ok except for being tired and armpit still hurting quite a bit. On Sunday, I was very tired and slept during the day and went to bed around 8:30 pm feeling like I had a slight sore throat, tired and mildly nauseous. My armpit still hurt quite a bit.  I woke up Monday at 5:30 am and showered and was profusely sweating when I was getting ready for work - my temperature was 100.6 so I took 800 mg of Ibuprofen to help with the temp and the pain in my armpit.  I did not go into work. I  am still tired and my current temp is 100.1 (12:30pm) and sweaty.  I do feel as though the severity of my armpit pain is lessening but it is still bothersome.

I then developed body aches and chills.  I did not develop a fever that I know of but the body aches and chills continues throughout the night.  During the night a severe headache developed as well as generalized weakness.  I was unable to sleep and had to miss work the next day.  Because the weakness and body aches continue, I plan to miss a second day of work tomorrow.  I treated the symptoms with Tylenol.

A 50-year-old female patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 (at the age of 50-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included tachycardia, tension headache, and glucose tolerance impaired.  Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), gabapentin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  On 18Dec2020, the patient experienced hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, tetany, muscle cramps, and hemoglobin dropped little bit.  The clinical course was as follows: The patient received the vaccine and about 30 minutes later she started to &#34;feel bad&#34;. She went to the urgent care and about an hour after they took her to the emergency room (also reported as hospital). She had a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and magnesium level done on the 18th, 21th, 23rd, 26th, 28th, 30th of Dec2020 and then again on 04Jan2021.  On 18Dec2020, her initial lab test showed potassium: 2.6, hemoglobin: 10.2, magnesium: 1.2, and calcium: 5.7. The physician assistant reported that a potassium of 2.6 was critically low and a hemoglobin was 10.2 was about normal for the patient. She received oral medications of potassium 20 mEq twice a day and calcium and magnesium supplements once a day. On 04Jan2021, lab data showed:  potassium: 4.2, magnesium: 2.1, calcium: 9.5 and hemoglobin: 14.5. Per the reporting physician assistant, the above levels went back to normal but stated she had to be supplemented to get back to that point. The clinical outcomes of the hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hemoglobin dropped little bit were recovered on 04Jan2021; while that of the tetany and muscle cramps, were unknown. The physician assistant assessed the events as related to the suspect vaccine.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The day after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine, I had a massive headache, to the point where I stayed in bed and slept all day.   I also noticed that my brain was foggy.  The next day I was able to move to the couch, but the headache was still severe with continued brain fog.  I called by PCP to see if there was anything that I needed to be doing or taking and she told me that I should start feeling better the next week.   The headache remains but is mild.  I have memory loss and difficulty concentrating.  I am a nurse and over my weekend at work, I had difficulty doing my job because I couldn&#39;t keep track of what I was supposed to be doing and had difficulty charting.  My coworkers even commented that I seemed &#34;really different&#34;, that my memory was poor, I had personality changes (according to one person) and that my standard of care was much less than usual.  One person also commented that seemed to not be able to hear her and kept asking her to repeat herself.  I find myself having to concentrate harder to see when I am reading or typing something.  I missed work on January 14 and 15 because of the mental fogginess and headache.  I thought I was doing better, but I realized that I wasn&#39;t when I returned to work on January 23 and 24.  I have spoken to my PCP on the phone once and am awaiting calls from my PCP and neurologist regarding this event.

                                                Got booster shot on Wednesday the 20th, came home and was fatigued. Thursday had horrible headache that would not be relieved with tylenol. I took a plane and arrived at 1130 pm. I went to bed shortly after arriving at my daughters house. Friday morning, I was unable to be woken up and my daughter called 911. I was in a coma. I suffered cardiac arrest during a CT to check for clots. I was resuscitated and put on life support. CT scan for clots, strokes, heart attacks were all clear. I was admitted to the C-ICU and on life support, on the ventilator, and was on 3 different medications at max dosage to keep my blood pressure barely surviving. The doctors told my daughter not to expect me to survive because they had no idea why I was suddenly so ill.  A doctor then told my daughter that my kidneys were failing, and my liver was damaged.  I also developed a high fever and had a high white blood cell count. They gave me Vancomycin and another antibiotic, and then the next the day a kidney doctor gave me lasix to flush out all of the excess fluid. I woke up on Saturday not knowing what had happened and was completely terrified and confused. My daughter was allowed into the ICU to see me and keep me calm, thankfully. She explained to me what happened. I am still in the hospital, as they are keeping me for observation and trying to determine if my kidneys will start working properly again.  Prior to this, I have only ever had a kidney infection, and I thought before I might have had the start of a UTI.  I do have chronic high blood pressure as well, a long term side effect from open heart surgery 10 years prior for an aneurysm, but aside from that I am relatively healthy 50 year old.

I woke up at 0300 with severe joint pain, headache and chills. Nausea started shortly afterwards. The joint pain was excruciating and it was very difficult to move. By 0330, I started vomiting. Vomiting continued until approximately 0745. I felt dehydrated but was not able to hold down any water. I contacted the Nurse Advice line and spoke to a nurse. She asked me a series of questions, all relating to signs indicative of an allergic reaction. I knew I was not experiencing a typical allergic reaction. But I was experiencing a bad reaction. Based on my responses to her questions, she did not recommend that I go an Urgent Care Clinic or see a Doctor. The severe joint pain continued through 02/14/2021. I started to feel better on 02/15/2021. Even though I did not experience an allergic reaction, given the severity of my joint pain and vomiting, I still feel it is important for what I did experience to be documented. Thank you.

Transported to nearest hospital, I had to have emergency surgery on left ankle, by Dr.  A plate and screws were placed in my ankle to stabilize the break.  I am being treated and monitored by my general doctor for the concussion.  I am currently non-weight bearing on my ankle, for a minimum of 2-4 weeks.  I am unable to work due to the ankle break and concussion, for an undetermined amount of time. I am scheduled to meet with Dr. on the 4th of March, at which time he stated  he will want to begin physical therapy, once the break has reached an adequate stage of healing.  I will be re-evaluated by my general Dr. for the concussion in 2 weeks.

She said the nurse suggested she talk to a medic located in the back are of where the COVID-19 Vaccines were being administered. She said she talked to medic. She said at that point it was probably about 25 minutes after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she never had allergies, and had no problem with the flu vaccine. She said she has had issues with anesthesia in the past, and if she is given the wrong type of anesthesia, she can get nauseous. She said the medic took her heart rate, and her heart rate was 154-ish. She said her heart rate was high, but sometimes for her, that is the case. She said the medic asked her how her breathing was. She said her breathing was OK, and could swallow fine. She said when the medic rechecked her heart rate, her heart rate was still the same. The medic said she has two things he can do: she can go to get Benadryl, or she can get checked out by a doctor. She said she wanted to see a doctor. She said she was brought to an Urgent Care to see a doctor. She said her heart rate was still elevated. She said the urgent care staff did a finger prick test (clarified as a blood sugar finger stick test), and she was told the finger prick test was fine.

She said the doctor felt she had a panic attack. She said she has had one panic attack in the past, and knows what a panic attack feels like. She said she maybe had some anxiety. She said her symptoms didn&#39;t seem like a panic attack because she wasn&#39;t having difficulty breathing and she wasn&#39;t short of breath, but she was somewhat nervous. She said she was not sure what to do, so she contacted her family doctor to see what she should do when she goes for her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said the Urgent Care doctor gave her a prescription for Hydroxyzine Pamoate 25mg capsule, 1 capsule three times daily, as needed, for anxiety. She said her doctor told her the Hydroxyzine Pamoate is used for allergic reactions, as well. She clarified when she was at the urgent care her heart rate went down, and the nurse at the urgent care gave her 2 Benadryl pink capsules. Reported she took Benadryl when she got home because she was afraid she was having an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. Outcome of possible allergic reaction was unknown. She said she had a great night sleep, and the next morning took her first dose of the Hydroxyzine Pamoate 25mg. She said her primary care doctor suggested she take the Hydroxyzine Pamoate 25mg an hour before she gets the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose.

                                                Transcription of a text I sent to my colleagues:  Hi all--I&#39;m not sure who has received the second vaccine, but I wanted to update as to my experience.  I got sick with the first one from about 4ish hours after until the next mid morning maybe?  Then I felt bad again that second night.  I had my vaccine (second) yesterday at 4 PM, and I felt OK going to bed but had a pretty pitiful night.  I woke up at 5 AM and I felt horrible.  That felt like someone took a pair of metal cymbals and slammed them together on my head.  The tinnitus was strong.  I also had body aches and joint pain and felt like I had the flu.  I felt a little better around 1 PM, but felt bad again around 330.  Now I&#39;m miserable again with terrible body aches and chills (this was at 7:38 PM).  I&#39;m sure I will feel better in the morning, just wanted to share my experience.&#34;  Sadly, since then, I have had tinnitus with a metallic ringing in both ears along with hearing loss.  I had some vertigo one day but unsure if this was related.  The tinnitus makes me very sad.  I am a hospitalist and am happy to have been vaccinated, still.  It has been 2 months today, and it remains, unrelenting.  It is worse in the morning and at night.  The hearing loss is difficult.

I felt &#34;off&#34; that night and the next day.  Probably like I was mildly sick and fatigued with body feeling sore all over and headachey.

                                                20 minutes after receiving the vaccination the resident started to not feel well. She said she felt very far away and just kept repeating I don&#39;t feel well. She was diaphoretic and her chest was very red and she kept scratching and rubbing it at it. I asked if she wanted IM Benadryl or epipen and she at first denied. She also said she felt like she needed to focus on her breathing. At this time we decided it was best to administer Epipen x 1 dose. Immediately after she felt better. She was observed for another 30 minutes and then went home. at 7:17pm I called and spoke with her. She said her arm was sore and that her oxygen levels were about 88-89% which is low for her but she said she felt fine and is currently working right now.

She stated that her husband, who was not vaccinated, had the virus and developed more serious symptoms than she did.  She is concerned about worsening side effects with the second dose and stated that she felt like crap the night after her first dose with chills and arm pain. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 on 26Dec2020. Specific test name was unknown, but she knows it was not a rapid test. She is scheduled to get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 08Jan2021. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose relative to the COVID-19 diagnosis. She has not been able to find the information she is asking about. The outcome of the event of Covid-19 was recovering while other events was unknown. The Covid-19 was assessed as unrelated to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test together with any associated symptoms are needed for full medical assessment. COVID-19 antigen test positive.

I took 25 of Benadryl and went about my evening. Tuesday around 12:00 I had that same sensation but a little stronger, I would call it a tongue swelling but no resp issues or swallowing problems. I called my PCP and he recommended me to take Zyrtec (which I take 1 daily) BID and Benadryl prn. I took 3 doses of Benadryl Tuesday and a Zyrtec Tuesday night and one Wednesday and  around 8:15 had the same sensation, tongue swelling but milder. I immediately took 50 mg of Benadryl and called my Dr again and he recommended a steroid pack and Benadryl prn and to not take the 2nd dose.

                                                The day after receiving the vaccine I woke up with slight soreness of the arm. At work at 10:00am I began to get fatigued chills overall body aches but was afebrile. I also had nasal congestion and sneezing for 4 hrs. that resolved. At 12 noon I felt progressively worse and had to leave work. I got home and my temp was 100.2 and took more Ibuprofen at 1 PM. At 2PM the body aches and chills were pretty severe- my temp rose to 103.2. I took more Ibuprofen and alternated with TYLENOL and it returned to normal at 10 PM. I notified my Drs office and had a telemedicine visit with Dr at 4PM who thought it was a normal immune response but suggested getting a COVID Test in the meantime before returning to work. I woke up this morning afebrile with no issues notified employee health got a referral and had my COVID test completed at 09:30am. The urgent care MD strongly urged me to report to VAERS, not just CDC as I had yesterday. My COVID tests are still pending.

                                                Day 7 post vaccine, woke with vertigo, nausea and double vision prior to my alarm going off at 5:30am, told my husband that I did not feel right and it felt like something was wrong with me. I asked him to send a message to work that I was not feeling well and would not be in. I was not able to see my phone clearly as I had double vision.  I went back to sleep to try to get relief, woke up and called out to husband for help and he said I was just making groaning noises but I know in my head I was saying please help me as I could not move my right side and I was not sleeping or having a dream. At approximately 9:30am my husband kept telling me someone was trying to text me and needed a response. I tried to get up and still could not move my right side. He helped me sit up and I could not use my right arm and hand. He helped me get some clothes on and took me to the ED. When we arrived I still could not use my right hand and my arm still felt weak. The weakness resolved within a couple of hours and I got the strength back in my hand.   I did have some concern that my TIA type symptoms could possibly be related to vaccine but it was just a thought until I received my second dose. 3 hours post vaccine my face became numb and tingly. It remained that way until I went to sleep. This is why I am reporting this incident.

A 51-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration (left arm), on 08Jan2021 at 12:00, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included stomach flu (about 2 years ago), pneumonia (14 years ago), and oral surgery (recently). Concomitant medications included lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), calcium, ergocalciferol (VIT D) and red yeast rice. The patient previously received influenza vaccine. The patient has no known allergies. Patient&#39;s body mass index (BMI) was 32.5. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The vaccine was administered in the pharmacy or drug store. About 30 min after vaccination on 08Jan2020, the patient&#39;s entire left arm felt &#34;odd&#34; not painful, just different than my right arm.  About 6 hours after the shot, the patient started getting very tired, and my joints/muscles on my left side (neck, leg, arm) started to ache.  She slept off and on from 20:00 to 12:00 and she did not really feel like moving from the couch, but got up to go to bed. She checked for fever around 19:30 and 12:00 but had none. She took one of my left over 600 mg ibuprofen (from a recent oral surgery) as treatment, then went to bed and woke up feeling much better. Today, she only has soreness at the injection site (as she normally did with a flu vaccine). She decided to be proactive and took another 600 ibuprofen around 15:00 and felt consistent all day. Patient stated that how she felt the evening of the vaccine was not painful; just &#34;different&#34; than she experienced before. Outcome of the events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.

Took Tylenol every 4 hrs and fever (101. 5)returns in 1-2 hrs. Pulse ox remained normal, 98%, but pulse was 99/min. Usually my resting pulse ox is 55/minutes.  Was unable to go to work and see patients.  Had these symptoms for 48 hrs even though stayed in bed, took Tylenol around the clock and drank plenty of fluids (2-3 liters of water in addition to natural orange and apple juices). Never lost appetite either, do eating my vegetables and fish diet. Ice cream help between Tylenol?s. Completely resolved after 72 hrs. Now still have  LEFT  injection site tender deltoid and left axillary tender nodes, improving as well. All along breathing fine, no cough or congestion or sore throat. No anosmia  or dysgeusia.  This was after my second Pfizer dose.  After the First dose only had tenderness on the RIGHT deltoid muscle injection site and tender axillary node, resolved by now.

I took Tylenol as soon as I got home due to symptoms getting worse.  That night I went to bed at 10pm and didn?t wake up till 7:45am (I was dead tired, I didn?t even hear my  alarm).  Jan/19/21. Soon as I got up, I experienced headache, vertigo, and this time with mild body aches/heavy feeling and  mental fog (Tylenol helped relieved symptoms).  Towards the afternoon, I also felt mild burning sensation in my eyes and somehow I felt hot flashes around my face only.  Been taking my temperature with normal results.   Jan/20/21  Still experiencing off/on headaches and light headedness, otherwise feels okay.  All symptoms gone by end of the day.

A 51-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL0142, expiry date not reported) on 07Jan2021 intramuscularly in left deltoid muscle at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), amlodipine besilate/ atorvastatin calcium (CADUET). The patient received the vaccine and then had COVID. On 07Jan2021 Thursday, the patient received the vaccine, and on Tuesday (12Jan2021) she said she was not feeling good. On Thursday (14Jan2021) she went to work and because she was not feeling good, she was tested and she was tested positive. The patient worked in a nursing home where she had been tested almost everyday. She was tested negative before she got the vaccine. She was at home, not receiving treatment for COVID. The reporter didn&#39;t understand why the patient (reporter&#39;s wife) got the vaccine and then had COVID. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported event tested positive based on the known safety profile. However the short duration of 7 days since the vaccine first dose is given it is unlikely patient would have fully developed immunity.

                                                yesterday started a flare up but she is not sure if this is related to the vaccine use; fever/was 105.00 with Tylenol; increased dizziness/light-headed; body aches; severe headache; nausea; chills; sweating/sweats; Fatigue; feeling crappy; blood pressure tends to be low but was 95/81 at the time she got the shot; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: no adverse effect. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 25Jan2021 this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 51-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3247, expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 17:45 at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing severe Crohn&#39;s disease, pneumonia, allergy to eggs/anaphylactic reactions to eggs, anaphylactic with bee stings on 2020 (this has happen twice in 2020), collapsed her lung (reaction to anesthesia that collapsed her lung), high fever, anaphylactic reactions. Concomitant medication included sertraline (SERTRALINE), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]). The patient previously took Hep B and experienced fever, flu like symptoms, achy, and lethargic (no issue with the first 2 doses but with the 3rd dose she had a high fever); MMR and had an adverse reaction. It was reported that the shot was given on 19Jan2021. She experienced the following severe dizziness which started that day (17:45) and lasted 3 days. It has resolved. Nausea which started that day (17:45) and stayed constant for 3 days. Now it has only been happing in the late afternoons or evenings. Light headed which started that day and last 3 days. Headache (17:45), the initial headache felt like her whole head was going to explode into a 1000 piece. Now it just starts about 4-5pm in the evening. It was better and not as severe but like a migraine with nausea (17:45), feeling crappy (17:45), and body aches. Body aches which started on the day of the shot (17:45) and lasted 3 days. Fatigue which started on the day she got the shot (17:45) and was ongoing in the evening now chills and sweats which started on the day she got the shot and was ongoing. Her husband asked about if this was being related to the change of life but she doesn&#39;t think so. Fever which happened on the day she got the shot (17:45) but not at the site, later that night and was 105.00 with Tylenol. It has resolved. She noted that her blood pressure tends to be low but was 95/81 at the time she got the shot (17:45). The patient has not taken her blood pressure and does know if this has resolved. It was relayed that she took Tylenol and Benadryl before the shot due to her history and was still taking it as treatment for the symptoms. She has a lot of drug and other allergies, the only that was anaphylaxis was bees and egg. This was why she brought 2 EpiPens when she had the shot. She didn&#39;t have to use her EpiPen and was really proud of that but did have some reactions.  The patient reported she did not go to the doctor. At this point she was somewhat expected that she had a not great reaction so the fact that she could still breath after getting it was a good thing. She also noted she could not have driven home due to dizziness. The patient was not brought to the emergency room and did not went to a physician&#39;s office. The patient has an ongoing medical history of Crohn&#39;s disease and reported that yesterday (as reported) started a flare up but she was not sure if this was related to the vaccine use. The patient recovered from fever on 23Jan2021; was recovering from dizziness, body aches, severe headache, nausea, chills, sweating, and fatigue; while outcome of blood pressure tends to be low, feeling crappy and Crohn&#39;s flare up was unknown.

A 52-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), Batch/lot number: EK9231, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021, via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 09:00 at single dose in deltoid right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart attack from Jul2019. Concomitant medication included diltiazem from 2019 and ongoing at 120mg tablet taken daily for abnormal heart rhythm she did not know of until had heart attack, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) from 2019 and ongoing at 81 mg tablet taken daily for heart attack. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunisation; she got the Flu vaccine every year and got shingles vaccine in Mar2020 for immunization. She did totally fine after receiving Flu vaccines and the Shingles vaccine. She had no side effects from the Flu vaccines except maybe a little arm soreness; she had arm soreness for a couple of days after the shingles vaccine; maybe a slight fever and took it easy. This Emergency Room Nurse (patient) received her second dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 06Jan2021 around 9:00am. She went back to work, worked around 6-8 more hours that day and was fine. She went home and around 8-10 hours after she got the second dose on the evening of 06Jan2021 she had a little arm soreness and body aches. Last night all night she had chills; she could not sleep; fever. This morning: 07Jan2021 she was so nauseous that she got up and tried to get to the bathroom where she threw up a little. She reported as of 07Jan2021 she kept falling down: She fell in the bathroom this morning first when she was trying to get to the bathroom to throw up; During the second fall she was going on the stairs and fell, and hit her head; she had a huge bump on her face that was very painful now that she thought was from that second fall; and she had the third fall this evening; she cannot walk straight or without assistance anymore, she had been on the couch all day. She has had vertigo all day and weakness in the muscles. Chills was described as unbearable, heavy chills that she could not control. Fever: Temperature of 102-102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The high fever hit around 3:00am on 07Jan2021. When her high fever hit around 3:00am she thought she would go to the emergency room but she did not want to scare her family so she stayed home and tried to pull through it. Today she took a Tylenol after she threw up this morning just to get through the day. Since she cannot walk without assistance or walk straight today that&#39;s the only lingering symptom that really worries her; she may go to the emergency room tonight if she did not get any better. She just did not want to scare her family and the emergency room was another copay cost so she really did not want to go to the emergency room at her workplace; but she may go there tonight and be kept overnight under observation. Prior to taking this second dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she was completely fine. She expected to have body aches, chills and fever; but she never thought the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine would put her into a place where she is falling like this with the nausea and vertigo; she has never in her life had vertigo or falling like this. She reported she had no other vaccinations on the same date as Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine second dose. Has had no other vaccines in the recent past. She had never felt like this before with any other vaccines; she had never felt so weak in her muscles and never fallen down like this with any other vaccines. Seriousness criteria and outcome of all events unknown. The reporter considered all events were related to Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

A 52-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), intramuscularly in the left arm on 28Dec2020 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included tested positive for covid on 06Nov2020. The patient had recent physical in Dec2020,  patient did blood work. Twelve years ago (2009) she had a partial thyroidectomy and at the physical they noticed a lump. The goiter was enlarged on her neck. She doesn&#39;t know if it a result from COVID, but she has Hashimoto&#39;s disease in Dec2020. She has to have surgery to removed the goiter, but she can&#39;t because of COVID. She has looked it up and it is an autoimmune disease. She had a fine needle biopsy and it was negative and she had a full thyroid work up that was fine in the beginning of Jan2021.The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 14Jan2021, the patient&#39;s test came back positive for covid. It was further reported that the patient tested negative on the Friday after holiday. She has been getting tested twice weekly since that time and they had all been negative. Patient was scheduled to get her second dose of the vaccine today (18Jan2021). The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

A 52-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received her second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19 vaccine brand Pfizer, lot EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 08Jan2021 10:30 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 immunisation.

She previously took Ceclor and Biaxin and had drug hypersensitivity. Her psoriatic arthritis was starting to have a flare prior to her first injection.

The events were reported as serious- disability or permanent damage. The outcome of events was not recovered.

They kept me for 2 hours. Started to resolve in those two hours but didn&#39;t go away completely. By evening it was mostly returned to normal. Next day, I woke up with flu-like symptoms - felt like I had the flu. Every hair on my head hurt; wanted to sleep; no appetite. Three in afternoon - I felt much better. As quickly as it came on, it went away quickly.

She was crying and stated that her boss can&#39;t tell her anything, she doesn&#39;t want to go to her doctor because, what was he going to tell her. She doesn&#39;t want to waste a copay. She reported taking Advil and Tylenol for her joint pain without relief and asked what else she should do. She stated she wanted directions, she doesn&#39;t want people reading off of a card. She stated she shouldn&#39;t have to pay a copay and she doesn&#39;t want more medicine to mask her symptoms, she wanted an answer. Additionally, the patient was calling about Pfizer COVID shot, she took first dose 22Dec2020, had a reaction, 35 minutes after she sat for 30 minutes, she works at a hospital, and she walked out to her car, she got sick and nauseous, then after the shot, she had flu like symptoms that lasted, and the next day was terrible, it lasted another week and a half, then she took the second shot 11Jan2021, to this day, she still has restless leg syndrome, fatigue, and her joints were hurting her. She had the same thing before, but this hurts a lot worse, and it was not going away, she was taking Turmeric, everything, and everyone says to just keep taking Tylenol or Advil but she can&#39;t keep taking it because now it was upsetting her stomach, or like arthritis medicine, she was taking Omega 3, vitamins, she was 52 years old, she does Spartan races, Cross fit, she does paleo and keto eating, if one looks at her they wouldn&#39;t know she was 52, and she was hurting everyday and doesn&#39;t know what else do to, and doctors weren&#39;t knowledgeable, she doesn&#39;t want a stupid answer. She called work, the CDC knows about it, now VAERS, and they said to call Pfizer, when she calls her doctor she doesn&#39;t want to pay a copayment and get an idiotic answer. She got this because she works at a hospital and she was trying to protect herself and everyone else, she doesn&#39;t like feeling this way, it was to the point she was getting angry, not at Pfizer, but she gets up and runs, with her dog, she was busy all the time, she has 3 boys in the military, and she meets up to do obstacles with them, but she doesn&#39;t feel like doing crap and was miserable everyday. She was a CNA in nursing school. She doesn&#39;t know if she even wanted to see her doctor, she doesn&#39;t want to get an idiotic answer. She hasn&#39;t seen him in while, she switched insurance, been primary for years. Stated this was her first day speaking to DSU before she decides what else to do after this, she was angry. Stated about 35 minutes after the first shot, after 30 minutes they said she could go, she said ok, she walked out to her car, was nauseous and threw up and didn&#39;t eat that morning, and the next day, she felt like she was in a car accident, that was how bad she felt, she had cold chills, flu like stuff that night before, she runs low like 96.6 to 96.8 and she took her temperature, she got in a blanket and went to bed that night, she was 95.5, and didn&#39;t bother taking another temperature, she took a bunch of Advil and went to bed, and Benadryl to go to sleep. This all started on 22Dec2020, and it took about 2 weeks, she just had joint pain, not like now, but those days she didn&#39;t feel good, but by the third week she was ok, and she went to take the second shot next time, and all hell broke loose. The second shot was 11Jan2021, and that night it she noted her joints were starting all over again, and she had restless leg syndrome, cold chills and everything, so she went to bed, she didn&#39;t have Benadryl, so she got up, and that night took Tylenol, she didn&#39;t get very much sleep, and she was very annoyed the next day, she felt like the first time, that like she got it an accident, feeling terrible, that night, and she can lay on the couch to relax, but with the restless leg syndrome, and her joints all day long, she just went yesterday to buy Advil Arthritis, and she never had arthritis before or anything. Restless leg syndrome depends, sometimes it was better than other time. Joint pain was not improving, she was so aggravated about that, she was not feeling 100%, people look at her and say she doesn&#39;t look like she feels good, she doesn&#39;t, and she was ready to bite their heads off, she was very active, always in the gym or something, she has 3 kids in the military, and was always meeting up with them to do military runs and just this was ridiculous. Stated she took a picture of the vaccine card, as she sent it to a few people.

The outcome was not recovered for the events joint pain, restless leg syndrome and fatigue; and unknown for the rest of the events.

Other products, patient history and investigation assessment was No. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was vaccinated with the COVID Vaccine on 20Dec2020 but tested positive afterwards on 27Dec2020. The patent thought she had COVID in the vaccine and COVID in her body. She was scheduled for next dose on 10Jan2021 and would like to know if she should get the scheduled dose or if she needs to wait longer and re-schedule it. She was now a COVID patient and sick. She was waiting to get better. Before the vaccine she tested negative and felt great. Then she got the vaccine. She had a runny nose and felt achy. She asked her coworker, and her coworker felt the same. She thought if it continued that maybe it was a side effect. Caller confirmed her symptoms were runny nose, feeling achy, and coughing. She took Tylenol and the aches went away. They then came back, and she had more aching and she was wondering why. Caller clarified that these symptoms did not start the next day after receiving the vaccine. Achiness/body aches was started on 23Dec2020 when she was at work. It would wake her up at night. She did have aches right now, but her fever had lowered down. She was also dizzy and weak. It was affecting her legs and she had no taste. She was not eating but needs to eat. If she did, she eat something sweet. Runny nose was started on 24Dec2020. She went back to work on 26Dec2020 but told them she could not work because she had symptoms of COVID. She went to her second job where they do COVID testing and asked her boss for a test. She tested positive on 27Dec2020. Dose was unknown. She said she thought she got 1 vial. The whole thing. The outcome of events &#34;tested positive for COVID after receiving the vaccine&#34; was not recovered.   Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

Lower back at kidney sites are so painful. Weakness. No energy to lift up arms or legs. Have difficult to get up and get out of bed to get medicine or food. So sleepy, maybe because Tylenol 500mg q4h to help for pain but reduce just little from 10 down to 8 for a short time enough to get out of bed to get something.  Ice pack at armpit, heat pat at lower back but just reduce the pain from 10 down to 9 only. No appetite. Eat lentil and rice porridge but indigestible and have to take Pepcid. All symptoms prolong until Friday 1/15/2021 around 1pm. I pushed myself hard to get up to drive to employee health for testing which I missed on Thursday due to unable to get up. After that the symptoms down to moderate that I able to report CDC. I wonder why 2 dose is so horrible to me.

Sweating, chills, headache, body aches and fatigue. The symptoms began to decline approximately 24H after vaccine but headache, mild nausea and extreme fatigue continued.  I felt so bad that I missed 2 days of work and got a COVID test to be safe, as I am a nurse, results were negative and employer was made aware of reaction.

The left arm felt like battery acid, hurt super bad. Felt like an outer body experience. Was given Benadryl.  Was having a problem clearing her throat. Felt weird by her bellybutton, felt like she had on a corset on. Rash developed at sternum and bellybutton. Went over to her ER at work. The knee to the hip felt like she had cement on them. Her tongue started to swell. She was wheeled up to tramum2. She blackout at some point.  Her body was doing one thing and her mind another. She had EpiPen stat.  Right was twitching like Parkinson&#39;s.  After 1 1/2 she started feeling a little better. 69/43 bp recorded. The next few days she felt like she had Mono.

Redness, pain, and swelling at injection site that has continued to worsen even after 48 hours.  Could not perform regular activities of daily living. I could not drive home from work the day after the injection because the adverse reactions were getting more severe, especially after the 24 hour mark.   Treatment: treated my symptoms at home with medications (I am a nurse),  after researching possible adverse reactions. I figured there was not anything someone else would to treat me besides treat my symptoms.

I felt fine until noon when my arm became sore, which I expected to happen so I took Tylenol.  By mid afternoon, my 4th and 5th finger on my left had began to tingle and I was having difficult typing with that hand on my keyboard.  By late afternoon, the left side of my face began to tingle like paresthesia.    I took more Tylenol at dinner but the sensation in my face lasted until I went to bed around 10:00.   I woke up in the night and my face felt fine but my 2 fingers were still tingling and I felt like I had no control over them.   When I woke up this morning, I took to more Tylenol and the symptoms have subsided. Also, when the nurse swabbed my arm with alcohol, I asked?Isn?t that a little high for the injection, and he said no?it?s right in the deltoid.   It felt like the injection site was close to the bones in my shoulder but that may have had nothing to do with these symptoms.

                                                One week after the vaccine I was find until....I got out of my car after driving and started staggering and could not function.  Severe dizziness, heavy headedness , nausea and vomiting and a horrible headache.  My husband had to physically muscle me back to my car. He wanted to take me to the ER and I would not let him because of the waiting room is full of COVID positive patients.  I threw up along the way home and multiple times to the point I had drive heaves.  I am a Registered Nurse and felt the symptoms I were experiencing were Vertigo.  I had one bout with Vertigo in 2015 and it was extreme.  I had Meclizine on hand and and took one tablet and slept.  The severity of this was so bad I could not walk unassisted or sit up without falling over. After 6 hours of sleeping I got up, dizziness continued, and vision a little off.  I still do not feel 100% I have had a headache since.  It never dawned on me this could be from the vaccine I had taken a week before.

A 54-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 30Dec2020 14:28 at the 54 years old at 0.3 mL single for where she works she was exposed to patients who need rehab that were exposed and getting COVID.  The patient medical history included Primary Essential Tremors and ongoing (had these for about 10-11 years. Her mother and grandmother also had them. Normally they were very fine, small tremors that people didn&#39;t notice. She can hold and turn her head and hide it) and Sulfa drug allergy (would get shortness of breath). The concomitant product was none. The patient previously took flu vaccine and experienced preservative made neck twitch and joint sores. Yesterday the patient got the COVID Vaccine and had a pretty significant adverse event. She was calling to report it and to see if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. The patient was also a licensed speech pathologist. She received the vaccine yesterday at 2:28 PM. She was allergic to Sulfa drugs and would get shortness of breath, so they wanted her to wait 30 minutes for monitoring. She was feeling giddy on 30Dec2020, but she ran into a friend that she had not seen before quarantine, so they were talking. It was exciting. After her 30 minutes she went to her car and felt a little funny. She thought she was hungry so she ate half a banana and had some water. She had an appointment to get to so she started to drive off, and by the time she got to the interstate she was feeling funny. She got on her left side, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face on 30Dec2020. This was like the precursor. Then on 30Dec2020 her face started to go numb. It felt like a dental block you would get with Lidocaine. It went from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips. It was midline on the left side. She was breathing fine. She was trying to figure out if she should pull over or call(Number), but her airway did not close up. Her upper esophageal sphincter got tight and felt funny like she was going to throw up. She drove to the hospital close to her house which is affiliated with where she got the vaccine. She normally had primary tremors, small to where people do not notice. But her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs on 30Dec2020. She looked like a bobble head. But she could still breath. They took her right in and they did an EKG to make sure it was not her heart. Her blood pressure was up on 30Dec2020, she assumes for being stressed. They monitored her. They gave her Pepcid and Benadryl. She did not want any nausea medications. She stayed for about 2 hours and slept some from the Benadryl. Her face slowly became less numb. The numbness went away started from her lips and outward to her check and temple area. Then it just felt funny. When she touched it, which she never lost sensation, it was like, whose face is this? It was strange. She is not numb anymore. It took a while for it to go away, and it still felt weird. When she woke up this morning it was completely gone. She had recovered completely from all of these things. The only thing she has now was some transient nausea. It was very mild. It comes and goes. It had improved. She had not taken anything for it.  The events Feeling funny, her face started to go numb, upper esophageal sphincter got tight, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, were all assessed as Medically significant. The outcome of the event Nausea was recovering, the events Felt giddy, blood pressure was up, Stress was recovered on 31Dec2020, the other events were recovered on 30Dec2020.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that the events Feeling funny, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Face started to go numb from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips, upper esophageal sphincter got tight , whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, Nausea, were related to the product BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events. The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

And neck pain... cervical radiculopathy in the L arm... pain and pins/needles into L thumb. It reached its peak with 4 nights of disturbed sleep starting on the date mentioned. I didn?t keep track of the symptoms other than that because I didn?t initially associate the symptoms to the vaccine until early this week. Symptoms have since improved and are (almost) resolved; I was advised to have the the 2nd vaccine today as scheduled - which was recommended lower on the deltoid and on the opposite shoulder.

Next morning the palpitations and fatigue went away but I start with a rash and very itchy and noticed my face swelling up. I took some prednisone I had home and Benadryl and went to the ER. They monitored me and medicated me and told me to keep with the Benadryl. On the 24th I started with the rash and on the 26th no more rash. My second dose is scheduled on the 13th and I will see my PCP on the 12th to decide if I should have the second dose. I am not allergic to anything and thought I would die on 12/24. I was swelling up in less than a minute after I woke up it was awful. I also have a consultation with an allergist on Tuesday  before the vaccine.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 08Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 54-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in deltoid left on 29Dec2020 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing sleep apnoea (diagnosed about 3-4 years ago, wear her CPAP religiously), Hashimoto&#39;s hypothyroid, and chronic low vitamin d (lack of sunlight). Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from 2016 and ongoing for Hashimoto&#39;s hypothyroid, ergocalciferol (VIT D) from 2018 for chronic low vitamin d; lack of sunlight (She did not take it religiously, but was supposed to take it everyday). At 10:30 AM (29Dec2020), she started to get cold and shake. She thought that this was insane and it was in her head. It became so severe she could not use her computer her hands were shaking so hard. She went back up to where they were giving vaccines, they took her temperature and it was 100. It had been normal the morning before she got the vaccine. Her heart rate was elevated at 100. They put a blanket on her and said they wanted to watch her for 15 minutes. In that time her fever went to 101 and her heart rate was 110. They took her to the ER. She was there for 5 hours. Her heart rate went to the high 120s. They did a 12 lead EKG. Her temperature had gone to 102.6, which was the highest. They gave her a liter of Normal Saline. She also had a headache, backache, and felt nauseated. The liter of fluid helped, no doubt. She was not admitted. She was wiped out the next day (30Dec2020) with aches and pains still. Their concern was they said they did not give her epinephrine because her heart was too high. She had no breathing issues. Just extreme cold. At one point she had woke up in the ER (29 or 30Dec2020) and her chest was hurting, she knows from her heart rate being too fast. She was so cold. She had on 6 blankets. The next day (30Dec2020) she still had the aches and pains, she was tired, and had brain fog. It all went away on 30Dec2020. She had nothing after that. What scared her was the heart rhythm. The ER doctor says its not great, but felt that getting the second dose was better than her having COVID. The Electrophysiologist she saw, said she was unsure if she should get the second dose. The hospital said that for this next dose, they would give her the injection, wait 15 minutes, then send her home, expecting that she would have the same thing happen. When after the first dose, she was in the ER on a 12 lead EKG with an intravenous (IV). She had no arm pain the whole time. The reporter assessed all events related. She felt fine prior, walking in to get the vaccine. But she was much better the next day and recovered completely. She was just worried about the second dose. The outcome of events was recovered on 30Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I waited for 30 minutes; I walked to my car and didn&#39;t feel well; I thought maybe I was hungry I ate 1/2 banana and drank some water. I started to drive home.  It felt like a huge cold railroad spike was being driven up the top of my shoulder to my neck, it was a cold sensation anteriorly and posteriorly on my neck.  Then my face (left side) started to go numb, it started just about the top of my left ear and went all the way to my lips. It stopped midline.  It felt like a dental block.  I could still swallow and breathe.  I started shaking, felt nausea, my upper esophageal sphincter started to spasm.  I kept checking my tongue and airway to see if I should pull over and call 911.  I drove to the ER.  My left side of face was numb, I was trembling, tremoring.  They gave me small dose of IV Bendadryl (12.5 mg) and Pepcid, I slowly started to feel better and the feeling came back to my face moving from midline lip to cheek.  It still felt &#34;funny&#34; but much better.  I was in the ER for around 2 hours. I have had more tremoring since my vaccine in my neck and hand (I do have primary essential tremors but it is tremoring much more now) and more neck pain (could be due to the increased tremors)

I woke up again at 6:30 with the same horrible headache not relieved at all by Maxalt so I took another dose. I had vertigo so I went back to bed. I woke up at 8:00 still with the horrible headache and vertigo but had horribe nausea. I never vomited. I felt weak all day, had no appetite and my neck felt very stiff all day. In the evening my knees were aching. The next day I continued to have a mild headache and neck stiffness.

                                                On Sunday, January 17, 2021 I started having severe joint pain in my wrists, elbows, knees, hips and shoulders. Along with aching all over. Over the course of the day, I started to feel bad. Then on Monday January 18, 2021, in addition, to the joint pain, I started feeling disoriented, dizzy like spells of vertigo.  I went to my PCP who did lab work and all was normal. He said it muse be delayed reaction to the vaccine. Later in the day, I was having difficulty putting words together and more dizzy and very lethargic. I laid down and slept until the next morning. (Tuesday 1/19/21) On Tuesday 1/19/21, they symptoms were improved but still had some dizziness. On Wednesday 1/20/21, the symptoms have improved except for an occasional dizzy spell.

                                                was extremely tired and could not stay awake fell asleep at 10 am for 5 hours to wake at 3 pm with slight low blood sugar , known by slight tremor in hands and body and also resolving  30 min after eating proteins and drinking orange juice. A few hours later around 5pm began getting headache, ate dinner and did not resolve so I took 100mg of Tylenol . could not sleep and was awake until 1am woke at 930 am with low sugar again resolved after eating and drinking orange juice. Had a headache less severe only took 500 mg of Tylenol it resolved. Stayed awake all day was fatigued. no other remarkable symptoms the rest of the day. the next day was about the same only less severe and by the fourth day I only noticed being tired during the day. I think it resolved completely by the 7th or 8th day I lost track due to my step mother coming out of rehab after having had COVID  in December.  as I write this I am fine and it is 1/22/21

Walked outside took elevator to the car felt increasingly more dizzy and weak. Got to car and started it, drove a few feet then knew it was dangerous to drive. parked and called My husband. He alerted people he knew . I then called 911. Symptoms progressively worsened. Thought I was going to code. Went to Er by ambulance. Trembling, dizziness, fast heart rate continued. Felt like i was going to die and my heart was going to jump out of my chest. In emergency room, they did an ekg and chest X-ray which were normal. They did some blood work. My potassium was very low ? 3.3. My TSH was 0.05; glucose 108;auto absol basos 0.1. Other results were normal. They told me the reaction was due to my low potassium and TSH levels. ER doctor recommended to change my levothyroxine dose with my pcp. Was in ER from approximately 1 pm - 6 pm on 1/7/21. They had me drink potassium and sent me home. Some symptoms subsided but still felt weak and dizzy when I left.

                                                On March 16, I was sitting in a chair next to my kitchen counter when I felt like my body was being thrown.  My head was thrown forward and I hit the counter hard and sustained a large contusion above my left eye.  The room was spinning and I was dizzy for the next few hours.  I never lost consciousness but had no control of my body for the few seconds of the episode.  The episode was sudden and violent and I was just sitting when it happened.   I spoke with my physician who diagnosed me with having experienced a Tumarkin otolithic crisis.  He has instructed me to wear a helmet and not to leave my home.  He is also recommending that I have a labyrinthectomy to treat the symptoms.  While I have a history of vertigo, I have not had any dizziness for more than a year.   I now feel dizzy on and off most of the day.

Location of numbness is in the area of the Right temple upper cheek bone easing toward ear.   By 2:00 pm that day was experiencing  a dull headache centering on my temple.  I went home from work to lie down.  The headache and numbness lasted into the next day.  At the time of this report 8:57 pm on 1/13/21 the numbness is still there.

                                                Patient became lightheaded at approximately 11:10 a.m. which was 9 minutes after administration of the vaccine.  The patient had expressed some anxiety about receiving the vaccine but wanted to receive it. The patient complained of lightheadedness and we lowered her to the floor with feet elevated. Her blood pressure had lowered significantly (60/40 approximately). Patient began to feel better and sat back in her chair. She again began to complain of lightheadedness and was lowered to the floor with feet elevated once more. Patients stayed in this position for several minutes. When her blood pressure was rechecked, it had risen back to 118/78. Patient felt much better and also ate some crackers and drank some water. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was checked a final time in a seated position after approximately 20 minutes and her blood pressure was 118/82. Patient reported having an event like this 36 years ago after her first visit to an OB/GYN and was similarly nervous that day. Patient was counseled extensively on preventing future lightheadedness and signs of any vaccine related adverse event. After approximately 45 minutes of observation from the event, patient was driven home by her husband.

Waking overnight last night (AM of 1/16/21) with right hand numbness that lasted for some time.  Extreme, extreme fatigue- the worst lasted 48 hours post vaccination.  Still continuing but not as severe as the first 48 hours. Body aches, particularly (but not only)  right hip and knee that have arthritis- worst sx ~ 36 hours post vaccination.  Ongoing intermittently. Heart palpitations but unable to determine if related to vaccination. Chest pain, mid-left sternal, intermittent, ongoing.  More of a muscular pain/discomfort.  Note: for 1st injection had some similar &#34;side effects&#34; but also some that were different.

Surgery was in 2017 and never had problems and they stated heart was compromised and maybe this is your reaction to the vaccine.

On 12/26/2020, the area on the left arm where the vaccine was administered started to get sore again, numb to the touch, and was throbbing sometimes. She reported that when she raises her arm up, it feels like something is tearing and sometimes feels weak.    On 12/27/2020, she woke up with vertigo which subsided but has been lightheaded ever since and feeling off-balance. She also reported to have loud noises coming from her ears described as hissing sounds. This has been constant.  She noted that years back, on two separate times she received chemotherapy treatment which really affected her ears. It felt like there was pressure and same kind of noises.    She is pending occupational health follow-up.

Approximately 2.5hrs later developed generalized muscle aches, tired, chills.  Next morning muscle aches were less, new headache and dizziness. took Tylenol which helped, about 5 hrs later symptoms worsened, improved with sleep and Tylenol.   Awoke this morning with some chest pain similar to initial response, some headache and dizziness, improved with Tylenol,  now returning (noon).  occasionally feels like I need to take a deep breath.  I believe its mostly muscular pain gets a little worse with deep breathing.  Sent home from work day of vaccine, worked partial days next 2 days

I went to work on 12/28 but woke up 12/29 with a low grade fever and felt like my throat was on fire.   so on the 29th I went and got a Strep and flu test which were negative.  I was feeling so bad so on the 6th of Jan do I went to the stand alone ER and got a chest xray and CT scan which revealed I did have pnemonia.  I went back home  but was feeling worse and was taken to and admitted in hospital for 2 days.  Initially I was admitted into the COVID unit but never was diagnosed COVID positive so I was moved off the COVID unit.  I was given albuterol pills to try to help with the symptoms but didnt work causing me to have to be admitted and was given several doses of steorid and other antibioics and had to use O2 at night because my stats kept falling.

A 56-Year-old female consumer (patient) reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1686), via unspecified route at left upper arm on 12Jan2021 about 9:15am at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type was hospital. Medical history and concomitant drugs were not reported. Weight: 175-180 lbs. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Past drug included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) been using the product more than 10 years and never had a problem with it, she didn&#39;t think that was related to her experience. Patient received first vaccine yesterday 12Jan2021. 45 minutes after receiving vaccine (12Jan2021 10 AM), she developed hot flashes in sternum (flushing sensation in her sternum or upper chest area. It was like when she had a dye injected), anxiety, dizziness/ light headedness, muscle weakness, significant dissociation, depersonalization, shakey, mild nausea, arm pain. The patient explained that this was why she was in the MRI scanner (Jan2021). This came a couple of times yesterday and had not been experienced this today (13Jan2021). It (dizziness) was ongoing and sporadic and had happened couple times yesterday and today. There were a few hours yesterday 12Jan2021 where she felt like herself but then it all started again last night. The patient reported feeling disassociated from her body, this was within about 20 minutes of the flushing and went in and out of being more or less alarming. She stated she felt disconnecting from where she was and space she was in, mentally. She knew where she was but could feel no connection to where she was or her body. The patient would touch her hand but couldn&#39;t feel her hands, it was like they weren&#39;t hers. This was during the half hour of the events occurring. She had mild nausea, this started not long after the flushing and it came and went a little bit but it was not too troublesome. The patient felt disconnect from her body and had shakiness like her lower leg feel shaky and weak and tingly. This happened on and off since the episodes started. The patient reported she slept great and had a few hours yesterday where she felt good. Her arm was tender, this might have been yesterday but she thought it was this morning and was only tender to touch. The hand on that same side was painful, but not unbearable, just uncomfortable. The patient apologized for being emotional and tearful. She felt completely overwhelmed. She couldn&#39;t believe that she put herself in this position and she was perfectly fine before the shot. She did contact her doctor. No AE required a visit to emergency room/ physician office. There had been no treatment, she didn&#39;t know what to do. She remarked she was not going back for the second dose. Outcome of event dizziness was not recovered, and the rest of events was unknown.

A 56-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 15:00 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine in a skilled nursing facility or long term care facility. The patient received no other vaccinations recently. Medical history included attention deficit disorder diagnosed at least 5 years ago for which the patient was taking Ritalin; hypothyroidism diagnosed a long time ago, probably 10 years and depression diagnosed a long time ago, probably at least 25 year, she takes a cocktail of anti-depressants for this (no further details provided about her anti-depressants). The patient also had a similar reaction of blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function/eyes could not focus before when her doctor put her on an antibiotic (unspecified). The patient was also very overweight. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN; lot: unknown, expiry: 28Jul2021) for attention deficit disorder and the patient takes a cocktail of anti-depressants (unspecified) for her depression. The patient received the first dose of the covid vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 3 PM and by 5PM she was experiencing bad headache, fever, L arm (injection site) pain that was severe. Later that evening she had blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function. She also got a fever of about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, was dizzy and her eyes could not focus and were almost like double vision but not quite, it was hard to explain. She just remembered that she had a similar reaction with her eyes before, when her doctor put her on an antibiotic. She cannot recall what antibiotic that was. The patient also experienced dizziness on 11Jan2021. The patient treated her side effects with ibuprofen and most of these improved. The injection was given in her left arm, her non-dominate one. She says that the pain was so bad it woke her up, and she doesn&#39;t take any pain meds, but that was really bad. She says that she took some Ibuprofen (lot: P113671, exp: Jan2022), about a total of 800mg over a few hours. Her fever had started pretty fast, by 05:00PM on the 11th, and it was better after taking the Ibuprofen, as was her arm pain, and headache. She says that the dizziness went away probably around 02:00AM the following day (12Jan2021). She says her eyes can focus again as well. The patient thinks that these effects are medically significant, mostly that her eyes were not able to focus, it was very scary. The patient stated that the purpose of this call is to have this documented, and possibly find out if there are recommendations that she should not get the second dose, since she had to call out of work because she couldn&#39;t function. The outcome of the event &#34;blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function; eyes wouldn&#39;t focus, couldn&#39;t function&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date and dizziness recovered on 12Jan2021 at 02:00. The outcome of the event &#34;she had to call out of work because she couldn&#39;t function&#34; was unknown while the other events were recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 56-year-old female patient had medical history included attention deficit disorder; hypothyroidism and depression and she takes a cocktail of anti-depressants for this. The patient also had a similar reaction of blurred double vision and couldn&#39;t function/eyes could not focus. Based on information reported, the reported double vision and difficulty focusing eyes were more likely due to pre-existing condition (s); and less likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The rest events fever, headache, vaccination site pain and dizziness were likely causally related to the use of vaccine due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Approx. 45 minutes later she became flushed, felt lightheaded/intoxicated/giddy/silly while driving home. She said she was extremely hungry (&#34;like a big dose of steroids&#34;). She states her ears were ringing and when she laid down at 2130 she could feel her heart beating throughout her body. This AM she reports feeling &#34;hungover/groggy/nauseated&#34;. She denied any lip/tongue swelling, any lip or extremity tingling, difficulty breathing, any injection site redness/heat/swollen/painful area, fever, chills, or ever having a vaccine reaction previously. Spoke with individual w/pharmacy. Advised to report to VAERS. Not an expected reaction. Possibly related to aleve vs. covid vaccine.

Took 1000 mg of Tylenol; and I was feeling okay. Just arm was sore. Not extremely sore. 8 pm at night - started shaking; knees were knocking together; severe chills; and it took a few minutes to recognize what was happening - took temp. 99.4; took another 1000mg tylenol; went to bathroom and without notice -  puked; woke up an hour after going to bed with worsened chills; 10:30 pm - temp 102.4; too early to take more Tylenol and so took pharmacy&#39;s version of Nyquil. Slept through the night after Nyquil but woke up with chills continuing - temp 103. 8 at 4:30 am; and then sat at side of bed and took tylenol 1000 mg  and got up to go to bathroom and couldn&#39;t walk forward and felt my arm hurt really really bad; couldn&#39;t walk forward; I leaned against the wall and bounced against the next wall and kept walking and grabbed a bedroom doorknob and got into the bathroom and fell on toilet and then crawled to couch because I couldn&#39;t walk straight. Stayed on a couch for two hours and then it was gone. Fever and chills continued that whole day on 24th. Didn&#39;t eat/had no appetite. Christmas day -no fever. Felt shaky though - like I&#39;d been super sick. No appetite still. Felt woozy and shaky inside (felt shaky inside) and that lasted for several days.  Appetite still remains poor. 02 stats were low through all of it - four liters (up two liters than normal.  Contacted: a pulmonologist - Dr. and she helped with O2 questions.

                                                After being given the vaccine the patient was asked to wait 15 minutes before returning to work. After 5-10 minutes  she reported shortness of breath and an anaphylactic type reaction. Patient was administered an Epi-pen by a nurse and the facility, and reported feeling &#34;a little better.&#34; She was also given oxygen and put on a pulse oximeter. Her O2 sat was 99% throughout. She reported before that she had no allergies and no adverse reaction to a vaccine in the past, but after this happened she said something similar also happened in the past with a flu shot. Patient believes this reaction was due to anxiety and not an allergy. 911 was called and arrived about 15-20 minutes after administration and patient was taken to the hospital. A nurse called the hospital 2 to 3 hours later and they reported she was &#34;doing fine&#34; and would be discharged home later today.

Next afternoon, Jan 5, I got severe myalgias, fever up to 100, severe fatigue, went home after work and slept til the next morning, went to work, took ibuprofen, and the myalgias improved and felt better. But around 3 pm, Jan 6, I got mild vertigo. By about 7pm Jan 6, I noticed my L ear didn&#39;t hear well. I changed the battery in my hearing aide and cleaned it but It made no difference. I woke up on Jan 7 with severe vertigo and hearing loss. I did Epley&#39;s maneuvers with no effect. I have had similar episodes. I went to work, but gave up when I could not hear patients talking to me. I went to the Emergency Dept and got admitted. I was too unsteady on my feet. Audiogram showed profound hearing loss both ears and almost complete loss of discrmination in R ear. I was put on high dose steroids. Also having tinnitus (mostly whooshing sound of my own pulse). MRI negative. Blood work negative. Some mild improvement now, after 1 dose steroids.

List of meds: Pepcid - 20 mg 2 x/day; Satirazine - 10 mg 1 day per day; benydryl 25 mg - several times a day - took over the weekend (over the counter).

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EK5730, expiration date: Mar2021, NDC number was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm (also reported as upper shoulder) on 07Jan2021 at 11:30 30 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported she was feeling exhausted, freezing cold, slightly nauseous, and did &#34;not feel as zippy as she normally do&#34; on 08Jan2021. She wanted these effects recorded, and would like to know if they were normal, and would they happen to the same or higher intensity with the second dose. The patient further reported she had no adverse reaction on 07Jan2021 other than her arm hurting a little. Starting on 08Jan2021, she had felt exhausted like she could just lay down and go to sleep, freezing cold, and slightly nauseous. She had been reading and was sure or was guessing this was normal, but wanted to verify that. She was not running a fever as of yet. Every time she tried to get up, she just laid back down. She felt fairly decent when she woke up, these events started later at the time of the report on 08Jan2021. She would not say these events were life threatening, but the CDC patient vaccine record card said to call to report any adverse events. She was scheduled for a second dose on 28Jan2021 and at this time did not plan to change dosing unless event worsening would occur. The patient had the vaccination, because she was always coming into contact with people with COVID at work. The patient had no investigation assessment. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient was recovering from the event &#34;arm hurting a little,&#34; she was not recovered from the events &#34;exhausted/exhausted like she could just lay down and go to sleep, freezing cold, and slightly nauseous,&#34; while the outcome of the event &#34;not feel as zippy as she normally do&#34; was unknown.

                                                Approximately 4-6 hours post vaccine I experienced site soreness and felt my hands were stiff, felt swollen, especially the right. Within a few more hours my arm became heavy and I had some general muscular achiness. By approximately 11pm I had intense muscular pain on the back of my legs making it difficult to stand. It felt like I had been hit repeatedly with 2x4s. About that time my posterior ribcage hurt also. I couldn&#39;t sleep, turning frequently as my hips hurt. This is what I felt like when I had COVID. Intense pain.  At 0630 (1/14) I got out of bed and felt I was going to faint, was extremely nauseous (I did not vomit) and had a very bad, global headache. I had to lay down again. My temp was 100.1 orally. I could not go to work. I was able to take Tylenol. It helped the pain but two hours later my temp was 100.8. I could not get out of bed  until 6pm, I felt delirious when I tried.  I was able to go to work on 1/15. Of note, following my first dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer BioNtech Lot #EH9899 on 12/23/20) I had site soreness, heaviness of my left arm, T of 99.5 same day (about 10-12 hours post vaccination), and mild body aches for about a day.

Symptoms progressed to a patch of redness,diffuse and bumpy induration, and warmth measuring approximately 8x10 cm. Skin is intact with no pustules or vesicles. Indistinct margins. No symptoms or involvement of the inner aspect of the arm or axilla. No adenopathy. Have used topical Hydrocortisone and oral Benadryl with some relief, but symptoms persist now 6 days post vaccine.  Symptoms are enough to wake me at night due to arm itchiness and  discomfort.

A 57-year-old female patient received single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, lot number: EL0142, exp date not reported), intramuscular (by injection once left arm, below shoulder blade in muscle) on 13Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization (because of job). Medical history included two stroked from 1998 and 2005. Concomitant medication included oral donepezil started taking 3 months ago (Oct2020) for something having to do with muscles because of stroke. She takes a blood thinner, as she had 2 strokes; and takes muscle relaxers too. By 15Jan2021 (Friday morning) the patient was feeling bad, she couldn&#39;t go to work, she lost her taste and her smell, part of smell. Part of taste was back at the time of reporting, but she was tired and sleeping all the time (onset date reported as 15Jan2021). She saw her neurologist because she had 2 strokes, they referred her to Pfizer, as they said she may have already had COVID 19 with the symptoms she has, but as far as she knows, she didn&#39;t have it, she took a test with the center a month before giving the vaccine, she took the vaccine because of her job, because of the kind of job she has, and they wanted her to let Pfizer know she was sick. She doesn&#39;t know if she wanted to get the other dose, as she was not feeling well at all. She was laying down sleeping every day. Her doctor said to tell Pfizer what was going on. She still doesn&#39;t feel good the day of reporting. She still hasn&#39;t eaten a whole meal since 15Jan2021. She thinks she was probably getting better, but was getting better slowly, she has no taste, she was not able to eat, no smell at all, which was really not a good thing. She can&#39;t tell the outcome of no smell she thinks. She can&#39;t smell nothing at all. She can&#39;t smell what she was cooking. It was the same as taste, she thought that is probably why she can&#39;t eat, she can&#39;t taste what she was eating. Taste was improved, but not well enough for her, it is hard to explain, you know how you enjoy food, like how it tastes, and if you can&#39;t taste, you can&#39;t eat. She sleeps all day, she was up now, but is probably going to go to sleep, she feels tired and needs to lay down. She told her doctor she will call and see what Pfizer says, they will go from there. She doesn&#39;t know if she will have to go see if she has COVID 19, or what was going on.  No further investigation assessment was performed. The patient took a test a month before (results unknown). No taste was recovering (ongoing at the time of reporting) while outcome of other events was not recovered.

A 57-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number EL3284), intramuscular into the left arm on 11Jan2021, at 16:00 as second  single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included Obstructive sleep apnea from an unknown date, oligodendroglioma from 1996 (noted as history of oligodendroglioma status post resection 25 years ago with stable follow up and no residual deficits).  The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, supplements or herbal remedies. There were no concomitant medications; Patient was not taking any OTC medications, prescribed medications, supplements or herbal remedies at the time as well as in the period prior to her vaccinations.  The patient previously received BNT162B2  (lot number EH9899 ) on 22Dec2020. On 18Jan2021, at  08:00, the patient experienced bilateral feet, left worse than right, burning, itching sensation, which progressed up to her mid calves and to a slight extent in both hands, which was medically significant and had not recovered, as it was persisting. This was elaborated as follows: patient experienced one week following 2nd Pfizer covid-19 vaccine patient developed bilateral feet, left worse than right, burning, itching sensation. the symptoms progressed up to her mid calves and to a slight extent. The events were considered medically significant. Details were as follows: The symptoms were quite intense and interfered with her life, requiring gabapentin prescription for control of neuropathic complaints. Patient denied any significant weakness, low back pain, neck pain, balance problems, dizziness, bowel or bladder involvement. Patient saw physician who performed workup for common associated etiologies of polyneuropathy, which were negative. Patient underwent EMG/NCS which were normal, and subsequently skin bx (skin biopsy) to rule out small fiber neuropathy (results pending). The patient further described the incident as a week after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine, the patient experienced new onset bilateral feet burning that went into her upper legs, mid calves and to a slight extent in both hands. The burning was experienced more in the left foot than the right foot. Reports it was severe enough for the patient to reach out to her primary care provider. (PCP) to start Gabapentin for neuropathic pain. PCP ordered labs to rule out infection and other causes for neuropathy which all came back negative. Patient has no known underlying risk factors that would predispose her to neuropathy. Neurologist did an EMG which showed no evidence of neuropathy. The patient went into to the office, and she had a skin biopsy to rule out small fiber neuropathy. She does not have results to provide for the skin biopsy at this time, however, the neurologist feels if the skin biopsy is positive, there may be an association with the vaccine in regards to the burning pain the patient is experiencing. She is calling to ask if this is a reported side effect. Treatment was confirmed as gabapentin was prescribed by PCP, and the patient started on it a few days after the onset of the burning pain. Outcome was noted as it has not improved, and has not resolved. No  COVID tested post vaccination was noted. The outcome of the events was not recovered; the condition was persisting.  Causality for the events was noted as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association contributory role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) to the onset of events pruritus,  burning sensation, condition aggravated cannot be excluded.

A 57-year-old female nurse received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3249) injection at single dose via an unknown route in the left deltoid on 20Jan2021 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism. Concomitant drug included  ongoing levothyroxine sodium (EUTHYROX) started about 12 years ago as of 27Jan2021 at 75mcg once a day for hypothyroidism.  Patient had first dose on the 20Jan2021, Wednesday and the last two nights (as of 27Jan2021) patient had chills. Onset date of chills was 25Jan2021. She assumed it would be sooner than further out close to the second one getting side effects.  She also experienced weakness and was really really tired. Onset date of tired was 24Jan2021. She was unsure if she should get the second dose, or if she needs to contact her provider about this. She did not know if these are normal side effects or not. She looked at the side effect list, which said chills and headache, which she has experienced both. She also had dizziness. She used Flonase for the fluid in her ears. She thought the headache and dizziness was from fluid from pressure or something. The FLONASE helped with that. She had no fever. She was a week out from getting the dose and was wondering if she should still be having these side effects.  Headache/ dizziness and weakness started a few days after she got the vaccine. She thought the weakness started that Friday or Saturday. If she got enough sleep she was okay, but she would wake up in the middle of the night. She thought the chills were from the weakness. She was also jittery and shaky as part of the weakness. Patient was always being really really tired later in the day. She thought that if she were working full time she would be missing work and that was medically significant. Treatment included FLONASE and took paracetamol (TYLENOL) for the headache early on. The events (chills, weakness, tired, headache and dizziness) were reported as serious with seriousness criteria of other medically important condition. No Investigation Assessment performed. Outcome of the events chills, weakness, tired was not resolved. Outcome of headache and dizziness was resolved. Outcome of the other evens was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the events cannot be excluded.

The facility where COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at a hospital and anatomically located on the left arm. The patient medical history included acid reflux She has been good for last 2 months. She was on Pepcid but not anymore; uterine polyp removal in 2019 (reported as 2 years ago) polyps removed from uterine wall, it was done outpatient but they still put her to sleep, but it had took her 2 weeks to get over the reaction of being put to sleep, it was the anesthesia, it wasn&#39;t pain, but she was very tired and groggy after.

She even went to the Nurse Practitioner yesterday because of it.

She went to the Nurse Practitioner and she said it sounds like nerve damage. The NP did not do any test, she really just left the office hoping that it would resolve on its own.  Caller states that this is not going away.  She actually read to not even take Tylenol or Advil 2 days prior as it can lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine. That&#39;s why she didn&#39;t take Tylenol till Friday Afternoon on 22Jan2021. She toughed it out for 2 days. The doctor told her she can take Advil right now.

I was contacted via radio to aid with assessment.  Upon my arrival, patient reported that that she was experiencing slight difficulty swallowing, was feeling ?off? and felt ?like her head was in a fog?. Assessment of vitals revealed an intial vital signs of respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, pulse of 74 beats per minute, 97% oxygen saturation levels. Blood pressure was obtained prior to arrival and was reported as 121/74. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Clear S1 and S2 were present upon cardiac auscultation with no mumurs or gallops noted. Patient appeared slightly pale with a slightly hoarse voice. Patient did not have noticeable pharyngeal edema upon examination. Patiney had no increased work of breathing and was not using accessory Muscles for breathing. Patient was given a swallow test using bottled water and then solid food and demonstrated intact ability to swallow with no regurgitation, choking or drooling noted. Continuous oxygen saturation monitoring revealed 02 that never fell below 96%. Continuous pulse monitoring revealed a pulse that was between 74-79. Given the stability the vital signs, demonstrated ability to swallow and inappropriately labeled IM medication in emergency kit (ie three loose syringes were not drawn up by myself. Medications were labeled by hand with no expiration date, route or dose), I elected to give the patient 25 mg of oral diphenhydramine. Patient declined to seek emergency medical attention several times. Patient?s daughter was then called so that the patient could be driven home. Patient was advised to seek emergency medical attention if her symptoms worsened, she developed increased difficultly breathing or otherwise felt unwell. Advised to follow up with PCP within next 24 hours.

                                                Within an hour of receiving the injection I lost 100% of my hearing in my right ear.  Starting with some ringing, vertigo and then just silence.  I called the Pfizer hotline, and they took down some information and then directed me to call the COVID hotline which resulted in pretty much the same.  As it was Christmas day and the weekend, I waited to contact my Primary Physician on 12/30/20.  She saw me immediately and sent me to a Specialist the next day to see Dr. for my hearing loss.  There I was given an audiological assessment where my right ear was found to have moderately severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 01Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as Covid 19 vaccine; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 vaccination. Medical history included having something called Adult Still&#39;s which is bad Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she got the vaccine and was experiencing sever cramps in her legs and thighs, and muscle joints pain. She mentioned on a scale of 1-10 it is 20. The patient also experienced flu like symptoms which were body ache and extremely tired. The patient reported that she called because she received her first Covid shot on 17Dec2020 and she was really sick from then, she was talking like super sick. In Dec2020, she had muscle cramps, headache, no fever but like she had the flu. She has something called Adult Still&#39;s which is bad Rheumatoid Arthritis, so it caused her to go into the flare but she was still sick. She was still feeling bad. She was still having muscle pains in her leg. The patient mentioned that she had to go to the emergency room because she could barely move her leg. They told her that it was a combination of Adult still&#39;s and her Covid 19 shot, so they gave her some medications. They gave her Lyrica 75 mg, twice a day and it messed me up that she couldn&#39;t even function. So, now she had to come home from work and now she was still having the leg cramps and just not feeling well so what can she do to feel myself better. The outcome of the event cramps in legs was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

Highest fever recorded was 101.8 the next day (Sunday) around  4pm.  Didn&#39;t take Tylenol or Motrin.  As of writing this (Monday 12:07 pm) my fever is gone but headache and extreme fatigue remain. Injection site still sore and today I notice I have a very swollen and painful lymph node left axilla opposite injection site.  I had to call in sick today and possible will tomorrow if the extreme fatigue and headache don&#39;t go away.

                                                Received vaccine on Monday by Wed afternoon lower abdominal cramping and feeling very unwell.  By Wed evening had chills and low grade fever 99.4.  Called out of work Thursday.  Felt terrible.  Thursday morning lower abdominal cramping consistent and pain scale between 4-5 with occasional spikes to 8.  Also felt terrible.  Had body aches, could only lay on couch.   Called my gastroenterologist.  Office returned call late afternoon and stated probably from vaccine and if it worsens or fever to call primary and to fill out VAERS form.  Thursday evening had temp of 100.4 and started with a cough where it felt I couldn&#39;t take deep breaths.  Only lasted a few hours.  Abdominal pain persisted.  Friday morning woke up and now have headache, but abdominal pain is now down to a 2 and I feel achy, but feeling a bit better.  Had to call out of work still too sick to go in.  No cough.  No fever.  Since I was feeling better my hope was since it was vaccine related that I would wake on Saturday and be totally fine, unfortunately, not the case.  Saturday morning abdominal pain same at a 2 and headache was on and off through the day into the night.  Still pretty much rested all day into the night.  Sunday morning much better.  Headache gone and abdominal pain down to a 1 and sometimes just vague.   Although I&#39;m feeling better my head feels out of sorts, kind of like my brain can&#39;t keep up with my eyes?  And new symptoms? right ear crackling and teeth on right side feel sensitive also,  pain under left armpit.  It&#39;s tender and lasts through the day.  Monday still feeling a bit lightheaded and fatigued and armpit pain still there but not worse and feel able to go to work to see if I can.  Tooth sensitivity also still there but ear pain gone.  Called primary doctor she suggests getting Covid test and have appointment for phone conference for Tuesday with doctor, also had  Covid test today at work  (was Covid tested last Monday also for work and negative) into Monday night head is still feeling &#34;off&#34;.  Tuesday armpit pain still same and dizzy head feeling same, mild abdominal pain comes and goes - Not bad enough to stop daily activity.  Spoke with primary doctor and she said side effects could possibly last this long and let her know when yesterday&#39;s Covid test comes in.........

                                                Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   I received the first Pfizer Vaccine (EH9899) on 12/19/20. A few days later, I felt like my head, on the side of my right ear, had a great deal of pressure in it and it felt &#34;funny &#34; but it did not really hurt. It was uncomfortable and distracting. I waited to see if it would go away. I noticed my hearing was decreased . On 01/06/20 when I woke up, my hearing was completely gone in my right ear. I could hear nothing out of that ear.  I had a noise in my head. Just a loud roaring noise. I had severe vertigo and could not walk across the room. I describe this as I felt like I was on a merry-go-round and someone was spinning me really fast. (continue)  Additional information for Item 18: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   continued:    I also experienced severe vomiting and could not stop. My husband took me to the doctor. Since I could not get in to my regular doctor that day, we went to an ear doctor I had visited a couple of years ago because that was the only person I could find to see me on short notice. I had regular hearing test in the past and my hearing was normal last time he checked it.  After doing a hearing test, he verified my Hearing was severely decreased in my right ear. I explained to him, I also feel &#34;foggy&#34; and I have problems concentrating, was having vertigo, and vomiting. I am not sure if that is because of the constant sound in my ear that distracts me but it is a definite problem and interferes with my work. I cannot concentrate. He started me on Steroids (Prednisone) 60 mg a day for 7 days, then 40 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for three days, Antivert 12.5 mg three times a day as needed, and Zofran for the vomiting if I needed that.  I have not experienced anymore vomiting and the Vertigo has been very limited. Mostly when I lay down now instead of when I stand up.  My blood pressure has also been slightly elevated, but it could be from the Steroids.   I was scheduled to take the 2nd Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21. Since I was receiving the high doses of Steroids, I was concerned that the vaccine would not be effective or may interact with the steroids so I went to my family doctor 01/08/21, for a visit. He said he would check and let me know if it was contraindicated for me to take the Vaccine on high doses of steroids. When I did not hear from him, because I had to take the vaccine the next day, I called the Pharmacy and talked to someone there and they told me the agency was still recommending you take the Vaccine even if you are on the steroids. I received the second Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21.  My hearing is now coming and going but I can hardly hear anything out of that right ear. . There is a constant noise, like a roaring, in my head and I still have problems concentrating. I have had no more vomiting and my vertigo has hot been as severe but I have experienced some at times.   I reported to the Pharmacy the day I received my vaccine, 01/09/21, about the things I had experienced this since my first vaccine. They took my information and said they would call me but today is 01/12/21 and I have not heard from them yet so I thought I would go ahead and report this. I am concerned this was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I return to the doctor 01/20/21 for a repeat hearing exam.   The Doctor expressed this condition could be a permanent and disabling  issue but currently being treated and will follow up with more testing.   I am also concerned about how the second vaccine affected me because I was receiving the high doses of Steroids at the time I received it.    I am sending this from a work email so if you reply, please reply to personal email.

She said she had a weird feeling that went around where her scar was from the surgery on the back of her left shoulder.

                                                I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in I was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive.; I had my 2nd vaccine at work early Sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day; I woke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise; I was covered in sweat; vomited; I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F; sore; I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).   This 58-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot  EJ1685 or FJ1685), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 09Jan2021 06:00 for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation on unknown date (1 episode), allergic to Keflex. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot  EJ1685 or FJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 22Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunisation.  On 10Jan2021 01:00 AM, the patient experienced: I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in i was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive (loss of consciousness) (medically significant), I had my 2nd vaccine at work early sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day (feeling abnormal), Iwoke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise (malaise), I was covered in sweat (hyperhidrosis), vomited (vomiting), I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F (pyrexia), sore (pain), I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response (seizure). No treatment required. The outcome of the events was recovered.   The events were described as follows: I am healthy RN with no active medical problems. I had my 2nd vaccine at work early Sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day, I expected this so was not alarmed and went to bed around 10pm. I woke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise and went to the bathroom in case I might vomit, etc. and I tried to have a BM. I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in I was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive. He yelled at me for about 10 seconds and I came to, I was covered in sweat. I asked him to walk me back to the bedroom where I again passed out, fell to the floor and hit the bed, then was unresponsive again for about 10 seconds then came to again and vomited. After this I felt completely relieved of my malaise. I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F. After this I was sore but otherwise completely okay, the next day I had a temp of 99.5°F. Today I am back to normal. I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response. The vaccine was administered at Hospital Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event &#34;began to pass out&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

                                                On Tues, 1/12 I started feeling like I was getting a cold  because I got the chills when I got home, but not the flu because I had my flu shot in Oct.2020     Wednesday 1/13 I left work because I started with vomiting, diarhhea , a light headache and my arm was real sore.  That continued on through that night and into the next morning.  So I had to call in at work that morning 1/14.  I finally started feeling better by friday night, 1/15.  The headache was gone and the chills were only slight and I could finally keep some toast down.  Before that I could only slightly keep liquids down.

A 59-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EK9231 and expiration date unknown), via intramuscular on left deltoid on 03Jan2021 09:13 at single dose for COVID-19 prophylaxis. The patient medical history and concomitant medications reported as none. The reporter is a registered nurse that reported that she had the first Covid-19 vaccine yesterday morning on 03Jan2021 and she had side effects. She reported that she had a fever, headache, and a real high heart rate that was in the 110&#39;s that last for lasted for hours. She said that she started with kind of chills and shakes 11 hours and 40 minutes after receiving the vaccine. One minute she was fine and the next minute she was feeling chilled. By the time she got home from her mother&#39;s house, which is a hours drive, she was not feeling too good. Her fever broke today 04Jan2021 at around 04:00 and when she checked her temperature it was 98.7 degrees. She said that 100.2 degrees was the highest temperature she recorded. The patient said that it was a mild fever. Her headache started about 22:00 03Jan2021. The patient said that she still has the headache a little bit and she has been treating it with Tylenol and it has gotten better. She said that she wears a fit bit that tracks her heart rate and she can hear her heartbeat in her ears and she could hear it going fast. Caller said that her heart rate was down to 98 beats per minute at 06:30 this morning. She said that her current heart rate was Body temperature. Caller said that her high heart rate had her very concerned. She said that it is not normal. She is supposed to go back on 30Jan2021 to get her 2nd injection. Should she still plan on getting the second part of the vaccine? The reporter assessed event real high heart rate that were in the 110&#39;s that last for lasted for hours as serious with medically significant. Other events were assessed as non serious. The outcome of the events fever and real high heart rate that were in the 110&#39;s that last for lasted for hours was recovered on 04Jan2020, outcome of the event headache was recovering, outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event high heart rate with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0615 am on 1/8/21.  Had no symptoms (not even injection site pain). At 2100 on 1/8, began to develop a lot of pain at the injection site.  Within 2 hrs of that time, I developed other symptoms, which include total body (bone and joint) pain (especially in my knees), and what I would describe as a &#34;bad sunburn type&#34; rash across my cheek bones, bridge of my nose, and orbital area.  Small raised bumps to this area, with swelling, and a feeling of pins and needles stabbing me all across my face.  My airway was fine, and at no time did I feel shortness of breath.  I was unable to sleep due to the bone and joint pain, and felt the need to walk continually (it was more painful to stay in one position). These symptoms persisted throughout the day (Saturday 1/9/21), noting at 5pm I described myself &#34;miserable&#34; to my friends and family.  All symptoms described above,  were at their most elevated intensity between the hours of 1700 - 0400. At 0400 Sunday (1/10/21) I felt a gradual release of the body aches, enough so that I could sleep until 0800.  At this time, 1300 (Sunday 1/10)  I note that I still feel &#34;flu type&#34; body aches, but constant pain has diminished in intensity by estimated 50%.  The sunburn type redness and swelling across my face/orbital area has also less by 50% (there is still redness, mild swelling, warmth, and some raised bumps across this area;  pins and needles feeling is gone).

                                                Six hours after being administered by the vaccine I started to feel soreness around the site. Within the hour it progressed to pain in my left upper arm radiating down to my lower arm. By this time, I had difficulty raising my arm and limited ROM. This continued for three days. The symptoms eased up a little bit but there was constant pain whenever I raised my affected arm. When I went to work on the night of the Jan third, I felt my arm hurting during the night. I took ADVIL for the pain and continued to do so. Jan 6 and 7 At night, I was awoken with excruciating pain on the same arm. This lasted for approximately a couple of mins. I sought a virtual consultation with my PCP who advised me to take ten days off from work. I am currently on medical leave. I haven&#39;t experienced the same excruciating pain as I had those two nights. However, my ROM is still limited because there is still moderate pain involved. I&#39;ve stopped taking Advil since it has started to upset my stomach.

                                                soreness around the injection site; Had severe arm pain; Had a fever on the night of the 31Dec2020 of 101.3; I have painful lymph nodes/the swollen lymph nodes under her right arm, the armpit area had swollen and painful lymph nodes; I have painful lymph nodes/the swollen lymph nodes under her right arm, the armpit area had swollen and painful lymph nodes; had joint pains/knees and hip joint pain; severe fatigue; muscle pain; This is spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 59-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Dec2020 14:15 at first single dose (0.3 cc, but really uncertain of dose) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID virus from Nov2020 to 2020 (The patient was not hospitalized. It was a mild case and lasted about 10 days. she had any positive antibodies at that time. Was off work for about 12 days and was very lucky to have had a very light case with fever, cough, cold, and super fatigue). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines at the same time or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccinations in past or events.  Caller reported she had the first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on the 30Dec2020 and having some side effect symptoms and her supervisor recommended for her to report these things, they are not life threatening, obviously, but things were still lingering. Side effect of severe fatigue started on the 31Dec2020 and lasted for 72 hours. It was so severe, now it is mild. The patient reported soreness around the injection site. Had a fever on the night of the 31Dec2020 of 101.3 and had that for 6 hours then it dissipated and was gone. Had never had a fever after injections before. Had severe arm pain that usually goes along with an injection. It started also that night of 31Dec2020. She had rolled over in the middle of the night and it hurt. That lasted for about 48 hours, but it has improved. Had some muscle aches since 31Dec2020 but that had improved and had joint pains since 31Dec2020. What was worrisome was the swollen lymph nodes under her right arm, the armpit area had swollen and painful lymph nodes, since 31Dec2020. The patient was still having that and that is why she was so concerned because shouldn&#39;t that have gone away after a week. Had knee and hip joint pain, but that had improved. Again, mentioned she had never had that before with an injection. The patient received vaccine at her workplace. Some of her coworkers got it the same day and no one else has this. Mentioned she did have COVID virus back in Nov2020 and wonders if this correlates with her getting the vaccine. Was not hospitalized or notified she had any positive antibodies at that time. Was off work for about 12 days and was very lucky to have had a very light case with fever, cough, cold, and super fatigue. This is the same way she felt back when she had the virus back in November. The patient was concerned about having these side effects would it be okay for her to get the next injection in 3 weeks. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. No further details provided. Outcome of the events Fever was recovered, of event swollen and painful lymph nodes was not recovered, of events knees and hip joint pain, fatigue, muscle pain, severe arm pain was recovering, of event soreness around the injection site was unknown.  The reporter considered the events severe fatigue, fever, swollen lymph nodes and pain under right arm, knees and hip joint pain as serious (medically significant). The reporter considered the events severe fatigue, fever, severe arm pain, muscle ache, swollen lymph nodes and pain under right arm, knees and hip joint pain as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 at a single dose in left arm for COVID-19 protection. Medical history included ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed about 18 or 19 years ago), COVID-19 previously and did not have side effects like this (the patient had COVID 19 last month and did not feel this bad at all. Patient was asymptomatic). Concomitant medication included ongoing liraglutide (VICTOZA), ongoing insulin detemir (LEVEMIR), both started about 2 or 3 years ago for diabetes Type 2. She received the product vial workplace policy, so it was not specifically prescribed to her. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 02Jan2021, and starting on 06Jan2021, she started with headaches, and muscle spasms all over her abdomen and back. Headaches was reported as worsened. The headache will not go away and even with Tylenol it still lingers. Muscle spasms all over her abdomen and back was reported as worsened. Her eyes were weak and hurting, started on 08Jan2021. She was so tired, she wanted to sleep. The tiredness, started on 06Jan2021, and it is like in the morning she is okay, but then during the day she just got worse and worse and worse. Her sore throat starting 07Jan2021 night, and this morning it was really bad. Throat was very sore was reported as worsened. She received no other vaccines on the same day at the COVID vaccine. The patient was wondering if those are side effects of the vaccine, because the patient had COVID-19 previously and did not have side effects like this. This is a non-serious report. The outcome of event eyes being weak and hurting, and wanted to sleep was unknown, outcome of the other events was not resolved.

                                                I received 2nd injection of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine at 1015AM on 1-12-21 and was doing great. I had taken one 325mg Tylenol and one  200mg Ibuprofen approximately 60 minutes prior to receiving vaccine (which is what I did prior to the first vaccine). I was doing great initially following the vaccine. I took another 325mg Tylenol and 200mg Ibuprofen when I went to bed at 2000  1-12-21. At 0300 1-13-21 I woke up feeling nauseated and when attempting to turn over to my right side I moaned loudly because I could not hardly move my left arm. My husband was woken and turned on the bedroom light and we noted a 3 inch bruise and large knot on my left deltoid at the injection site. He told me that I felt warm. I took my temperature that was 101.2 degrees. I took 650mg Tylenol and that time. At 0500 1-13-21 I was having chills, muscle and joint aches. I could not fully close my hands into a grip. My &#34;brain&#34; hurt, not a headache but literally it hurt to move my head. I would occasionally get a sharp pain in the front and back of my head. My temperature went to its highest at approximately 1500 1-13-21 to 102.5 degrees. I continued to offset Tylenol with Ibuprofen throughout the day. At 2000 1-13-21 my temperature was 101.8 and began to trend downward.  I went to bed and when I woke up on 1-14-21 I felt 100% better with just a little fatigue from the inability to sleep the day prior.

                                                With my second shot after eight hours of no symptoms, I had a fever of 101.8 and slept in a very deep sleep for 48 hours.  I woke to drink water and use restroom only.  On Monday morning I woke up soaked in sweat that smelled like vinegar and the fever was gone.  My first shot I had a little soreness in my arm only.

                                                Within a few hours of shot, I experienced EXTREME tinnitus (very loud), numbness in head, face and lips and hardening of lymph gland in left chest. This lasted for hours. Injection site pain only lasted about 24 hours.  Since then, I still have numbness on the right side top of head and intermittent EXTREME  tinnitus that interferes with my ability to concentrate, communicate and sleep. It comes and goes but the volume is beyond anything I have ever experienced. Then it goes away. The  right side of my head has stayed numb.   Will this go away? Should I get the 2nd dose or not?
