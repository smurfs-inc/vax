At 11;00 PM  I started feeling cold with muscles twitching in legs.  Got out of bed with difficulty walking and shaking and teeth chattering.  Shaking became more intense.  Put on more clothes and sat by fireplace.  Took 2 Tyneol and ate banana.  Continued to shake all over for 10 mins.  Shaking so much could not hold phone.  Subsided.  Startrd again lasting for 10 mins.  Subsided and finished at 11:30  PM.  Stayed up until 1;00 PM.  To bed and had difficulty sleeping.  Feel alright today.

                                                Patient was observed for 15 minutes after the vaccination administration, felt fine, and left the facility with her husband.  The 2 of them drove 2 blocks away to a restaurant to eat.  Midway through her meal, she reported that she started to feel &#34;funny&#34; like she was &#34;drunk&#34; or something, and felt nausea and hot/sweaty.  Her husband got her in the vehicle and drove to the vaccination facility,  When he arrived, she was obtunded and &#34;out of it.&#34;  No respiratory distress, No noted rash, but some clamminess/diaphoresis.  She was initially examined by FNP and cursory limited neuro exam while patient was seated did not reveal any gross motor deficits.  FNP called 911 and staff called for me.  When I arrived, patient was groggy, but responsive.  She was A&amp;O x3 and in no distress. Pulse 54, strong and regular (normal rate for her per patient--on a Beta blocker).  BP 120/74.  O2 sat 97% on outdoor cold air.  Patient was able to move all extremities equally and with equal strength.  Lungs CTA, Heart regular no murmur, abdomen soft.  Patient complained of continued malaise/grogginess and nausea, no vomiting.  EMS arrived, checked glucose, which was &#34;normal&#34; (I didn&#39;t hear the result) and patient declined transport.  I discussed ER evaluation vs. continued monitoring by me.  Patient and husband requested monitoring.  Patient stayed in the vehicle with her husband, I gave the husband my phone number to call if any worsening.  I checked on her 5 minutes later, then 10 minutes after that.  By that time, her adult daughter had arrived.  We again discussed continue family monitoring  vs. ER.  The family wanted to take the patient home to monitor.  Patient stated &#34;If I could just go to bed, I think I will be fine.&#34;  I called to check on the patient at 6p.  She had rested well and was improved.  She still felt a bit groggy, but otherwise was feeling better.  I called to check on the patient 1/29 at noon.  At that point, husband stated that she was &#34;back to normal. Symptoms and signs appeared to be consistent with a vasovagal response.  I suspected symptoms may have been prolonged by her Beta blocker

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reporting on the COVID vaccine and who explained that she had a reaction to the vaccine. She had the vaccine yesterday (18Jan2021) about 03:30 in the afternoon and by the time she got home, within the hour, her lips tingled and she felt funny, and her eye lids tender. There was no one to call by that time and she did not think it was severe enough to go to the ER so she just took a Benadryl and went to bed. The patient woke up and her face was swollen more than before (onset reported as Jan2021). She doesn&#39;t think she is at the stage of life threatening, she can still breath, but doesn&#39;t know what to do at this point. Should she take more Benadryl or contact her healthcare provider. The patient asked if this makes her ineligible for the second dose. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Went back to bed.  6 am still hurt everywhere, short of breath (oxygen concentration at 90 and sometimes below--thankfully I had oxygen as I sleep with it).  Running a temperature of 100., disoriented, heart rate at 115&#43; and I hurt everywhere.  8 am called Dr. &amp; left call-back.  1 pm tried Dr. again.  Told person on telephone and he told Nurse Practitioner.  They ordered nose spray because I mentioned I may have a sinus infection as my head hurt, my ears hurt.  I continued Tylenol every 6 hours on Friday and Saturday (all day).  I was able to get up and do a few things on Saturday.  Felt better on Sunday but still weak feeling.  Oxygen saturation back to 95-96 and heart rate under 100.

Felt a little  better next day but knew I was about to pass out so laid down in hallway where my husband found me. Got better as day went on and feel fairly well today.  Also had a mild case of night sweats last night. They were awful  when I actually had COVID - for about  2 weeks.

I attempted to report this on line at instructed on forms given me when I left the site. however the CODE that was to be sent to my phone never came.

                                                I think I am having a bad reaction to my covid shots.  The first shot was 1/31; a week later on 2/7  I started having headaches that travel around my head: some are behind my eyes and my teeth ache;  some more like migraines that go up the back of my head; some more on the top of my head or on the side.  My sense of taste changed.  My second shot was 2/27.  The day after I slept all day.  The headaches continued (I have had a headache of one kind or another since 2/7).  I had a tooth that broke off last June and was removed on March 8.  I thought the tooth was infected and part of the headache problems, but since then I have been having really bad fibro pain and for the week of 3/8- 12 I ran a fever, had chills and more headaches.  I was on amoxicillin from 3/8 to 3/14, but the tooth was not that badly infected and is healing well.  The headaches do not seem to relate to the tooth.  I have had a headache every day since 2/7 of various intensity and in different areas of my head.  I am extremely fatigued and need to nap some days.  My fibromyalgia symptoms are worse than they ever have been and some nights keep me awake.  I also muscle stiffness and spasms in my neck occasionally.  This is not normal for me. I saw a ARNP on 3/16 and she tested me for neurologic symptoms. Here are her notes:  NEUROLOGIC: negative findings: speech normal, mental status intact, cranial nerves 2-12 intact, gait, including heel, toe, and tandem walking normal, Romberg negative, muscle tone normal, muscle strength normal, rapid alternating movements normal, finger to nose normal, reflexes normal and symmetric   I have a video appointment with my primary care provider 3/26 to discuss this further

This 76-year-old female consumer (patient) reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number; EL8982, expiry date; May2021), NDC number, UPC number; unknown, covid19 vaccine manufacturer; unspecified intramuscular from 28Jan2021 to 28Jan2021 at single dose on deltoid left (left upper shoulder) for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history included ongoing antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus (Patient medical continuing: Yes, diagnosed around 19 years old), surgery on her feet on 04Dec2020, blood thinner. Concomitant medications included Warfarin (tablet), strength; 6 mg orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date ongoing at 3 mg (6mg 5 days a week and 3mg two days a week) and then at 3 mg (3mg three days a week and 6mg four days a week) for blood thinner. Laboratory test included INR (International normalised ratio) done on 04Feb2021 with result as (4.9; it is very high). Additional Information for concomitant products Warfarin: Her dose varies, new chart as of todays visit states to take 6mg on Sunday, 6mg on Monday 3mg on Tuesday, 6mg on Wednesday, 3mg on Thursday, 6mg on Friday, and 3mg on Saturday. Patient reported that INR should be a range just listen to number 2.5 to 3. My report they showed me that I am 4.9, that is big number. It is like 2 margin over. When I go to a surgeon tomorrow because I have wound on my foot from surgery that I had and it is not healing, it is just draining. I don&#39;t know if one has anything to do with other but I am very suspicious about it because my blood is too thin and my body me things don&#39;t heal the way they supposed to. Consumer stated, &#34;I have been hold for almost for 2 hours because what happens I left my number as requested for call back. I got a call back in another 2 minutes. When I press to receive a call it disconnected. So I had to start all over again. So it is been like 2 hours adventure. Firstly I need to say that someone I told to call a second number well disconnect me twice but I have something call a report number that the person I think it has same job title of you. I am not certain but her name is (Name) and she gave me report number. She asked me all the questions, I answered all the her questions including my 28Jan2021 Pfizer injection which was my first injection and I have question referring to my taking Warfarin and wanted to if there was interaction because I went to doctor today to see my blood was instead 2.5 to 3, it was 4.9 which is extremely high and the only thing I have taken, I have done differently was to have my Pfizer injection on 28Jan2021. Consumer stated, &#34;It is already in your system because as I said before I have report number. Should I give the report number. The person I spoke a long time ago that with I have been phone said that she information from my card when you they gave that card for you come like second time for the second dose or booster as I told this call.&#34; When probed for if the consumer call the Drug safety earlier: Consumer stated, &#34;That thing I am telling I spoke to someone by the name of (Name). She started asking by same question you did. That is why I am trying to tell you that person already asked me everything and give me report number. She wanted to transfer me because she says it is wrong department. I started here same information again. I have been on phone for far too long for this to be evening. The report number is &#39;number&#39;. Consumer stated, &#34;Concern is that I have Lupus and I take Warfarin. My INR report does part of what to do when you have lupus. You have blood measure monthly or whatever times that necessary. It is very high. It should be a range just listen to number 2.5 to 3. My report they showed me that I am 4.9, that is big number. It is like 2 margin over. I am trying to find out if the injection had interaction with warfarin that is medication I take. Blood thinner I take because I have lupus with antiphospholipid symptoms. I am trying to find out if the injection had any interaction with warfarin the blood thinner. That is the information I am trying to to get. When I go to a surgeon tomorrow because I have wound on my foot from surgery that I had and it is not healing, it is just draining. I don&#39;t know if one has anything to do with other but I am very suspicious about it because my blood is too thin and my body me things don&#39;t heal the way they supposed to. The consumer has taken the Pfizer Covid Vaccine: Consumer stated, &#34;That is the first thing I said. I told you and then I am telling about warfarin. I said I wanted to know if the Pfizer vaccine which I took on 28Jan2021 as I said that before if it had conflicting reactions with warfarin. I explained to you I have lupus and I also have antiphospholipid syndrome which cause me to take warfarin medication. I want to know if the Pfizer injection had any negative interaction with warfarin the blood thinner.&#34; When consumer informed about Medical Information: Consumer stated, &#34;That person transfer to me before. It was drop. So can you connect me to number. She tried to transfer me and I got nowhere to call just died. If I call I am gonna be on waiting for all over again. I already had experience consumer stated, &#34;I have already been answered all of your questions that is why I have a reference report number that I gave you. I have been answered whole time questions. I answered everything. I just wanna be connected to get somebody because I am tired of being on the phone.&#34; Is there a product complaint to report was no. Consumer was provided with the number of Medical Information number and was requested to select option 3, timings as and 8 am to 8 pm Monday to Sundays as per (EST). Investigation Assessment: Yes. She had the first dose of the Pfizer covid19 vaccine on 28Jan2021. She is nervous. She lives with lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, which means her blood is too thick. She is on a blood thinner, she takes warfarin. She is asking if the vaccine could interfere with warfarin. Today she had her INR checked and it was was 4.9. States a stable reading is between 2 and 3. The only different thing she has had in her body is the vaccine. Reports she is nervous and scared. She had surgery on her feet and she has a wound where a thicker scab came off, states it is draining but not drying out. She was thinking maybe this was due to her her INR being high. She will see the surgeon tomorrow. She put a bandaid on her foot where the open wound on her foot is. The next morning she checked her foot and the bandaid was wet. She put some peroxide on it. She read peroxide is not good for open wounds because it kills good bacteria so she used gauze and placed it over the open wound with tape across it. Last month her warfarin dose was 6 mg 5 days a week and 3mg two days a week. As of today she is to take 3mg three days a week and 6mg four days a week. Warfarin is 6mg tablet that is perforated, clarifies it can be broken in half. She does not think her new regimen that she was given today will bring her INR back in the range between 2 and 3. States her INR has never been that high. She will go back to see the nurse in two weeks to get her INR checked. She sees her patient medical record number listed on the card. She says pardon her grunts and moans because she grunts and moans when she moves since she is 76. She feels weird and her eyes are extra dry in 2021. She is nervous about the area where she had surgery on her feet, she does not want it to get infected. She thinks she had surgery on 04Dec2020 to have arthritis in her toes corrected. Outcome of events was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received  the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9266, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 23Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history included stomach problem and bleeding problems in her stomach. There were no concomitant medications. The patient said that absolutely everything was okay until she went to get the shot, and was even okay the evening of the shot, then it went down hill from there. She said nothing she has that is related to the pain in her arm, or that she feels she should provide. She did not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient stated that the injection area was a little sore and the area became bigger and bigger by Wednesday (24Feb2021). She woke up on Thursday (25Feb2021) and her elbow and shoulder was in pain, described as a dull pain. The patient stated she has a stomach problem where she can&#39;t take medicine. She started treating her pain with aspirin cream with Lidocaine. She said that its kind of worked, it didn&#39;t take it away, but more manageable. Now it&#39;s been 6 days later (01Mar2021), it was reported a deep deep pain in the point she can&#39;t sleep at night. She can&#39;t position her arm in a way that is not painful. It was getting unbearable. It transferred from shoulder to her neck on Friday (26Feb2021). It got worse Thursday evening and has been the same since. Patient said, &#34;I am not going to get the second shot if this pain does not go away or if I am going to experience this again.&#34; The patient was calling about a possible side effect and was wondering if anyone else had it and does it go away. She was suffering, she wanted to know if the pain she is in, that she is still experiencing will go away. She said that she had a deep muscle ache pain to the point she can&#39;t sleep at night.  Patient stated that her pain began as soreness at injection site that started Wednesday and then it just got worse and worse and became deeper and deeper just between her shoulder and elbow, a deep constant achy pain. During the day when she is using her arm she can kind of forget the pain, but at night there was no comfortable position she can put her arm in without pain, so she has not been sleeping the last 3-4 nights, she can&#39;t sleep, she was miserable. She said she would rather get COVID than this, it was ridiculous. As she has bleeding problems in her stomach, she can&#39;t take anything to treat the pain, so she was trying to use lidocaine on her arm, which did at first give some relief but no longer works. She said that the only number listed on the bottle was next to &#34;EXP date, LOT: 19C506, EXP: Mar2021 (as reported).&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                She got the vaccine, when she came home she started feeling the fatigue that she felt after the 1st vaccine.  She then started feeling very cold, laid down and watched TV.  She then had chills all night and did not sleep well due to that.  When she got up on Tuesday the chills were gone but had a slight headache off and on throughout the day, her temp was 97.2.  Throughout the day she would get warm spurts/hot flashes, as well as fatigue.  She did sleep that night, and when she got up yesterday morning still had the hot flashes and it was 94.2, and took it twice due to it being so low.  She was like that with fatigue and not able to sit up.  She went to bed, took some Tylenol and rested.  The heat feeling it started going away.  Around dinner time she felt more like herself, the headache was gone and her temp was 97.  She was doing pretty good, and the last thing she had was she felt on her cheeks and noticed a rash on her face, like a prickly heat type rash.  Before she went to bed she put Neosporin on it, and when she got up this morning it was almost gone but still has a tiny few bumps.   The arm itself did not hurt at all.    Feels that it is a stressful situation as to where to get the vaccine and having to travel to get it as it&#39;s not available in locations closer to their homes.  The people at the pharmacy were great, but had to travel and if it wasn&#39;t for her daughter she would probably not have her shot.

The pt reports that she received the first COVID vaccine several weeks ago and immediately afterwards she felt warm and had some difficulty focusing and walking. This resolved and she has since felt well. Today at 0800 she had her second dose of the COVID vaccine. About 15 minutes later she had an acute change in her mental status. She became disoriented and slow to answer questions. She also started having difficulty walking. She was also noted to be hypertensive with systolic BP in the 200s. She was subsequently sent here by the doctor at the vaccine clinic via EMS. Currently the pt is feeling somewhat improved and more back to her baseline. She notes that she still does not feel quite herself. Notes that her symptoms feel similar to her reaction after the first vaccine except much worse. Sates she takes Levothyroxine but no other medications. She last had her thyroid numbers checked in January and they were somewhat &#34;off.&#34;

After the 2nd one she had muscle aches, headache, freezing cold, and &#34;weird&#34;, and felt really badly then at 9:30 PM, 32 hrs after the 2nd vaccine dose she felt the a-fib started. She had not been in a-fib in many years. Cardiology had already recommended eliquis but she was holding off. She had diltiazem from 2017 that she tried but with out relief. They rate controlled her but she remained in a-fib, started eliquis, and she went home. For 2.5 weeks she had headache and chest pain, other muscle pain, felt horrible, until she stopped the Eliquis.  Since stopping the Eliquis, she still has occasional mild chest pain, and headache, and flushing.   Her current chest pain is left chest, not radiating. The quality varies, stabbing pain in a very small location at times, may be associated with eating.   She did have a stress test years ago and was &#34;fine&#34;.   She had a dental appointment planned that she had to cancel, she has moved it to May 4th.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8730) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 10:30 (at the age of 76-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing pollen allergy from an unspecified date and ongoing ribs sore from an unspecified date. The patient stated that the pollen was bothering her and that she had been taking Zyrtec in the morning and at night. Medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was also reported as none. Family medical history relevant to the event was reported as &#34;her son also had a seizure after the polio vaccine when he was 7 years old&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient denied any medications or medical conditions relevant to symptoms. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine and there were no prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EN202) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (at the age of 76-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient previously received the polio vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization and experienced seizure and the patient previously received the flu shot on an unspecified date (6 years ago) for immunization and 8 hours after the vaccine was achy, sick, in bed for 9 days. Developed bronchitis and coughed so hard she cracked her ribs. Stated her ribs were still sore at times to this day. The patient stated that she would never get another flu shot and that her doctor agreed with her on that decision. On 25Mar2021 the patient experienced headaches, dizziness, dizziness comes and goes but it affects her vision, numb, head feels fuzzy/fuzziness is constant and eyes are crossing. The patient stated that she got her second dose of the vaccine on 24Mar2021. She reported that after her first shot she was fine. She stated that she started having headaches and dizziness the day after her second vaccine and this had lasted for 14 days. It has gone on now for several weeks and was not getting any better. She felt her symptoms went in different degrees at different times of the day. She might go one day without a headache. Today her headache was more like a numbness all around her head. She stated that her headaches come and go, sometimes start when her eyes pop open in the morning or at 10 AM. If she was going to have a headache that day, it usually started by 10 AM and was a full-blown headache. Stated her head always fely fuzzy and woozy and sometimes she felt like her eyes were crossing. She stated that she never got headaches; not since her early 20s. Dizziness continued to come and go, but it affected her vision and she was scared to drive and have a wreck. She reported that the symptoms were driving her bonkers. She also reported that she had to hold onto walls when she walked. The dizziness did not go away even when she laid down. She was dizzy when sitting on the sofa. Her head also felt fuzzy and numb, the fuzziness was constant. She reported that she felt disabled and felt like she was turning 100 instead of 77. She cannot lay in bed all the time and wanted to know how long these symptoms would last. The patient denied any labs, testing or treatment relevant to symptoms. She had not been to the doctor or to the emergency room in relation to these symptoms. She stated that she thought about it at times. She stated that she would have to call an ambulance to take her since she was scared to drive. Yesterday she thought she was not doing so bad and drove to the store. She stated that while in the store, her dizziness had her to where she could hardly pay for her items. Stated that it kind of felt like she was drunk, but she was not drunk. The patient stated that her experience with the polio vaccine made her almost not get the COVID-19 vaccine for fear it would bring on a similar situation. The clinical outcomes of the events headaches, dizziness, dizziness comes and goes but it affects her vision, numb, head feels fuzzy/fuzziness is constant and eyes are crossing were all not recovered/not resolved. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after. The patient declined safety report, saying that she is stressed and anxious (2021), she just wants to be transferred for her question. The reporter considered the events fatigue aggravated serious and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as medically significant. The outcome of the events fatigue aggravated recovering; as for the events blood pressure raised, &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39;, lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired were not recovered; while the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 01Apr2021 (reported as 2 days after). The outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events fatigue aggravated and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as serious (IME).Based on the plausible temporal association and product safety profile, the reported events are possibly related to the vaccine BNT162B2. administration. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0773) via an unspecified route of administration in left upper arm on 04May2021 11:00 at age of 76-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Doctor wanted her to get it. Caller said that her doctor told her she wouldn&#39;t make it if she got COVID. Her heart couldn&#39;t pump very well and was very weak. Other medical history included a lot of allergies (They made her sit in a recliner for 30 minutes) and thyroid disorder. No further details provided by the caller regarding her thyroid condition. Caller did not think there were any other medical conditions that she had that would be relevant as she was pretty darn healthy. Family medical history relevant to AE: Not that she knows of. Daughter had the shot and was sick for 2 days. She had the Pfizer. No vaccine administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for thyroid from an unspecified start date for 20 years and ongoing. Got the shot 04May2021. Dry heaves on 04May2021: Didn&#39;t really throw up, but she had them all day. Still has them but not as bad. Nausea/ nauseated on 04May2021: It was actually kind of steady. Caller was able to eat and drink, not that she wanted to. She did not know what to do with herself. She was eating and drinking. She took TUMS [CALCIUM CARBONATE] and always had a cast iron stomach. Skin is so itchy on 04May2021: Skin started itching right away, that evening that she got the shot. She even used a back scratcher. It was all over and still felt the same. Treatment: Had taken diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) maybe once or twice and when she went to bed. She didn&#39;t take it steady. She did not take the TUMS steady either. Yesterday, she felt better, and currently felt worse again. Had a little more energy and was feeling good. Sore arm on 04May2021: Was sore right away, after the shot. It was still sore but it was better. It was not red or anything. Treatment: Took 1/4 of a paracetamol (TYLENOL), 325mg, so it was 12 or something. Weak on an unspecified date and did not feel well on an unspecified date. Her blood pressure was good and she has no fever. She also stated her stomach was upset 24/7. She didn&#39;t like the way she was feeling after the first dose (May2021). She just wish this would go away. She didn&#39;t feel good. 10 days was a long time to have a reaction. Tests: Recently had blood work and everything was normal. Even her thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) which she got tested for every month is fine. It was off but currently was regular. The event did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Her next shot was on 25May2021 and was scared to get it. The patient asked what would happen if she did get the second dose. The outcome of events &#34;skin so itchy&#34;, &#34;nauseated/nausea&#34; was not recovered, of events &#34;dry heaves&#34;, &#34;sore arm&#34; was recovering, of &#34;TSH is off&#34; was recovered, of other events was unknown.

She had been diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Disorder prior to the vaccine.  She seemed to recover from this episode but 2 months later she went from  Mild Cognitive Disorder to Hallucinations, Delirium and a full blown Advanced Lewy Body Diagnosis.  We are unable to explain how she has progressed to this degree and wondering if the vaccine could have accelerated her path.  She is currently in a Facility and will have to be moved to 24 Care in a Memory Care Unit

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number was either: EL1283, CL1283, or LL1283) on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took pneumonia shot on an unknown date and flu shot in Oct2020 for immunization. Patient got the first dose of the vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 in the morning. On 11Jan2021 her arm felt tender where the needle went in.On 12Jan2021 late afternoon, she started getting hissing in her ear that was still there and had not gone away at all and she also had a constant humming in her right ear. By 13Jan2021, she still had the humming.  She saw an ENT on 13Jan2021 and doctor didn&#39;t know if it was correlated to the vaccine or not; doctor took some wax out of her ear and she seemed to get relief from the hissing for about 15 minutes but about 15-20 minutes later the hissing/ humming continued. On 14Jan2021, woke up with complete deafness in right ear. Immediately called ENT doctor and did a hearing test. Patient could not hear and they confirmed she had sudden hearing loss in her right ear on 14Jan2021, she had nothing in her right ear (as reported). They put her on 40 mg a day of Prednisone (20mg tablets) and so far, prednisone hadn&#39;t done anything: originally taking prednisone 40mg for four days and was taking two a day;  on 16Jan2021 when she was getting no relief and couldn&#39;t sleep due to the humming in her ear, she called doctor and was advised to take the 40mg together in the morning, she will take 40mg a day. On 19Jan2021 she took 20mg for four days and then decreased by half again. She was also advised by doctor to take 25mg Benadryl (UPC: 30048284 Lot: SPS023 Exp: Jun2022) at night.

She also asked  if there was a certain amount of time she should wait to restart in case the doctor decided she should not get the second dose; she also wanted to know if she should wait on the second vaccine and maybe start over in two months.She was concerned and wanted to know if she should proceed with the second shot. The patient underwent blood work on an unspecified date to see if she can receive contrast for an MRI. She never had problem with MRI contrast before.

No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event diarrhea was recovered on 29Jan2021; events chills and exhausted was recovering; event &#39;she has been able to eat, but nothing taste that great&#39; was not recovered; and unknown outcome for the other events.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing low thyroid and mostly it&#39;s food allergies. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 125 ug, daily for low thyroid. The consumer stated, I took the vaccine on Monday (25Jan2021), three days ago and as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I came prepared because I do have some reactions sometimes. Mostly it&#39;s food allergies but I guess was being prepared, so I took Benadryl with me and I took it out of the packet. When probed for the treatment, consumer stated, &#34;I just took Benadryl as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I was prepared and I took my Benadryl with me and we stayed there I guess about 45 minutes until I felt better it would have been 12:15 and I was fine.&#34; The consumer stated, &#34;I have been trying for two days, that was in my arms hurting a little on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and then today (28Jan2021) around noon I was feeling a reaction again. I had the tightening in my neck and around my mouth area that&#39;s where I usually get the reactions from, but for two days I have been fine and I did not eat anything on an unspecified date in Jan2021 out of the way to give me a reaction to it. Now I took 2 Benadryl and it subsided but it&#39;s still tight around my neck and a little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness. What am I supposed to do? After I took this shot on Monday today is Thursday and I am having the same reactions that I had when I took (incomplete sentence) (pending clarification). The outcome of the events as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange was recovered on 25Jan2021, little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness and tightening in my neck and around my mouth area was not recovered and other events was unknown.

                                                weak feeling; heartbeat climb up and up; unnerving; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 77-year-old female patient received dose 2 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EN5318; expiration date 31May2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Concomitant medications included losartan, escitalopram, and atorvastatin from unknown dates for unspecified indications. The patient received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (lot number EL1284; left arm) on 15Jan2021 at 11:00. The patient previously received codeine on an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced allergy. On 06Feb2021 at 13:00 the patient experienced a weak feeling and heartbeat climb up. The patient had a weak feeling, had to sit down and took her pulse with oximeter and her Apple watch. She watched her heartbeat climb up and up. She tried yoga breathing but could not slow it down. She was not sure how long this went on because it was very unnerving, but it reached as high as 105 before it started to go down. The beats went up, then down, finally started to keep going down. Once more there was a wave of the weakness through her before she stayed in the 73&#43; range. The patient was usually in the 60&#39;s. Since then the patient&#39;s heartbeats have been what is usual for her. During the episode the patient&#39;s husband found &#34;rapid heartbeat&#34; on the paper they received. The patient was concerned this happened a day after the vaccine, not within an hour. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient was not hospitalized and did not receive any treatment for the events. The outcomes of weak feeling and rapid heartbeat were recovered. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 77-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), intramuscularly on 24Feb2021 11:00 AM (at the age of 77-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had not medical history. the patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient waited the 17 minutes when they said to wait and then she felt to be okay at that point.  About a half hour after having gotten the vaccine, person got into her car. She went to drive home and became completely disoriented, forgot her name and where she lived. She drove to her old address. Friend called her at around 12:30 to check in on her. She was panicked, she was still disoriented, did remember her name, but had difficulty with her address and thought she had a stroke.  A friend made her pull over and asked her to call 911, but she wanted to go home. She was much better when she calmed down and the and determining that a stroke likely wasn&#39;t the case. The patient did not receive any treatment. No covid prior vaccination. Her second dose was scheduled for 18Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about batch number was not available and is going to be requested.

They had to put me into another room that was much cooler and put me into a recliner with feet up, ice behind my neck and on my forehead. I was pushing water so it was not dehydration, and I had eaten my normal healty breakfast also so not low blood sugar. This was my second shot and I had the same reaction with the first shot. It took about an hour before I could stand and walk again, but was still a bit shaky and faintly light headed for about another hour.

A 77-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 77 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included: cholesterol, spinal fusion L4/5, stenosis, allergies to medications, food, or other products: kefex, Zithromax, levofloxacin, oxycontin, methylprednisolone, Lisinopril, ezetimibe, Amlodipine.  She reported she has constant spiking of her blood pressure (BP) and lack of sleep for 37 days (average 1-3 hours daily), since the vaccination. She described the following: She has experienced &#34;dizziness, blurred vision at times, extreme and constant headaches, tons and tons of pain in her neck&#34;. She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function&#34;. When she &#34;lays down&#34;, her &#34;heart is racing so fast and [her] BP gets so high that it won&#39;t let [her] sleep&#34;. She feels like her &#34;body is going crazy&#34;. She &#34;cannot get more than 2-3 hours of sleep other than 1-2 exceptions&#34;.  Also, her &#34;BP wakes her from a dead sleep&#34;.  When she wakes up, she usually &#34;takes a rice [pad] and applies hot and cold to her neck, and she sometimes takes some Tylenol&#34;. &#34;Every time [she] wakes up, her BP [readings] are around 152/101 and 160/97. She has been in and out of the hospital for her high BP.  After the hospital, she called (Number) because her BP &#34;was off the chart&#34;. Her cardiologist ruled out heart issues. She did an &#34;echo, a stress test and EKG&#34;.  On 01Feb2021 she was admitted to hospital with 200/103 blood pressure. Ruled out cardiovascular &amp; placed on Amlodipine. Now 37 Days later with many visits to doctors, blood pressure remains high. Cardiologist ran stress test &amp; echo with no heart issues. Placed on many Blood Pressure Medications that also created side-affects (urination, flushing, dizziness, extreme headaches); Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol 25 mg, Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, Propranol 20 mg. Today, picking up yet another (Hydralazine?) as last-ditch effort. BP daily spikes remain high (160/99 and 175/100). Racing Pulse &amp; BP wakes me out of a dead sleep within 1-2 hours.

                                                She had been in her usual state of health until tonight. Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

                                                The 2-3 days after the shot my mom got a fever (over 100 degrees) and the chills which we were able to control with Tylenol for the most part. However, over the next 4 weeks, my mom gradually lost the ability to control her bladder function, and her ability to transition between sitting, standing and lying down w/o help. She also exhibited even more difficulty with walking than she did before (shuffling). My mother experienced pain all throughout her body, and the pain became as bad as an 8-9 in a range of 1-10. She struggled to raise her arms, reach her arms out, or grasp objects. She lacked energy, she would sleep for 10 hours every night, and she had difficulty concentrating and remembering what she was reading,

Then around 7:00 PM her arm started to get a little sore but kept moving it and massaging it.  She then could not move anything by 10:00 PM, and had gone straight to bed as she felt so bad.  She was dizzy, light headed, and these symptoms continued all night and all day Thursday.  She dozed to sleep off and on all day Thursday and was in so much pain, didn&#39;t have to move to have pain.  She is still having some pain today, but feeling much better.  She still is a little bit dizzy.  Feels as if she laid down she could sleep for a long time.  She has pain in her back area, her arms, her hips.  She did not take anything for her reaction as was told not to take aspirin and does not use other medications.  She feels exhausted and if she moves her arm too much and also her legs then they start to hurt.  Getting in and out of bed is easier today, but she could not get them over the bed to get in or out on Wednesday.  Her neck also hurt to turn.  She had similar symptoms to when she had the COVID virus in November/December.  She had been hospitalized for it twice, was informed that she had a stroke after she had passed out.

                                                I am 77.  I had the Pfizer vaccine, March 9th,  with a terrible reaction starting 2 days after.  I couldn&#39;t use my brain to think, to read with comprehension, to remember things I wanted to remember and had difficulty finding my words. This lasted for 3 days when the fog began to lift.  I also had some shortness of breath(SOB)  and very low energy.  The CDC has said that when giving the injection it is no longer necessary to aspirate (pull back on the syringe) which I was taught to do as a young nurse to ensure that you are not giving the injection into a vein (blood would appear in the syringe.) It is supposed to be given into the muscle which has plenty of veins so if you don&#39;t aspirate, how will you know if you are injecting into a vein? A week later, I ended up going to the local hospital ER because of the SOB and had Chest xray, EKG, brain Cat Scan and blood work which were all normal. I debated about getting the second shot but decided to get it as long as the injector gave the injection as I had been taught. Fortunately she was very experienced and agreed to inject me using the pullback method after I explained what I had gone through the 1st time. So for the second shot I had the sore arm but no other reaction. I think Dr is making a mistake about the pullback decision.  Do we even know what happens if the vaccine is injected into a vein? I am not certain if my first shot was injected into a vein because the injector never pulled back to check.  I have not heard of anyone else with my experience.

The events required an emergency room visit. She wanted to know if anybody else has been hospitalized for massive heart attacks and says that&#39;s what she was having. The patient had her second shot on 22Feb2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on an unspecified date; and outcome of the rest of events was unknown.

                                                allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine; 1st dose last 22Jan2021 - 2nd dose was on 08Feb2021; 1st dose last 22Jan2021 - 2nd dose was on 08Feb2021; doesn&#39;t feel good; one heck of a temperature; By doing what she did, if that negated the COVID vaccine/ That&#39;s what she was afraid of; redness and swelling in her right arm; redness and swelling in her right arm; feeling hot all over the body; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 77-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included weakened immune system because of the alcohol allergy (started while 19), and aches and pains. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (expiry date May2021) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 77 years old last 22Jan2021 administered on the upper righthand arm later clarified as upper right arm; and she was still going through that systemic reaction when she had her first COVID vaccine. The patient asked on regarding how effective the vaccine was related to receiving steroid therapy. Patient was advised by doctor to go to urgent care to have a covid test to see if she and husband were exposed to covid before the vaccines kicked in.  Patient stated that on an unspecified date in 2021, she still didn&#39;t feel well and was running one heck of a temperature (increased). Patient reported she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. She filled out the forms. Patient felt like she should be put in the hospital. She has a horrific allergy to alcohol. Each time she receives an injection it gets worse. She knew when she received the second dose that the third ingredient was alcohol. She thought about was worse, the virus or the reaction. Within a minute of taking the vaccine she had a reaction. She reported it at the site and was watched for a half hour. Her question was &#34;because she took prednisone immediately after getting the vaccine does that negate the shot?&#34; She was not asked the name of the steroid that she took. She was taking prednisone 20mg, 2 tablets as soon as she gets a shot then 2 daily Monday-Friday. It was still going through her system and it was reeking havoc on her. If she goes to the hospital they will give her Benadryl and monitor her. Patient stated that on 08Feb2021, she had an allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine. Patient stated that she had both COVID shots and had adverse reactions and took some medicine for the adverse reaction and now the patient was concerned it might mess with the shot, it might not work for her as it should. She knew that this was going to be a long process and she knew her allergies were rare, but they were there. She is allergic to isopropyl alcohol, even if it is in shampoos or liquid soaps, she gets reactions. She had her first COVID vaccine and she had her own hospital cleanser that she has with her at all times and she used it which was not a problem. For her second COVID vaccine, the nurse was naming the 3 ingredients that were in the COVID vaccine and asked if she was allergic to any. She said this last shot had alcohol in it, she sat with her husband next to her, and thought which was worse: getting COVID, the cases in the city are high, or having a reaction to the alcohol. She chose the latter. When it went into her arm she immediately knew she was getting a reaction. She had steroids with her just in case this happened. Each time the reaction happens, it gets worse. She said she sat for half an hour and has been on steroids until last Friday. She was supposed to be on them for days. On Friday, she was wondering if taking the steroids negated the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine and that&#39;s why she called in. She knew that this was rare and it was not something that the company going to say that the company know how to fix it. Patient worked in the health unit of a university as a hiring and firing people person. So, she was around it, but she was not a doctor or a nurse. So, she guessed the answer was no. Last week she received her second COVID vaccine. She said, she has got to get rid of 5 pounds, but it&#39;s harder to do that when you&#39;re older. She experienced the reaction from the isopropyl alcohol within her second dose of the COVID vaccine last week, 08Feb2021. She said she was still going through it and will for a while. When asked for the outcome, she said she couldn&#39;t answer that honestly. She said she didn&#39;t feel good (2021). Period. She knew that when she goes through this it takes, each time, an extra 4 to 5 days to get over it. When she got up this morning, she didn&#39;t feel good. Her husband asked if she wanted to go sailing, and she said not in 30 degree weather, but for her to say no to sailing, her husband knew she didn&#39;t feel well. She couldn&#39;t say worse, but she can say she didn&#39;t know how long it was going to be, which was scaring her. By doing what she did, if that negated the COVID vaccine, then lets go from there. That&#39;s what she was afraid of. When she tells people she is allergic to alcohol, and when it happens, they look at her like &#34;nobody is allergic to alcohol.&#34; She is 77 and has the aches and pains of a 77 year old, which she hates. But she doesn&#39;t think there are related medical conditions to what she experienced. This (allergy to alcohol) started when she was 19 and it has gotten progressively worse. So she tries to be careful. She says this was her, not dumb, but her decision that she made and now she is concerned.  She said no to any tests done. She had the immediate reaction and she knew what to do. Patient further reported that she has allergy to alcohol and had an adverse reaction after the 2nd shot due to alcohol swab and on an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced redness and swelling in her right arm and feeling hot all over the body. Patient asked if her doctor will prescribe Benadryl to manage my allergy will it affect the effectiveness of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event &#34;allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine&#34;. The patient did not recover from the event &#34;allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine&#34;. The outcome of the other events reported was unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 08Mar2021 15:30 (3:30 PM) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hashimottos (reported as hoshimottos) Diagnosed 35 years ago, hypermobile Diagnosed 20 years ago, and disorder nomia Diagnosed 25 years ago; all unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); diazepam (VALIUM); and levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 on 15Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization first dose at the left arm and experienced immobile for a day, cannot walk, weakness and sore arm. The patient was to know if there is going to be a booster for the Pfizer covid vaccine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer covid vaccine both doses and she is calling to report the reaction she had with the first and second dose to help other patients, she said she was close to death after the second dose. In the middle of the night she was awaken due to excruciating pain in the body, like truck ran over her. The patient heard that someone had same reaction who was in the hospital, with similar symptoms to covid. She said she felt like if her internal organ were shutting down. She does not do well with the antibiotic, and does not go to the doctors. She could not walk or eat after the second dose. She said she has hashimoto dysautonomia hypermobility. she said she thinks she might have had anaphylactic reaction. The patient added that she has lived through it and her experience has been very unusual. The caller has underlying conditions that may have caused this event, she received the second dose on 08Mar2021, it was a horrible experience but since she is still alive she would want to report it. The caller does have strange reactions to chemicals and she typically goes to naturopaths and holistic doctors because of this. The caller also has multiple autoimmune disorders and feels like that may have played a part in this reaction. It was added that further added that she received her second dose 08Mar2021 at 3:30pm and had a little bit of a sore arm, she was thinking positive thoughts about all of this because she never gets vaccines. At 2:00am on 09Mar2021 the caller was awaken in excruciating pain, every surgery she has had or accident manifests in the greatest pain. The pain was excruciating the caller took over the counter pain medicine and diclofenac and it didn&#39;t help. The caller is unsure of what she took, she may be making this up. The caller felt like she was dying, she felt like her internal organs were shutting down, it happened all week. The caller was so weak her husband fed her and made sure she was drinking. The caller thinks she would die if she had to have a booster shot of this vaccine. The caller has never had anaphylactic shock, could this have been anaphylactic shock? All of the pain from a surgery all occurred at once and her entire body was wrecking, in horrible pain, that she does not think heroin could have taken care of. After the second vaccine she was literally so weak that she felt like all of her vital organs were shutting down and it lasted for 6 days, like she got hit by a truck, like had beat her up. The caller knows that there are new found reactions with (Company name) and they stopped thousands of doses because of it, she saw this in the news today. The patient wanted to make note that she has underlying autoimmune diseases, she is unsure if there is a correlation between this and her reaction. The caller was changing from her thyroid medicine and her thyroid went very high with the generic brand so she was swapped to Synthroid in the middle of this. The caller was on levothyroxine and it wasn&#39;t working, her thyroid was sky high (Unknown lot number and expiration date Feb2022). The caller was going through all of these changes as well when she received the vaccine. The caller&#39;s doctor took a test and the caller has antibodies and they are there but not very strong. The caller doesn&#39;t want to be spreading something because she is feeling healthy and fine today. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose at the age of 72-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.

The concomitant medications were not reported.  on an unspecified the patient experienced atrial fibrillation (AFIB), tachycardia, chills, lethargy, brain fog, felt like i had a cold spent 2 days feeling like that, hypersensitivity. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of AFIB, tachycardia. The  outcome of events was unknown.   The course of events was as follows: On an unspecified she had reacted to the first vaccine: the first day she was fine. The next day she had chills, lethargy, kind a brain fog, felt like she had a cold and spent 2 days feeling like that. On Day 3 she had AFIB and tachycardia for 3-4 days saw the heart doctor and got medicine for that. She had a temperamental immune system. The stress test was super important. She was wandering if she had the Pfizer vaccine a week after the stress test. She got it at the university, and she wandered if they were restricted to give it to her a few days after my scheduled date: They wanted to rule out blockage in her heart.  She was having a test done around the same time as the 2nd Pfizer vaccine. She wanted to know if she could get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine later/ a week after the stress test. She wanted the vaccine, it was important. On 04May21 she was going to have a dye based test checking your heart, a stress test. The stress test was scheduled the same morning as her 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She was advised to consult with your doctor or pharmacist for further guidance.

This 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0171), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies and sinus headaches which she takes (Excedrin) off and on for years in the past, and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included atenolol (manufacturer unknown) taken for hypertension, start and stop date were not reported. Past drug history included the patient received a flu shot (unspecified Flu shot) with a mega reaction she was sick for weeks which was at least probably 15-20 years ago So, she never got a flu shot after that and she has never had the flu. On 29Apr2021, the patient had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, dizzy/light headed, felt like I am going to faint, and ringing in the ears. On an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced allergic reaction. On 01May2021, she was really ill, and her blood pressure went up over 220 and pulse rate went way up. On 02May2021, she experienced headaches. On 06May2021, she was feeling a little weird and nauseous. On an unspecified date in May2021, her memory is a little off right now. The clinical course was as follows: the patient reported, &#34;I had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, it&#39;s okay now, I couldn&#39;t really move it. I feel I may be having a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine (Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine) got on Thursday (29Apr2021) of this past week. I am very light headed, dizzy and felt like I am going to faint, has ringing in the ears, and all that has been going on about a week, since last Thursday (29Apr2021). Then I was really ill last night (01May2021). It started last night when we went to bed around 11 O&#39;clock. I have never had anything like this in my life. My blood pressure was through the roof. With a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope, her blood pressure went up over 220 which was so high that had never happened before, so I took an extra pill (atenolol 25 mg tablet) last night (01May2021) which helped a little bit but not enough, and I really thought that I was going to pass out and be really sick. Because I thought that it was either having a stroke or a heart attack, my husband had to call ambulance to take me to the hospital last night. The systolic and diastolic and pulse rate went way up.  They did chest x-ray, blood work, and urinalysis, and everything came back fine and they could not find anything. They just felt that I was just having a major reaction to the shot so they sent me home. I just got home this morning (02May2021) from having to go to the emergency room. But as soon as we got home, I started with a humongous headache and so I had Excedrin/Tylenol for headaches because I used to get sinus headaches. So, I took that, and it helped a little bit, my headache got a little better. Anyhow, I am much better right now and I am sleeping. But tomorrow it will be the same.&#34; Later the patient also reported, &#34;Today (06May2021) I am feeling a little weird with ringing of ears and is light headed sometimes. Because of the light headedness, I feels a little nauseous. But I am a still very nauseous. I feel like I am going to faint again and my blood pressure I think has gone back up. I am trying to keep calm and trying to figure out what is going on. But I am really afraid if I am having a reaction to the vaccine unfortunately. I am dizzy and I do not want to start getting worst again. I guess I will feel better if you tell me that this happens sometimes and what can I do to decrease somehow?&#34; She also stated that she did contact her doctor about this event but she didn&#39;t get very far. Her memory is a little off right now because she really has not felt well. She stated that her biggest thing is her blood pressure. She also stated, &#34;The only thing that I am really concerned now is about getting the second shot because I already had the reactions by the first shot. Am I going to face the same thing or even the worse with the second shot?&#34; Treatments were received for her blood pressure went up over 220 and headaches. The clinical outcomes of the event &#34;a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine&#34; resolved on 01May2021, the event nauseous was not resolved, while the events, allergic reaction, really ill, felt like I am going to faint, pulse rate went way up, ringing in the ears, dizzy/light headed, Headaches, feeling a little weird and memory is a little off right now were unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12May2021 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0168) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included acne and migraine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 12May2021, patient experienced soreness in arm. On 13May2021, she had symptoms of rash on her face and it&#39;s itching, and the rash started in her face and ear, all on the left side, on her ear half way down the outside of the ear. She could see all the pimples on the face so she put hot water on it and used rubbing alcohol, which she thought would help curb the itching and dry it up, the bottom of the ear lobe is very much active going into jaw area still. She also had headache, and tiredness following her dose, the doctor told her if headache was severe, take a Tylenol with codeine, she took something with codeine and it went away after about three hours. She also had some breast pain (only in the enfold of her breast closest to the middle of her chest), sore to the touch, and it was very sore for about 24 hours, and that it hasn&#39;t fully resolved. Then, while bathing, she noticed a knot in the vaginal area right in the fold of pelvis and thigh inside of the pelvis that was painful, large, and the size of a quarter, if she push on the pelvic bone area, it would be painful. Also, while bathing, she identified cysts in the rectal area; after bathing she was trying to identify what they were, when she touched it, it hurt, it felt like a ball and eventually it went down and she caused them to bleed, not a lot of blood, just a small amount. She also started getting more growths in the vaginal area/bottom area near the rectum. Patient got sleepy and now made herself go lay down and she doesn&#39;t usually do that. She felt a little bad, she didn&#39;t think it was severe side effects, she knew things were going on that she could pinpoint to what would possibly happen but not these cysts. She was recently seen by her gynecologist, a week ago, and none of these problems were apparent at that time. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. Patient had blood work done on 07Apr2021 and 10Apr2021 before the vaccine. The outcome of cysts bleeding and soreness in arm was recovered on 13May2021, itching rash, breast pain, painful knot, cysts in the rectal area was recovering, headache was recovered, other event outcome was unknown.

She reported that no one told her about a high fever (100.4) or to go to the hospital. She said it was not worth it for her to get a fever. She reported the information on the paper was very vague and not clear, she felt horrible as she suffered and wanted to let know. She wanted to complain that the temperature of fever was not written and none of those were approved. She was asked to contact her local doctor. That was the most horrible experience for her. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement as high, body temperature as and 100.4. The outcome of all the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for Injection; Lot number: EW0753; Expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included surgeries. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for Injection; Lot Number: EW0173), as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. On unspecified date in May2021, a few days later after second dose, the patient&#39;s chest to all the way up to neck was brilliant, brilliant red and felt like really hard sandpaper, and around neck 2 long red lines, it looked like someone was trying to strangle. The patient went to the dermatologist, they did not know what it was, and they sent the sample out. In the meantime, the patient&#39;s whole body got covered in little red spots, and then slowly it started to peel off and the peeling was even on top of the hand, the patient still peeling, her rear end was still peeling skin off, It was like big sheets coming off, It scared the hell out of her, she did not know what was going on. Patient just told that no one else was having that kind of reaction that she had. It really scared her when it reached this far on the top of her neck where the chin starts because she thought oh my god it has got on the face too, but it stopped their and everything else got it. The first symptom was on her chest and that became brilliant red and looked like she was on fire and that was just as hard as a sandpaper. That was the first thing and slowly other things started, that brilliant red start and her body all started coming out with red spots. It did not itch and slowly it started to &#39;fluffing&#39; off and the skin was still &#39;fluffing&#39; off. Patient had the second vaccine almost a month ago. On the top of her hand there was peeling. It scared her to death because this thing has not been happened it was 6 months and she do not know why she got it and really do not know. She just wanted to report because she went to her own doctor and then to dermatologist. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown.  Follow up needed, further information has been requested.

A 78-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at an unknown dose and frequency for an unspecified indication and pirfenidone (ESBRIET), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at an unknown dose and frequency for an unspecified indication. Medical history included pulmonary fibrosis (diagnosed between 2007-2010), Lymphoma type B, blood pressure (abnormal), cholesterol (abnormal), vertigo, biopsy, tightening of legs and feet, drip (nasal) and pain. Concomitant medication included gabapentin for tightening of her legs and feet, diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) for drip (nasal) and meloxicam for pain. It was reported that the patient took the vaccine and had two sleepless nights on 05Jan2021, her body turned very hot but she have some conditions. Sleepless nights: they have been really rough nights. Scary. Coughing and choking. She thinks the vaccine kicked in and started beating the hell out of it. The patient clarified that she is having sleepless nights because of the coughing, choking, and burning and she feels that it is related to the vaccine kicking in. She slept last night, 14Jan2021. The cough is starting again today (as reported). She hopes it calms down. When she said her body was hot, like burning she was describing her sleepless nights. She is afraid. She is keeping in contact with her doctor. She figured she better call because more people are on this medication. The patient also experienced congestion on 06Jan2021. It was reported that the patient has shrunk and weighed less. Maybe 154 pounds. She was 170. The action taken for ciprofloxacin and pirfenidone was unknown. The outcome of the event congestion was not recovered, while unknown for the rest of the events.

                                                little depressed; not feeling like herself; weak; tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 16:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included kidney ablation (ablation on the kidney cancer 5 years ago), kidney cancer, blood pressure, neuropathy, pain, had a urinary tract infection 19Dec2020 and they saw the cancer came back, radiologist read the CAT Scan and said the size of the tumor 1.5 to 2.4. Concomitant medications included acebutolol for blood pressure taking for years, diclofenac for neuropathy using for 10 years, oxycodone for pain taking 19 years; all ongoing, and oxycodone hydrochloride (OXYCONTIN) for pain. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Family Medical History was none. The caller stated that he was not sure if the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have given patient (his wife) COVID-19 or not. He also stated that when they received their vaccines the facility was very crowded as was the hospital when the wife was getting her blood work done so he was not sure when or where she contracted COVID-19. On 29Jan2021, patient was very busy running several errands including going to the hospital for bloodwork and a nuclear medicine injection as part of a work up for kidney ablation that the patient was supposed to have completed, patient was in the process of getting ready to have an ablation on her kidney and had the nuclear scan for her kidneys and then went to get a COVID test. After they got home, patient sat down at the computer and she started to act funny, kind of quiet and not talking which was unusual for her. So at about 1700PM the husband went in to ask her what kind of music she would like and he found her unconscious in the chair. He took her blood pressure and it was 60 over 4; with no heart rate; she was just barely breathing, he could tell by the way her mouth moved. He tried to breath for her, all of the sudden she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating. He called (phone number provided) and they rushed her to the hospital, and the paramedics verified her heart was not beating and they started to do resuscitation.

A 78-years-old female patient receive first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) on 15Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID Prevention. Medical history included ongoing High Blood Pressure, she was diagnosed approximately 5 years prior to starting blood pressure medications in 1998. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) at 320mg/12.5mg, once daily, by mouth from 1998 and ongoing, amlodipine besylate at 5mg, once daily, by mouth at night from 1998, both for High blood pressure. The patient stated that she did not realize, but she must have been exposed to the COVID Virus, prior to getting her shot. She stated that on 15Jan2021, she went and got her Pfizer COVID shot, and that same day, by the time she got home, she was starting to feel bad and it went downhill from there. She mentioned that on the same day on 15Jan2021, she &#34;came down with covid&#34;. She finally went in on 22Jan2021, and got tested, and she did test positive for COVID. The patient was tested Positive for COVID-19 on 22Jan2021. She did believe she was getting better. On 29Jan2021, she felt fairly decent, and today, she is kind of weak but she is assuming that will happen. She was scheduled to go back for her second dose on 08Feb2021, and she is wondering if there are recommendations about the second dose, for people who tested positive for COVID after having gotten the first dose. When queried for her PCP contact information, she stated that her head is not working really great and she feels stupid she did not have this information handy to provide. She states that the first week with her symptoms, she just figured she did have the virus. She had a cough but it never got down to where she had trouble breathing, and she just figured that her body had to go through, whatever it was going to go through, and as long as the patient felt like she was okay, there was not anything anyone could do, she just had to play it out. When she did finally go get tested, the doctor told her to get on Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what the patient has been taking, and she feels like it has helped a lot. Before she saw the doctor, she was taking Acetaminophen, but the doctor told her to do the Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what she has been doing. By the time she got home from getting her vaccine, her heart was racing. She took her blood pressure and it was okay at 125/73, and her heart rate was 72. She has high blood pressure and she takes two medications for that, so she took her night time blood pressure pill and the fast beating of her heart went away. The next day, she got to aching. She has had all different aches, and she ran a fever that got up to 101, and the rest of the time it was 100 or 99, but the fevers were not all day long, they would just come and go. Now she has had no fever in four or more days, and she is doing better. She does still have the cough, but she also has allergies so she does not know what is causing the cough. As far as the reaction to the vaccine, just her arm got sore. But she thinks she was exposed prior to getting the vaccine and just did not know it. she stated that the people took her temperature the day of the shot and she didn&#39;t have a temperature. She did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of fever was recovering, of cough and allergies was not recovered, of her heart was racing was recovered.

I have also experienced extreme fatigue, chills, nausea, muscle and joint aches, a sore throat (briefly), an occasional headache, tenderness in my left armpit and along the left side of my rib cage, stomach pain and diarrhea and at times, a low-grade fever and sweating. My memory and ability to focus on my work have been affected. Yesterday (March 13), I felt OK all day and thought I was better at last, but after I ate dinner, I vomited and had diarrhea. I told my primary care physician about all of this in an email and she replied that my symptoms were &#34;normal.&#34; I&#39;m not so sure. I haven&#39;t read of anyone else feeling so sick for so long after the first dose of Pfizer.

There was so many people so she just kept walking and luckily was able to get to car and told her husband she did not feel good. By then she had a terrible headache and when she got home she laid down right away. Then things started spinning and she was very nauseous and is aware that these things can happen with the vaccine. Had flu like symptoms like she never had before, but this was worse. She did not have a fever, but was flushed and very cold, chills. Her arm was not hurting until about 9pm and during the night she had a rapid heart beat, but not really. Was very anxious like something was going to happen and she tried to calm herself by taking deep breaths but does not know if that worked. Finally, after 3 hours she was able to go to sleep and did go to the bathroom a couple times and felt week with the flu like symptoms, they were very bad. When she got up today she was 60-65% better. She did eat something later yesterday and had thought the nausea was because she hadn&#39;t eaten all day long. The food was flat tasting and she know she has that whenever she has the flu where nothing tastes right. She clarifies she has that anyway since 16 years ago she had cancer and a strong dose of chemotherapy and radiation and her immune system since has not been the same and has been very deprived. Whenever she gets sick she gets deathly sick and has to be watched or she may have to get hospitalized due to weakened immune system. States some people say that the second dose is worse, is that true or is it the same feeling. If she feels like that with the second dose she may not get it. No further details provided. Mentions as the day goes on she comes around more. Has to get her glasses to see card given. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. The outcome of event her immune system since has not been the same and has been very deprived was unknown and other events were not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 78-year-old female (pregnancy unknown) patient receive second dose in series of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN5318), via unknown route of administration on Right arm on 03Feb2021 09:00 (the day of vaccination), at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history includes High blood pressure, and historical vaccine Caller had the First Dose on 13Jan2021 and it was Lot number EL3302. Caller had the Second Dose on 03Feb2021, and it was Lot number: EN5318. Caller reports that she got both doses via injection into the right arm. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that caller states that she would like to talk about side effects from the COVID vaccine. Caller had the first dose of the product on 13Jan2021 and the second dose, this past Wednesday at 09 AM. Caller states that she was fine the whole rest of that day but then she woke up at 3 AM the next day and everything had changed. Caller states that she had a headache, she was exhausted, had chills, a fever of 100, it was overall a feeling like she had the flu. Caller is wondering if these are known side effects of the product because the caller&#39;s husband also got the vaccine, and he did not have any of these symptoms. Caller states that her primary care doctor is her Gynecologist and he is not aware that the caller even had the vaccine because she only goes to him once a year. Caller confirms the product was not prescribed to her by anyone in particular. Caller states that she had just read about the product and saw stuff on TV and thought that because of her age she should get it. Caller states that her brother in law is a physician and he told the caller to get the product. Caller states that her brother in law got the shot too and after his first shot he was fine but he had a few symptoms after the second shot, where he was feeling like he had the flu but he did not have as many symptoms as the caller had. Caller states that she got through the whole day of the day she had the injection and everything was great until 3 AM the next morning and she woke up with all the side effects. Caller states that she was so worn out, she just felt zapped, she had no appetite, a dull headache, she slept most of the day, fever of 100, and overall she felt sluggish. Now today, caller doesn&#39;t feel great, but she has no symptoms, she is just washed out. Caller states that she just guesses she did not know to expect that from the product. Caller states that she had heard there were some side effects and some people get them more than others but her husband did not get a single one. Caller is also wondering if the side effects will just go away on their own. Caller had no other vaccines on the same days as her doses of the COVID vaccines. Caller states that she has not had any bloodwork done in a while.

She told them that she was going to have a procedure and they told her that it would be okay for her to have the vaccine.  Then she had the procedure on 3/25/21 and then 2 days later she lost the use of her legs.  She has fatigue, no energy whatsoever, it took 3 days for her to be able to get up and walk, and slept on the floor as she could not use her legs to get into the bed.  She did call her doctor about 5 days later and he thought that it could have been a combination of the vaccine and anesthesia from the procedure.  She continues to have the fatigue and no energy whatsoever.

I was very disoriented upon waking. I could not gather my thoughts and memories. Things like: I knew I was in a city , but didn?t know where the city was in the world; and other things like that. It was as though I had stepped out of my life and didn?t remember enough to step back in. It only lasted maybe 5 min, but was completly disconcerting &amp; disarming. I?ve never had a similar event.  And it came after another disarming 10 min bout of dizziness / sense of off-balancedness and a very slight nausea the night before. It too, was arresting because I had had no alcohol to drink for months. I felt continually better during the early morning and didn?t think about it much during the rest of the day.

She mentioned that she was scheduled to get the second shot today i.e. 26Feb2021 Friday, and her son saw on tv some people can get diarrhea, which she did not know before. She said that she had not gotten a temperature, and her BP was fine. She mentioned that she had irritable bowel disease anyway, and usually when she has that it clears in a week. She says that she would like to know if it is safe for her to get the second shot. On an unknown date in Feb2021, she experienced nervousness and it will have repercussions. She said that her son said there was some program on TV that listed all those things, some that were not in the paperwork she got. She had been nauseated or had diarrhea, and she called before, and some people get diarrhea, and she was supposed to check and see if she should get second shot. The outcome of all the events was unknown. Caller mentioned that she called her provider, but they were not going to get back to her in an hour and a half before she would go to get the second dose. She says she got the first dose of the vaccine at (Pharmacy) and says that she thought her diarrhea was better and then it came back the day before yesterday. She mentioned that her vaccine card was handwritten, and she could not read the writing on it. She says it mentioned (Clinic site) and that the handwriting was horrible on the card, and she could not tell if the LOT was E129EG. She says NDC/EXP were not provided on the card. The caller said that she has either got to get the shot or cancel this one, but if she cancels this one she does not know when she would be able to get second since the appointments are all booked up in (State).   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 78-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL1283) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypo thyroiditis (does not have it anymore, it was 30 years ago when she was a teacher), knee that was broken twice and allergic to antibiotics from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down/something clicks in body, heart beats really fast, really bad pain in her right knee, muscles really tight, didn&#39;t feel so good, she was scared to death, her nerves, anxiety and very frightened. The reporter stated that feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down, was happened after she got her first covid shot. The patient asked to know if it was safe for her to get the second dose of the vaccine. The patient wondered if anyone else, she had the first Pfizer vaccine, later clarified as the COVID vaccine, a week ago last day before the time of this report, and she used to have a really fast heartbeat, but it slowed down, and once in a while, it was fast and stuff, now she had this happened twice, where she felt something click in her body, her heart beats really fast, and she drank water immediately, it slows down, has anyone said this after getting the vaccine. She has been on the phone for two hours. She never had a little click, she had thyroid hypo thyroiditis and every evening she would have a fast heartbeat, her blood pressure would go, but she never had when she would feel this little click, like a little, and her heart was really fast in morning of the report, it was really fast, and the minute she drinks water, it slows it down, it does not make sense. Also, her muscles are really tight, she was 78 and having a hard time with this pandemic, her nerves not good, she was nervous about the vaccine. She stated she was a teacher, and her weight was 106-107 pounds. About the event feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down/something clicks in body, heart beats really fast, the patient stated, unknown when this started, exact date unknown, this has happened twice, this morning was the second one, and the minute she drank water, it slows it down, but it was very very fast, and she did not feel so good after, she was scared to death, her nerves are shot, she has trouble with anxiety, she was feeling ok now. She was nervous about what was going on and would feel better if someone else said they experienced the same. About the event muscles being really tight, the patient stated she has knots, her muscles are tight in her shoulders and neck lots, last night she was writing recipes, she does recipes boxes for her grandkids, and she was using her right arm a lot, she does not get to go to spa since the pandemic, she has not gotten to go to her for over a year. Her husband rubbed it out, and she did heat. Her muscles were tight right after she did it, so it could be something, it said if you think you had a symptom and also the second night after, she had a really bad pain in her right knee, it lasted one night, it was a knee that was broken twice, which may be why it was that leg. She was very very frightened to take it, she reacts to things strangely, when she has any procedure, they always say they never had that happen to anyone, she was allergic to antibiotics, different things happen when she takes different things, she was nervous about the whole thing, which may have to do with it. The second dose is on 12Feb2021. The outcome of the event muscles really tight was recovering and unknown for other events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 78-year-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing glaucoma (had it for 7 years), ongoing hypothyroid (started 7 years ago). It took her 5 years to find the right doctor and the right medication. It took a while to balance it off. She has been okay the last 2 years with the right medication; asthma from 1969(controls her allergies, so it did not turn into asthma), ongoing high blood pressure (had it all her life), allergy to glycerin and ongoing vertigo (started way before she had the vaccine). Concomitant medications included ongoing irbesartan (AVAPRO) for high blood pressure (She just went back to it about a year ago because it was doing really good then her blood pressure spiked up) and ongoing levothyroxine sodium (TIROSINT SOL) for hypothyroidism for 3 years. The patient previously took flu shot and then had the flu and got pneumonia. On an unknown date, couple of days after the first dose the patient experienced redness in her eyes, about a week or 2 after the vaccination the patient couldn&#39;t focus. On 06Feb2021, the patient had pressure behind left eye and vertigo (vertigo). There were no relevant tests done. She was being treated for vertigo, but the vertigo was basically gone though she was seeing a physical therapist. The vertigo started way before she had the vaccine. The patient visited physician&#39;s office for the adverse events. The Patient did not go to the emergency room. The patient should have gone to the hospital, but she was afraid to be around people with Covid. She did not get vaccines at all because she fears having a reaction. The last vaccine she had in 2006 made her so sick she got pneumonia. It was for the flu, and she got the flu. The patient did not have any vaccination within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient thought it was important for her to take the vaccine which it took her awhile to talk herself into it because of her previous experience with adverse reactions. She took levothyroxine sodium solution because the patient was allergic to so many things. The first one they gave her was a gel capsule and it caused an itching reaction. The patient is allergic to glycerine and could not take capsules that have a glycerine encasement. The first one they gave her was a gel capsule and it caused an itching reaction. She was allergic to the preservative in eye drops. She did not know if the Covid vaccine had any preservative, she did not think it did. She looked it up and did not see anything she was allergic to. The patient had a long list of allergies. Her family all has high blood pressure and allergies. The outcome of the event vertigo was recovered on an unknown date, for redness in her eyes was not recovering while unknown for rest of the event.   Additional details unable to be obtained.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 11Jan2021 10:50 (Batch/Lot Number: EJ1686; Expiration Date: 20Mar2021) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE, vaccinated at the age of 78 years old for covid-19 immunisation. Patient received the first dose on 21Dec2020. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism Diagnosed 20 years ago, ongoing colitis, ongoing proctitis, ongoing diverticulum, ongoing gastrointestinal pain, and breast cancer. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism, start and stop date were not reported. Caller states she was told by a couple of doctors that she needed to report this. Caller states her first vaccine was 21Dec2021 and then her second dose was on 11Jan2021. Caller states four days after the second dose, she wound up in the ER with severe headache, abdominal pain, dry heaves and she had a morbid feeling. Caller states after that, she saw her doctor and for two months she had problems with nausea, severe nausea, where she couldn&#39;t eat, lost 13 pounds, hypothyroid went to hyperthyroid, very serious extreme anxiety, which she is still battling. Caller states the Endocrinologist felt it could&#39;ve been associated with the vaccine. Caller states the ER ran tests and abdominal scans and all they showed were the usual things she knew she had, nothing new. Caller states she asked the ER doctors, and they said they didn&#39;t know if it was related and when she asked Endocrinology, they said they don&#39;t know for sure. Caller states her Primary doctor said it could be related, anytime a person has a vaccination, if they are immunocompromised or have inflammation, it can possibly trigger this and events occur. Caller states she had dry heaves, an aversion to food, lost weight, and had terrible anxiety, all four days after vaccine. Caller states after the first vaccine, she was fine. Caller states after the second vaccine, she woke up that morning four days after, it was acute, this had never happened before and she had a feeling of doom and dry heaving. Caller states it took her two months, before she started to eat and put the weight back on. Caller states the nausea is gone and she is able to eat and put weight back on. Caller states she still has extreme anxiety and she is seeing a doctor for that and is being medicated so it is persisting by improved with medicaiton. Caller repeats, this all happened four days after her second injection. Caller states no one knows that much about the vaccine but they said something that this reaction should be reported. Caller states the nausea and other GI issues lasted for about two months, but she can&#39;t give actual dates of when it recovered. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know dates of when the other side effects recovered, but they only thing she still has is the anxiety. Seriousness: Caller states the Nausea was disabling, she couldn&#39;t eat at all, she had to drink ensure and boost. Caller states the rest were medically significant. She was worked on by her PCP and Endocrinologist, and they adjusted her thyroid medication to bring back down her levels, and she is sure that is part of the reason for her anxiety and anorexia. Caller states before she had hypothyroid. Treatment: Suppositories, Zofran, Reglan, Anxiety Medication, Adjustment of the thyroid medication Synthroid. States when she lost an extreme amount of weight, her thyroxin increased, so they dropped her dose to the normal range. Causality: Caller states she feels it is related because it was an acute onset and rare for her, even though she is older, she is healthy. Caller states she has had breast cancer but nothing that stopped her from working. Caller states it is hard to know, but she thinks it is related. Caller states her one son was home and called and said mom looks like she is going to pass out and she is not an alarmist and usually would say no, but she said yes, he better make sure that she gets to the ER, she felt impending doom, with abrupt onset. Tests: Caller states they did an Endoscopy and Colonoscopy because of her abdominal pain and they found colitis and proctitis and every, itis, a person can think of along with diverticulosis and inflamed gut, but she already had those, they were not caused by the vaccine, she had them in the past. Outcome of anxiety was recovering, of others was recovered in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship between events anxiety, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, retching, malaise, weight decreased, hyperthyroidism, decreased appetite, eating disorder and company suspect BNT162B2, the causal relationship cannot be denied.

This consumer reported same events for two patients (one is patient self). This is the first of two reports. This 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration to right arm on 13Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfas, Penicilins, and Avelox, Sulfa or Penicillin allergies since she was a child and had the Avelox allergies about 15-16 years ago. None concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. Did get the original Shingles vaccine about 3 years ago and then they came out with the new one and she got the first dose of that and believes she had a reaction to that one, thinks it was a rash. Also had the flu shot and she usually gets sick with it, but didn&#39;t with this last one. Thinks her body is just delicate. No vaccines administered on same date. Patient had the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on 13Jan2021 15:00 and she was fine. She had a reaction the following day (on 14Jan2021). At 11am the next day she got very dizzy and felt like she was going to faint, pass out at any second. Used cold compresses and drank water and took deep breaths, but she didn&#39;t pass out. She had a funny taste in her mouth. Then from that time until about 7pm she had urine issues and kept going to the bathroom to urinate and had diarrhea and upset stomach. Patient felt like she was out of her body, felt very weird, strange. Doctor stated she maybe had a reaction to the vaccine and recommended for her to take Tylenol. She didn&#39;t take it until right before going to bed. She was able to sleep on 14th night. Woke up the next morning and was fine. She didn&#39;t see any of these reactions listed and that happened. Patient explained to a friend of the reactions and the friend mentions that she also had a friend who had the vaccine and had the same exact reactions, everything. Everything improved and stopped the next morning she was fine, on the 15th. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. The events outcome was recovered on 15Jan2021. It was just a span of time and she has to assume that it was the vaccine since she has never had that before.

Medical history included COPD from an unspecified date (not taking any medication for COPD) and she was 5&#39;5 and has gotten a little bit tinier on an unspecified date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 28Jan2021, the patient stated everything was perfect and she was made to sit there for 15 minutes. The patient reported her adverse event as having absolutely no saliva at all about 2-3 minutes later after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Her mouth stopped producing the saliva almost immediately and it was total. She stated she never had anything like that before. She stated it did not make her feel ill. She was still breathing alright, so she did not tell anybody.  She did not have a good night&#39;s sleep and anxious about whether she won&#39;t be able to breathe with this experience. At 07:00 the next day, everything went back to normal and it was very noticeable for her. She was concerned about taking the second shot in 3 weeks considering her experience with the first shot. The patient stated afterwards that the information provided to her helped her to be relived and be confident about taking the second shot. Outcome of the event was recovered on 29Jan2021 07:00.

                                                began to hallucinate; Dizzy; bed nightmare; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 79-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Expiration Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Jan2021 at 79-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included high blood pressure from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, shrunk a little from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (&#34;about 5&#39;9 and I was always 5&#39;10 but I think I shrunk a little&#34;).  Concomitant medications included nebivolol hydrochloride (BYSTOLIC) taken for blood pressure high from an unspecified date to an unspecified date (&#34;I have blood pressure, high blood pressure. I am taking a blood thinner. I was taking the other one, but they told me to look the other one (BYSTOLIC). It (BYSTOLIC) is a new drug I would say.&#34;). The patient previously received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) for COVID-19 immunization on an unknown date and experienced adverse event (&#34;no problem, nothing happened, there were minor things here and there&#34;). On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient began to hallucinate (medically significant), dizzy (non-serious), and bed nightmare (non-serious). The patient did not receive treatment due to the events; &#34;No, I just ignored it.&#34;  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated, &#34;I took the virus vaccination shot (clarified as COVID 19 vaccine). The first one, there was no problem, nothing happened, there were minor things here and there. The second one I took was just this past Sunday. Something weird happened not right away, not the first day but probably it was second day, second or the third day, I am pretty sure I am not sure exactly, I think. I was not keeping track of all of that.&#34; The patient began to hallucinate; and when she got out of her bed, she suddenly had a feeling that she should look back. The patient stated that she looked back and there was her deceased sister (who died 37 years ago; according to the patient) and her daughter who was still alive; both were looking at her. The patient further reported the following: &#34;They remained in my bed beside me. Okay, I ignored it and thought it was kind of funny because I know that my daughter is in (place name) and my sister is deceased. So, I am having a bed nightmare or something, so I ignored it. Then next thing it happened for a few days and then the dog that we just had euthanized, my daughter (name) had cancer and it was euthanized and what happened is, I was sitting on my sofa and I have seen the dog come out of my bedroom going to the bathroom but only the back of her and she disappeared. Then I spent the night at my other daughter&#39;s house and somewhere in the middle of the night I was awake in my something and I woke up and I looked over into my sistert&#39;s dining room and there was my brother standing there looking at me and there was two of his children sitting at the table also. I thought this is getting a little weird.&#34; The patient reported that nothing like this happened before. The patient wanted to understand the event because she &#34;never had been dizzy from my drug, taking the drug (unspecified medication) that made me dizzy but that not the same thing what is going on here.&#34; The clinical outcome of the events was unknown.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  Concomitant medication included atenolol for blood thinner.  The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 for Covid-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event. The patient stated that she received the second dose of the vaccine on 04Feb2021 and has been sick ever since. She has a terrible terrible splitting headache on her right temple and can&#39;t sleep and was having so much pressure behind her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t even lay her head on a pillow. She stated she had no reaction to the first shot but this time her head is all fuzzy, her mind wasn&#39;t good and when she sets things down she can&#39;t remember where they are. The second shot was really giving her a fit. Her throat hurts, jaw hurts, head hurts, and feels like she is running a temperature. She is a little off balance, when she walks she falls into things because she can&#39;t see things hardly in her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t put up with the pain any longer, it is terrible behind her temple and eye. She thought it was a sinus infection but now she thinks it was from the shot. She stated she almost had a wreck today because she cannot see out of her right eye because of the shot. She hit a telephone thing and almost wrecked 3 or 4 times. She tried to get tested for Covid but she didn&#39;t have an appointment and she cannot go to work until she finds out about the virus. She was going to get tested tomorrow but was going to have to call the rescue squad because she can&#39;t drive and she was not putting her son through this if she has the virus. The patient asked if she was allergic to the second shot or if these were normal symptoms. She asked what she should do. She stated she takes Atenolol, a blood thinner, and thyroid medicine. She stated she was taking Tylenol but it doesn&#39;t help any and nothing seems to help. All the events occurred on Feb2021. Outcome of all the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration, on 02Feb2021 12:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, knee surgery, and bulging disc.  The patient had an MRI on an unspecified date in Jan2021 (a week and a half prior to the date of initial report) with result of bulging disc. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate (ARNUITY ELLIPTA) for asthma; She was supposed to take 1 puff a day. However, being in the house, she had no problems, she had maybe used it twice a week since she hasn&#39;t had any problems, she last took 1 puff on 01Feb2021). She was also taking vitamin pills concomitantly. On 04Feb2021 23:00, 2 days after the vaccine, the patient had sweats, was wringing wet, and was not feeling well. Her hair was wet, and she was sweating. She was okay on the morning of 05Feb2021 but not herself. She had a little nausea on 05Feb2021. She was just not quite herself on 05Feb2021 but doesn&#39;t have the sweats. She further reported that she had her first shot on 02Feb2021 12:00. She was fine and had no problems. However, on night of 04Feb2021, before bed, she started getting hot and sweaty, like she was wringing wet. She didn&#39;t feel good, but 2 days had gone by and she was fine. She also went to bed with something like chills (later clarified as not chills), she went to sleep on the morning of 05Feb2021 and felt okay but not that great. When queried when the chills started, she said that it was not really chills, she was just very sweaty, wringing wet. She stated that she never sweats, and in this case her whole hair was wet. Being older, she was wondering what was going. Her feeling hot and sweaty subsided during the night. She did start to feel nausea, or she thought maybe she hasn&#39;t had anything to eat and so had a half banana and then she was okay. She thought she was hungry and felt funny, she had the half banana and was okay. She also felt a little shaky and nervous on 04Feb2021; however, it all subsided after going to bed. At the date of report, 05Feb2021, she felt okay but she didn&#39;t feel completely herself. Her second dose is scheduled on 26Feb2021 at 9:15 AM. Outcome of events feeling hot and sweaty was recovered with sequel on 05Feb2021. Outcome of event not feeling well was unknown. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 05Feb2021. Outcome of the events shaky and nervous was recovered on 04Feb2021. Outcome of she was just not quite herself was not recovered.

Sometimes the recur in the same day, sometimes not.  When I am in the fogged state, when I take a step, I find I have no control of, or contact with my lower limbs and I stumble.  This has been going on for over a month.  And the feeling of exhaustion felt after dose #1 and dose #2 has continued intermittently.

Patient second dose was on 26Mar2021, and they did not ask for her vaccine card, so she does not have and was not able to provide NDC/LOT/EXP from the second dose. She says that the NDC was not provided on her vaccine card for the first dose. The patient mentions a COVID test, but says that this was just a paper, she had forgot that she had a card, the test was to do a job. Patient says it was the second dose that she had a reaction after. She says she got both doses in her left arm. She says her reaction was discomfort and mild malaise beginning Saturday. Patient said that it has not got better or worse, she was having intermittent trembling periods where she would feel ok but then start shaking and be exhausted again, so it has been about the same since Saturday. Patient said that she will be ok for a couple hours, and then it will all start again, and she will shake all over. Patient felt a little fuzzy, like she was not thinking clearly, and so tired and trembling. The patient said that her prolonged reaction was not enough to go to the hospital, but she was not feeling so good, and thinks maybe people should be warned. The patient did not receive any treatment for adverse event. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

It was a very severe reaction if not vertigo. It was awful. spinning widely, nauseous. I called the doctor and he prescribed some vertigo medication/nausea medication. We tried an Epley maneuver for vertigo. spinning uncontrollably. which ear it was in. did the epley maneuver itself. I couldn&#39;t bend down. The last week or so I&#39;ve been cautious but ok, tried to seen ENT and I have a therapist to help me do that Epley maneuver again. I don&#39;t want to set off anything.

She has been falling a sleep a lot, day, night and was previously very active and now falls asleep at a drop of a hat.

This is report 1 of 2. This report is in regard to the reporter&#39;s sister. A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: Unknown, NDC number: Unknown, Expiry Date: Unknown), via unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (about two months ago) as 2nd dose single for covid-19 immunization. The patient had History with Oral lichen planus From an Unspecified date and unknown if ongoing). Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not have any other product. Reporter stated that, she doesn&#39;t know the specific day of vaccination. It has caused diarrhea to the patient that has persisted for 8 weeks. GI doc gave Lomotil, and it helped a little bit. She has had to change her diet and cut out vegetables because it made the diarrhea worse. Patient was very depressed. Patient wanted to know if It was reported earlier and why would it cause the ongoing diarrhea. Patient had seen that that it causes sometimes severe diarrhea, but it didn&#39;t say how long it will last. Patient was concerning about if someone need to take an immunosuppressive medication to stop the diarrhea. She was afraid her doctor is going to tell her she needs to take an immunosuppressant medication. It also had stated like, if the Pfizer aware that people have to take medications that shut down the immune system. Upon follow up on 27May2021, reporter stated that, patient was very depressed (on unspecified date) about it. She had a tendency of having autoimmune problems, that she had oral lichen planus, sometimes called burning mouth syndrome. Her doctor diagnosed her with oral lichen planus, which is an autoimmune reaction to bell peppers, she was eating a lot of bell peppers. patient has a hyper immune system. She did not take any type of autoimmune medications no Humira or immunosuppressive medications. Patient took the COVID-19 vaccine 8 weeks ago and patient developed the diarrhea by the 4th day after the vaccine. Patient had never had diarrhea her entire life. Patient went into shock. Her sister&#39;s diarrhea was still ongoing. The gastro doctor gave her sister Lomotil and the Lomotil was working to a point, it prevents the worst of the diarrhea. Her stool was coming out very loose. Reporter did not have the NDC number, lot number and expiry date for the Lomotil, stating it was a prescription, chemical name called atropine or something (as reporter). Patient changed her diet and was becoming depressed. Normally, her sister is a person very concerned for her health and she would have a plant-based diet with multiple vegetables, and now her sister can&#39;t do that. patient felt her life depends on having a healthy diet. Patient had vaccinated at pharmacy or something, reporter was concerned that, patient got a good vaccination that was not corrupt in any way. Reporter was urging patient to get the vaccine because she travels and goes to a different country and this and that. So, she could be able to travel. patient has a hyperactive immune system, it appears so anyway. Reporter was using her own words when she uses the term hyperactive immune system, so this may not be medically accurate. Her sister has oral lichen planus which is a bad problem. patient was eating a lot of bell peppers. Bell peppers produce an immune reaction, because they contain a chemical called solanine. patient was eating a lot of bell peppers because the internet said they were healthy and contained a lot of vitamin A. she got an immune reaction to the bell peppers, and the immune reaction produced sores under her sister&#39;s tongue, very painful sores. Patient had side effects happen three or four days later after the vaccine- it started as diarrhea and she thought it would stop. Patient&#39;s shoulder was sore. reporter mentioned she doesn&#39;t know when patient&#39;s soreness began and ended. The soreness did completely go away for patient. No Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Event Did not require any visit to emergency Room or Physician Office. Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks of the suspect vaccine and events following prior vaccinations were none. Patient&#39;s Family Medical History was related to the autoimmune stuff, clarified as the oral lichen planus. Patient had oral lichen planus and was previously treated with steroids. The oral lichen planus started with sores under her sister&#39;s tongue. Her sister was treated twice with steroids. Patient said the steroids were successful. Patient&#39;s sores were treated with a steroid once and then the sore returned so she went back to the same doctor, and the doctor treated her again with steroids. The second time, the sores went away. At that point, this condition was called burning mouth syndrome, which is on the internet, it was a known condition that is very painful. The doctor diagnosed it as burning mouth syndrome. The diarrhea her sister is experiencing was causing a psychological effect. Reporter stated that, there was no warnings of if a person who has an overactive immune system shouldn&#39;t take the COVID vaccine, there was no kind of warning. Reporter seriousness for all the events were Unspecified. Outcome of all the events were unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Outcome of the event her arm began to be sore was recovered in Jan2021, for the other events was unknown.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 13:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and previously took the flu shot one time and started having right arm pain across her chest over to the left side right after getting it. So she don&#39;t take it anymore and takes a bunch of herbs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she has a disease, amyloidosis on an unspecified date, where there is a build up of protein in the body. She didn&#39;t know that there is protein in the shot and doesn&#39;t know the affects it has with her condition. She found out the day after getting the first Pfizer C-19 (clarified as COVID-19) shot that there was protein in it. The patient wanted to know the affects it has with her condition and if it will affect her getting the second dose and if it covers the new virus and booster shot. The patient got the vaccine on 16Jan2021 and found out about the protein in it the next day when it came across her phone. The patient received it at a school, where they vaccinated 1,169 residents. They text her to inform her she could get the vaccine. They also have the health department there. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient took 1 Tylenol about 15:00 that afternoon and seated herself in the chair about 17:45, then she felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head. She stood up and walked around to see if she was going to faint and she did not faint. She walked through the house and nothing else happened. The patient mentioned that her eyes have been swollen and her hands hurt, that&#39;s where the protein build up comes in the body. Has pings up and down her legs, they are sharp pings that lasted through on to Tuesday. She took 1 Advil to help and as of yesterday (as reported) no pings. Her hands still hurt, because this condition forms chains in the body and the chains are around the hands like carpel tunnel. The protein normally should leave the body and with this condition it doesn&#39;t and it leaves chains. When she was diagnosed with it they took a spot off the ankle to test it, the Dermatologist did and sent it off. No further details provided. Wants to know the affects of her getting the second shot. No further details provided. The outcome of the events amyloidosis and hands hurt was not recovered, the events felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head and sharp pings up and down legs was recovering, and the event  eyes swollen was unknown.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

An 80-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265), intramuscular at Right Deltoid from on 16Feb2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included stomach was burning, heartburn, low thyroid, myocarditis and was hospitalized a year ago, Milroy&#39;s disease, and low potassium, heart disorder and Back disorder. Concomitant medications included bumetanide (BUMEX) Has been taking for about 40 years for Milroy&#39;s disease, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) from Jan2020 for Myocarditis, levothyroxine Has been taking for 40 years for low thyroid, tramadol Started about 10-12 years ago for back, metoprolol from Jan2020 for heart, omeprazole (PROTONIX) Started taking about 8 years ago for stomach was burning and heartburn, potassium Has taken for 40-50 years for low potassium, vitamin B12, vitamin D3 and baby aspirin 81mg, all were ongoing. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL8982) on an unknown date for covid-19 immunization and she got a really sore arm. The patient experienced Myocarditis/had another virus that went to her heart on an unspecified date, brain fog on 17Feb2021, trouble remembering on an unspecified date, incredible fatigue on 17Feb2021, could sleep around the clock on 17Feb2021. The clinical course as following: injection was on 16Feb2021. She has had incredible fatigue. She was asking how long is the fatigue going to last. She knows it is a side effect but she could sleep around the clock. She stated she goes to bed at 6PM if not before then and gets up at around 8AM and by 9AM she could go back to bed. She is sorry she got the shot because she is miserable. She mentioned she has been reading up on the vaccine and it said &#34;you might have fatigue for a day or two&#34;. Her fatigue has now been 8 days. She thought &#34;how long is this going to go on&#34;.  Patient reported that with the first shot she got a really sore arm. Stated she thinks the person giving the injection put the darn thing through her bone. She thought it was to be expected, but it feels like the person who administered the vaccine was a poor shot giver. She provides the first Covid Vaccine Lot number: EL8982. With the second shot her arm did not get sore at all. The only thing she&#39;s having was the fatigue, she can hardly walk past her bed without wanting to get back in it. She tries to get up to shower and fix her hair and be motivated and she&#39;s been fighting the fatigue all day to not get back in bed. When probed for the seriousness criteria of the fatigue, the caller explains she doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s that significant. She thought it will go away. However, she was just coming out of myocarditis. She was just in the hospital for myocarditis and they did a heart cath and she has no plugged arteries, nothing. They couldn&#39;t find anything other than she had another virus that went to her heart. She had another virus a year ago January. She wonders if COVID was out there then, because she had never been so sick with the flu. She kind of diagnosed her problem and it was like a wave over her body. She also had a terrible irregular pulse. When she went to the hospital the next morning, her cardiac enzymes were 4.5 times more than normal, her troponin was out of sight. She doesn&#39;t think that would have a bearing because she should be coming out of that myocarditis because of the medication the doctor put her on. She doesn&#39;t know if that would complicate it, too. Her heart doctor said a lot of people have myocarditis, especially athletes, but they are young and fall over dead. 90% of the time, its myocarditis because you don&#39;t know you have it.  She reports she&#39;s getting a foggy brain. Her son asked her who her dentist was because she had a root canal and she couldn&#39;t think of the dentist&#39;s name. She thinks her son threw that in because her son knew that she wouldn&#39;t be able to remember. She&#39;s not confused. It&#39;s just difficult to get the word out, but if she waits a couple minutes, she has the answer. She is also getting old, too. She lives by herself; she has no stimulation and she thinks that is significant to her circumstances. She thinks it&#39;s a problem with the COVID-19 injection. Caller explains she had blood work very recently about 2 weeks ago. She just looked at lab reports and everything was okay except one of the vitamins was a tiny bit high (she can&#39;t remember what the vitamin was), but nothing she was worried about. It could have been a Potassium was a little high, but she is not worried about that. Her main question is how long the fatigue last, she thought for only 1-2 days. She mentions she took her temperature every morning and its always like 97 something and it&#39;s never wavered. The outcome of the events brain fog, incredible fatigue, and could sleep around the clock was not recovered and the outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, viral myocarditis is most likely due to a viral infection in this patient with cardiovascular co-morbidities and is not related to suspect product.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Mar2021 13:30 (at 80 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, allergic to gluten, lecithin, and other barky parts of plants, high pressure, she did not hear very well, left breast surgery, skin cancer. She had a small skin cancer taken off each of her legs, one removed in Jan2020 and one removed in Feb2020. They are all healed up and they are fine, it was not the bad kind. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced choking experience in which her throat tickled, and dizziness, dehydrated, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does, couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction all on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown.   Clinical course was reported as follows. She mentioned that she was fine for 20-30 minutes to an hour after she got home. That afternoon, she noticed that her bowel movement was regular, constant, and repeating which was not normal and would typically indicate SIBO (Small intestine bowel overflow) in which the colon empties everything. She mentioned that this was indicative of her gluten allergy. She reported having had bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction she has to plants like lectin and gluten especially due to the irritable bowel system-her whole bowel system will empty and she will have to replace 2 days worth of food. With this event starting 01Mar2021 her bowels just kept emptying and emptying. During dinner while she was eating and watching tv, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, and a choking episode in which her throat tickled, and dizziness that she couldn&#39;t get up. She took hot water for the tickling sensation and took one aspirin for the other symptoms, but she still did not feel very well. She went to bed at 9pm but couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, she only slept like 2-3 hours long which she can get from Novocaine with her teeth. She got up 3 times and excreted a cup of urine per time. In the morning, she woke up and excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does. She got herself weighed and had a weight of 109lbs versus the normal 122lbs which indicated that she was really dehydrated so she took her fluids and ate breakfast. Other than this, she mentioned that she got up today and felt fine and feels that in 2 days she will be fine. She felt pretty good and she was going to run but did not dare burn any more calories or fluids so she is sitting still and taking it easy. Regarding outcome of event she reported the pounding pressure like high blood pressure are better, fine# she had a normal breakfast# she can get around and do whatever she needs around the house except she needs now to spend the day recouping from the dehydration so she needs pay attention to what she eats and drinks. She mentions that she runs 3-4 miles a day and tries to be active for her age. She is asking if she can take the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. She is unsure if this is an allergic reaction or something psychological. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself.

I still have to go to my neurologist and my artery doctor because they said my arteries in my head on that side is narrowing, were narrowed. So, I am in for a long holiday. I had to go to a lot of doctors to figure out what they are going to do, and I am sleeping a lot, there is something wrong. I just want Pfizer to know just something not right with that. If you want also my husband but he came with me and he had shot with me.

                                                The morning after Mom&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer shot, Dad woke up and found Mom lying on the floor next to the bed.  Mom said, &#34;I can&#39;t move my arm.&#34; Dad called paramedics who checked her.  They said her vital signs were normal and left.  On 2/9/21 in the morning my da awoke to see that Mom had large amounts of bubbly saliva pouring from her mouth onto her pillow.  Dad called paramedics, who said this was a diabetic reaction.  Mom had NEVER had anything happen like this before.  Mom was very sleepy, could not be aroused, and made only gurgling noises.  She was admitted to the hospital for care and therapy.  She pulled her own IV out.  Mom had to be restrained in the hospital and sedated, due to confusion and worsening dementia.  By 2/18 when we spoke by phone mom&#39;s speech was abnormally slow and very repetitive.  &#34;I&#39;m very tired today&#34; was spoken many times.  In morning time mom was able to follow basic conversation.  Not so later in the day.  Mom came home from rehab on 2/26/21.  She was able to walk steadily and independently at home after her therapy.  After a week or so, Mom began hitting the in-home caregiver.  Dad&#39;s presence would calm her.  In a short time Mom seemed not to know dad anymore, and would hit him and the caregiver when they helped her.  She also pulled all covers off the bed and pulled clothes out of the closet, throwing them all over the room during the night.  Mom was usually walking around the house during each night.  On 4/16/21 Mom and dad were napping sitting up on the couch in the morning.  Mom fell forward and hit her head on the hearth.  Dad and caregiver gave first aid and called paramedics, who took her to the ER.  Mom came home on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 Mom pulled her catheter out in the early morning.  In the afternoon Mom&#39;s appearance was concerning, so Dad called paramedics.  They said that Mom&#39;s BP had dropped very low and took her to the ER. Mom was combative the next day in the hospital.  Dr. adjusted her medications periodically to ensure that mom&#39;s care would be manageable when she would eventually be sent home.  Minimal therapy was done due to dementia.  By 5/3/21 doctor said that Mom is bed bound and needing total care.  Her blood sugar spiked high despite special diet.  Staff waiting for insulin order from doctor.  5/4/21 Doctor called Dad to say that Mom had died during the night.

An 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid right on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as unknown, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter stated that since then (having both doses of the vaccine), she has been to the emergency room 4 different times experiencing side effects. She has a metallic taste and horrible smell that she experienced in which it made her not want to eat or drink. She has minor hallucinations, chills, joint pain, and her tissue is tender. Her joint pain has improved. Then stated, &#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to die from it.&#34; She asked if anyone has reported these reactions previously and what should she do about them. Her family physician&#39;s nurse looked up a study in which 11% of the patients were experiencing a metallic taste. Also stated, &#34;This is very discouraging and depressing.&#34; The outcome of the event joint pain was recovering while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of minor hallucinations cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.

                                                Patient is an 80 y/o right handed female who is totally independent at baseline who received her Pfizer vaccine out of the country (1st dose 2/19/21, 2nd dose 3/12/21).  She was reactive to both shots, reporting arthralgias, headache, low grade fever, chills. She had a rise in blood pressure later during the day of her shot as well as the next day (up to 180/70, from baseline of 130/70). She also had an episode of epistaxis several days after her first shot.  She traveled independently out of the country on 3/31/21 to visit her son on a leisure trip. On 4/5/21 she had headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, and did not feel well, and her systolic BP was 198, after which she took additional 40 mg of lisinopril.   Her BP subsequently decreased to systolic BP of 130 mm Hg on 4/5/21, but over the next few days she had labile BP with a range of BP of 125 to 171/ 58 - 68.  She was meticulous in checking and recording her BP several times a day, and she increased her lisinopril dose to 40 mg po qd from 20 mg po qd given the higher than usual blood pressure range.  On 4/10/21 her BP was as follows: 6:30 am, 148/60 (she took her daily lisinopril 20 mg po); 11:30 am:  132/52; 3 pm: 171/69 (she took additional lisinopril 20 mg po) after which her systolic BP decreased to 130. Then around 6:20 pm the same day (4/10/21), she had acute onset of headache, vomiting, left sided weakness, SBP 220, and was witnessed to have rapid change in mental status. There was no antecedent trauma to the head. EMTs were called immediately and she had loss of consciousness during the ambulance ride to the ED, after about 20 minutes of symptom onset, with agonal breathing and bradycardia to the 40s, but never lost her pulse. Upon arrival to the ED out of the country, her Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, she was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Head CT demonstrated massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage (140 cc) within the R temporal parietal and occipital lobes, with cerebral edema and 14 mm midline shift, associated with small subdural hematoma and small intraventricular hemorrhage within the temporal horn and body of the R lateral ventricle. They reported hyperdense &#34;spot sign&#34; within the intraparenchymal hematoma compatible with active hemorrhage, no evidence of venous thrombosis, no masses, no arteriovenous malformations. She had 2.5 mm aneurysm right  that was thought to be incidental finding unrelated to her event. She was taken emergently to the OR on 4/10/2021 for decompressive R hemicraniectomy, which she underwent successfully with minimal blood loss.  She had no coagulopathy and her platelets and hemoglobin were normal. She remained in the Neuro ICU for 3 weeks. She received a tracheostomy two weeks after her presentation, and was weaned off the ventilator. She is breathing spontaneously after 5 weeks from presentation. She remains in coma or minimally conscious state, with GCS score of 5-6 as of 5/13/2021.

The patient was found not to be diabetic and was given some crackers, juice and water. She was offered to go to a private room for further monitoring, but declined. Her condition did not improve, so she was taken to a private room for monitoring and observation at about 2:30PM. Vitals were taken, she was still feeling poorly and had very high blood pressure (&gt;200 systolic). She declined the ED. At 2:40PM, her blood pressure did not decrease, so the ED was called to take her in, and she agreed.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                my head and ears closed down; my head and ears closed down; she doesn&#39;t sleep all night long; her body was shaking; my heart was beating out of my chest; felt a little lazy and tired; tinge-y pains in her heart; SVT; shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at Single Dose (dose unknown; by injection once to left upper arm) for covid-19 immunisation, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.75 mg once a day, and orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.88 mg, once a day for thyroid disorder.  Medical history included cancer, heart stents, irregular high blood pressure, breathing problem, underactive thyroid, back problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient took a flu shot 20 years ago for immunization and got really sick, took Pneumonia shots for immunization and was fine.  On 19Jan2021, the patient had a little lazy and tired. On 21Jan2021, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off; beating so fast and rapid it, and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head; on 21Jan2021, her body was shaking. In Jan2021, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath; she had SVG, she thought, it was irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart. Details were as follows: On 22Jan2021, she woke up in the morning around 3-4 am and said &#34;my heart was beating out of my chest and my head and ears closed down.&#34; The sensation subsided by 8 am. She called her family MD who did not respond so the following Monday she was in contact with her cardiologist who put her on a Holter monitor for a few days. He later told her she had SVT and prescribed a beta blocker for her to take. The patient stated &#34;I am so allergic to medicine.&#34; She took Plavix after a stent 5 years ago and was fine taking it for a few years. Then she had another stent placed, was prescribed Plavix again, and was &#34;so sick and dizzy and short of breath - it was the Plavix.&#34; States that she can take Cipro, ibuprofen, and synthroid and that her list of allergies is about &#34;2 pages long.&#34;  The patient wanted to know if she should take the second dose? her cardiologist advised that she not take it. Caller states she doesn&#39;t want to take the second dose and probably won&#39;t. She had a long history of allergic reactions to medications. She never had the flu, she hasn&#39;t had mumps, chicken pox, measles, occasionally, rarely a cold, about 20 years ago, she took a flu vaccine and got so sick after the shot and never took it again, she never got the flu, she does take Pneumonia shots and was fine. States she seems to have a natural immunity against typical disease you can catch. Other things, she had cancer, heart stents, and things of that sort, as far as infectious diseases, she had no problems. She had a reaction she thinks came from the COVID shot. She had a blood test and it showed her thyroid went a bit more underactive, so about 2 weeks ago, her Synthroid was raised from 0.75mg to 0.88mg, so 0.88mg was a new medication, but it was minimal. Communication: Caller was advised to slow down to assure accurate documentation. Synthroid 0.75mg: no NDC, lot, expiry. States this has been her only change in meds recently. She got that Synthroid the same day as she got her COVID vaccination, which was 19Jan2021, that afternoon, she got a Pfizer COVID vaccination. Also she got a prescription for her new Synthroid. The first day, 19Jan2012, she had no reaction at all, she took two Tylenol, someone suggested. She felt a little lazy and tired, for the rest of Tuesday, then Wednesday she felt more tired, she laid around on the couch watching TV, she stayed in her pajamas, had no serious reaction, just tired, then Tuesday and Wednesday, and then on Thursday night, she never did anything on Thursday either, she went to grocery store, was not feeling better, and on Thursday, 21Jan2021, at 3AM, she was awakened from sleeping, she did not sleep all night long, she got up often, her heart, she never had this before and had 3 stents, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off, it was beating so fast and rapid and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head, and this went on, she didn&#39;t want to call, she lives by herself on a farm, and thought to wait and see if it goes away, and about 7AM, it was basically really bad from 3AM to 5AM, and at 7AM it went away, the rapid heartbeat was so far throughout and her body was shaking, and chest was so she never had it happen before.  At 8AM she called her family doctor office, she wanted to go and see them and she was told she wasn&#39;t in that day, they would send a note in the computer to get back with her. The doctor did not get back with her all day Friday, and then she felt ok Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath, but her heart didn&#39;t feel like it was beating out of rhythm. Then Monday morning she called her heart doctor, he said he doesn&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t sound to him like it was the Synthroid, since it was a small change of dose, but he didn&#39;t know about COVID but he hadn&#39;t heard it as being an after effect, but he said to come by 2:30PM on Monday, to be fitted with a heart monitor, which she wears on her heart and it listens 24/7, listens to her heart function, so she wore that, he said to bring it back on Monday and leave it in the office, and she did that, she wore it Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, she never had that really huge feeling in her in heart anymore, she thought it was a waste of time, then she got a call from the heart doctor on Tuesday, he asked how she was feeling, she said she was fine, and sorry if she caused a commotion and he said she has a heart problem now, she said she didn&#39;t feel anything, but her heart is beating erratically, and he doesn&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t feel it, he said she has SVG, she thinks, it is irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart and he says he will send in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a beta blocker, she thinks Metoprolol. The pharmacy just got the medicine in and she is sitting there waiting now. He told her a couple months ago, her heart sounds fine, there seemed to be nothing the matter. She asked if it was the COVID vaccine, he said he doesn&#39;t know, and she asked if she should take the second dose on 09Feb2021, he said no, he doesn&#39;t think he wants her to take it, she is going to see him in 2 weeks and will try the medicine, but she wanted to report what happened to her. Has Pfizer heard of anyone having rapid heartbeat after COVID vaccination. States she is overweight. Second dose is scheduled for 09Feb2021, at 1PM. Caller states going from 0.75mg to 0.88mg on Synthroid is a minimal adjustment, it can go up to the 200&#39;s for underactive thyroid, it&#39;s minimum, she is supposed to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning with water. She has had underactive thyroid since she was 20 years old, so for 40 years, and had no problems with Synthroid before. The patient had irregular high blood pressure: it is high during the night and normal during the day, and if she would take, she had been going to physical therapy, she had a back problem, it came from a different thing, her knee is bone on bone, and they want her to get a knee implant, but when she limps on her knee it makes her back, it hurts from not walking straight, so she went to physical therapy, and what was causing high blood pressure, if she took Ibuprofen or Aleve, it would significantly increase her blood pressure, so she has a sensitivity to pain medicine, especially Ibuprofen and Advil, it increases her blood pressure, and often when she doesn&#39;t have it in her system, her blood pressure is much more normal. She does not have Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil to provide lot/expiry, she is in her car. She is interested, she feels she won&#39;t take the second vaccine, she wants to see what they say, she also wants to ask how much protection with just the first shot?  The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events heart was &#39;beating out of chest&#39;, &#39;head and ears closed down&#39; was recovered in Jan2021, of other events was unknown.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 15:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.

Often trembly with complete lack of appetite (lost 6 pound in 2 weeks). Only wanted to sit or lie down- unable to  go for daily walk (no strength).  No fever or respiratory symptoms.  This extreme condition lasted for approx. 10 weeks, during which time I saw my doctors five times for diagnosis or assistance.  They could find no reason for my sudden symptoms except for adverse reaction to the vaccine, and were unable to assist.  I mostly sat and laid around  for 10/11 weeks , after which my symptoms improved gradually, and I  am feeling better at this time.

A 81-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL9261; Expiration Date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm on 01Feb2021 11:30, as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included sinusitis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy peripheral from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and anxiety. Patient explained that she had trouble with the flu shot prior, having weakness and low blood pressure and that&#39;s why she got so nervous to get it, she was exhausted from that. There were no concomitant medications. After the onset of events, her husband suggested to take benadryl, and so she took 1 yesterday. Patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine 01Feb2021. Medical Conditions was she actually had a physical a week ago, her heart is fine, the doctor said her blood work was normal. Patient was calling about the Covid Vaccine, she got it the day before yesterday. She experienced &#34;a lot of pain in the injection site (left arm) the first night after the injection. She also experienced tiredness on 01Feb2021, chills, a mild fever on 02Feb2021, one swollen lymph node on the right side on 02Feb2021 and has been feeling weak. She reported that she spoke with someone else prior to speaking with medical information and stated she gave them &#34;her information&#34; about the side effects. Her muscles aching, the chills, the swollen lymph node on the right side started on 02FEB2021. She was also mostly tired with no energy she had a little bit fever since she had the chills. She was just feeling unwell like she got the flu. Caller stated that it was just the normal flu shot, she hasn&#39;t had it for 5-6 years now. She has no lot number to provide. Her doctor said if it causes trouble then don&#39;t get it, a couple times she was in urgent care because of the low blood pressure, like she was going to pass out. The chills she just had once or twice yesterday. She didn&#39;t take a temperature. She clarifies that it was just 1 lymph node that was sore and raised, she can barely feel it today, it went down. Today she still felt the weakness and tiredness. Caller would like to know if it was ok for her to take Tylenol for her post vaccination symptoms. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure abnormal was low and blood test was normal. Investigation assessment included All tests were normal. Patient does have anxiety; however, caller thinks that it was this covid situation and the depressing news every day.

                                                Two days after patient&#39;s first vaccine@ about 4 pm, I could tell that something was wrong with her. Every day she and I play cards, but this day she was really struggling. She couldn&#39;t figure out where any of the cards went, and was missing every play. I tool her up to lay down. At about 6pm, her eyes looked really glassy and she was unable to speak clearly. Her words were very slurred, and her sentences did not make any sense. I called 911, and they came and took her to the ER. The doctors said that she had a small stroke. She was put on a low dosage of blood pressure medicine, and was hospitalized for 6 days to monitor her. During that time many tests were run on her.  2nd Vaccine- 2-24-21 Two hours after returning from getting the second vaccine, the patient went upstairs to go to the bathroom and she passed out onto the bathroom floor. Again, when talking to her, her words were slurred. She was very weak. I called 911 again. Initially they were not going to take her, but when she went to get up she fell back down. She was too weak to walk, so they took her to the ER again. She was released to go home that evening. Sher saw her primary doctor and was referred by her oncologist to see a hematologist. She endured a three month waiting period until she could be tested for APLS. She will go this Friday to find out the reslts of that test. Additionally, she saw her vascular neurologist, Dr. He looked at her scans and said it was NOT a stroke. He said that  her body basically had a surge as a result of trying to fight off the vaccine. He said that the CAT scan that was done at the time she went to the ER the first time did NOT indicate signs of a new stroke, but that what they were seeing on the scans was from her past stroke. Dr. said that he saw no indication that she had another stroke and that her body was just reacting to the vaccine. He said that all of the symptoms that she had were all things that could happen because of the surge.

                                                accompanied with a panic attack; 2nd dose- went into a tachycardia event that was beyond anything she has ever had in the past 40 years; trauma; 2nd dose- extremely exhausted; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported for herself. An 81-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (fairly early in the day) (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) as 2ND DOSE,SINGLE for covid-19 immunization, at the age at vaccination of 81 years old.  Anatomical Location of Administration of Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: She did not really remember but she tends to think it was in her right arm for both. Medical history included tachycardia (This all started when she was 43 years old, and usually gets them periodically; benign with a regular rhythm), ongoing panic attack had for 40 years, ongoing anxiety (reported as she was an anxious person and at first she thought that it was just her anxiety kicking in but the event was beyond anything in 40 years that she has ever experienced). Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6200) for covid-19 immunization and experienced tired a little bit. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced 2nd dose- went into a tachycardia event that was beyond anything she has ever had in the past 40 years (hospitalization) on 17Mar2021 with outcome of recovered on unknown date, accompanied with a panic attack (hospitalization) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, 2nd dose- extremely exhausted (non-serious) on 15Mar2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Mar2021, trauma (non-serious) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Reported as she got her second dose on 15Mar2021 and both her husband and her were extremely exhausted, not sleepy, just tired. They were told to expect that though. There was no pain or nothing at the injection site for her. Then 2 days later she went into a tachycardia event that was beyond anything she has ever had in the past 40 years. She knew how to take care of these events and they are usually accompanied with a panic attack and she can usually calm it with breathing. But this was extreme, it was beyond anything in the past 40 years that she has ever experienced. Her husband took her to the hospital and they checked her out and she was okay and her heart did calm down. But what was interesting was that ever since that event on 15Mar2021 she had not had 1 panic attack or one tachycardia episode. She had a slight one not to long ago but it was not like the ones that she used to get. She used to get these events fairly often in a short period of time. She is not sure if the COVID vaccine did anything, but she was grateful if it did but she just wanted to make that comment about the good. 2nd dose- She was extremely exhausted and this began soon after she had the COVID vaccine fairly early in the day. Her and her husband came home soon afterwards and looked at each other and said that they were tired and it was not sleepiness, it was not like they needed a nap. It was profound tiredness and exhaustion. Her husband had it more so but they were both in bed for a couple hours. Neither had pain in the injection site though. This lasted for several hours into the evening. 2nd dose- Her tachycardia event was on 17Mar2021 which was two days after her COVID vaccine. Her husband took her to the emergency room in the early evening that day and when she got there the event was still occurring but it was not as severe. She was in the emergency room for a couple of hours, so late that night she was released and when she went home she was tired. Which she usually is tired after her tachycardia events occur. But while in the emergency room everything checked out. She confirms that she has recovered completely. She was curious if anyone else has reported anything with this same kind of thing she has experienced. She is amazed because she has had lots of trauma in the last week with her grandson and normally an event like that would have her over the top but she has been calm about it. He was 21 years old and he attempted suicide and she cannot believe it. He was out of state and she was so close to him. At the very last moment he told his dad that he is making a mistake and he just can not stand the isolation from college. This normally would send her into the worst but she has been very calm and maybe it just has not all hit her yet and then also the recent events with her husband would normally make her very frightened. She is glad that she has not had any tachycardia events but this all started when she was 43 years old and she usually gets them periodically. She declined a transfer since it is lunch time and she needs to wake her husband for his lunch. She remembered reading articles while she was waiting for her first dose and tachycardia jumped out at her as a side effect and her husband first thought was that seeing that triggered her but she didn&#39;t have anything after the first dose so she dismissed it but then it occurred after her second dose. She was more amazed that she has not had an attack since then and she has not had any tachycardia and she has had them for years and she is just so grateful. The events require a visit to Emergency Room. Not to Physician Office: not really because she did it on her own and then she got in contact with her doctors.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested

As the day progressed and I revisited the episode, I consider that it was an aberrant event that I should report.  I am journaling each day in case this or something else occurs.

Attempted to vomit but only gaged.  Friend called at 700am and I wasn&#39;t making much sense.  Later in the day I seemed alright, became cold in the evening and fever had returned.  At 4 am morning of 2/17 I woke up soaking wet.  Went back to sleep and seemed to be fine when I got up at 8am.  It is now 2 weeks since I had this shot and I have experienced no further problems.  My daughter-in-law Is a doctor and she said I should report these side effects.

She then went out, got lunch, brought it home, nothing about the day was out of the ordinary other than the vaccination.  She often stays up too late and watches TV in her recliner and falls asleep.  She guesses she didn&#39;t put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn&#39;t come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn&#39;t remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn&#39;t remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI&#39;s, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn&#39;t think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn&#39;t understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.

An 82-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 11:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, at 82 years old. Medical history included history of a stroke from an unknown date (previous history of a stroke 19 months ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2(Lot# EW5318) on 07Feb2021, at 82 years old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event (no reaction). Other historical vaccine included Flu shot (influenza vaccine) on an unspecified date and experienced almost killed her. The patient reported no reaction and no problems (no pain, no nausea, no anything) from the second dose until the evening of 08Mar2021 when she was in her kitchen cooking and chopping vegetables, she felt the sudden urge to faint and then became so dizzy that she had to lie down on the couch. She had an overwhelming feeling of dizziness. A feeling like she wanted to faint, and she never faints. Her daughter got her to the sofa. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. The room spun unbelievably. Everything spun. She went to bed and when she woke up, she felt worse. She states that the dizziness was worse, she was unable to visually focus, if she closed her eyes and she opened one eye it would be blurry and the people on TV were sliding off the screen and  everything was sliding away, and she had pain behind her left eye into her head. When she tried to get up to go to the bathroom the room was spinning. It lasted through the next day (09Mar2021). When she got up, she couldn&#39;t put her two feet on the floor out of bed without leaning towards the left. She didn&#39;t fall. It was so bad she had to grab onto things to walk.  During that day they brought her downstairs and she stayed on the sofa and it just got worse. Her daughter had her call her primary care doctor and he said that if her neurologist had heard any of what had happened, then go to the emergency room, to which is where she was 19 months ago with her stroke. She spent the 11Mar2021 and 12Mar2021 in hospital (due to dizziness). They couldn&#39;t find anything. She had not had a new stroke.  She had every test known to man. They did a full neurological work up including an MRI, CT Scan, carotid artery studies and checked everything and could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke. The told her that she could potentially have an inner ear problem or problems with the &#34;crystals in her ear&#34; which could be causing her dizziness, however, they could not positively identify the cause of her problem. They found evidence of her previous stoke. When they were sending her home, it says on her discharge paperwork, they were going to put her in a vestibular clinic. It has to do with crystals in her ear. She was still dizzy and still walking with a walker which she hasn&#39;t had to use in 19 months since her stroke. And she has slept a lot, the night she was discharged on 12Mar2021 and the following day. On 14Mar2021 she woke up a little bit. But on 15Mar2021, she is very tired and very weak and still very dizzy. The dizziness is not the room revolving kind. She is taking an anti dizzy pill. She has to see her doctor tomorrow morning, her neurologist at hospital. The dizziness is still persisting but not as bad and she can jump up and walk and do things with the walker. Regarding tests done at the hospital, she came out with shining colors apparently.  All tests came through fine. There was no evidence of stroke, her blood pressure, triglycerides, fluids or liquids, everything tested perfect. When querying if she had gone to her physician&#39;s office, she reported she had a morning call with her doctor on a phone appointment and he sent her straight to the hospital. She is still dizzy and walking with a walker which she has not had to use in 19 months. She states that doing a lot of hand-eye coordination exercises at home. She has the television on to check her vision which seems to be returning to normal. She stated, &#34;I just don&#39;t know where to go from here.&#34; She stated that she has a follow up appointment the following day with her neurologist. She wanted to know if this side effect has been reported and how long she can expect to feel this way.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on Mar2021 which included blood pressure, triglyceride, fluids or liquids: tested perfect; and CAT scan, EKG had unknown results. On 11Mar2021, CT Scan: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem); MRI: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of overwhelming feeling of dizziness and unable to visually focus. Outcome of the event dizziness was not recovered; outcome of the event unable to visually focus (visual disturbance) was recovered on an unspecified date in Mar2021; while room was spinning (spinning sensation) was recovered on 09Mar2021, while unknown for the other events.

                                                4/10/21 ER HPI: 82 y.o. female who presents to the Emergency Department by paramedics from a local nursing home.  The patient is an 82-year-old female with a known history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.  She presented to the emergency room after being transported from a local nursing home.  Apparently, the patient was acting a little bit more confused than normal and she was looking more short of breath than normal.  The nursing home nurse stated that her oxygen saturations were in the upper 80s without oxygen and the patient looked visibly more short of breath than normal.  Because of this, the nursing home made the decision to send the patient in.  When paramedics arrived at the nursing home they placed 2 L of oxygen on her and her oxygen saturations went up into the high 90s.  The patient does dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She did not miss a dialysis treatment this week.  The patient has had her coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and several months ago did have coronavirus (COVID-19) at the local nursing home.  The patient does have mild dementia and so is somewhat of an unreliable historian.  Transferred to pleural effusion

An 82-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261; Expiration Date: 31May202, NDC: 59267-1000-2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 06Feb2021 at 12:00 as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing emphysema, ongoing breast cancer from 2007 (she did not take chemo, just radiation) and ongoing follicular lymphoma from 2014 (did not take chemo, just radiation. Cancer was in the bone marrow, said she didn&#39;t think that has anything to do with it, has had two operations) and bone marrow cancer. The patient previously took budesonide/ formoterol fumarate (SYMBICORT) she was using SYMBICORT, but her doctor switched it a few months ago, back to ANORO), prochlorperazine maleate (COMPAZINE) she takes a couple of times per month, takes 10mg when she feels nauseated and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) she takes when she needs it. Concomitant medications included furosemide (LASIX) at 40 mg, twice a day (one 40mg pill in the morning and one 40mg pill at night) from 1985 to an unspecified date and then increased to 80 mg, twice a day (two pills (80mg total) in the morning and two (80 mg total) at night) from on an unspecified date and ongoing for blood pressure; ongoing simvastatin (ZOCOR) taken for high triglycerides; umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol trifenatate (ANORO). Patient thought she has been on Lasix since 1985 but can&#39;t remember back that far. She was taking Zocor for a long time and stated Anoro Inhaler was a fairly new medication. For Anoro inhaler, patient stated she pulls back the thing and didn&#39;t know, maybe it pinches a pill and inhales the white powder. Relevant family medical history included none and both parents were deceased. Patient stated that her oncologist does blood tests once every four months, a test for markers and stuff like that, CBC, metabolic panel and bloodwork every 4 months. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL3246, Expiration date: 30Apr2021, NDC: 59267-1000-2) via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 14Jan2021 12:00 pm for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that, the patient has very sexy legs, but she doesn&#39;t anymore, says she got lymphedema about 5-6 days after the second Pfizer vaccine in Feb2021. She was now going to physical therapy, to bear her out and try to understand what she&#39;s saying. Caller states 30% of the people there that have had cancer and had radiation, get the same side effect she has had, some people have it in the arms, she got hers in her leg, says she has intense swelling, called lymphedema, says her legs look like they belong on an elephant. Caller said at the physical therapy place, 30% of people who have come in for help had radiation treatment for some kind of cancer, all have different kinds of cancer, but the swelling, the lymphedema, was the side effect they&#39;ve all experienced. Caller states that no one has called Pfizer and let Pfizer know, states she won&#39;t take the booster, won&#39;t have anything to do with this, says it&#39;s too scary. Caller states she was an active person, never had a problem with legs swelling or anything like that and now, her look like legs that belong on an elephant. Caller states the correlation seems to be with radiation treatment, because she has bone marrow cancer, and other ladies have breast cancer, states the only thing we all have in common was different treatments but in her own case she had no chemo, but she did have radiation. It seems like with radiation this swelling was an after effect. Caller says it&#39;s 2 or 3 things, not just that they had cancer or radiation treatment, says those of us who had radiation also got this swelling. Caller states she never had any trouble with legs or anything, says she was an active person. States some people experienced this four days after the vaccine, says hers started six days after the vaccine, says she woke up one morning, and her legs were huge. States usually legs were smaller in the morning. Caller wonders what were the ingredients that causes swelling. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it, says like overnight turned a switch on and now her legs were going to be big and fat and ugly. Caller states the reason she&#39;s calling was because at physical therapy last Thursday, other people who had the shot had the same side effect, says the only thing the lady said, she wasn&#39;t sure if she was a nurse or not, was the relationship was not with the kind of cancer, but the radiation treatment and the shot has been causing this and wasn&#39;t surprised. Caller says she was told that about 30% that they&#39;re handling now had the Pfizer vaccine. Caller thinks that&#39;s all they gave in the state NC, no other vaccine here, says it just seems to be with this. Caller states the lymphedema, hers was in her legs, others have it in their arms, she doesn&#39;t know why it&#39;s happening. Caller states about six days after the second shot, she can&#39;t remember exactly what day, about six to seven days, she woke up one morning, and her legs were hurting like the devil in Feb2021, stated her legs were about six times the size they should be in Feb2021. Caller states usually in the morning, the swelling goes down, but this woke her up out of the blue like zap, says no warning, no nothing, just one day she woke up and that where it was. Caller states her doctor increased Lasix, she used to take one 40mg pill in the morning and one 40mg pill at night, increased it to two pills (80mg total) in the morning and two (80 mg total) at night. Caller states she is now only taking one-and-a-half-pills this morning, because she doesn&#39;t feel right and she was peeing too much in Feb2021 and was not feeling right. She doesn&#39;t want to get dehydrated. Caller states she has a doctor appointment 10Jun2021 and was going to tell him she was taking less because she was just so weak in Feb2021. Says she was weak because she&#39;s taking too much Lasix, states she was taking two 40mg morning and night. Caller states she was just concerned, she has big legs, fat legs, she calls them fat. The patient not visited emergency room. The events result in the patient visited physician office. Patient reported that she has had no shots for four months however she was going to get the high dose flu shot on 01Oct2021. No relevant tests were performed at the time of this report.

We took her to her doctor and she thought she had a stroke.  We went to the ER for every test possible.  She became disoriented and also had to put adult briefs on her.  On Sunday she was driving and on Monday she was totally disoriented.  My dad called and I rushed home 2 1/2 hours away.  This was a terrifying event.   She was glossy eyed and couldn&#39;t read.  She didn&#39;t have any paralysis; thank goodness.  It was all pretty much mental.

An 83-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: TL9261, expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 16:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and there were no concomitant medications. On 25Jan2021, the patient experienced having acid reflux, pain in her chest/stomach that lasted all night last night and was worse when lying down. When she burped, it relieved some pressure. She had strange visions flashing in her head while trying to sleep on 25Jan2021. The patient was wondering if she was having a reaction from the vaccine. On 25Jan2021, after over an hour after the vaccine, she started having severe pain in the chest and stomach area and she couldn&#39;t sleep last night at all. She was awake all night, burping up acid. She was wondering if those were reaction to the vaccine, should she go see her doctor or what should she do about that. She got her first dose on 25Jan2021 and she started having chest and stomach pain the same day at about 6 PM. She was burping acid all night and early in the morning of 26Jan2021 and she was having these strange things like pictures going to her head that were weird. She was not sleeping but they were strange images, they were strange, they weren&#39;t normal. She says with that added in it sounds crazy. She has her vaccine card that says she should get the next one 15Feb2021. She wanted to avoid catching the corona. She had drank acid yesterday and she was wondering if that was causing her to have acid reflux. She clarified that she drank a lot of acidic liquids on 25Jan2021 and she was wondering if that might have had something to do with it, like orange juice and cranberry juice so she is wondering did that have anything to do with it, the acidity maybe made her stomach have acid reflux because she has had that in the past. She asked if she should go to the doctor. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Brought to ER The Four Paramedics that came to take her to the ER stated they were overwhelmed with calls for post covid vaccine problems and that ALL of their vehicles were out on calls many due to this.  Agressive workup including CT, EKG, Cardiac monitoring, CTA neck and Brain, Carotid and peripheral dopplers and vascualar surgeon consultation revealed nothing. Told it temporally had to be assoc with the vaccine??  I am reporting so that this can be evaluated for confirmation.

At late in the day on 04Mar2021, she experienced a lot of problems which she mentioned was the worst experience in her life. She was 99% sure it was from the vaccine because she didn&#39;t experience anything like that before getting the vaccine. She mentioned that she experienced side effects all night like her heart beating really fast, a headache, a stiff neck, her nerves pounding all throughout her body, and a blood pressure of 174/78. She mentioned that it was the worst she&#39;s felt so far as compared to going to the ER, as she&#39;s experienced before.

She mentioned that it was horrible, very scary, she was very ill, very uncomfortable, really bad, and didn&#39;t want to go through that again. She didn&#39;t know if she would make it through the night. She was asking for what to do and asking if there needed to be an adjustment for her dose because she was a very small person. She didn&#39;t want to have the 2nd shot if she went through that again. It was the worst experience of her life. She was not sure what to do now about her second shot. She had the first shot 02Mar2021 and everything was fine, 03Mar2021 she was okay but on 04Mar2021 she had, by night time, she had a lot of scary things that had never happened to her before. Her heart was pounding she could hear it in her ears. Her head, her neck felt stiff and her head felt heavy, her whole body felt heavy and like the nerves in her whole body were just aggravated, it was hard to explain. She had ringing in her ears. Her blood pressure was 174/78 and she was just afraid to have the second shot, it was scary, it was really bad. She was wondering if the amount of the vaccine was too much for her.  She confirmed it was the evening 04Mar2021 when all this began. She said all of this was pretty well recovered at this point. She said the day after that happened, she was shaky but today (08Mar2021) she was fine. She did not know what it would be medications they are looking for but she was on normal medicine for old people she guesses. This was so bad that she really was not going to take the second dose unless they can tell her if she should or that they should give her less or something like that. The outcome of events was recovered in Mar2021.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a Contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was none medical history. Concomitant medication included atenolol taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Her leg was swollen and there was edema and there was a lump on the side and it was pink or getting red and she was on medicine (Clarification Unknown) for 7 days, twice a day and the leg is still (incomplete sentence), the edema has gone down some. The leg was still pink and it is tender to touch and if she stand on her leg for too long or walking around too much it hurts. She got pain. She was also sleeping whereby she was watching television and all of sudden she was sound sleep and she wake up over an hour or two after that and then she awake for a while but she have no trouble sleeping at night again. She had chest pain and it&#39;s not angina because that she did have (Further clarification was unknown if consumer had angina in past hence not captured on tab) but it&#39;s a sharp pain and it does not want her taking Nitroglycerin because it went away and it last for maybe (incomplete sentence) it just like a stabbed wound. She was dizzy. That&#39;s still, it&#39;s not like what it was but it is getting less but she was still dizzy. She cannot walk a straight line. She lived in an apartment house and she had to walk down the hall to go down the stair but she sometime had to stop because she was dizzy. she kind of lean against the wall for few seconds and then she continued on. Concern was not the word for it. It made her very nervous and the circulation was very poor in both feet now and one leg, the right leg that has the pink and still the tenderness in that leg. The foot turns very dark pink and the big toe that she had turned dark purple. She wrote everything down and she will say this at the time after the injection she did not have any problem until about four days later but she did have problem with doing my cross- word puzzles and doing her puzzles. She could not do any of her puzzles, nothing was computing in her brain (Clarification unknown) but that&#39;s coming back slowly, so is that to be expected. Start date of event: Consumer stated &#34;It was 4 days after the 5th, about 09Feb2021. She went there and saw a doctor an MD of course and she went there on 12th so it was a week later. She went because the pain was terrible. The outcome of events Leg is still pink and it is tender to touch; If I stand on my leg for too long or walking around too much it hurts, I got pain; Dizzy; is not recovered, all of sudden she was sound sleep; Cannot walk a straight line; Nervous; Circulation is very poor in both feet now; Foot turns very dark pink and the big toe that I have turned dark purple; Nothing was computing in my brain; pain was terrible was unknown, outcome of the other events was recovering. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

The patient received her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 21Feb2021, and her arm was sore on the 21Feb2021 (that night) and on the 22Feb2021 (next day) but went away. The pain came back  two and a half weeks later, and her 2nd shot was scheduled for this 13Mar2021 (Saturday). It seemed like it was okay after the first two days, but now it was back. Her arm had been sore, all week; on 10Mar2021 (today) it was really sore. She also mentioned her right leg was bothering her (start date: unspecified), but she didn&#39;t think that&#39;s related to the vaccine. She did not know if it was like just really dull before and she did not really notice it. It seemed like it was okay, and all of a sudden, each day she felt a little sore and today was really sore. She confirmed after the vaccine she had arm soreness and the arm soreness was getting worse. On 13Mar2021 (Saturday), it would be 3 weeks since she received the first dose. She took ADVIL as treat-ment, and but it didn&#39;t seem to help (Usually, ADVIL helps her). She did have TYLENOL and wanted to know if you can alternate TYLENOL and ADVIL. While attempting to provide email she commented her mind went blank and she was unable to think of her email address to provide (start date: unspecified). In concern to height, she thought she had shrunk. She wanted to know if it was normal for the pain to come back after about 2 and a half, almost 3 weeks and since this arm was sore, will she have to get it in her other arm. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of arm soreness and arm soreness was getting worse/arm was sore. The outcome for arm soreness and arm soreness was getting worse/arm was sore was not recovered, and for another event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch cannot be obtained.

                                                I just got done going to the bathroom (2-4-2021) and was zipping up my pants  when I fainted.  I fell backwards into the bathtub  knocking down both shower doors.  My legs were hanging over the edge of the tub.  One shower door fell on my upper right chest area.   This happened just over 24 hours from when I received the vaccine.  I had not felt bad at all from the vaccine.  Didn&#39;t sleep too well that night (2-4-2021) because I hurt due to the fall.  I called my doctor on 2-5-2021 to let her know I fainted 24 hours after receiving the vaccine and wondered if that was due to it.  I do feel weak today (2-5-2021).

                                                Patient is a 84-year-old female presenting to the emergency room with anxiousness, generalized weakness and one episode of vomiting/nausea surrounding her Covid vaccination this afternoon.  On exam patient appears mildly anxious, has no evidence of allergic reaction, lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.  Patient is resting comfortably, speaking in complete sentences.  Shortly after physical exam patient was noted to have oxygen saturation of 90 to 92%, subsequently placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  Will obtain CBC, CMP, chest x-ray, EKG.  We will also give patient 500 cc of fluid and 4 mg of Zofran for control of nausea and vomiting.  We will continue to monitor patient. No leukocytosis, no AKI, electrolytes within normal limits, chest x-ray without evidence of underlying pneumonia or pneumothorax.  I have reevaluated patient, patient has been reporting a ongoing headache for which she has a history of and takes Fioricet, requesting Fioricet.  Will order Fioricet.  We attempted to take patient off of her oxygen however when taken off the oxygen she drops to 88% on room air.  Patient reports ongoing generalized weakness and nausea which has required an additional 4 mg Zofran.  Given that patient has been monitored for couple of hours and has had ongoing nausea and vomiting, generalized weakness in the setting of hypoxia when taken off of oxygen will obtain troponins and admit patient to the hospital for obs.  I have spoken to Dr. who has accepted patient to observation with telemetry for further management.  Patient was informed of admission status, with no further questions at this time.

An 84-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 28Dec2020 by injection once to right deltoid (Batch/lot number: EL0142), second dose of BNT162B2 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021, both at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. Investigation Assessment: No. The patient had second her COVID shot, the vaccine, on 18Jan2021, and she is a very healthy 84 years old with no health problems, and she woke up on 19Jan2021, and was disoriented, she could not get her head around what day it was, this was so rare, she normally goes to the fitness center and excursuses, but her body was not responding, her brain was not working right, it was a strange ordeal, so she got in the shower, to get her circulation going, and she couldn&#39;t shower, she got all wet, and had to get out and lay on a towel, she couldn&#39;t function, it was very scary, and very atypical. Her disorientation went away by 10AM on 19Jan2021- she did not see anyone or go to a provider. Her body started not responding around 7:30 when she got up, and by 9 or 10AM, she was functioning again. The patient didn&#39;t think this was from vaccine, she had seen enough vaccine reactions to various vaccines, and this was not a vaccine reaction, she thought what is happening? Is this a stroke, or a vascular event, she has since recovered but was still very shook, anxious about what it was, what happened until an hour or so after, it was still under her. Causality: Unknown, she didn&#39;t think of the connection until someone else did, she was describing it and the other person said it was because of the vaccine, as this person was a skeptic and doesn&#39;t want the vaccine herself, and this was not a typical response, but then she got to thinking. The outcome of disoriented/disorientation and body not responding/she couldn&#39;t function was recovered on 19Jan2021, the other event was unknown. Seriousness: it was disabling at the time, she was concerned she had a stroke, she was checking her grasps and her face and legs, she was obsessing. Seriousness for disoriented/disorientation and body not responding/she couldn&#39;t function was disability.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of serious events cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  The underlying medical conditions in the advanced old patient considered confounders.

An 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm on 21Jan2021 17:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included oral cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received flu vaccine for immunization and reported that it made her sick for 10 days 4 or 5 years ago. The patient previously took Tylenol (takes 1 instead of 2, Everything she takes half the recommended dose). The patient experienced fast heartbeat, increased BP, weakness, dizziness, nausea and headache on an unspecified date in Jan2021. It was further reported that she had a fast heart beat, her blood pressure went real high, she was dizzy and weak. This was while she was there and being watched for the 15 minutes by a nurse. She is 84 years old and doesn&#39;t take any medication; she did have oral cancer but with no chemo as it had not spread and this was 2 years ago. It was explained that the patient didn&#39;t feel good about it but she drove home. When she got home she was confused and felt like she could pass out. She walked through the house didn&#39;t know who she was, she just kept walking and walking. It was a strange feeling that lasted 15-20 minutes. She called her son late in the afternoon and told him to check on her to make sure she made it through the night. She still had funny feelings over the next few days but at this point she only has the dizziness that happens occasionally. She notes also that her blood pressure was checked at home by her and was higher than normal the first few days after but is now normal. Over the next day she had a headache and a little nausea, but it was not severe. She also mentions having a little soreness in her arm but not bad. She did read about the side effects and states she had the elevated heart rate, increase in blood pressure and dizziness right after getting it. The patient wonders could she ask for smaller dose, she only weighs about 110lb. When she spoke with her doctor she was told that the COVID virus is worse than what she experienced after the vaccine. She has not been to the doctor since getting the vaccine, she just talked to them. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: high and heart rate: fast on Jan2021. The patient was recovering from dizziness, the outcome of nausea was unknown and the patient recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

Fall, potentially acute encephalopathy / confusion, hypertension (potential for non-compliance with antihypertensive medications?) - patient with known severe to advanced dementia / mild cognitive impairment.  Likely related to hypertensive encephalopathy with post-COVID vaccine prodrome with underlying advanced dementia.  Situation: hospitalization after a fall and hypertension emergency Background: Pt is an 84 y/o female pt with a log history of dementia, has been able to live alone safely until most recent illness/hospitalization. Assessment: Pt received her 2nd COVID vaccine on Saturday.  On Sunday, pt&#39;s sister was unable to get a hold of her as her sister calls her daily due to her dementia.  After several phone calls, her sister went to pt&#39;s home and found pt on her bedroom floor.  There was   some blood found, not sure from where.  Sisiter was unable to get pt up so EMS was called and pt was taken to ED.  She was evaluated, her BP was very elevated, she was admitted and testing was done.  Head CT/MRI was unchanged.  X-ray of her R shoulder shows a vertical non-displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity of the proximal humerous, no surgical intervention is recommended at this time, pt instructed to wear a sling for now. Pt is discharged home with Home Care and family support.

                                                The second dose was really  my first covid vaccine shot.  That evening for both, I started aching a lot in both arms and shoulders, couldn&#39;t sleep and extremely tired the next day.  The following day I was back to normal and the symptoms gone.  The second shot had a little stronger symptoms. I had covid in early November, 2020 in case that matters.    Also, I had a flu shot late October and had a severe reaction which led to my being diagnosed with covid.

                                                She got the vaccine, she had no effects, and no reaction whatsoever. The husband had no side effects either.   On 3/16/21 they were on their way to go to bed and the bedroom is upstairs and she was fine, she was in the bedroom getting ready for bed, and her husband followed 15 minutes later and when he got upstairs she was sitting in a chair next to the bed, and he noticed that when he spoke with her that she did not speak clearly back, and was very low tone, not much loudness to her speech.  He didn&#39;t think much about it, and he talked with her again and noticed that she seemed to be having some difficulty talking, but he could understand what she was saying if he paid close attention.  He then realized that something was wrong, and asked her how she felt and she said she felt strange.  She was trying to take a pair of socks off and could not reach them.  She tried to lift her leg to put one knee over the other for her to remove them and was not able to do that.  He helped her take the socks off, she wanted to put some cream on her foot and was not able to do so, which is her usual routine.  He put that on her foot while he was talking to her, and her speech was different than it was earlier.  She was wearing a turtle neck shirt and was not able to take it off to get dressed for bed.  Her husband assisted in dressing her to get ready for bed.  He was thinking that she may have been having a mini-stroke.  She tried to get up from the chair and was not able to get up on her own.  He went to try to help her to lift her and it was hard.  When she did get her bottom up off the chair she stayed in a bent position and was not able to stand up.  He put her back down on the chair and tried some more times, and ultimately able to get up and he was able to get her into the bed (the chair was next to the bed).  She could sit on the edge of the bed, but was not able to move her legs on her own to get into the bed.  He struggled to get her in the bed and was not in a mood to talk and just leaned over on one side to try to go to sleep.  He told her he was going to get the walker in the basement for her to use.  He brought up the walker and put in by the bed, and informed her that it was there, and reached to see where it was in the event that she needed to use it through the night.  She did get up around 3:15 this morning to use the bathroom and her husband asked if she needed assistance, and she said that she was able to get up and go to the bathroom, and moved her legs just slow and was able to use the walker.  She was feeling much better at that time.  She got up one more time during the night and was not in need of the walker and was back to bed.  This morning when they got up at 8:00 Am and she was back to her normal self.   She came down the steps and was like nothing had ever happened.  They called her son who works in the hospital and he told them to call us to see if there were any other people that had the same reaction.    She stated while he was giving me this information that she did not recall a lot of the events that he was telling me.

I spoke with her twice and my uncle and aunt checked on her three times, all three she was freezing cold and too tired to get up. In the morning, she was dazed, cold and walked to the bathroom, where she collapsed to her death. Paramedics could not revive her. My mom died Saturday morning - within the 24-hour period of her vaccine. She was feeling so great leading up to it, active, stripping the guest bedroom sheets, bubbly, and excited for us to be able to finally visit her soon.

She does have a history or heart troubles. She was washing her hair on Wednesday, and she noticed around her neck it looked swollen. Like a little band around her neck. It could have been there before the vaccine. She called her doctor that same day and she said to call Pfizer, and that she thinks she should cancel the second one. She got her first COVID vaccine on 23Jan2021, and she is scheduled for the second 13Feb2021. She does take a heart medication. The place on her neck is not itchy. She knows the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. She sees her dermatologist for Basal cells and other things that are itchy. This place on her neck, if it is a rash, is brown not red. She gets a lot of those places on her skin. Her doctor told her to call Pfizer and then cancel her second appointment. She just wants to speak to medical information first. She doesn&#39;t even know if it is a rash. She hasn&#39;t had any side effects. Her arm didn&#39;t even hurt. This little rash is only on her neck. She had worked as a dental assistant. She is just worried now about getting the second shot. The outcome of event for itchy and worried was unknown and for other events it was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

I was  totally bedridden for several days, getting up only for necessities  I lived on Ibuprofen.  I would get up, take two Ibuprofen, and sit for an hour before I could func.   My arm hurt.  The worst part is that my brain felt as if it were all swelled up, pushing against my skull.   I could not perform  normal tasks  at all ,  until the last couple of days.   I could not think, reason or remember at all until the last 2-3 days,  I had to get substitutes to teach my classes.  I could not write nor communicate  nor pay my bills.  I have a manuscript overdue.  I am now staying at night with friends, for neither they nor I trust me to function normally alone.

I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

An 85-year-old female patient started received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9264 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm, on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was received on 11Jan2021 (lot number: EL0142) Medical history included GERD. Concomitant medication included pantoprazole and other unspecified product. Patient got the first shot of the COVID vaccine three weeks ago, and she didn&#39;t know anything had happened to her. She got the second dose of the vaccine yesterday at noon, and she was fine, although she didn&#39;t sleep very well on 01Feb2021. But the morning of 02Feb2020, she went in the kitchen and dropped some blueberries because the plastic boxes don&#39;t close easily, and she bent over to pick the blueberries up and she got dizzy. She did not know why she should get suddenly dizzy, and her stomach seemed a little upset, but she has no fever on 02Feb2021. Patient was just wondering if the dizziness is a side effect of the vaccine. Patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine and stated when she had the incident where she bent over and was dizzy, it felt just really terrible, but she was feeling fine now, but the incident did shake her up a bit. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                The vaccine recipient was already diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s but was in an early stage of the condition and able to live independently.  Beginning the day after the vaccine there was a marked and sudden cognitive impairment that severely affected ability to live independently, with (subjectively) worse memory, confusion, mood swings and anger outbursts, and loss of ability to do routine household tasks that she was previously able to do consistently without difficulty (e.g. making coffee, writing checks, heating up a frozen meal).   This gradually improved over the next two months.  She has now (as of April 17, 2021) returned to her pre-shot baseline level of function.  Based on this event we have chosen not to subject her to the risk of a second shot.

The dates were: Covid-19 (Pfizer-BioNtech), given in right arm.  1st shot:  Lot # EN6198, time of vaccination unknown; 2nd shot:  Lot # EN6207, time of vaccination unknown.  On April 19, patient complained about left shoulder pain and went to see her general practitioner.  Tests were done to rule out heart issues.  On April 20, she called 911 and went to one of the two local hospitals, complaining of shoulder pain.  After an xray, the diagnosis was given as tendonitis and she was sent home and instructed to take 500mg Ibuprofen morning and evening.  On April 23, a rash became apparent on her left arm.  She had a follow-up appointment with her GP on April 27 and was  diagnosed with shingles.  She continued to get more uncomfortable and confused, and late on April 29,  a neighbor took her to the other local hospital where she was admitted.  A lumbar puncture test confirmed that she had herpes zoster virus in the spinal fluid.  She was treated in the hospital with acyclovir by IV and was released from the hospital on May 4 to a skilled nursing facility where she rehabilitated until May 14, when she was sent home.  She continues to be somewhat confused and has difficulty thinking of words - much more so than before her shingles episode.

Before giving her the vaccine she did seem nervous about it. While sitting in the waiting area after the vaccine was administered, the patient said that her angina was acting up. She did take 1 nitroglycerin tablet an got some relief.  About 15 minutes later she became agitated again and took another nitroglycerin and again got some relief.  She called a family member and explained what was happening. She did not feel that she needed an ambulance. After about an hour she was able to return to her room. I spoke to her on weekend and she felt better.

An 86-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL9262 expiry date 21May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 86 years old) at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL8982) on 22Jan2021 at single dose in upper right arm and on 22Jan2021 experienced severe headache and arm hurting. Relevant medical history includes ongoing compromised immune system diagnosed many years ago, and ongoing one kidney functioning. The patient received no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021 the patient experienced high, over the top blood pressure, delirious incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware which both required hospitalization from 13Feb2021 to 14Feb2021. It was also reported they were concerned about one kidney/ was dehydrated in 13Feb2021. On 13Feb2021 unspecified blood labs showed kidney was extremely dehydrated and Chest X-ray was good. Clinical course was reported as follows: she was just released from hospital yesterday, she took the second Pfizer COVID shot, on 12Feb2021, and became so very very ill, she expected some side effects, the first shot wasn&#39;t bad, the first all she had was a severe headache and arm hurting, but that was 3 weeks ago, and the second one she can&#39;t say how horrible it was: she had to get the paramedics there, she was very very ill. It was the worst night she has had, and she is 86 years old, and has had a multitude of serious issues but that shot was the worst. It was a combination of high blood pressure, over the top, and insomnia like she couldn&#39;t budge and open her eyes, she couldn&#39;t see anything but squares, it was like a horrible, if there is such a thing as a trip, a horrible trip, something she can&#39;t imagine wishing on anyone. The county administered it, she has several doctor, she initially provides her primary care doctor, for consent to contact, but says her nephrologist would be better, as she hasn&#39;t seen her primary care doctor in some time. Her primary care doctor doesn&#39;t know she had this, another doctor gave her permission, her nephrologist. States they were more concerned in the hospital about her kidney, she has one kidney functioning and, on mistake of the hospital, they didn&#39;t connect her to hydration, the night nurse didn&#39;t, and she was dehydrated and it was affecting her kidney. Her husband tried to call Saturday, when she had this reaction at like 06:30/07:00, but there was a huge long wait, he was calling to see about side effects, but they were beyond waiting, had to get the paramedics, her blood pressure was 178/113 and heart rate was 103. First shot was 3 weeks back. It looks like she had it on 22Jan2021, the headache and arm hurting started towards the evening, the shot was taken earlier in the day, and they started in the evening, her headache was quite severe, but with Tylenol it went away, the arm is still sore from the second vaccine, but is slightly better. Clarifies she was hospitalized for the blood pressure and delirium, like, it is best explained, like delirious: incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware, all she could see was, like if she talked about people who did LSD and trips, it was a bad trip, it was squares, she wanted to open her eyes, but could only see squares. She fell asleep Friday night about 11PM, and felt this at 04:00, and she pulled off her sleep apnea mask, she had to run to the restroom, she was weak, feeling like she would slip onto the floor, and had to get right in bed, and the insomnia continued until about 7AM, that was when she started to be able to focus on like words, she was able to say words in her mind, it was like a bad nightmare. She was admitted to the hospital, she was in the emergency room (ER), the paramedics took her there Saturday, about 07:30, took her to the hospital after immediate heart checking, an intravenous (IV) of some kind, and brought her to the hospital and she was in X-rays and what not, they did procedures in the ER, and they suggested her to be observed overnight, they watched her and things started to become more normal, but she is still not clear headed, she is woozy, like foggy. High, over the top blood pressure outcome: It has been back to a good blood pressure. Insomnia is ok- she slept ok last night. What is left: the night she woke up, so early Sunday morning, in the hospital, she was profusely sweating like someone came to her room and showered her bed with water, her sheets and blankets were soaked and this morning she woke, she got up, was still very woozy, and asked her husband to help get her out of bed, and she changed her nightgown and after an hour she got in the shower, as she was sweating again, not sweating, but occasionally on and off chills, she is taking off her nightshirt and putting on a bed jacket, she gets warm and cold, hot and cold. She had blood labs a chest X-ray, heart monitor the whole time until she was discharged, and everything was good except the kidney was extremely dehydrated. This was all on Saturday as well. On her first visit to get the vaccine, at that time, the facility was a big mall, and they handed her what to look for after the injection, and she didn&#39;t notice until this morning, it says if you have an immune system that is compromised, it could affect it, and she has immune system that is compromised diagnosed many years ago. Over the top blood pressure and insomnia had resolved, arm sore was resolving, dehydrated and affecting kidney had not resolved, final outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                Starts around 4 pm.  Lot of pain right side of face like:  1.  toothache, whole jaw aches   2.  neck arthritis   3. sinus infection  4.  ear infection all at the same time.  Strong pain all through right side of face, sometimes up through eye.  Worse lying down.  Cause?   Dental exam complete mouth x-rays indicated no problems with any teeth.  Saw Dr. 3/3/2021, was checked for ear, sinus infections, felt all around my neck, no problems.  Prescribed gabapentin, told to continue the Tylenol Arthritis I had been taking on my own.  Symptoms continue today, only right side of face, head, temple area, sometimes up through right eye, teeth on right side ache.  Only take the Tylenol once a day since that is all that I need it.  More painful if I lie down in bed at night so sit upright until pain is gone; then sleep through the night.  No problem all during the day when I?m up and around doing whatever. . .no pain then.  Someone in my dental office has the same symptoms along with Bells Palsy, was told by her doctor it&#39;s from the Covid shot and could last 3 months? Pharmacist also told me filling the gabapentin for several others with same symptoms (I live in a small town).

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

We placed her in a wheelchair and she then said that her throat was closing up.  She said that it felt like someone was choking her.  A moment later, she felt like her jaws felt huge.  We quickly gave her about four or five large glasses of water  (one right after the other) and quickly took her blood pressure which went up to 170/80.  We then gave her one of her blood pressure pills.  After this, she started to finally feel better.

An 86-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed in 1971 (reported as 50 years ago) and ongoing; type 2 diabetes in 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) which resolved in 2019 (about 2 years ago) after the patient lost some weight; she had an episode of A-Fib in 2019 when her potassium was low (lower than the current hospitalization), once the potassium was corrected, her A-Fib resolved. The physician stated that patient has shrunk and was now about 5 foot 2 inches. Clarified that this has not recently occurred since the vaccine; stated it was happening just with age. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any issues with the first dose of the vaccine. She received her second vaccine dose on 24Mar2021. The physician spoke with the patient on Friday, 26Mar2021, and the patient was fine. On Saturday, 27Mar2021, the patient had an episode of diarrhea, vomiting and was weak. The lady cleaning the patient&#39;s house found her slumped against the wall. The physician met them at the hospital and said the patient seemed okay. They thought it was just an issue from her potassium being low on Mar2021, so they gave her that. The hospital did a CT scan that showed nothing on Mar2021. The hospital did an MRI of the head that showed multiple small emboli in the brain on Mar2021. The physician believed that the patient must have thrown more clots because she became aphasic on Mar2021 and could not name things. The patient also had difficulty walking on Mar2021. The physician felt it was important to call and report this since she has heard of people throwing clots with vaccines. The physician did not know if the events were related to the vaccine. The patient was in the hospital for 7 days (as reported). She was now able to walk with some assistance. The patient&#39;s son thought that the patient was okay when he went to see her. Since the reporter was a physician, she knew which questions to ask the patient and saw that she still had some problems. The patient could remember some things but has problems with recent memories on an unspecified date in 2021. She also has some confusion on an unspecified date in 2021, such as she thought she was in a boat hospital. The physician was uncertain if the vomiting and diarrhea was somewhat better. They were wondering if the patient has some food sensitivities (2021). The patient also had carotid studies done in the hospital on Mar2021 and they were fine. They believed that patient&#39;s potassium dropped, and she went into A-Fib and threw clots on Mar2021. The clots must have come from the heart valves since the carotid studies were fine and if the clots had been in her legs, they would&#39;ve gone to her lungs not to her brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan: negative, potassium: low, carotid studies: fine, MRI of the head: multiple small emboli in brain, all on Mar2021; and potassium: low, height: 5 foot 2 inches (shrunk), and weight: lost, all on an unspecified date. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness and fall required emergency room visit. The outcome of the event difficult walking was recovering and unknown for all other events. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fall, potassium low, cerebral embolism, thrombosis, and &#34;potassium dropped and she went into A-Fib and threw clots&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and being life threatening; and the events aphasia and gait disturbance were assessed as serious due to hospitalization. All other events were non-serious. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 until 02Apr2021.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Same day as when patient received the 2nd vaccine, she was overcome with generalized fatigue and nausea.  By the 4th day, her legs would not hold her when she tried to stand getting out of bed.  She was nauseous to the point of not being able to eat or drink.  Infact, she did not have the strength or desire to eat or drink.  By the 5th day post vaccine (02/20/21), I took her to the Emergency room because she was so fatigued, she just slept, and couldn&#39;t stay awake to eat or drink.  She was able to get to the car with a walker, but that was the last time she walked.  After time at hospital and then Skilled nursing, she passed away on 03/21/21.  She never regained the ability to toilet herself, eat on her own, failed to eat and drink, and eventually was put on hospice because she lost 30 pounds over the month from failure to eat or drink, even though I was there or the nurse was there to feed her every meal, and try to get her to take fluids.  Her fatigue was just overwhelming. When she first arrived at the emergency room, she: ? Presented with 2 days of weakness and AMS; fever, nausea  and generalized fatigue ?

An 87-year-old female patient started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was none.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated she had this injection 08Jan2021, states the following Thursday, 14Jan2021, she broke out with 2 different reactions, a rash that looks like measles all over, the second reaction is part on her back looks like a little kid has not had their diaper changed, like diaper rash, like half a belt from the right side to the back. States she is very concerned, the patient went to a dermatologist who she had a lot of faith in, doctor met her at the door, read about it but has never seen a reaction like this. States that they injected her with something and it worked in two different places. States she did a biopsy on her hip and took movies to show her students, called her and stated she need to report this event. The patient states she wants to know if she should get the second vaccine. States she used to be 5 foot 2 inches, shrunk prior to vaccine. The patient last night to report but she could not get through. Stated she got injection on right arm. The patient stated the rashes are trying to improve. States the rash that looks like measles started on the right side and now is all over. The patient stated she is allergic to bromines and swims in a bromine salt water heated swimming pool and this has nothing to do with it but the point she is saying is that she says your allergic to things and then not have reactions and sometimes you do. Both events were serious with criteria of medially signicant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included biopsy: unknown results, body height: 5 foot 2 inches (States she used to be 5 foot 2 inches, shrunk prior to vaccine).  The outcome of the event rash that looks like measles was not recovered, while the outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.

She took a pain pill when she got something to eat, and thought to sit down watch a program to take her mind off of it because she felt like she was going to die (Jan2021). After the pain pill and the food it seemed to get better. She wakes up in the night crying (Jan2021), because she was scared if she didn&#39;t get better the shot would kill her. Maybe it&#39;s her nerves getting the best of her. Her son had the vaccine and had no side effects. She wanted to know if she is the only one having the side effects.

Her Weakness was about the same.  She was not feeling the stomach pain right at this minute, when she woke up during the night with it and last felt it 5 or 6AM this morning, she had chores and tasks to do this morning, but her heads going at that time also around 5 or 6 o clock, it was about the same as Wednesday, she just felt like she needed to get something to settle her stomach down, like she needed something for the energy.

On Monday when she got up there she was a little weak and they put her in a wheelchair that day, this past Monday.

An 87-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 01Feb2021 14:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure abnormal, glaucoma, thyroid problems, mild cognitive impairment and memory problem. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin and carvedilol for blood pressure, donepezil for mild cognitive impairment, ezetimibe, levothyroxine for thyroid problems and ongoing latanoprost for glaucoma. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL3246) on 11Jan2021 for covid-19 immunization. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient had fallen, did not hit her head, but she has extreme fatigue, memory loss (she has seen some improvement now) unable to be by herself now and take her medications. The patient had a mild case of memory loss and had delirium. The reporter cannot say these events occurred from the vaccine of course. However, the work up that has been done has been negative and reporter was worried. It was reported that the patient had a little memory problem prior to getting the vaccine, however, now it was worse. It was like the patient cannot be alone now. The patient did not have a stroke. However, this like sent the patient over a cliff. This is a life changing event. If patient gets better it&#39;s all good, but if she does not they are in big trouble. Patient was previously able to care for self and now she was not able too. Patient underwent lab test (unknown result) in Feb2021. Patient was taken to Urgent Care, was seen by a physician and basic blood work was done and a urine test was done (unknown result). The outcome of event delirium was recovering; all other events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch has been requested.

                                                Dizziness; Pain in the lower extremities; pain in feet; legs hurt; Felt poorly; Blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly; Left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s sister). An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 07:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, bypass in 2010, hearing is very bad on the phone, arthritis pain, headache, and blood thinner. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included metoprolol for hypertension, quinapril for hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) for hypertension, ascorbic acid/ calcium/ minerals NOS/ retinol/ tocopheryl acetate/ vitamin B NOS/ vitamins NOS/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER), calcium carbonate (CALTRATE), atorvastatin, warfarin as blood thinner, spironolactone, and paracetamol (TYLENOL) for arthritis pain and headache; all were ongoing. The patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 13Jan2021 and had reactions to the vaccine or something else. That day, the patient&#39;s left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain), but that was expected, and it went away within 2 days (initially didn&#39;t report it because it was expected). Yesterday (18Jan2021), the patient experienced dizziness and pain in the lower extremities. Last night (18Jan2021; about 6 days after the injection), the patient woke up, felt poorly, and was very dizzy (feeling of dizziness), then, later on, had pain in both lower extremities. The patient took her blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly with result of 159. The patient&#39;s heart rate, temperature, and pulse oximetry were okay on 18Jan2021. She then walked to the bathroom, came back, and went back into bed. The second time she said her legs hurt but this morning she is feeling better than she was. Today (19Jan2021), the pain in feet is better, and the dizziness is gone. Pulse oximetry and temperature were okay this morning (19Jan2021). The patient was wondering if these effects could be related to the vaccine, since the dose was received 6 days ago. The patient was not sure if could possibly be related to the COVID-19 vaccine or if it was that she spent a lot of time doing paperwork on the computer yesterday (18Jan2021) and perhaps that caused some of the symptoms. The patient&#39;s sister called to ask if Pfizer has heard of any late adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccine like this patient&#39;s, 6 days later. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 04Feb2021 (day 22) and her sister asked what if it&#39;s not available. The patient&#39;s sister was concerned about interval and potentially being unable to gain access to the second dose due to supply issues. The patient recovered from &#34;Left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain)&#34; on 15Jan2021; and from &#34;Dizziness&#34; on 19Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the other events.

She finally got up and went into the bathroom and by 3:30 had coughed up little round, clear jellyfish.  Then she stopped coughing and went back to bed for 15 minutes, and then at 3:45 started getting diarrhea which she had until 10:30 AM.   She called Pfizer and reported her reaction and talked to them. During that time she had a lot of diarrhea and her body was starting to ache, joints and muscles.  She did not take her temperature and went back to bed, and slept until she could get up and go to the bathroom.  She then took her temperature and it was 100.7, which her normal is 97. 3.  She slept from 11:00 PM Wednesday until 11:00 AM Thursday.  She could not stay awake for long  before falling back to sleep.  Yesterday she did sleep most all of the day, and did not eat anything since Tuesday evening and did have a piece of toast yesterday.  Today, 3/19/21 she is able to get up, dressed and gotten downstairs to get something to eat and has lost 6# in this time period.  She is feeling wimpy, and her temp is down to 97.3, her pulse ox is 98%, pulse in the 70s.  She&#39;s achy, and has rubbed on Aspercreme  and has taken Tylenol a couple of times.  She is still very weak, probably dehydrated and going to get something to eat as she has just gotten up.  She is foggy thinking, but feels that once she rests, eats and gets strength she will be fine.

A 88-Years-old white female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9266, expiration date: 31 May 2021), via intramuscularly in left arm on 14Feb2021 at a dose of 0.3ml as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s history included allergies to Penicillin, Cortisone, and she thinks also to Lidocaine, maybe. The patient did not have any NDC numbers, Lot numbers or expiry to provide for any of these products, as it was years ago. The patient did not receive any other medications. On 14Feb2021 about an hour after she got her vaccine; the patient had waited 40 minutes after getting the vaccine shot, and nothing happened, so she left, and while she was on her way home, she got a sensation in her nose, throat and upper chest like it was warm, and there was dryness. The patient previously used to get allergy shots because she was allergic to horse flies, and within 24 hours of being bitten, she would have hives the size of dinner plates. The patient went through allergy shots for 10 years and then she moved away and was no longer near water, so she did not think she needed the shots anymore. The patient had been getting the shots for 10 years, she would start to get where her lips felt funny and stuff after getting the shot, and her reaction to the COVID vaccine, felt similar to that, but it had dissipated within a half hour. This was probably respiratory and was not major, her nose did not close up, but it did get dry. The event resolved within an hour. The patient inquired with three physicians about if she should get the COVID vaccine, because she had an anaphylactic experience 40 years ago, before she was going to the allergist, and she had to go to the ER (emergency room), and they gave her whatever they did, Epinephrine or whatever it was, but that experience felt like she was being blown up like a straw was in her body. The patient inquired with these different physicians about told them about her experience from years ago, and what their suggestion would be, and they told the patient to go for it with getting the COVID vaccine, because it anything were to happen, it would be within 15 minutes of getting the shot, but the patient&#39;s was more than 15 minutes after getting it. The patient got the hives to the horse flies, it was usually within 24 hours. The patient did take an EPIPen with her when she went to get the COVID vaccine, because she was concerned she would have a reaction, but did not end up needing to use it. The outcome of the events was recovered.

                                                The next morning after receiving the vaccine I noticed that my mother she talking to me, as her primary giver she knows me and comfortable to me. She tells me the same story over the over with isn&#39;t abnormal. It was every 3-4 words she was jumbling her words. I didn&#39;t think anything of it at first. I just let it go.   Early Wednesday morning  2:48am, I heard her in her bedroom. I went to check on her, I found at her dresser trying to put her watch on. She didn&#39;t know who was I or didn&#39;t know where she was. It took me about 40 minutes to calm her down. Now it was every 2 words that she was jumbling up. I finally got her back to bed. I went to send a message to her doctor. In the morning someone from the doctor&#39;s office called back I explained what was going on and they said get her to an ER.   I took her to the hospital 01/27/2021.  She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  Still not been discharged. Patient was still confused when I had to left last night, did not understand where she was at or why she had to stay there. My mother was very angry when she woke up early Wednesday is not my mom she is very lovely. One year or two years she did have a TA or mini stroke.

                                                Confused; Disorientated; Sleeping a lot/Groggy; Headache; Felt very weak, felt very tired; felt very panicky; Dizziness; Felt like she had the flu; Chills; pain in her neck; she was cold; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  This 89-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number PFREL1283, Expiration Date 30Apr2021), via intramuscular, on 15Jan2021 (at 12:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing lymphoedema (she gets water in her legs), ongoing severe arthritis of both knee caps (she had a cortisone shot and lidocaine in her knees), and dust allergy. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine received in Jan2020 and in Oct2020 (with terrible reaction: pain in arm, numb in arm and muscle pain arm for 6 weeks). Past drug history included allergy to lidocaine (her face swelled up), and hydrocortisone (CORTISONE). She was in a wheelchair. Surgical history included 2 hip replacements. Relevant concomitant medications included drug for lymphoedema. The patient stated she started having side effects almost immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. She felt very panicky, felt very weak, felt very tired. She had like a headache. Some of the symptoms started the day she got the shot and then more symptoms arose the day after. She was very tired and was sleeping a lot the next day. She felt very like groggy. In fact, she was so groggy, she pressed the wrong button in her chair. She clarified she has lymphedema and she has to be in a lift chair to keep her legs elevated. When she needs to get up, she presses a certain button to raise and lift the chair into a sitting position. However, that day, her doorbell rang (her meals are delivered to her) and she was so groggy and confused, that she pressed the button that put her straight out into a lying position instead of a sitting position. She ended up sliding off the chair and onto the floor. She had to call for assistance (there is an emergency button she can press). She had to be lifted off the floor. She explained to them she didn&#39;t end up on the floor from walking, she slid off the chair. She was so disoriented she pressed the wrong button. She felt like she had the flu, she was cold, she had the chills. She was laying down, covered up with 2 blankets. She couldn&#39;t move. It was terrible. At the time, she slid off the chair, she had to go the bathroom. She is on a water pill which makes things worse, but she has a bedside commode close to her lift chair. When she was trying to get off the chair go to the bathroom (which is only 4 or 5 steps away from the commode), she was so disoriented, she pressed the wrong button. She has had this chair for 5 years.  She slid off the chair and ended up hitting the floor with her rear end. She remained on the nice cold floor (its a ceramic tile floor) until they came to pick her up. She mentioned she has had 2 hip replacements and once she is on the floor, she can&#39;t get up. Once assistance from where she lives came to pick her up, she was asked if she need to go the hospital or call ambulance. She explained to them she didn&#39;t fall. She slid off the chair. She is a very active person. Although she is almost 90, year is not senile. She slid off the chair, she didn&#39;t fall. The patient stated that she got the flu shot this past October and had a terrible reaction to that, too. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her system. She has had a flu shot every single year for the past 10-15 years and she has never had a reaction at all. She received the regular flu shot at her doctor&#39;s office in Oct2020 had a terrible reaction, she had severe pain in her arm where they gave her the shot, the pain wasn&#39;t at the injection site, the shot was high up the arm, her arm was numb and she couldn&#39;t raise it; she had muscle problems with the arm, she had trouble with her arm for 6 weeks. She has been taking naproxen sodium (ALEVE) for the headache. She has just been treating it symptomatically. No fever and she has just felt cold. The patient stated she really is not sick. She went to pick up dog medicine from the vet and when she leaves her facility, her temperature is always checked when she comes back. She was told her temperature was 97 something. So, she wasn&#39;t running any temperature prior to the vaccine. The patient was planned for the second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient stated her symptoms are not so severe it affects her breathing or something serious. It&#39;s just a pain in her neck to walk around with a headache. The outcome of the events was unknown.
