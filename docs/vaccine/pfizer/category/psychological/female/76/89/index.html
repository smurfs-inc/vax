                                                Patient was observed for 15 minutes after the vaccination administration, felt fine, and left the facility with her husband.  The 2 of them drove 2 blocks away to a restaurant to eat.  Midway through her meal, she reported that she started to feel &#34;funny&#34; like she was &#34;drunk&#34; or something, and felt nausea and hot/sweaty.  Her husband got her in the vehicle and drove to the vaccination facility,  When he arrived, she was obtunded and &#34;out of it.&#34;  No respiratory distress, No noted rash, but some clamminess/diaphoresis.  She was initially examined by FNP and cursory limited neuro exam while patient was seated did not reveal any gross motor deficits.  FNP called 911 and staff called for me.  When I arrived, patient was groggy, but responsive.  She was A&amp;O x3 and in no distress. Pulse 54, strong and regular (normal rate for her per patient--on a Beta blocker).  BP 120/74.  O2 sat 97% on outdoor cold air.  Patient was able to move all extremities equally and with equal strength.  Lungs CTA, Heart regular no murmur, abdomen soft.  Patient complained of continued malaise/grogginess and nausea, no vomiting.  EMS arrived, checked glucose, which was &#34;normal&#34; (I didn&#39;t hear the result) and patient declined transport.  I discussed ER evaluation vs. continued monitoring by me.  Patient and husband requested monitoring.  Patient stayed in the vehicle with her husband, I gave the husband my phone number to call if any worsening.  I checked on her 5 minutes later, then 10 minutes after that.  By that time, her adult daughter had arrived.  We again discussed continue family monitoring  vs. ER.  The family wanted to take the patient home to monitor.  Patient stated &#34;If I could just go to bed, I think I will be fine.&#34;  I called to check on the patient at 6p.  She had rested well and was improved.  She still felt a bit groggy, but otherwise was feeling better.  I called to check on the patient 1/29 at noon.  At that point, husband stated that she was &#34;back to normal. Symptoms and signs appeared to be consistent with a vasovagal response.  I suspected symptoms may have been prolonged by her Beta blocker

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ELI283, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 11Jan2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she had her first vaccine on 11Jan2021. On 19Jan2021, the patient was feeling really bad, had a bad headache, general malaise and was feeling sick and nauseated. She was not feeling well and has not been feeling well the last 3 days. She thought the side effect would be right after getting the vaccine however hers started on 19Jan2021 (2 days ago). She stated she had an awful headache which she still has and had nausea. She wanted to know if it was normal to have happened this far away from receiving the vaccine, this amount of time from the vaccine. The patient reported that she is not quite as bad now, but she still feels it. The patient was worried it will not go away (Jan2021). The patient became frustrated and stated that she was just trying to find out if what she was feeling was normal. The patient also thought she had COVID and took a test in Jan2021 but she did not have COVID (negative). The outcome of the events &#34;not feeling well/general malaise/feeling sick&#34;, &#34;feeling really bad&#34;, &#34;a bad headache&#34; and &#34;feeling sick and nauseated/nausea&#34; was recovering; and the outcome of &#34;worried it will not go away&#34; and &#34;frustrated&#34; was unknown.

Additional Information for concomitant products Warfarin: Her dose varies, new chart as of todays visit states to take 6mg on Sunday, 6mg on Monday 3mg on Tuesday, 6mg on Wednesday, 3mg on Thursday, 6mg on Friday, and 3mg on Saturday. Patient reported that INR should be a range just listen to number 2.5 to 3. My report they showed me that I am 4.9, that is big number. It is like 2 margin over. When I go to a surgeon tomorrow because I have wound on my foot from surgery that I had and it is not healing, it is just draining. I don&#39;t know if one has anything to do with other but I am very suspicious about it because my blood is too thin and my body me things don&#39;t heal the way they supposed to. Consumer stated, &#34;I have been hold for almost for 2 hours because what happens I left my number as requested for call back. I got a call back in another 2 minutes. When I press to receive a call it disconnected. So I had to start all over again. So it is been like 2 hours adventure. Firstly I need to say that someone I told to call a second number well disconnect me twice but I have something call a report number that the person I think it has same job title of you. I am not certain but her name is (Name) and she gave me report number. She asked me all the questions, I answered all the her questions including my 28Jan2021 Pfizer injection which was my first injection and I have question referring to my taking Warfarin and wanted to if there was interaction because I went to doctor today to see my blood was instead 2.5 to 3, it was 4.9 which is extremely high and the only thing I have taken, I have done differently was to have my Pfizer injection on 28Jan2021. Consumer stated, &#34;It is already in your system because as I said before I have report number. Should I give the report number. The person I spoke a long time ago that with I have been phone said that she information from my card when you they gave that card for you come like second time for the second dose or booster as I told this call.&#34; When probed for if the consumer call the Drug safety earlier: Consumer stated, &#34;That thing I am telling I spoke to someone by the name of (Name). She started asking by same question you did. That is why I am trying to tell you that person already asked me everything and give me report number. She wanted to transfer me because she says it is wrong department. I started here same information again. I have been on phone for far too long for this to be evening. The report number is &#39;number&#39;. Consumer stated, &#34;Concern is that I have Lupus and I take Warfarin. My INR report does part of what to do when you have lupus. You have blood measure monthly or whatever times that necessary. It is very high. It should be a range just listen to number 2.5 to 3. My report they showed me that I am 4.9, that is big number. It is like 2 margin over. I am trying to find out if the injection had interaction with warfarin that is medication I take. Blood thinner I take because I have lupus with antiphospholipid symptoms. I am trying to find out if the injection had any interaction with warfarin the blood thinner. That is the information I am trying to to get. When I go to a surgeon tomorrow because I have wound on my foot from surgery that I had and it is not healing, it is just draining. I don&#39;t know if one has anything to do with other but I am very suspicious about it because my blood is too thin and my body me things don&#39;t heal the way they supposed to. The consumer has taken the Pfizer Covid Vaccine: Consumer stated, &#34;That is the first thing I said. I told you and then I am telling about warfarin. I said I wanted to know if the Pfizer vaccine which I took on 28Jan2021 as I said that before if it had conflicting reactions with warfarin. I explained to you I have lupus and I also have antiphospholipid syndrome which cause me to take warfarin medication. I want to know if the Pfizer injection had any negative interaction with warfarin the blood thinner.&#34; When consumer informed about Medical Information: Consumer stated, &#34;That person transfer to me before. It was drop. So can you connect me to number. She tried to transfer me and I got nowhere to call just died. If I call I am gonna be on waiting for all over again. I already had experience consumer stated, &#34;I have already been answered all of your questions that is why I have a reference report number that I gave you. I have been answered whole time questions. I answered everything. I just wanna be connected to get somebody because I am tired of being on the phone.&#34; Is there a product complaint to report was no. Consumer was provided with the number of Medical Information number and was requested to select option 3, timings as and 8 am to 8 pm Monday to Sundays as per (EST). Investigation Assessment: Yes. She had the first dose of the Pfizer covid19 vaccine on 28Jan2021. She is nervous. She lives with lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, which means her blood is too thick. She is on a blood thinner, she takes warfarin. She is asking if the vaccine could interfere with warfarin. Today she had her INR checked and it was was 4.9. States a stable reading is between 2 and 3. The only different thing she has had in her body is the vaccine. Reports she is nervous and scared. She had surgery on her feet and she has a wound where a thicker scab came off, states it is draining but not drying out. She was thinking maybe this was due to her her INR being high. She will see the surgeon tomorrow. She put a bandaid on her foot where the open wound on her foot is. The next morning she checked her foot and the bandaid was wet. She put some peroxide on it. She read peroxide is not good for open wounds because it kills good bacteria so she used gauze and placed it over the open wound with tape across it. Last month her warfarin dose was 6 mg 5 days a week and 3mg two days a week. As of today she is to take 3mg three days a week and 6mg four days a week. Warfarin is 6mg tablet that is perforated, clarifies it can be broken in half. She does not think her new regimen that she was given today will bring her INR back in the range between 2 and 3. States her INR has never been that high. She will go back to see the nurse in two weeks to get her INR checked. She sees her patient medical record number listed on the card. She says pardon her grunts and moans because she grunts and moans when she moves since she is 76. She feels weird and her eyes are extra dry in 2021. She is nervous about the area where she had surgery on her feet, she does not want it to get infected. She thinks she had surgery on 04Dec2020 to have arthritis in her toes corrected. Outcome of events was unknown.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8730) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 10:30 (at the age of 76-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing pollen allergy from an unspecified date and ongoing ribs sore from an unspecified date. The patient stated that the pollen was bothering her and that she had been taking Zyrtec in the morning and at night. Medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was also reported as none. Family medical history relevant to the event was reported as &#34;her son also had a seizure after the polio vaccine when he was 7 years old&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient denied any medications or medical conditions relevant to symptoms. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine and there were no prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EN202) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (at the age of 76-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient previously received the polio vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization and experienced seizure and the patient previously received the flu shot on an unspecified date (6 years ago) for immunization and 8 hours after the vaccine was achy, sick, in bed for 9 days. Developed bronchitis and coughed so hard she cracked her ribs. Stated her ribs were still sore at times to this day. The patient stated that she would never get another flu shot and that her doctor agreed with her on that decision. On 25Mar2021 the patient experienced headaches, dizziness, dizziness comes and goes but it affects her vision, numb, head feels fuzzy/fuzziness is constant and eyes are crossing. The patient stated that she got her second dose of the vaccine on 24Mar2021. She reported that after her first shot she was fine. She stated that she started having headaches and dizziness the day after her second vaccine and this had lasted for 14 days. It has gone on now for several weeks and was not getting any better. She felt her symptoms went in different degrees at different times of the day. She might go one day without a headache. Today her headache was more like a numbness all around her head. She stated that her headaches come and go, sometimes start when her eyes pop open in the morning or at 10 AM. If she was going to have a headache that day, it usually started by 10 AM and was a full-blown headache. Stated her head always fely fuzzy and woozy and sometimes she felt like her eyes were crossing. She stated that she never got headaches; not since her early 20s. Dizziness continued to come and go, but it affected her vision and she was scared to drive and have a wreck. She reported that the symptoms were driving her bonkers. She also reported that she had to hold onto walls when she walked. The dizziness did not go away even when she laid down. She was dizzy when sitting on the sofa. Her head also felt fuzzy and numb, the fuzziness was constant. She reported that she felt disabled and felt like she was turning 100 instead of 77. She cannot lay in bed all the time and wanted to know how long these symptoms would last. The patient denied any labs, testing or treatment relevant to symptoms. She had not been to the doctor or to the emergency room in relation to these symptoms. She stated that she thought about it at times. She stated that she would have to call an ambulance to take her since she was scared to drive. Yesterday she thought she was not doing so bad and drove to the store. She stated that while in the store, her dizziness had her to where she could hardly pay for her items. Stated that it kind of felt like she was drunk, but she was not drunk. The patient stated that her experience with the polio vaccine made her almost not get the COVID-19 vaccine for fear it would bring on a similar situation. The clinical outcomes of the events headaches, dizziness, dizziness comes and goes but it affects her vision, numb, head feels fuzzy/fuzziness is constant and eyes are crossing were all not recovered/not resolved. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after. The patient declined safety report, saying that she is stressed and anxious (2021), she just wants to be transferred for her question.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number was either: EL1283, CL1283, or LL1283) on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took pneumonia shot on an unknown date and flu shot in Oct2020 for immunization. Patient got the first dose of the vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 in the morning. On 11Jan2021 her arm felt tender where the needle went in.On 12Jan2021 late afternoon, she started getting hissing in her ear that was still there and had not gone away at all and she also had a constant humming in her right ear. By 13Jan2021, she still had the humming.  She saw an ENT on 13Jan2021 and doctor didn&#39;t know if it was correlated to the vaccine or not; doctor took some wax out of her ear and she seemed to get relief from the hissing for about 15 minutes but about 15-20 minutes later the hissing/ humming continued. On 14Jan2021, woke up with complete deafness in right ear. Immediately called ENT doctor and did a hearing test. Patient could not hear and they confirmed she had sudden hearing loss in her right ear on 14Jan2021, she had nothing in her right ear (as reported). They put her on 40 mg a day of Prednisone (20mg tablets) and so far, prednisone hadn&#39;t done anything: originally taking prednisone 40mg for four days and was taking two a day;  on 16Jan2021 when she was getting no relief and couldn&#39;t sleep due to the humming in her ear, she called doctor and was advised to take the 40mg together in the morning, she will take 40mg a day. On 19Jan2021 she took 20mg for four days and then decreased by half again. She was also advised by doctor to take 25mg Benadryl (UPC: 30048284 Lot: SPS023 Exp: Jun2022) at night. They are scheduling her for an MRI in Jan2021.Patient was also scheduled for the second dose on 01Feb2021 and will be on the prednisone until 26Jan2021; she would like to know whether the prednisone will diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine. She also asked  if there was a certain amount of time she should wait to restart in case the doctor decided she should not get the second dose; she also wanted to know if she should wait on the second vaccine and maybe start over in two months.She was concerned and wanted to know if she should proceed with the second shot. The patient underwent blood work on an unspecified date to see if she can receive contrast for an MRI. She never had problem with MRI contrast before. Final outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

It was her first shot and is scheduled for her second one on 08Feb2021. She was wondering will she have to go through all of this again. She had noticed hives on her arms on 19Jan2021 morning but mostly now are on her buttocks and thighs.  She stated that she had thought it was an allergic reaction to a fabric softener that she changed to. No treatment was given in response to the events. She has stated that she takes other medications that she has never had a reaction to. She does not think that they were related to this. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Caller states that it really concerns her that someone who is medically savvy as she could have a serious problem. stated that she did not feel totally right while she was waiting afterwards, states that she came home and laid around and the next morning, she can tell when it is high because she is chronically low. Caller states the next morning the top number of her blood pressure was 166, states bottom number is never out of sync (AS REPORTED). Caller states she could feel it really bad yesterday, really bad states she took the pressure once and it was 182/94 and a little later it was 192/84 and that is when she went to the walk in clinic. Caller states she has an irregular heart beat and she takes a blood pressure medication to treat that, takes 25mg once a day at night time.

She also takes an allergy medication and something for cholesterol that she has been taking for years. She called on 21Jan2021 around 5pm regarding the Pfizer covid vaccine. She called because she was having blood pressure issues and two different doctors thought it was covid vaccine related. It has taken since then till today to get a reasonable blood pressure.

A 77-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284; expiry date: unknown) , via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 18Jan2021, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ear problems in the past and sick. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had her first COVID shot on 18Jan2021. By Wednesday, two days later (20Jan2021), both ears were messed up, she was running a temperature (also reported as low-grade fever), had a headache, and was very nervous. She went to the doctor and her doctor gave her an antibiotic shot, two steroid shots, and some antibiotic ear drops, which did not work. She then did a home call with the doctor and she provided more steroids, an oral pack, and an oral antibiotic for 5 days. She was still having problems with her ears. Mainly her left ear. It goes from ear to ear. She went to the ENT about the earaches which turned out to be infected, and has subsequently been on two rounds of antibiotics, with persistent symptoms that have gotten better over time. Patient wanted to know if this could relate to the COVID Vaccine. She has never had this happen before, and she has been really sick but not this bad. She has had ear problems in the past, but normally the antibiotic liquid drops clear it up. It was like a chronic ear ache. Her earaches were hurting bad. What she is wondering is if it could be a side effect from the first COVID shot. She clarifies that her ears are swollen on the inside. It was an infection somewhere. The antibiotics and steroids have not healed it up. All of these events were still occurring but come and go. For instance, yesterday she had a low temperature but has not yet had one today. The antibiotic ear drops prescribed were Neopoly HC OTSC 1% OTIC SU. NDC: 24208-635-62. Expiry date: Jun2022. She was unsure what the lot was but also sees: 349111. The oral antibiotics she has is Amoxicillin 875mg/125mcg. These are in a pharmacy vial. Use before: 26Jan2022. She was given two steroid shots. One shorter acting and one longer acting. She was unsure of the names. Oral steroid pack: Manufactured by Pharmaceutical name. Prednisone USP 5mg. REV 1016. 314518. lot: 1150419. Expiry date: Feb2022. She also pre-treated with allergic reaction medications. She goes back to the ENT on Thursday. Patient wanted to know if these had happened to anyone before.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EM9801), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 04Feb2021 (Administered between 9:30-10:00AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date of vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced an atrial fibrillation in which she started racing and couldn&#39;t breathe. She mentioned that she recently attended a funeral but attributed the symptoms as side effects of the vaccine. She was taken to the Emergency room where she was given cortisone and resolved her symptoms. Patient also further  reported she had side effects with the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath. She said it was cold outside by her nephew&#39;s graveside, but she felt she had to fan herself like she was overheated. She said her heart rate was flying, and she had an irregular heart beat. She said she left her nephew&#39;s graveside and went to an urgent care. She said the doctor at the urgent care had done an EKG result abnormal, and told her she needed to go to the Emergency Room right away. She said the doctor had called the paramedics to transport her from the urgent care to the Emergency Room at (Institute name). She said she did not have any pain, but had a hard time breathing. She said she may have been scared because her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. She said she has chronic migraines, but what she had at the time was a mild headache, and not a migraine. She said she has not smell or taste a lot of the time. She clarified she has had no smell or taste for a while, saying she would not be able to tell if she got the COVID-19 Virus because of her loss of taste and smell. She said she was tested the Friday before her nephew&#39;s funeral and was negative for the COVID-19 Virus. She said she has had a total of four COVID-19 Virus tests before, and all her COVID-19 Virus tests have been negative. She clarified she did not have a COVID-19 Virus test while she was at the ER on Saturday, 13Feb2021. With her nephew&#39;s death, getting her COVID-19 Vaccine had left her mind. She said it didn&#39;t dawn on her until she settled down, and she thought her high heart rate and irregular heart beat were side effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath. She said the Emergency Room doctor didn&#39;t think to ask her about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she panicked when she got to the hospital. She said she didn&#39;t even know that someone had drew blood from her. She said someone put a label on her, and told her the label was to show blood was drawn from her. She said when she looked down at the label, she saw an IV access was put in her arm.

She said the Emergency Room doctor gave her a prescription for Diltiazem 120mg white capsules, and told her to take the Diltiazem 120mg every day. She said the emergency room doctor told her she could go home, and that she needed to follow-up with her regular doctor.

Patient also reported that on 22Feb2021 was her first day outside of her house since last Sunday (14Feb2021) and reported she has a slight headache, and her sight is not clear. She said she now feels she has &#34;name&#34; back, clarifying she has recovered completely. She has a follow up with her doctor on 24Feb2021.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing low thyroid and mostly it&#39;s food allergies. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 125 ug, daily for low thyroid. The consumer stated, I took the vaccine on Monday (25Jan2021), three days ago and as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I came prepared because I do have some reactions sometimes. Mostly it&#39;s food allergies but I guess was being prepared, so I took Benadryl with me and I took it out of the packet. When probed for the treatment, consumer stated, &#34;I just took Benadryl as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange and I was prepared and I took my Benadryl with me and we stayed there I guess about 45 minutes until I felt better it would have been 12:15 and I was fine.&#34; The consumer stated, &#34;I have been trying for two days, that was in my arms hurting a little on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and then today (28Jan2021) around noon I was feeling a reaction again. I had the tightening in my neck and around my mouth area that&#39;s where I usually get the reactions from, but for two days I have been fine and I did not eat anything on an unspecified date in Jan2021 out of the way to give me a reaction to it. Now I took 2 Benadryl and it subsided but it&#39;s still tight around my neck and a little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness. What am I supposed to do? After I took this shot on Monday today is Thursday and I am having the same reactions that I had when I took (incomplete sentence) (pending clarification). The outcome of the events as soon as I got the shot I felt a little strange was recovered on 25Jan2021, little tight around my neck and throat, like a tightness and tightening in my neck and around my mouth area was not recovered and other events was unknown.

                                                weak feeling; heartbeat climb up and up; unnerving; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 77-year-old female patient received dose 2 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EN5318; expiration date 31May2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. Concomitant medications included losartan, escitalopram, and atorvastatin from unknown dates for unspecified indications. The patient received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (lot number EL1284; left arm) on 15Jan2021 at 11:00. The patient previously received codeine on an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced allergy. On 06Feb2021 at 13:00 the patient experienced a weak feeling and heartbeat climb up. The patient had a weak feeling, had to sit down and took her pulse with oximeter and her Apple watch. She watched her heartbeat climb up and up. She tried yoga breathing but could not slow it down. She was not sure how long this went on because it was very unnerving, but it reached as high as 105 before it started to go down. The beats went up, then down, finally started to keep going down. Once more there was a wave of the weakness through her before she stayed in the 73&#43; range. The patient was usually in the 60&#39;s. Since then the patient&#39;s heartbeats have been what is usual for her. During the episode the patient&#39;s husband found &#34;rapid heartbeat&#34; on the paper they received. The patient was concerned this happened a day after the vaccine, not within an hour. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient was not hospitalized and did not receive any treatment for the events. The outcomes of weak feeling and rapid heartbeat were recovered. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                She had been in her usual state of health until tonight. Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 77-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 77 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included: cholesterol, spinal fusion L4/5, stenosis, allergies to medications, food, or other products: kefex, Zithromax, levofloxacin, oxycontin, methylprednisolone, Lisinopril, ezetimibe, Amlodipine.  She reported she has constant spiking of her blood pressure (BP) and lack of sleep for 37 days (average 1-3 hours daily), since the vaccination. She described the following: She has experienced &#34;dizziness, blurred vision at times, extreme and constant headaches, tons and tons of pain in her neck&#34;. She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function&#34;. When she &#34;lays down&#34;, her &#34;heart is racing so fast and [her] BP gets so high that it won&#39;t let [her] sleep&#34;. She feels like her &#34;body is going crazy&#34;. She &#34;cannot get more than 2-3 hours of sleep other than 1-2 exceptions&#34;.  Also, her &#34;BP wakes her from a dead sleep&#34;.  When she wakes up, she usually &#34;takes a rice [pad] and applies hot and cold to her neck, and she sometimes takes some Tylenol&#34;. &#34;Every time [she] wakes up, her BP [readings] are around 152/101 and 160/97. She has been in and out of the hospital for her high BP.  After the hospital, she called (Number) because her BP &#34;was off the chart&#34;. Her cardiologist ruled out heart issues. She did an &#34;echo, a stress test and EKG&#34;.  On 01Feb2021 she was admitted to hospital with 200/103 blood pressure. Ruled out cardiovascular &amp; placed on Amlodipine. Now 37 Days later with many visits to doctors, blood pressure remains high. Cardiologist ran stress test &amp; echo with no heart issues. Placed on many Blood Pressure Medications that also created side-affects (urination, flushing, dizziness, extreme headaches); Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol 25 mg, Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, Propranol 20 mg. Today, picking up yet another (Hydralazine?) as last-ditch effort. BP daily spikes remain high (160/99 and 175/100). Racing Pulse &amp; BP wakes me out of a dead sleep within 1-2 hours. So weak &amp; constant neck pain that feels like someone is placing pressure around my neck. The blood pressure medication received are the following: Amlodipine from 1Feb2021 until 9Feb2021. She explained it work well to manage her BP but she &#34;could not urinate and had red flashes in [her] face&#34;; therefore, it was stopped by her cardiologist. She was off the BP medication from 9Feb2021 until 17Feb2021. Metoprolol from 18Feb2021 until 25Feb2021, but it didn&#39;t work. She explained it was stopped by her doctor because of side effects. Propranolol in combination with Alprazolam as needed for anxiety. She explained she &#34;took 3&#34; of the tablets for anxiety. Hydralazine 25mg which she started yesterday, after seeing her cardiologist. She explained she only got 3 hours of sleep last night. She woke up around 1:30am/2am&#34; her heartrate was at &#34;93&#34; and she put heat and cold on her neck to settle the pain. She specified the headache and pain were so bad it lasted for 1.5 hours, and her BP was 150/93 at 3 am .She added she had a &#34;red and flushed face&#34; and therefore took a &#34;Benadryl at 4am&#34;. She explained her BP was down to &#34;125/78&#34;, after taking the Benadryl, but got up to &#34;147/90&#34; at 7 am when she attempted to call Pfizer. She explained she has &#34;done [her] due diligence: she consulted HCP, did all the test, she attempted to go for walks and do activities she can tolerate, but her symptoms persist. She added she use to golf and cannot anymore. She explained her symptoms are persisting until this day and her body won&#39;t handle it further. She mentioned she knows she is COVID-19 free because when helping take care of her quadriplegic son in the summer, she tested negative. Outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : PFIZER INC-2021277006 same patient, different vaccine dose/AE.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 08Mar2021 15:30 (3:30 PM) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hashimottos (reported as hoshimottos) Diagnosed 35 years ago, hypermobile Diagnosed 20 years ago, and disorder nomia Diagnosed 25 years ago; all unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); diazepam (VALIUM); and levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 on 15Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization first dose at the left arm and experienced immobile for a day, cannot walk, weakness and sore arm. The patient was to know if there is going to be a booster for the Pfizer covid vaccine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer covid vaccine both doses and she is calling to report the reaction she had with the first and second dose to help other patients, she said she was close to death after the second dose. In the middle of the night she was awaken due to excruciating pain in the body, like truck ran over her. The patient heard that someone had same reaction who was in the hospital, with similar symptoms to covid. She said she felt like if her internal organ were shutting down. She does not do well with the antibiotic, and does not go to the doctors. She could not walk or eat after the second dose. She said she has hashimoto dysautonomia hypermobility. she said she thinks she might have had anaphylactic reaction. The patient added that she has lived through it and her experience has been very unusual. The caller has underlying conditions that may have caused this event, she received the second dose on 08Mar2021, it was a horrible experience but since she is still alive she would want to report it. The caller does have strange reactions to chemicals and she typically goes to naturopaths and holistic doctors because of this. The caller also has multiple autoimmune disorders and feels like that may have played a part in this reaction. It was added that further added that she received her second dose 08Mar2021 at 3:30pm and had a little bit of a sore arm, she was thinking positive thoughts about all of this because she never gets vaccines. At 2:00am on 09Mar2021 the caller was awaken in excruciating pain, every surgery she has had or accident manifests in the greatest pain. The pain was excruciating the caller took over the counter pain medicine and diclofenac and it didn&#39;t help. The caller is unsure of what she took, she may be making this up. The caller felt like she was dying, she felt like her internal organs were shutting down, it happened all week. The caller was so weak her husband fed her and made sure she was drinking. The caller thinks she would die if she had to have a booster shot of this vaccine. The caller has never had anaphylactic shock, could this have been anaphylactic shock? All of the pain from a surgery all occurred at once and her entire body was wrecking, in horrible pain, that she does not think heroin could have taken care of. After the second vaccine she was literally so weak that she felt like all of her vital organs were shutting down and it lasted for 6 days, like she got hit by a truck, like had beat her up. The caller knows that there are new found reactions with (Company name) and they stopped thousands of doses because of it, she saw this in the news today. The patient wanted to make note that she has underlying autoimmune diseases, she is unsure if there is a correlation between this and her reaction. The caller was changing from her thyroid medicine and her thyroid went very high with the generic brand so she was swapped to Synthroid in the middle of this. The caller was on levothyroxine and it wasn&#39;t working, her thyroid was sky high (Unknown lot number and expiration date Feb2022). The caller was going through all of these changes as well when she received the vaccine. The caller&#39;s doctor took a test and the caller has antibodies and they are there but not very strong. The caller doesn&#39;t want to be spreading something because she is feeling healthy and fine today. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 78-years-old female patient receive first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) on 15Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID Prevention. Medical history included ongoing High Blood Pressure, she was diagnosed approximately 5 years prior to starting blood pressure medications in 1998. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) at 320mg/12.5mg, once daily, by mouth from 1998 and ongoing, amlodipine besylate at 5mg, once daily, by mouth at night from 1998, both for High blood pressure. The patient stated that she did not realize, but she must have been exposed to the COVID Virus, prior to getting her shot. She stated that on 15Jan2021, she went and got her Pfizer COVID shot, and that same day, by the time she got home, she was starting to feel bad and it went downhill from there. She mentioned that on the same day on 15Jan2021, she &#34;came down with covid&#34;. She finally went in on 22Jan2021, and got tested, and she did test positive for COVID. The patient was tested Positive for COVID-19 on 22Jan2021. She did believe she was getting better. On 29Jan2021, she felt fairly decent, and today, she is kind of weak but she is assuming that will happen. She was scheduled to go back for her second dose on 08Feb2021, and she is wondering if there are recommendations about the second dose, for people who tested positive for COVID after having gotten the first dose. When queried for her PCP contact information, she stated that her head is not working really great and she feels stupid she did not have this information handy to provide. She states that the first week with her symptoms, she just figured she did have the virus. She had a cough but it never got down to where she had trouble breathing, and she just figured that her body had to go through, whatever it was going to go through, and as long as the patient felt like she was okay, there was not anything anyone could do, she just had to play it out. When she did finally go get tested, the doctor told her to get on Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what the patient has been taking, and she feels like it has helped a lot. Before she saw the doctor, she was taking Acetaminophen, but the doctor told her to do the Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what she has been doing. By the time she got home from getting her vaccine, her heart was racing. She took her blood pressure and it was okay at 125/73, and her heart rate was 72. She has high blood pressure and she takes two medications for that, so she took her night time blood pressure pill and the fast beating of her heart went away. The next day, she got to aching. She has had all different aches, and she ran a fever that got up to 101, and the rest of the time it was 100 or 99, but the fevers were not all day long, they would just come and go. Now she has had no fever in four or more days, and she is doing better. She does still have the cough, but she also has allergies so she does not know what is causing the cough. As far as the reaction to the vaccine, just her arm got sore. But she thinks she was exposed prior to getting the vaccine and just did not know it. she stated that the people took her temperature the day of the shot and she didn&#39;t have a temperature. She did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of fever was recovering, of cough and allergies was not recovered, of her heart was racing was recovered.

This consumer reported same events for two patients (one is patient self). This is the first of two reports. This 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration to right arm on 13Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfas, Penicilins, and Avelox, Sulfa or Penicillin allergies since she was a child and had the Avelox allergies about 15-16 years ago. None concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. Did get the original Shingles vaccine about 3 years ago and then they came out with the new one and she got the first dose of that and believes she had a reaction to that one, thinks it was a rash. Also had the flu shot and she usually gets sick with it, but didn&#39;t with this last one. Thinks her body is just delicate. No vaccines administered on same date. Patient had the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on 13Jan2021 15:00 and she was fine. She had a reaction the following day (on 14Jan2021). At 11am the next day she got very dizzy and felt like she was going to faint, pass out at any second. Used cold compresses and drank water and took deep breaths, but she didn&#39;t pass out. She had a funny taste in her mouth. Then from that time until about 7pm she had urine issues and kept going to the bathroom to urinate and had diarrhea and upset stomach. Patient felt like she was out of her body, felt very weird, strange. Doctor stated she maybe had a reaction to the vaccine and recommended for her to take Tylenol. She didn&#39;t take it until right before going to bed. She was able to sleep on 14th night. Woke up the next morning and was fine. She didn&#39;t see any of these reactions listed and that happened. Patient explained to a friend of the reactions and the friend mentions that she also had a friend who had the vaccine and had the same exact reactions, everything. Everything improved and stopped the next morning she was fine, on the 15th. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. The events outcome was recovered on 15Jan2021. It was just a span of time and she has to assume that it was the vaccine since she has never had that before. Patient does not know if she should blame the vaccine because she also has a lot of allergies to a lot of antibiotics and does not know what caused her reactions.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021065869 Same reporter/ vaccine/ AEs, different patient

A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number unknown reported as &#34;EL9281 or EL9261&#34; as the reporter cannot tell, pending clarification, expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 12:00 at SINGLE DOSE (first dose) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COPD from an unspecified date (not taking any medication for COPD) and she was 5&#39;5 and has gotten a little bit tinier on an unspecified date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 28Jan2021, the patient stated everything was perfect and she was made to sit there for 15 minutes. The patient reported her adverse event as having absolutely no saliva at all about 2-3 minutes later after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Her mouth stopped producing the saliva almost immediately and it was total. She stated she never had anything like that before. She stated it did not make her feel ill. She was still breathing alright, so she did not tell anybody.  She did not have a good night&#39;s sleep and anxious about whether she won&#39;t be able to breathe with this experience. At 07:00 the next day, everything went back to normal and it was very noticeable for her. She was concerned about taking the second shot in 3 weeks considering her experience with the first shot. The patient stated afterwards that the information provided to her helped her to be relived and be confident about taking the second shot. Outcome of the event was recovered on 29Jan2021 07:00.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                began to hallucinate; Dizzy; bed nightmare; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 79-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Expiration Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Jan2021 at 79-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included high blood pressure from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, shrunk a little from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (&#34;about 5&#39;9 and I was always 5&#39;10 but I think I shrunk a little&#34;).  Concomitant medications included nebivolol hydrochloride (BYSTOLIC) taken for blood pressure high from an unspecified date to an unspecified date (&#34;I have blood pressure, high blood pressure. I am taking a blood thinner. I was taking the other one, but they told me to look the other one (BYSTOLIC). It (BYSTOLIC) is a new drug I would say.&#34;). The patient previously received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) for COVID-19 immunization on an unknown date and experienced adverse event (&#34;no problem, nothing happened, there were minor things here and there&#34;). On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient began to hallucinate (medically significant), dizzy (non-serious), and bed nightmare (non-serious). The patient did not receive treatment due to the events; &#34;No, I just ignored it.&#34;  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated, &#34;I took the virus vaccination shot (clarified as COVID 19 vaccine). The first one, there was no problem, nothing happened, there were minor things here and there. The second one I took was just this past Sunday. Something weird happened not right away, not the first day but probably it was second day, second or the third day, I am pretty sure I am not sure exactly, I think. I was not keeping track of all of that.&#34; The patient began to hallucinate; and when she got out of her bed, she suddenly had a feeling that she should look back. The patient stated that she looked back and there was her deceased sister (who died 37 years ago; according to the patient) and her daughter who was still alive; both were looking at her. The patient further reported the following: &#34;They remained in my bed beside me. Okay, I ignored it and thought it was kind of funny because I know that my daughter is in (place name) and my sister is deceased. So, I am having a bed nightmare or something, so I ignored it. Then next thing it happened for a few days and then the dog that we just had euthanized, my daughter (name) had cancer and it was euthanized and what happened is, I was sitting on my sofa and I have seen the dog come out of my bedroom going to the bathroom but only the back of her and she disappeared. Then I spent the night at my other daughter&#39;s house and somewhere in the middle of the night I was awake in my something and I woke up and I looked over into my sistert&#39;s dining room and there was my brother standing there looking at me and there was two of his children sitting at the table also. I thought this is getting a little weird.&#34; The patient reported that nothing like this happened before. The patient wanted to understand the event because she &#34;never had been dizzy from my drug, taking the drug (unspecified medication) that made me dizzy but that not the same thing what is going on here.&#34; The clinical outcome of the events was unknown.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 79-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  Concomitant medication included atenolol for blood thinner.  The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 for Covid-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event. The patient stated that she received the second dose of the vaccine on 04Feb2021 and has been sick ever since. She has a terrible terrible splitting headache on her right temple and can&#39;t sleep and was having so much pressure behind her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t even lay her head on a pillow. She stated she had no reaction to the first shot but this time her head is all fuzzy, her mind wasn&#39;t good and when she sets things down she can&#39;t remember where they are. The second shot was really giving her a fit. Her throat hurts, jaw hurts, head hurts, and feels like she is running a temperature. She is a little off balance, when she walks she falls into things because she can&#39;t see things hardly in her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t put up with the pain any longer, it is terrible behind her temple and eye. She thought it was a sinus infection but now she thinks it was from the shot. She stated she almost had a wreck today because she cannot see out of her right eye because of the shot. She hit a telephone thing and almost wrecked 3 or 4 times. She tried to get tested for Covid but she didn&#39;t have an appointment and she cannot go to work until she finds out about the virus. She was going to get tested tomorrow but was going to have to call the rescue squad because she can&#39;t drive and she was not putting her son through this if she has the virus. The patient asked if she was allergic to the second shot or if these were normal symptoms. She asked what she should do. She stated she takes Atenolol, a blood thinner, and thyroid medicine. She stated she was taking Tylenol but it doesn&#39;t help any and nothing seems to help. All the events occurred on Feb2021. Outcome of all the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 13:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and previously took the flu shot one time and started having right arm pain across her chest over to the left side right after getting it. So she don&#39;t take it anymore and takes a bunch of herbs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she has a disease, amyloidosis on an unspecified date, where there is a build up of protein in the body. She didn&#39;t know that there is protein in the shot and doesn&#39;t know the affects it has with her condition. She found out the day after getting the first Pfizer C-19 (clarified as COVID-19) shot that there was protein in it. The patient wanted to know the affects it has with her condition and if it will affect her getting the second dose and if it covers the new virus and booster shot. The patient got the vaccine on 16Jan2021 and found out about the protein in it the next day when it came across her phone. The patient received it at a school, where they vaccinated 1,169 residents. They text her to inform her she could get the vaccine. They also have the health department there. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient took 1 Tylenol about 15:00 that afternoon and seated herself in the chair about 17:45, then she felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head. She stood up and walked around to see if she was going to faint and she did not faint. She walked through the house and nothing else happened. The patient mentioned that her eyes have been swollen and her hands hurt, that&#39;s where the protein build up comes in the body. Has pings up and down her legs, they are sharp pings that lasted through on to Tuesday. She took 1 Advil to help and as of yesterday (as reported) no pings. Her hands still hurt, because this condition forms chains in the body and the chains are around the hands like carpel tunnel. The protein normally should leave the body and with this condition it doesn&#39;t and it leaves chains. When she was diagnosed with it they took a spot off the ankle to test it, the Dermatologist did and sent it off. No further details provided. Wants to know the affects of her getting the second shot. No further details provided. The outcome of the events amyloidosis and hands hurt was not recovered, the events felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head and sharp pings up and down legs was recovering, and the event  eyes swollen was unknown.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

                                                Myocarditis/had another virus that went to her heart; trouble remembering; incredible fatigue; could sleep around the clock; brain fog; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (Patient). An 80-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265), intramuscular at Right Deltoid from on 16Feb2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included stomach was burning, heartburn, low thyroid, myocarditis and was hospitalized a year ago, Milroy&#39;s disease, and low potassium, heart disorder and Back disorder. Concomitant medications included bumetanide (BUMEX) Has been taking for about 40 years for Milroy&#39;s disease, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) from Jan2020 for Myocarditis, levothyroxine Has been taking for 40 years for low thyroid, tramadol Started about 10-12 years ago for back, metoprolol from Jan2020 for heart, omeprazole (PROTONIX) Started taking about 8 years ago for stomach was burning and heartburn, potassium Has taken for 40-50 years for low potassium, vitamin B12, vitamin D3 and baby aspirin 81mg, all were ongoing. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL8982) on an unknown date for covid-19 immunization and she got a really sore arm. The patient experienced Myocarditis/had another virus that went to her heart on an unspecified date, brain fog on 17Feb2021, trouble remembering on an unspecified date, incredible fatigue on 17Feb2021, could sleep around the clock on 17Feb2021. The clinical course as following: injection was on 16Feb2021. She has had incredible fatigue. She was asking how long is the fatigue going to last. She knows it is a side effect but she could sleep around the clock. She stated she goes to bed at 6PM if not before then and gets up at around 8AM and by 9AM she could go back to bed. She is sorry she got the shot because she is miserable. She mentioned she has been reading up on the vaccine and it said &#34;you might have fatigue for a day or two&#34;. Her fatigue has now been 8 days. She thought &#34;how long is this going to go on&#34;.  Patient reported that with the first shot she got a really sore arm. Stated she thinks the person giving the injection put the darn thing through her bone. She thought it was to be expected, but it feels like the person who administered the vaccine was a poor shot giver. She provides the first Covid Vaccine Lot number: EL8982. With the second shot her arm did not get sore at all. The only thing she&#39;s having was the fatigue, she can hardly walk past her bed without wanting to get back in it. She tries to get up to shower and fix her hair and be motivated and she&#39;s been fighting the fatigue all day to not get back in bed. When probed for the seriousness criteria of the fatigue, the caller explains she doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s that significant. She thought it will go away. However, she was just coming out of myocarditis. She was just in the hospital for myocarditis and they did a heart cath and she has no plugged arteries, nothing. They couldn&#39;t find anything other than she had another virus that went to her heart. She had another virus a year ago January. She wonders if COVID was out there then, because she had never been so sick with the flu. She kind of diagnosed her problem and it was like a wave over her body. She also had a terrible irregular pulse. When she went to the hospital the next morning, her cardiac enzymes were 4.5 times more than normal, her troponin was out of sight. She doesn&#39;t think that would have a bearing because she should be coming out of that myocarditis because of the medication the doctor put her on. She doesn&#39;t know if that would complicate it, too. Her heart doctor said a lot of people have myocarditis, especially athletes, but they are young and fall over dead. 90% of the time, its myocarditis because you don&#39;t know you have it.  She reports she&#39;s getting a foggy brain. Her son asked her who her dentist was because she had a root canal and she couldn&#39;t think of the dentist&#39;s name. She thinks her son threw that in because her son knew that she wouldn&#39;t be able to remember. She&#39;s not confused. It&#39;s just difficult to get the word out, but if she waits a couple minutes, she has the answer. She is also getting old, too. She lives by herself; she has no stimulation and she thinks that is significant to her circumstances. She thinks it&#39;s a problem with the COVID-19 injection. Caller explains she had blood work very recently about 2 weeks ago. She just looked at lab reports and everything was okay except one of the vitamins was a tiny bit high (she can&#39;t remember what the vitamin was), but nothing she was worried about. It could have been a Potassium was a little high, but she is not worried about that. Her main question is how long the fatigue last, she thought for only 1-2 days. She mentions she took her temperature every morning and its always like 97 something and it&#39;s never wavered. The outcome of the events brain fog, incredible fatigue, and could sleep around the clock was not recovered and the outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, viral myocarditis is most likely due to a viral infection in this patient with cardiovascular co-morbidities and is not related to suspect product.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Mar2021 13:30 (at 80 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, allergic to gluten, lecithin, and other barky parts of plants, high pressure, she did not hear very well, left breast surgery, skin cancer. She had a small skin cancer taken off each of her legs, one removed in Jan2020 and one removed in Feb2020. They are all healed up and they are fine, it was not the bad kind. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced choking experience in which her throat tickled, and dizziness, dehydrated, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does, couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction all on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown.   Clinical course was reported as follows. She mentioned that she was fine for 20-30 minutes to an hour after she got home. That afternoon, she noticed that her bowel movement was regular, constant, and repeating which was not normal and would typically indicate SIBO (Small intestine bowel overflow) in which the colon empties everything. She mentioned that this was indicative of her gluten allergy. She reported having had bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction she has to plants like lectin and gluten especially due to the irritable bowel system-her whole bowel system will empty and she will have to replace 2 days worth of food. With this event starting 01Mar2021 her bowels just kept emptying and emptying. During dinner while she was eating and watching tv, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, and a choking episode in which her throat tickled, and dizziness that she couldn&#39;t get up. She took hot water for the tickling sensation and took one aspirin for the other symptoms, but she still did not feel very well. She went to bed at 9pm but couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, she only slept like 2-3 hours long which she can get from Novocaine with her teeth. She got up 3 times and excreted a cup of urine per time. In the morning, she woke up and excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does. She got herself weighed and had a weight of 109lbs versus the normal 122lbs which indicated that she was really dehydrated so she took her fluids and ate breakfast. Other than this, she mentioned that she got up today and felt fine and feels that in 2 days she will be fine. She felt pretty good and she was going to run but did not dare burn any more calories or fluids so she is sitting still and taking it easy. Regarding outcome of event she reported the pounding pressure like high blood pressure are better, fine# she had a normal breakfast# she can get around and do whatever she needs around the house except she needs now to spend the day recouping from the dehydration so she needs pay attention to what she eats and drinks. She mentions that she runs 3-4 miles a day and tries to be active for her age. She is asking if she can take the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. She is unsure if this is an allergic reaction or something psychological. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering.

She started crying and hyperventilating. I used an EpiPen on her immediately within 2 minutes of her turning red and she seemed to calm down for a few minutes. She was able to talk and ask questions. We gave her water to drink but then she started crying again and seemed to have more anxiety. Paramedics came within 15 minutes and took over.

The patient was found not to be diabetic and was given some crackers, juice and water. She was offered to go to a private room for further monitoring, but declined.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at Single Dose (dose unknown; by injection once to left upper arm) for covid-19 immunisation, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.75 mg once a day, and orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.88 mg, once a day for thyroid disorder.  Medical history included cancer, heart stents, irregular high blood pressure, breathing problem, underactive thyroid, back problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient took a flu shot 20 years ago for immunization and got really sick, took Pneumonia shots for immunization and was fine.  On 19Jan2021, the patient had a little lazy and tired. On 21Jan2021, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off; beating so fast and rapid it, and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head; on 21Jan2021, her body was shaking. In Jan2021, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath; she had SVG, she thought, it was irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart. Details were as follows: On 22Jan2021, she woke up in the morning around 3-4 am and said &#34;my heart was beating out of my chest and my head and ears closed down.&#34; The sensation subsided by 8 am. She called her family MD who did not respond so the following Monday she was in contact with her cardiologist who put her on a Holter monitor for a few days. He later told her she had SVT and prescribed a beta blocker for her to take. The patient stated &#34;I am so allergic to medicine.&#34; She took Plavix after a stent 5 years ago and was fine taking it for a few years. Then she had another stent placed, was prescribed Plavix again, and was &#34;so sick and dizzy and short of breath - it was the Plavix.&#34; States that she can take Cipro, ibuprofen, and synthroid and that her list of allergies is about &#34;2 pages long.&#34;  The patient wanted to know if she should take the second dose? her cardiologist advised that she not take it. Caller states she doesn&#39;t want to take the second dose and probably won&#39;t. She had a long history of allergic reactions to medications. She never had the flu, she hasn&#39;t had mumps, chicken pox, measles, occasionally, rarely a cold, about 20 years ago, she took a flu vaccine and got so sick after the shot and never took it again, she never got the flu, she does take Pneumonia shots and was fine. States she seems to have a natural immunity against typical disease you can catch. Other things, she had cancer, heart stents, and things of that sort, as far as infectious diseases, she had no problems. She had a reaction she thinks came from the COVID shot. She had a blood test and it showed her thyroid went a bit more underactive, so about 2 weeks ago, her Synthroid was raised from 0.75mg to 0.88mg, so 0.88mg was a new medication, but it was minimal. Communication: Caller was advised to slow down to assure accurate documentation. Synthroid 0.75mg: no NDC, lot, expiry. States this has been her only change in meds recently. She got that Synthroid the same day as she got her COVID vaccination, which was 19Jan2021, that afternoon, she got a Pfizer COVID vaccination. Also she got a prescription for her new Synthroid. The first day, 19Jan2012, she had no reaction at all, she took two Tylenol, someone suggested. She felt a little lazy and tired, for the rest of Tuesday, then Wednesday she felt more tired, she laid around on the couch watching TV, she stayed in her pajamas, had no serious reaction, just tired, then Tuesday and Wednesday, and then on Thursday night, she never did anything on Thursday either, she went to grocery store, was not feeling better, and on Thursday, 21Jan2021, at 3AM, she was awakened from sleeping, she did not sleep all night long, she got up often, her heart, she never had this before and had 3 stents, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off, it was beating so fast and rapid and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head, and this went on, she didn&#39;t want to call, she lives by herself on a farm, and thought to wait and see if it goes away, and about 7AM, it was basically really bad from 3AM to 5AM, and at 7AM it went away, the rapid heartbeat was so far throughout and her body was shaking, and chest was so she never had it happen before.  At 8AM she called her family doctor office, she wanted to go and see them and she was told she wasn&#39;t in that day, they would send a note in the computer to get back with her. The doctor did not get back with her all day Friday, and then she felt ok Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath, but her heart didn&#39;t feel like it was beating out of rhythm. Then Monday morning she called her heart doctor, he said he doesn&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t sound to him like it was the Synthroid, since it was a small change of dose, but he didn&#39;t know about COVID but he hadn&#39;t heard it as being an after effect, but he said to come by 2:30PM on Monday, to be fitted with a heart monitor, which she wears on her heart and it listens 24/7, listens to her heart function, so she wore that, he said to bring it back on Monday and leave it in the office, and she did that, she wore it Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, she never had that really huge feeling in her in heart anymore, she thought it was a waste of time, then she got a call from the heart doctor on Tuesday, he asked how she was feeling, she said she was fine, and sorry if she caused a commotion and he said she has a heart problem now, she said she didn&#39;t feel anything, but her heart is beating erratically, and he doesn&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t feel it, he said she has SVG, she thinks, it is irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart and he says he will send in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a beta blocker, she thinks Metoprolol. The pharmacy just got the medicine in and she is sitting there waiting now. He told her a couple months ago, her heart sounds fine, there seemed to be nothing the matter. She asked if it was the COVID vaccine, he said he doesn&#39;t know, and she asked if she should take the second dose on 09Feb2021, he said no, he doesn&#39;t think he wants her to take it, she is going to see him in 2 weeks and will try the medicine, but she wanted to report what happened to her. Has Pfizer heard of anyone having rapid heartbeat after COVID vaccination. States she is overweight. Second dose is scheduled for 09Feb2021, at 1PM. Caller states going from 0.75mg to 0.88mg on Synthroid is a minimal adjustment, it can go up to the 200&#39;s for underactive thyroid, it&#39;s minimum, she is supposed to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning with water. She has had underactive thyroid since she was 20 years old, so for 40 years, and had no problems with Synthroid before. The patient had irregular high blood pressure: it is high during the night and normal during the day, and if she would take, she had been going to physical therapy, she had a back problem, it came from a different thing, her knee is bone on bone, and they want her to get a knee implant, but when she limps on her knee it makes her back, it hurts from not walking straight, so she went to physical therapy, and what was causing high blood pressure, if she took Ibuprofen or Aleve, it would significantly increase her blood pressure, so she has a sensitivity to pain medicine, especially Ibuprofen and Advil, it increases her blood pressure, and often when she doesn&#39;t have it in her system, her blood pressure is much more normal. She does not have Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil to provide lot/expiry, she is in her car. She is interested, she feels she won&#39;t take the second vaccine, she wants to see what they say, she also wants to ask how much protection with just the first shot?  The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events heart was &#39;beating out of chest&#39;, &#39;head and ears closed down&#39; was recovered in Jan2021, of other events was unknown.

                                                Got her vaccine, came home drove herself, had no problem whatsoever, felt perfectly fine during the day.  She then went out, got lunch, brought it home, nothing about the day was out of the ordinary other than the vaccination.  She often stays up too late and watches TV in her recliner and falls asleep.  She guesses she didn&#39;t put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn&#39;t come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn&#39;t remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn&#39;t remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI&#39;s, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn&#39;t think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn&#39;t understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.

During that day they brought her downstairs and she stayed on the sofa and it just got worse. Her daughter had her call her primary care doctor and he said that if her neurologist had heard any of what had happened, then go to the emergency room, to which is where she was 19 months ago with her stroke. She spent the 11Mar2021 and 12Mar2021 in hospital (due to dizziness). They couldn&#39;t find anything. She had not had a new stroke.  She had every test known to man. They did a full neurological work up including an MRI, CT Scan, carotid artery studies and checked everything and could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke. The told her that she could potentially have an inner ear problem or problems with the &#34;crystals in her ear&#34; which could be causing her dizziness, however, they could not positively identify the cause of her problem. They found evidence of her previous stoke. When they were sending her home, it says on her discharge paperwork, they were going to put her in a vestibular clinic. It has to do with crystals in her ear. She was still dizzy and still walking with a walker which she hasn&#39;t had to use in 19 months since her stroke. And she has slept a lot, the night she was discharged on 12Mar2021 and the following day. On 14Mar2021 she woke up a little bit. But on 15Mar2021, she is very tired and very weak and still very dizzy. The dizziness is not the room revolving kind. She is taking an anti dizzy pill. She has to see her doctor tomorrow morning, her neurologist at hospital. The dizziness is still persisting but not as bad and she can jump up and walk and do things with the walker. Regarding tests done at the hospital, she came out with shining colors apparently.  All tests came through fine. There was no evidence of stroke, her blood pressure, triglycerides, fluids or liquids, everything tested perfect. When querying if she had gone to her physician&#39;s office, she reported she had a morning call with her doctor on a phone appointment and he sent her straight to the hospital. She is still dizzy and walking with a walker which she has not had to use in 19 months. She states that doing a lot of hand-eye coordination exercises at home. She has the television on to check her vision which seems to be returning to normal. She stated, &#34;I just don&#39;t know where to go from here.&#34; She stated that she has a follow up appointment the following day with her neurologist. She wanted to know if this side effect has been reported and how long she can expect to feel this way.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on Mar2021 which included blood pressure, triglyceride, fluids or liquids: tested perfect; and CAT scan, EKG had unknown results. On 11Mar2021, CT Scan: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem); MRI: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of overwhelming feeling of dizziness and unable to visually focus. Outcome of the event dizziness was not recovered; outcome of the event unable to visually focus (visual disturbance) was recovered on an unspecified date in Mar2021; while room was spinning (spinning sensation) was recovered on 09Mar2021, while unknown for the other events.

                                                4/10/21 ER HPI: 82 y.o. female who presents to the Emergency Department by paramedics from a local nursing home.  The patient is an 82-year-old female with a known history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.  She presented to the emergency room after being transported from a local nursing home.  Apparently, the patient was acting a little bit more confused than normal and she was looking more short of breath than normal.  The nursing home nurse stated that her oxygen saturations were in the upper 80s without oxygen and the patient looked visibly more short of breath than normal.  Because of this, the nursing home made the decision to send the patient in.  When paramedics arrived at the nursing home they placed 2 L of oxygen on her and her oxygen saturations went up into the high 90s.  The patient does dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She did not miss a dialysis treatment this week.  The patient has had her coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and several months ago did have coronavirus (COVID-19) at the local nursing home.  The patient does have mild dementia and so is somewhat of an unreliable historian.  Transferred to pleural effusion

An 83-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK92321), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis and lost a couple of inches from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the Covid-19 shot on 06Jan2021 and had reaction on both legs. They were covered in red spots and at knees it was especially bad, it wasn&#39;t like bumps, it wasn&#39;t like rash it&#39;s more like a color and skin it felt very warm and legs from the knees down especially kept patient awake at night from itching and the itching started on 07Jan2021 night into 08Jan2021 and it woke patient up and patient was just calling at knees. So patient got up and went into bathroom and patient put some anti-itch that&#39;s what patient husband had for his allergies. Patient said the spots on knees, the red spots are basically gone but they were still there and the left knees was specially bad and you can feel through pants even that it&#39;s warm on these places but when rubbing hands on it you can&#39;t feel rash or anything, it was more like a discoloration in skin, there was also a red spot over the injection site, patient would say about the size of a tennis ball and also there was a swelling just that gone bad but and it was okay really but it was there, patient had at a place on belly and it was gone, so let do something else but the discoloration on leg the splotches, patient guess they called splotches not a rash like a pimply rash but just there and they itch something there but it was getting better now. Patient was about 5&#39;4&#39; or maybe 5&#39;4.5&#39;, and patient weighed a 141. Patient had 2 Covid test that were negative. Patient got the vaccine at the College. Patient got it in the upper left arm in the muscle it was not hurt when it went in but it was kind of hurting now, but it was okay. Patient put some kind of cream as treatment. The adverse events resulted in neither doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, nor emergency room/department or urgent care. Patient was going to because it was hurting so bad like a waxing kind of stinging and burning but then patient just put more cream on it and it would stop, it was going to the doctor on 09Jan2021 morning but it was so much less and now patient didn&#39;t think she feel any ill effects. Outcome of all events was recovering.

We took her to her doctor and she thought she had a stroke.  We went to the ER for every test possible.  She became disoriented and also had to put adult briefs on her.  On Sunday she was driving and on Monday she was totally disoriented.  My dad called and I rushed home 2 1/2 hours away.  This was a terrifying event.   She was glossy eyed and couldn&#39;t read.  She didn&#39;t have any paralysis; thank goodness.  It was all pretty much mental.

An 83-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: TL9261, expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 16:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and there were no concomitant medications. On 25Jan2021, the patient experienced having acid reflux, pain in her chest/stomach that lasted all night last night and was worse when lying down. When she burped, it relieved some pressure. She had strange visions flashing in her head while trying to sleep on 25Jan2021. The patient was wondering if she was having a reaction from the vaccine. On 25Jan2021, after over an hour after the vaccine, she started having severe pain in the chest and stomach area and she couldn&#39;t sleep last night at all. She was awake all night, burping up acid. She was wondering if those were reaction to the vaccine, should she go see her doctor or what should she do about that. She got her first dose on 25Jan2021 and she started having chest and stomach pain the same day at about 6 PM. She was burping acid all night and early in the morning of 26Jan2021 and she was having these strange things like pictures going to her head that were weird. She was not sleeping but they were strange images, they were strange, they weren&#39;t normal. She says with that added in it sounds crazy. She has her vaccine card that says she should get the next one 15Feb2021. She wanted to avoid catching the corona. She had drank acid yesterday and she was wondering if that was causing her to have acid reflux. She clarified that she drank a lot of acidic liquids on 25Jan2021 and she was wondering if that might have had something to do with it, like orange juice and cranberry juice so she is wondering did that have anything to do with it, the acidity maybe made her stomach have acid reflux because she has had that in the past. She asked if she should go to the doctor. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Patient is a 84-year-old female presenting to the emergency room with anxiousness, generalized weakness and one episode of vomiting/nausea surrounding her Covid vaccination this afternoon.  On exam patient appears mildly anxious, has no evidence of allergic reaction, lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.  Patient is resting comfortably, speaking in complete sentences.  Shortly after physical exam patient was noted to have oxygen saturation of 90 to 92%, subsequently placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  Will obtain CBC, CMP, chest x-ray, EKG.  We will also give patient 500 cc of fluid and 4 mg of Zofran for control of nausea and vomiting.  We will continue to monitor patient. No leukocytosis, no AKI, electrolytes within normal limits, chest x-ray without evidence of underlying pneumonia or pneumothorax.  I have reevaluated patient, patient has been reporting a ongoing headache for which she has a history of and takes Fioricet, requesting Fioricet.  Will order Fioricet.  We attempted to take patient off of her oxygen however when taken off the oxygen she drops to 88% on room air.  Patient reports ongoing generalized weakness and nausea which has required an additional 4 mg Zofran.  Given that patient has been monitored for couple of hours and has had ongoing nausea and vomiting, generalized weakness in the setting of hypoxia when taken off of oxygen will obtain troponins and admit patient to the hospital for obs.  I have spoken to Dr. who has accepted patient to observation with telemetry for further management.  Patient was informed of admission status, with no further questions at this time.

                                                could not get her head around what day it was/ her brain was not working right; disoriented/disorientation; body not responding/she couldn&#39;t function; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (patient). An 84-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 28Dec2020 by injection once to right deltoid (Batch/lot number: EL0142), second dose of BNT162B2 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021, both at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. Investigation Assessment: No. The patient had second her COVID shot, the vaccine, on 18Jan2021, and she is a very healthy 84 years old with no health problems, and she woke up on 19Jan2021, and was disoriented, she could not get her head around what day it was, this was so rare, she normally goes to the fitness center and excursuses, but her body was not responding, her brain was not working right, it was a strange ordeal, so she got in the shower, to get her circulation going, and she couldn&#39;t shower, she got all wet, and had to get out and lay on a towel, she couldn&#39;t function, it was very scary, and very atypical. Her disorientation went away by 10AM on 19Jan2021- she did not see anyone or go to a provider. Her body started not responding around 7:30 when she got up, and by 9 or 10AM, she was functioning again. The patient didn&#39;t think this was from vaccine, she had seen enough vaccine reactions to various vaccines, and this was not a vaccine reaction, she thought what is happening? Is this a stroke, or a vascular event, she has since recovered but was still very shook, anxious about what it was, what happened until an hour or so after, it was still under her. Causality: Unknown, she didn&#39;t think of the connection until someone else did, she was describing it and the other person said it was because of the vaccine, as this person was a skeptic and doesn&#39;t want the vaccine herself, and this was not a typical response, but then she got to thinking. The outcome of disoriented/disorientation and body not responding/she couldn&#39;t function was recovered on 19Jan2021, the other event was unknown. Seriousness: it was disabling at the time, she was concerned she had a stroke, she was checking her grasps and her face and legs, she was obsessing. Seriousness for disoriented/disorientation and body not responding/she couldn&#39;t function was disability.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of serious events cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  The underlying medical conditions in the advanced old patient considered confounders. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

A 84-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, NDC number: Unknown, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry Date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for she did not got COVID. Medical history included continuing A-fib, takes medication for this everyday. Diagnosed at least 10 years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Last night (25Jan2021) her symptoms started. She was unsure if it was from the vaccine or not but she was thinking it was, she had not had it before. Around 11 pm last night (25Jan2021) she got a pressure all in her head and all over her body. She felt flushed. She had nausea. She could feel her heart beating. She could really feel it. It was not abnormal. She did have A-fib, but this was normal, not like A-fib. Her took her blood pressure which was normal. She took her pulse which was normal. She went to bed around 1am. This went on all night off and on. She slept maybe about 3 hours total. Sometimes her legs feet and hands would feel tingly. And the flushing continue- it feels like her body was hot, but it was not hot to the touch. She had felt better this morning when she got up, but she did have one bout when she was just sitting here. She had improved overall. Caller stated she already spoke to the safety department but did not have any reference number to provide. The outcome of event &#39;Feeling flushed&#39; and &#39;Sometimes her legs feet and hands would feel tingly&#39; was recovered on 26Jan2021, of the other events was recovering.

I spoke with her twice and my uncle and aunt checked on her three times, all three she was freezing cold and too tired to get up. In the morning, she was dazed, cold and walked to the bathroom, where she collapsed to her death. Paramedics could not revive her. My mom died Saturday morning - within the 24-hour period of her vaccine. She was feeling so great leading up to it, active, stripping the guest bedroom sheets, bubbly, and excited for us to be able to finally visit her soon.

                                                This is an 84-year-old woman who several weeks ago began having issues with weakness, nausea vomiting and abdominal discomfort.  She had at least 2 hospitalizations at another facility.  About 6 weeks ago she received her 1st SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and apparently had fever and malaise following the vaccination.  She continued to have ongoing weakness and failure to thrive. Three weeks ago she received her 2nd vaccine.  At about the same time she began to have worsening of her overall weakness and then for the last several days prior to admission she has had deteriorating mental status, weakness and was brought to the hospital on March 27th with severe altered mental status and possible seizures. Following her admission here she developed worsening respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.  She is currently ventilated and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging scanning of the brain with contrast demonstrates areas of restricted diffusion suggesting diffuse areas of encephalomyelitis.  Lumbar puncture demonstrated 1 white blood cell and 9 red blood cells with normal glucose and normal protein.  Cultures have been no growth.  A cerebral spinal fluid meningitis panel has shown no evidence of the presence of DNA to common bacterial pathogens.  PCR is further negative for HSV 1 and 2, varicella zoster, enterovirus and cryptococcus.  West Nile virus antibodies have not been sent on either serum or cerebral spinal fluid. Blood cultures have been no growth.  Urine culture had a light growth of Enterococcus.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was done and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures and studies are all negative. She has been started on plasma exchange but so far has had no clinical improvement. Electroencephalogram demonstrates diffuse generalized slowing consistent with encephalopathy as well as a single area that may be epileptiform. I do not have any history of travel or obvious recent exposures to ticks or mosquitos. The question of this being a vaccine related encephalomyelitis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been raised. The question of this being a vaccine related encephalomyelitis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been raised.

The next day on 26Feb2021 at 11:00 am, she noticed bright red bleeding in her urine when she emptied her bladder. After a few hours it faded. On the next day on 27Feb2021, she experienced the bright red bleeding in the urine again. The red blood did not hurt and patient was achy and headachy, &#34;you know muscles.&#34; So, that kind of happened and it just kind of eased off. She slept a lot because she felt tired and so rotten from Friday, Saturday, Sunday after getting the shot. She also had a mild low-grade fever, headaches, and body aches and pains which she considered normal. Patient was hard of hearing and did not have a bright red bleeding, just had a taint little bit till the day when she got it and then the next day, she went to the bathroom to empty her bladder again and had bright red bleeding again with some blood clots in it. Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Clinical course was reported as follows: she was just released from hospital yesterday, she took the second Pfizer COVID shot, on 12Feb2021, and became so very very ill, she expected some side effects, the first shot wasn&#39;t bad, the first all she had was a severe headache and arm hurting, but that was 3 weeks ago, and the second one she can&#39;t say how horrible it was: she had to get the paramedics there, she was very very ill. It was the worst night she has had, and she is 86 years old, and has had a multitude of serious issues but that shot was the worst. It was a combination of high blood pressure, over the top, and insomnia like she couldn&#39;t budge and open her eyes, she couldn&#39;t see anything but squares, it was like a horrible, if there is such a thing as a trip, a horrible trip, something she can&#39;t imagine wishing on anyone. The county administered it, she has several doctor, she initially provides her primary care doctor, for consent to contact, but says her nephrologist would be better, as she hasn&#39;t seen her primary care doctor in some time. Her primary care doctor doesn&#39;t know she had this, another doctor gave her permission, her nephrologist. States they were more concerned in the hospital about her kidney, she has one kidney functioning and, on mistake of the hospital, they didn&#39;t connect her to hydration, the night nurse didn&#39;t, and she was dehydrated and it was affecting her kidney. Her husband tried to call Saturday, when she had this reaction at like 06:30/07:00, but there was a huge long wait, he was calling to see about side effects, but they were beyond waiting, had to get the paramedics, her blood pressure was 178/113 and heart rate was 103.

It looks like she had it on 22Jan2021, the headache and arm hurting started towards the evening, the shot was taken earlier in the day, and they started in the evening, her headache was quite severe, but with Tylenol it went away, the arm is still sore from the second vaccine, but is slightly better. Clarifies she was hospitalized for the blood pressure and delirium, like, it is best explained, like delirious: incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware, all she could see was, like if she talked about people who did LSD and trips, it was a bad trip, it was squares, she wanted to open her eyes, but could only see squares. She fell asleep Friday night about 11PM, and felt this at 04:00, and she pulled off her sleep apnea mask, she had to run to the restroom, she was weak, feeling like she would slip onto the floor, and had to get right in bed, and the insomnia continued until about 7AM, that was when she started to be able to focus on like words, she was able to say words in her mind, it was like a bad nightmare. She was admitted to the hospital, she was in the emergency room (ER), the paramedics took her there Saturday, about 07:30, took her to the hospital after immediate heart checking, an intravenous (IV) of some kind, and brought her to the hospital and she was in X-rays and what not, they did procedures in the ER, and they suggested her to be observed overnight, they watched her and things started to become more normal, but she is still not clear headed, she is woozy, like foggy. High, over the top blood pressure outcome: It has been back to a good blood pressure. Insomnia is ok- she slept ok last night. What is left: the night she woke up, so early Sunday morning, in the hospital, she was profusely sweating like someone came to her room and showered her bed with water, her sheets and blankets were soaked and this morning she woke, she got up, was still very woozy, and asked her husband to help get her out of bed, and she changed her nightgown and after an hour she got in the shower, as she was sweating again, not sweating, but occasionally on and off chills, she is taking off her nightshirt and putting on a bed jacket, she gets warm and cold, hot and cold. She had blood labs a chest X-ray, heart monitor the whole time until she was discharged, and everything was good except the kidney was extremely dehydrated. This was all on Saturday as well. On her first visit to get the vaccine, at that time, the facility was a big mall, and they handed her what to look for after the injection, and she didn&#39;t notice until this morning, it says if you have an immune system that is compromised, it could affect it, and she has immune system that is compromised diagnosed many years ago. Over the top blood pressure and insomnia had resolved, arm sore was resolving, dehydrated and affecting kidney had not resolved, final outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

An 86-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed in 1971 (reported as 50 years ago) and ongoing; type 2 diabetes in 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) which resolved in 2019 (about 2 years ago) after the patient lost some weight; she had an episode of A-Fib in 2019 when her potassium was low (lower than the current hospitalization), once the potassium was corrected, her A-Fib resolved. The physician stated that patient has shrunk and was now about 5 foot 2 inches. Clarified that this has not recently occurred since the vaccine; stated it was happening just with age. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any issues with the first dose of the vaccine. She received her second vaccine dose on 24Mar2021. The physician spoke with the patient on Friday, 26Mar2021, and the patient was fine. On Saturday, 27Mar2021, the patient had an episode of diarrhea, vomiting and was weak. The lady cleaning the patient&#39;s house found her slumped against the wall. The physician met them at the hospital and said the patient seemed okay. They thought it was just an issue from her potassium being low on Mar2021, so they gave her that. The hospital did a CT scan that showed nothing on Mar2021. The hospital did an MRI of the head that showed multiple small emboli in the brain on Mar2021. The physician believed that the patient must have thrown more clots because she became aphasic on Mar2021 and could not name things. The patient also had difficulty walking on Mar2021. The physician felt it was important to call and report this since she has heard of people throwing clots with vaccines. The physician did not know if the events were related to the vaccine. The patient was in the hospital for 7 days (as reported). She was now able to walk with some assistance. The patient&#39;s son thought that the patient was okay when he went to see her. Since the reporter was a physician, she knew which questions to ask the patient and saw that she still had some problems. The patient could remember some things but has problems with recent memories on an unspecified date in 2021. She also has some confusion on an unspecified date in 2021, such as she thought she was in a boat hospital. The physician was uncertain if the vomiting and diarrhea was somewhat better. They were wondering if the patient has some food sensitivities (2021). The patient also had carotid studies done in the hospital on Mar2021 and they were fine. They believed that patient&#39;s potassium dropped, and she went into A-Fib and threw clots on Mar2021. The clots must have come from the heart valves since the carotid studies were fine and if the clots had been in her legs, they would&#39;ve gone to her lungs not to her brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan: negative, potassium: low, carotid studies: fine, MRI of the head: multiple small emboli in brain, all on Mar2021; and potassium: low, height: 5 foot 2 inches (shrunk), and weight: lost, all on an unspecified date. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness and fall required emergency room visit. The outcome of the event difficult walking was recovering and unknown for all other events. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fall, potassium low, cerebral embolism, thrombosis, and &#34;potassium dropped and she went into A-Fib and threw clots&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and being life threatening; and the events aphasia and gait disturbance were assessed as serious due to hospitalization. All other events were non-serious. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 until 02Apr2021.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 87-year-old female patient started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was none.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated she had this injection 08Jan2021, states the following Thursday, 14Jan2021, she broke out with 2 different reactions, a rash that looks like measles all over, the second reaction is part on her back looks like a little kid has not had their diaper changed, like diaper rash, like half a belt from the right side to the back. States she is very concerned, the patient went to a dermatologist who she had a lot of faith in, doctor met her at the door, read about it but has never seen a reaction like this. States that they injected her with something and it worked in two different places. States she did a biopsy on her hip and took movies to show her students, called her and stated she need to report this event. The patient states she wants to know if she should get the second vaccine. States she used to be 5 foot 2 inches, shrunk prior to vaccine. The patient last night to report but she could not get through. Stated she got injection on right arm. The patient stated the rashes are trying to improve. States the rash that looks like measles started on the right side and now is all over. The patient stated she is allergic to bromines and swims in a bromine salt water heated swimming pool and this has nothing to do with it but the point she is saying is that she says your allergic to things and then not have reactions and sometimes you do. Both events were serious with criteria of medially signicant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included biopsy: unknown results, body height: 5 foot 2 inches (States she used to be 5 foot 2 inches, shrunk prior to vaccine).  The outcome of the event rash that looks like measles was not recovered, while the outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.

She took a pain pill when she got something to eat, and thought to sit down watch a program to take her mind off of it because she felt like she was going to die (Jan2021). After the pain pill and the food it seemed to get better. She wakes up in the night crying (Jan2021), because she was scared if she didn&#39;t get better the shot would kill her. Maybe it&#39;s her nerves getting the best of her. Her son had the vaccine and had no side effects. She wanted to know if she is the only one having the side effects.

The dizziness was a different each time, sometimes she has got it, sometimes she didn&#39;t, its intermittent, she would be doing something and then she needed to grab a hold of something when the dizziness come on. Her Weakness was about the same.  She was not feeling the stomach pain right at this minute, when she woke up during the night with it and last felt it 5 or 6AM this morning, she had chores and tasks to do this morning, but her heads going at that time also around 5 or 6 o clock, it was about the same as Wednesday, she just felt like she needed to get something to settle her stomach down, like she needed something for the energy.

On Monday when she got up there she was a little weak and they put her in a wheelchair that day, this past Monday.

Caller stated that she had very bad nerves, her husband passed away 2 years ago and she hasn&#39;t overcome that, she lived by her-self, and was wondering if some of this stress, would lead to the symptoms she was having right now.

An 87-year-old female patient received first dose of COVID-19 vaccine (UNSPECIFIED TRADE NAME, lot# EM9809), intramuscularly in right arm on 04Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.

The patient denied rash, hives, welts, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, wheezing, throat tightness, hoarseness, stridor, itching, dizziness, facial swelling, lip swelling and tongue swelling. Treatment included: no therapy. Follow up response to treatment: excellent. Patient discharge: Stable to go home and follow up with PCP. Differential Diagnosis: Vaccine Related Anxiety (include misc mental health). Patient left at 15:40pm accompanied by husband. Follow up with PMP regarding blood pressure.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events.

                                                The next morning after receiving the vaccine I noticed that my mother she talking to me, as her primary giver she knows me and comfortable to me. She tells me the same story over the over with isn&#39;t abnormal. It was every 3-4 words she was jumbling her words. I didn&#39;t think anything of it at first. I just let it go.   Early Wednesday morning  2:48am, I heard her in her bedroom. I went to check on her, I found at her dresser trying to put her watch on. She didn&#39;t know who was I or didn&#39;t know where she was. It took me about 40 minutes to calm her down. Now it was every 2 words that she was jumbling up. I finally got her back to bed. I went to send a message to her doctor. In the morning someone from the doctor&#39;s office called back I explained what was going on and they said get her to an ER.   I took her to the hospital 01/27/2021.  She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  Still not been discharged. Patient was still confused when I had to left last night, did not understand where she was at or why she had to stay there. My mother was very angry when she woke up early Wednesday is not my mom she is very lovely. One year or two years she did have a TA or mini stroke.

Felt terrible like (when you bend over and get up to quick) that feeling stayed constant also a feeling of a constant hot flash.  Doctors at ER gave me a through checkup and everything checked out normal  except blood pressure.  They said be sure and notify you because they think it probably was the vaccination.  I am making an appointment with my doctor today .

This 89-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number PFREL1283, Expiration Date 30Apr2021), via intramuscular, on 15Jan2021 (at 12:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing lymphoedema (she gets water in her legs), ongoing severe arthritis of both knee caps (she had a cortisone shot and lidocaine in her knees), and dust allergy. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine received in Jan2020 and in Oct2020 (with terrible reaction: pain in arm, numb in arm and muscle pain arm for 6 weeks). Past drug history included allergy to lidocaine (her face swelled up), and hydrocortisone (CORTISONE). She was in a wheelchair. Surgical history included 2 hip replacements. Relevant concomitant medications included drug for lymphoedema. The patient stated she started having side effects almost immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. She felt very panicky, felt very weak, felt very tired. She had like a headache. Some of the symptoms started the day she got the shot and then more symptoms arose the day after. She was very tired and was sleeping a lot the next day. She felt very like groggy. In fact, she was so groggy, she pressed the wrong button in her chair. She clarified she has lymphedema and she has to be in a lift chair to keep her legs elevated. When she needs to get up, she presses a certain button to raise and lift the chair into a sitting position. However, that day, her doorbell rang (her meals are delivered to her) and she was so groggy and confused, that she pressed the button that put her straight out into a lying position instead of a sitting position. She ended up sliding off the chair and onto the floor. She had to call for assistance (there is an emergency button she can press). She had to be lifted off the floor. She explained to them she didn&#39;t end up on the floor from walking, she slid off the chair. She was so disoriented she pressed the wrong button. She felt like she had the flu, she was cold, she had the chills. She was laying down, covered up with 2 blankets. She couldn&#39;t move. It was terrible. At the time, she slid off the chair, she had to go the bathroom. She is on a water pill which makes things worse, but she has a bedside commode close to her lift chair. When she was trying to get off the chair go to the bathroom (which is only 4 or 5 steps away from the commode), she was so disoriented, she pressed the wrong button. She has had this chair for 5 years.  She slid off the chair and ended up hitting the floor with her rear end. She remained on the nice cold floor (its a ceramic tile floor) until they came to pick her up. She mentioned she has had 2 hip replacements and once she is on the floor, she can&#39;t get up. Once assistance from where she lives came to pick her up, she was asked if she need to go the hospital or call ambulance. She explained to them she didn&#39;t fall. She slid off the chair. She is a very active person. Although she is almost 90, year is not senile. She slid off the chair, she didn&#39;t fall. The patient stated that she got the flu shot this past October and had a terrible reaction to that, too. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her system. She has had a flu shot every single year for the past 10-15 years and she has never had a reaction at all. She received the regular flu shot at her doctor&#39;s office in Oct2020 had a terrible reaction, she had severe pain in her arm where they gave her the shot, the pain wasn&#39;t at the injection site, the shot was high up the arm, her arm was numb and she couldn&#39;t raise it; she had muscle problems with the arm, she had trouble with her arm for 6 weeks. She has been taking naproxen sodium (ALEVE) for the headache. She has just been treating it symptomatically. No fever and she has just felt cold. The patient stated she really is not sick. She went to pick up dog medicine from the vet and when she leaves her facility, her temperature is always checked when she comes back. She was told her temperature was 97 something. So, she wasn&#39;t running any temperature prior to the vaccine. The patient was planned for the second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient stated her symptoms are not so severe it affects her breathing or something serious. It&#39;s just a pain in her neck to walk around with a headache. The outcome of the events was unknown.
