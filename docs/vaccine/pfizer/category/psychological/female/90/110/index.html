A 91-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248; expiration date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and blood thinner. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner. The patient is asking if there were any reports of adverse events with kidneys and the vaccine. She received the 1st shot last Thursday (07Jan2021) and told that yesterday (10Jan2021), she had an episode where kidneys weren&#39;t acting. She also mentioned that she is on a blood thinner, ELIQUIS. She is due to receive the 2nd shot on 28Jan2021. She said that she wouldn&#39;t want to receive the 2nd dose if this was related to her adverse reaction. The issue with the kidney started after on 10Jan2021, yesterday she was really having problems, she went to church then came home by that time she would have to go to the bathroom, but she did not go, she ended up cooking dinner which was 3 hours later, she was noticing that she was not urinating. She drank some Gatorade and that made it little better, she is wondering if it&#39;s a side effect. On 10Jan2021, when she noticed the kidney issues, she did not know for certain if it started before that, she didn&#39;t pay attention. Also, yesterday (10Jan2021), she got sick in which she had to grab the counter, she felt bad, she wasn&#39;t dizzy, but felt light-headed. The symptom of not having the feeling to urinate had improved a little today but she is concerned and wanted to know if this was a side effect. Her being light-headed only occurred on 10Jan2021, it was a onetime occurrence yesterday. However, she was also just sitting around, laying around, after that yesterday. The outcome of the event &#39;light-headed&#39; was unknown; while outcome of other events was recovering.

                                                very acute confusion; marked confusion; never had it before; completely out of character; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patients daughter). A 91-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 14:30 PM (at the age of 91-year-old)  as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was not reported. Historical vaccine included Dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced minor soreness and nausea; the Flu vaccine and experienced aches, chills, fever, and once even had a red streak up and down the injection site arm. On 05Feb2021, immediately after received the second shot, the patient experienced very acute confusion; marked confusion, that lasted about an hour; she had never had it before; it was also reported that it was completely out of character. The nurse informed that her mother had never had marked confusion before and since it did pass, the nurse feels it&#39;s medically significant. It was reported that the patient was observed for 15 minutes and then got up and went back to her apartment. In that period of time when in there, no one noticed what happened in that few minutes. The nurse reported her mother&#39;s neighbor was who called her. The nurse was on the way to pick up her mother anyway because she knew there was always a chance of side effects with older people. The nurse had just driven up within that 15 minutes when the neighbor called stating the patient was confused. This was completely out of character for her. When she picked up her mother she took her to the emergency room which is maybe 20 minutes away and didn&#39;t have the petal to the metal. On the way to emergency room could see her mother starting to clear up. She had her down in the car in about 10 minutes, 20 minutes driving to emergency room, so a total of 45 minutes to hour. They asked questions and within the hour her mother was okay, it was scary. The clinical outcome of very acute confusion and completely out of character was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the events &#34;acute confusion; marked confusion, that lasted about an hour; she had never had it before; it was also reported that it was completely out of character&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be completely exclucded.

This 91-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included high blood pressure, kidney cancer, cancer in her bladder 20 years ago and coughing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), ascorbic acid (VIT C), losartan potassium for blood pressure, metoprolol succinate for blood pressure, amlodipine for blood pressure, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81). Patient had cancer in her bladder 20 years ago. That was taken care of. Had kidney cancer because her husband used to smoke and blow it in her face. Had rare type of kidney cancer. It was removed. Treated for bladder cancer. Patient has had no problem ever since and that was more than 18 years ago. Patient had a fever, headache, and was very tired. Burning up on side of the body and she got all wet. This was not normal and she felt like she was dying. Patient stated she had shingles and developed post herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had pain at the bottom of her foot but it was getting worse after she received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Patient noticed the liquid going thru arm to chest and in straight line to her leg, like a science fiction movie with an injection of some kind. The doctor thought the vaccine might have an impact on the nervous system and spike the symptoms of post herpetic neuralgia. Patient spoke to her doctor but nobody knows anything. Nobody was willing to help her. Patient felt like she was dying. She didn&#39;t want to die. Patient feel the symptoms are getting worst. She was burning up inside. Her pain was around the bottom of the foot now it&#39;s on top of the foot and goes up to knee. Patient was not blaming anybody but she thought it was the vaccine. Patient was sweating, wet, perspiring all night. The symptoms usually occur at night. Patient wanted to know if these symptoms were associated with the vaccine. Patient also mentioned she developed a bladder infection for which she was taking antibiotics. Patient had Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021, about 5 days ago. Patient followed instructions before vaccine. Doctor said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) before the vaccine for a headache. Patient did that. Patient had injection and told to wait for 15 minutes before she went home. About 5 minutes, she was relaxed and sitting down. Vaccination given in left arm. All of a sudden she had a very strange feeling in her body on 02Feb2021. Something was going across the top and right side like a fluid was flowing or something strange. Then it felt like a straight line down her right foot and it stopped. Was a feeling like maybe the liquid of the vaccine went that way. Didn&#39;t have a vein going that way. Patient was afraid. She went home and didn&#39;t remember the next thing that happened. Every night she has gotten more sick. Patient had a feeling in her foot where she had shingles a few years ago. After shingles had post-herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had burning on bottom of her foot and would put it in ice water. Patient could handle that because it was just uncomfortable. After injection, she got so bad, the post-herpetic neuralgia was on her whole foot and it started to burn. It went up a little towards the knee or higher. Yesterday, at times, it quickly went over to the left leg. Patient had a fever every day and every night. Patient took paracetamol to cut the fever. Patient was coughing on call but stated that was nothing and the coughing was something she had. Every night she felt like her body was burning up in side. Felt like she was burning alive. Got all wet with perspiration. She changed clothes and every night it got worse. Patient called emergency, they listened to her, stating they have never heard of anything like this. Asked patient if she wanted to go to emergency. She stated ok. The doctor listened to her story and told her it was weird. Doctor told her to give it a few more days to up to eight days. Doctor wanted her to get a urine test, but she couldn&#39;t urine, patient tried for a long time in the bathroom and only got a few drops of urine out and it was brown. Not normal urine. Next day patient called 911. She wanted to be assured she was not dying at home. Did have room available at the hospital. Patient had to sit in a wheelchair and there was no bed for her to lie down in. Last time she was admitted from the emergency. Next day she came home and had to call emergency again. Really thought she was burning up. Patient didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital and suffered at home. Next night and third night was so bad. Patient couldn&#39;t urinate anymore. She had a fever, but not a high fever, because the paracetamol cut the fever. Temperature was 100 degrees. On the inside she thought she was being burned up a live. Never got better, always got worse. Yesterday, she was in the hospital all day. Now she has an infection in her bladder. Was put on a machine and everything. Had a long procedure, and got the urine going. Patient didn&#39;t miss not urinating. Has accidents like when she sneezes or cough. Usually gets up 2-3 times at night to urinate. When she finally realized she couldn&#39;t urinate, the doctor kept her there for a long time, eight hours. Was put on the machine, thought she may need a catheter. Her bladder was massaged in order to get her to urinate. Patient only had the left kidney. Correct problem about the urine. Doctor told her to make sure she goes back for second dose on 23Feb2021, but she was afraid. In the morning she was a little better, couldn&#39;t handle this. Patient was very weak and tired. One night she was in the emergency and didn&#39;t sleep because of the procedures. Patient didn&#39;t think the needle went in all of the way when the nurse administered her vaccine. Sensation started on the left, went across her chest, straight down like an arrow. Like something was trickling down to the end of her foot and stopped. Patient had symptoms every night since. So severe patient thought she was burning up. Patient got worse every night and didn&#39;t get any better. Patient said feeling at COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was not a natural thing. Last time she was in the hospital her blood pressure went up to 184. After COVID-19 Vaccine patient lost a little weight. Same time had this problem, was seeing a doctor with a colon specialty. Had so much constipation for a long time and tried to correct it with mediation. Medication was too strong and gave her diarrhea. Doctor thought maybe she had colon cancer. Stopped the medication. Wasn&#39;t 100% healthy, but that was just cramps. Patient eats very little now, not very hungry. Patient feels good in her bowels after something good from a restaurant. Patient attempted to clarify the medication that was too strong. She stated it was over the counter. She stated it was something that had to be mixed. She was supposed to take a cap full and mix it with 8 ounces of liquid. Needed something to make her have a bowel movement. Only took it for two days. Was way before the vaccine. It was too strong and she stopped it. Patient took a probiotic. After that patient was given gas relief medication called: Gas Relief Extra Strength Simethicone, 125mg. Provided: V11496, MSRS 53041 REV 0417, and 883928. Patient no longer has constipation. Now it is the opposite. Now bowel movements are soft and pasty. Patient tried a stool softener that didn&#39;t work, was worthless. Was over the counter. Patient didn&#39;t take stool softeners after the COVID-19 Vaccine. All the events started from Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 94-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 (around 3:15 PM to 3:20 PM) at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml dose injection in right arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure, cholesterol, blood thinner and fluid. The patient historical vaccine included varicella zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) for immunization. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect as this was the first dose. The patient had no prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included ongoing apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner, ongoing furosemide (LASIX) for fluid, valsartan for blood pressure, ongoing pravastatin for cholesterol. The reporter was calling because her mother had the COVID-19 Vaccine on 07Jan2021, it was on a Thursday. By that Friday (08Jan2021) she was not feeling that well. Caller stated she did not know if what occurred had any correlation to the vaccine, but she wanted to report these details in case this started to be came a problem. Her mother is 94 years old and was in very good shape. However, now she was in the hospital completely disoriented. Since getting the vaccine she had subsequently broke out with shingles two days after getting the vaccine on 09Jan2021. Caller reiterated she was not saying this had anything to do with the vaccine, but she just wanted to reported these events. Caller initially stated it was unknown why patient was admitted to the hospital. She went on to explain her mother, the patient, was complaining of pain and burning. She started complaining of this pain and burning in the evening like around 5PM (on 08Jan2021 17:00). She later broke out into shingles. Caller mentioned patient has not had the SHINGRIX vaccine yet. However, she did have the older vaccine, ZOSTAVAX. Caller confirmed patient received the ZOSTAVAX years before. Patient went to the Emergency Room the first time on 09Jan2021 due to complaining of pain and burning and they could not find anything wrong with her. They checked her vitals and ran several tests and it all came back fine. They then sent her home. Patient went back to the Emergency Room on 10Jan2021 and completed another battery of test, labs, checked vitals, had chest x-ray, and cat scan at this time they could not diagnose with Shingles. On 11Jan2021, the patient had an appointment with her Primary Doctor and he did not find anything wrong. Patient came home with caller&#39;s sister and she was helping her get undressed. That was when the sister noticed a rash on the patient&#39;s body. The rash broke out on her body on Monday 11Jan2021. They tried to call the doctor that night, but did not get a response. On Tuesday 12Jan2021 they took the patient to urgent care and that was when she was formally diagnosed with Shingles. She was started on medication for the Shingles, Acyclovir, and sent home. They also thought she had a slight Urinary Tract Infection. She was started on CIPRO for the urinary tract infection. Patient was home for a couple of days in Jan2021 and she was not getting any better. She was then starting to lose her mental faculties. They thought this was from the urinary tract infection. Caller clarified the patient was then admitted to the hospital on 16Jan2021 due being disoriented. For causality assessment, it was mentioned that it is so coincidental this happened right after getting the vaccine. She was healthy and then it was like a snowball. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 94-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (right arm) on 21Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE (arm right) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included left shoulder pain (on medication for years) from an unspecified date, and elbow that she fell on two weeks before on Jan2021. Concomitant medication included hydrocodone for left shoulder pain. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced real tired and she even slept 14 hours the night before. Reporter was wondering if tiredness is a side effect of the product. The patient also had an elbow that she fell on two weeks before on Jan2021, and three days after getting the vaccine (24Jan2021), that elbow started hurting more, and it was on the same arm as the side she got the injection on, the right arm. The reporter was unsure of the lot number reported as E13249 or EL3249 (unsure which lot number is his, and which is the one his wife received). The patient received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the event &#34;elbow starting hurting more, and it was on the same arm as the side she got the injection on, the right arm&#34; was not recovered. Outcome of events &#34;is real tired and she even slept 14 hours last night&#34; was unknown.

A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.
