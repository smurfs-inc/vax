A 90-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer BioNTech) (lot# EL3249), intramuscular in right upper arm, on 14Jan2021 between 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM , at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. She was monitored for an hour after vaccine. Medical history included penicillin allergy, ongoing vascular dementia, cardiac pacemaker insertion, congestive heart failure. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took ciprofloxacin and experienced drug hypersensitivity and rash (she took the prescribed dose and immediately broke out after, all over her body), codeine and experienced drug hypersensitivity, neomycin and experienced drug hypersensitivity, neosporine and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient experienced aspiration pneumonia in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, wouldn&#39;t eat on 17Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, trouble breathing/couldn&#39;t breathe without oxygen on 21Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, incoherent on 15Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, thrashing around with her legs, would not settle down/legs were thrashing around on 15Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, persistent urinary tract infection (UTI) on an unspecified date in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown. The events were considered serious as caused patient&#39;s hospitalization. Clinical course: on 15Jan2021 night the patient started thrashing around with her legs, would not settle down, she was incoherent. On 17Jan2021, when she woke up, she was completely incoherent and would not eat. On 17Jan2021 she was taken to the emergency room (ER), and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and persistent urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was admitted on 17Jan2021 and she was treated. On 18Jan2021 patient got better, they put her on a bunch of antibiotics. On 19Jan2021 patient walked the halls, she wasn&#39;t incoherent. She was going to get PT/OT, speech therapy. The patient was discharged on 20Jan2021 and was taken to rehab type place (near the hospital), she was fine. However over the night she got worse. She became incoherent again and couldn&#39;t breathe without oxygen (21Jan2021). On 21Jan2021 the patient was sent back to ER due to trouble breathing. The reporter stated that something happened at nursing home and the patient went bonkers. She was admitted again (still ongoing) and put to intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac function test: nothing wrong with heart in Jan2021, chest x-ray: concerning for possible Covid pneumonia on 17Jan2021 (transvenous pacemaker is present some peripheral, increased entity present Concerning for possible COVID pneumonia), CT scan: no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax in Jan2021, COVID-19 virus test: negative in Jan2021 (2 times during the ER trips). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with unspecified antibiotics.

                                                The evening of the administration hands started to tingle, lasted about half hour.  The next morning felt fine at noon the second day started with violent shaking chills which lasted one hour, at that time it slowly started to stop but felt icy cold with sweating.  Took 2 tablets of advil 200mg at the beginning of shaking.  After shaking slowed down could not talk, stand or hold up hands; she was drooling barely could swallow.  She just wanted to lay down and sleep.  This lasted about 30-45 minutes.  Hands turned BLUE to her wrists lasting 15 minutes.  Resolved without intervention.  Very tired that evening. Slept for 12 hours. Back to normal the next day.

A 90-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left arm, on 18Feb2021 at 10:50 AM, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including type 2 diabetes diagnosed years ago), and obesity. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Jan2021 at 90 years of age for COVID-19 immunization. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. About a week ago (Mar2021), the patient started experiencing delusions and hallucinations. The patient was currently hospitalized. These came on quickly, no definitive diagnosis. Over the last 2 months (2021), the patient slowly started slurring speech to the point where it was very slurred. In 2021, they took her to the emergency room (ER) and they did a battery of test including computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood test, urine, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain. They were thinking maybe she might have had a small stroke but did not find anything. On Sunday (14Mar2021; within the last 2 weeks), the patient also had brain fog, and a little confusion, but was still there. The patient had no cognitive issues of any sort. On Tuesday (16Mar2021), the patient called and said there were some men at her house. The patient had the police go over and they said there was no one there and she started to say other things that did not make sense. On Wednesday (17Mar2021) at 03:00, the patient&#39;s granddaughter got a call from EMS that the patient reported someone broke into her home, stole her TV, and raped her. This was not true. By Wednesday (17Mar2021), the patient was in full blown psychosis with hallucinations, and delusions. The patient was hospitalized on Wednesday (17Mar2021) and the delusions, psychosis and hallucinations began between Sunday to Wednesday (Mar2021). The patient&#39;s granddaughter believes it all occurred after the vaccine. It was around the same time frame. The patient&#39;s granddaughter would notice a word here and there where the patient was slurring. The patient&#39;s granddaughter did not know if the patient was being lazy or tired and it gradually progressed. The patient&#39;s current state is in a very bad spot - cognitively, she is very bad (started on an unspecified date). The patient now has aphasia and extreme lethargy from 18Mar2021, and dysphagia from 22Mar2021.  This has all progressed since she has been in the hospital. The psychosis came out of nowhere. The patient was on a whole laundry list of medications and does not know if they were relevant to this. The patient had just recently started experiencing some extreme changes to herself to the point where she is hospitalized. The medical team is not finding anything wrong with the patient medically. The patient has developed some psychosis and there is nothing else that has happened that would have caused it. The patient had both doses of her COVID-19 vaccine. The patient&#39;s granddaughter was trying to research it to see if has been reported by anyone else. The patient&#39;s granddaughter considered the events as non-serious. The patient had not recovered from the events.

                                                kidneys weren&#39;t acting/kidney issues; not having the feeling to urinate; Light-headed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (reported for herself). A 91-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248; expiration date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and blood thinner. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner. The patient is asking if there were any reports of adverse events with kidneys and the vaccine. She received the 1st shot last Thursday (07Jan2021) and told that yesterday (10Jan2021), she had an episode where kidneys weren&#39;t acting. She also mentioned that she is on a blood thinner, ELIQUIS. She is due to receive the 2nd shot on 28Jan2021. She said that she wouldn&#39;t want to receive the 2nd dose if this was related to her adverse reaction. The issue with the kidney started after on 10Jan2021, yesterday she was really having problems, she went to church then came home by that time she would have to go to the bathroom, but she did not go, she ended up cooking dinner which was 3 hours later, she was noticing that she was not urinating. She drank some Gatorade and that made it little better, she is wondering if it&#39;s a side effect. On 10Jan2021, when she noticed the kidney issues, she did not know for certain if it started before that, she didn&#39;t pay attention. Also, yesterday (10Jan2021), she got sick in which she had to grab the counter, she felt bad, she wasn&#39;t dizzy, but felt light-headed. The symptom of not having the feeling to urinate had improved a little today but she is concerned and wanted to know if this was a side effect. Her being light-headed only occurred on 10Jan2021, it was a onetime occurrence yesterday. However, she was also just sitting around, laying around, after that yesterday. The outcome of the event &#39;light-headed&#39; was unknown; while outcome of other events was recovering.

This went on  for 4 days (until 1/31/2021).  She called a nurse at her facility morning of 1/31/2021, who told her it was most likely a side effect from the vaccine.   My mom did not feel reassured and called the front desk at her facility.   Eventually 911 was called, the paramedics came afternoon of 1/31/2021 and they told her her blood pressure was not quite right, and if she wanted to go to the hospital.  She said no.   She was less upset though.   She still didn&#39;t feel &#34;normal&#34; until 2/2/2021.  She is prone to panic and PTSD if things don&#39;t feel right.

A 91-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE)Lot # EL3247, via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 18:00 at single dose at left shoulder for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included osteoporosis from Aug2020, rash on her legs from Aug2020, (lower leg below the knee, she was using a steroid but she had stopped as she was told not to use it too often by her doctor and just use Vaseline to keep the skin moist. She was asked if she had used any steroids but she hadn&#39;t used it in the past week and maybe only once in the previous week but couldn&#39;t be certain it wasn&#39;t in the last 10 days. She resisted the urge to use Mometasone 0.01 as it damaged the skin.); allergies to Sulfa a few years before. The patient reported her daughter who died at 41 years old of breast cancer. There were no concomitant medications. There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.The patient previously took brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate (COMBIGAN) a few years before and experienced allergies, the eye drops didn&#39;t her any good at all and was told not to use it anymore. She previously received flu shot most every year and never had a problem. She stated that evening on 19Jan2021 she felt fine and then the next morning on 20Jan2021 she experienced tingling around the mouth area and lips. Almost as though her mouth or lips were moving in a way that she had no control over. She looked in the mirror and saw no evidence of it moving but could feel it moving. It was just a feeling she was having. The feeling was about the same. The first 2 days was on just the right side but she has had now had 2 occasions where it was on the left side. This was not constant, just occasionally during the day. She wanted to know if this was a known side effect and will it go away. She wanted to know if she should receive the second dose of the vaccine considering these side effects.The outcome of the events was not resolved.

A 91-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 at 14:30 PM (at the age of 91-year-old)  as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was not reported. Historical vaccine included Dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced minor soreness and nausea; the Flu vaccine and experienced aches, chills, fever, and once even had a red streak up and down the injection site arm. On 05Feb2021, immediately after received the second shot, the patient experienced very acute confusion; marked confusion, that lasted about an hour; she had never had it before; it was also reported that it was completely out of character. The nurse informed that her mother had never had marked confusion before and since it did pass, the nurse feels it&#39;s medically significant. It was reported that the patient was observed for 15 minutes and then got up and went back to her apartment. In that period of time when in there, no one noticed what happened in that few minutes. The nurse reported her mother&#39;s neighbor was who called her. The nurse was on the way to pick up her mother anyway because she knew there was always a chance of side effects with older people. The nurse had just driven up within that 15 minutes when the neighbor called stating the patient was confused. This was completely out of character for her. When she picked up her mother she took her to the emergency room which is maybe 20 minutes away and didn&#39;t have the petal to the metal. On the way to emergency room could see her mother starting to clear up. She had her down in the car in about 10 minutes, 20 minutes driving to emergency room, so a total of 45 minutes to hour. They asked questions and within the hour her mother was okay, it was scary. The clinical outcome of very acute confusion and completely out of character was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the events &#34;acute confusion; marked confusion, that lasted about an hour; she had never had it before; it was also reported that it was completely out of character&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be completely exclucded.

This 91-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included high blood pressure, kidney cancer, cancer in her bladder 20 years ago and coughing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), ascorbic acid (VIT C), losartan potassium for blood pressure, metoprolol succinate for blood pressure, amlodipine for blood pressure, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81). Patient had cancer in her bladder 20 years ago. That was taken care of. Had kidney cancer because her husband used to smoke and blow it in her face. Had rare type of kidney cancer. It was removed. Treated for bladder cancer. Patient has had no problem ever since and that was more than 18 years ago. Patient had a fever, headache, and was very tired. Burning up on side of the body and she got all wet. This was not normal and she felt like she was dying. Patient stated she had shingles and developed post herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had pain at the bottom of her foot but it was getting worse after she received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Patient noticed the liquid going thru arm to chest and in straight line to her leg, like a science fiction movie with an injection of some kind. The doctor thought the vaccine might have an impact on the nervous system and spike the symptoms of post herpetic neuralgia. Patient spoke to her doctor but nobody knows anything. Nobody was willing to help her. Patient felt like she was dying. She didn&#39;t want to die. Patient feel the symptoms are getting worst. She was burning up inside. Her pain was around the bottom of the foot now it&#39;s on top of the foot and goes up to knee. Patient was not blaming anybody but she thought it was the vaccine. Patient was sweating, wet, perspiring all night. The symptoms usually occur at night. Patient wanted to know if these symptoms were associated with the vaccine. Patient also mentioned she developed a bladder infection for which she was taking antibiotics. Patient had Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021, about 5 days ago. Patient followed instructions before vaccine. Doctor said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) before the vaccine for a headache. Patient did that. Patient had injection and told to wait for 15 minutes before she went home. About 5 minutes, she was relaxed and sitting down. Vaccination given in left arm. All of a sudden she had a very strange feeling in her body on 02Feb2021. Something was going across the top and right side like a fluid was flowing or something strange. Then it felt like a straight line down her right foot and it stopped. Was a feeling like maybe the liquid of the vaccine went that way. Didn&#39;t have a vein going that way. Patient was afraid. She went home and didn&#39;t remember the next thing that happened. Every night she has gotten more sick. Patient had a feeling in her foot where she had shingles a few years ago. After shingles had post-herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had burning on bottom of her foot and would put it in ice water. Patient could handle that because it was just uncomfortable. After injection, she got so bad, the post-herpetic neuralgia was on her whole foot and it started to burn. It went up a little towards the knee or higher. Yesterday, at times, it quickly went over to the left leg. Patient had a fever every day and every night. Patient took paracetamol to cut the fever. Patient was coughing on call but stated that was nothing and the coughing was something she had. Every night she felt like her body was burning up in side. Felt like she was burning alive. Got all wet with perspiration. She changed clothes and every night it got worse. Patient called emergency, they listened to her, stating they have never heard of anything like this. Asked patient if she wanted to go to emergency. She stated ok. The doctor listened to her story and told her it was weird. Doctor told her to give it a few more days to up to eight days. Doctor wanted her to get a urine test, but she couldn&#39;t urine, patient tried for a long time in the bathroom and only got a few drops of urine out and it was brown. Not normal urine. Next day patient called 911. She wanted to be assured she was not dying at home. Did have room available at the hospital. Patient had to sit in a wheelchair and there was no bed for her to lie down in. Last time she was admitted from the emergency. Next day she came home and had to call emergency again. Really thought she was burning up. Patient didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital and suffered at home. Next night and third night was so bad. Patient couldn&#39;t urinate anymore. She had a fever, but not a high fever, because the paracetamol cut the fever. Temperature was 100 degrees. On the inside she thought she was being burned up a live. Never got better, always got worse. Yesterday, she was in the hospital all day. Now she has an infection in her bladder. Was put on a machine and everything. Had a long procedure, and got the urine going. Patient didn&#39;t miss not urinating. Has accidents like when she sneezes or cough. Usually gets up 2-3 times at night to urinate. When she finally realized she couldn&#39;t urinate, the doctor kept her there for a long time, eight hours. Was put on the machine, thought she may need a catheter. Her bladder was massaged in order to get her to urinate. Patient only had the left kidney. Correct problem about the urine. Doctor told her to make sure she goes back for second dose on 23Feb2021, but she was afraid. In the morning she was a little better, couldn&#39;t handle this. Patient was very weak and tired. One night she was in the emergency and didn&#39;t sleep because of the procedures. Patient didn&#39;t think the needle went in all of the way when the nurse administered her vaccine. Sensation started on the left, went across her chest, straight down like an arrow. Like something was trickling down to the end of her foot and stopped. Patient had symptoms every night since. So severe patient thought she was burning up. Patient got worse every night and didn&#39;t get any better. Patient said feeling at COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was not a natural thing. Last time she was in the hospital her blood pressure went up to 184. After COVID-19 Vaccine patient lost a little weight. Same time had this problem, was seeing a doctor with a colon specialty. Had so much constipation for a long time and tried to correct it with mediation. Medication was too strong and gave her diarrhea. Doctor thought maybe she had colon cancer. Stopped the medication. Wasn&#39;t 100% healthy, but that was just cramps. Patient eats very little now, not very hungry. Patient feels good in her bowels after something good from a restaurant. Patient attempted to clarify the medication that was too strong. She stated it was over the counter. She stated it was something that had to be mixed. She was supposed to take a cap full and mix it with 8 ounces of liquid. Needed something to make her have a bowel movement. Only took it for two days. Was way before the vaccine. It was too strong and she stopped it. Patient took a probiotic. After that patient was given gas relief medication called: Gas Relief Extra Strength Simethicone, 125mg. Provided: V11496, MSRS 53041 REV 0417, and 883928. Patient no longer has constipation. Now it is the opposite. Now bowel movements are soft and pasty. Patient tried a stool softener that didn&#39;t work, was worthless. Was over the counter. Patient didn&#39;t take stool softeners after the COVID-19 Vaccine. All the events started from Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.

She said her mother&#39;s blood pressure was up during that time, as well. She said on Saturday night (20Feb2021) at 9:00 PM she took her mother to the Emergency Room because her mother&#39;s blood pressure was very high. She said a CT scan of her mother&#39;s head was done and was negative for a stroke. She said her mother was kept in the Emergency Room and monitored.

She said her mother was given some orange juice and peanut butter crackers at the time. She said her mother&#39;s stomach became upset then. She said she thinks her mother&#39;s stomach upset had more to do with having the orange juice and peanut butter crackers than anything else. She said her mother has never had nose bleeds or headaches before. She said her mother has blood pressure issues that she takes blood pressure medicine for. She said she thinks the COVID-19 Vaccine may have exasperated her mother&#39;s issues. Reported on Sunday (21Feb2021), her mother didn&#39;t seem much better to her. She said her mother&#39;s blood pressure was up, her mother was dizzy, weak and had a bad headache. She said her mother has a healthy appetite for 92 years old and her mother didn&#39;t want anything to eat. She said she ended up calling 911 because her mother wasn&#39;t making any sense when she talked.

Reported her mother has had no more nose bleeds since yesterday 22Feb2021.  She said her mother is still quite weak, but her blood pressure is now under control. She said her mother has been on a stroke watch while at the hospital, and her mother has not been allowed to get up out of bed as of last night (21Feb2021). She said the hospital staff are supposed to let her mother walk today (23Feb2021) to see if her mother&#39;s blood pressure stays stabilized. She said her mother&#39;s comprehension is not at the same level as prior to being hospitalized. She clarified her mother still drives a car at 92 years old and takes care of her own check book. She said she doesn&#39;t know if her mother will still be able to do that at this time. Reported her mother was checked for a UTI while at the hospital. She said the hospital went ahead and treated her mother for a UTI without knowing if her mother had a UTI. She said because her mother is elderly, a lot of times the elderly have UTIs. She said the hospital didn&#39;t want to waste time and went ahead and treated her mother for a UTI because her mother hadn&#39;t been on antibiotics recently. The caller stated she did not have any information on the medications her mother has been given while at the hospital. Reported at first she did not think her mother&#39;s symptoms had to do with her mother&#39;s first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, but then there was a new part to her mother&#39;s story that made her think her mother&#39;s symptoms had to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller stated she is apprehensive for her mother to go get her second COVID-19 Vaccine shot.

A 94-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 (around 3:15 PM to 3:20 PM) at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml dose injection in right arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure, cholesterol, blood thinner and fluid. The patient historical vaccine included varicella zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) for immunization. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect as this was the first dose. The patient had no prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included ongoing apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner, ongoing furosemide (LASIX) for fluid, valsartan for blood pressure, ongoing pravastatin for cholesterol. The reporter was calling because her mother had the COVID-19 Vaccine on 07Jan2021, it was on a Thursday. By that Friday (08Jan2021) she was not feeling that well. Caller stated she did not know if what occurred had any correlation to the vaccine, but she wanted to report these details in case this started to be came a problem. Her mother is 94 years old and was in very good shape. However, now she was in the hospital completely disoriented. Since getting the vaccine she had subsequently broke out with shingles two days after getting the vaccine on 09Jan2021. Caller reiterated she was not saying this had anything to do with the vaccine, but she just wanted to reported these events. Caller initially stated it was unknown why patient was admitted to the hospital. She went on to explain her mother, the patient, was complaining of pain and burning. She started complaining of this pain and burning in the evening like around 5PM (on 08Jan2021 17:00). She later broke out into shingles. Caller mentioned patient has not had the SHINGRIX vaccine yet. However, she did have the older vaccine, ZOSTAVAX. Caller confirmed patient received the ZOSTAVAX years before. Patient went to the Emergency Room the first time on 09Jan2021 due to complaining of pain and burning and they could not find anything wrong with her. They checked her vitals and ran several tests and it all came back fine. They then sent her home. Patient went back to the Emergency Room on 10Jan2021 and completed another battery of test, labs, checked vitals, had chest x-ray, and cat scan at this time they could not diagnose with Shingles. On 11Jan2021, the patient had an appointment with her Primary Doctor and he did not find anything wrong. Patient came home with caller&#39;s sister and she was helping her get undressed. That was when the sister noticed a rash on the patient&#39;s body. The rash broke out on her body on Monday 11Jan2021. They tried to call the doctor that night, but did not get a response. On Tuesday 12Jan2021 they took the patient to urgent care and that was when she was formally diagnosed with Shingles. She was started on medication for the Shingles, Acyclovir, and sent home. They also thought she had a slight Urinary Tract Infection. She was started on CIPRO for the urinary tract infection. Patient was home for a couple of days in Jan2021 and she was not getting any better. She was then starting to lose her mental faculties. They thought this was from the urinary tract infection. Caller clarified the patient was then admitted to the hospital on 16Jan2021 due being disoriented. For causality assessment, it was mentioned that it is so coincidental this happened right after getting the vaccine. She was healthy and then it was like a snowball. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.

A 94-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (right arm) on 21Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE (arm right) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included left shoulder pain (on medication for years) from an unspecified date, and elbow that she fell on two weeks before on Jan2021. Concomitant medication included hydrocodone for left shoulder pain. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced real tired and she even slept 14 hours the night before. Reporter was wondering if tiredness is a side effect of the product. The patient also had an elbow that she fell on two weeks before on Jan2021, and three days after getting the vaccine (24Jan2021), that elbow started hurting more, and it was on the same arm as the side she got the injection on, the right arm. The reporter was unsure of the lot number reported as E13249 or EL3249 (unsure which lot number is his, and which is the one his wife received). The patient received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the event &#34;elbow starting hurting more, and it was on the same arm as the side she got the injection on, the right arm&#34; was not recovered. Outcome of events &#34;is real tired and she even slept 14 hours last night&#34; was unknown.

A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

Saturday  the 27 is when it started, she woke with all these symptoms, she needed assistance with everything  she normally does by herself ex: taking shower, getting dressed.  Everyday after she got 10% better and as of this notice she still isn?t back 100%.. She better than she was but suffering from the effects. She?s not going to get second shot because she says it will kill her. I want her to get it but if the 2nd shot is worse than first I can?t in good conscience let her get it.
