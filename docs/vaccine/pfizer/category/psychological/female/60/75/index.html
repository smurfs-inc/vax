This 60-year-old female nurse (Patient) reported that received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation, Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune. Concomitant medications included Metoprolol at 12.5 mg for Atrial fibrillation and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN). No diabetes, no hypertension. None of the usual common diseases. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was &#39;weird&#39; sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday. What happened it looked like an encephalopathy but my head swelled, my face was all swollen, complete brain fog, fatigue and I couldn&#39;t talk. I was in so much pain in my head resulting in (incomplete sentence).&#34; Lab work included the only thing is the PCR swabbing. No blood test. Registered Nurse further stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know if that is important. But I will tell you and if it is you can send me the questions. I do have a history of Autoimmune. So my Physician thought that this was just like an enhancement of like my bodies reaction I have Chronic Lyme and I have lupus like my ANA has always been stressful. But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body&#39;s reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.&#34; Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I just wanted to let you know what happened and the intensity of what it was because normally I would expect a headache. But this was a &#39;go dated&#39;. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I guess the only question that I have is so do my work has this question and I was going to call my doctor tomorrow may be might know it better. I know that I have to take the second dose. But I understand the second round can be worse than the first. Is there anything that they are recommending that I can do may be prior to ease the reaction?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported clinical manifestations including swelling face and head swelled, which was suspected as encephalopathy by the reporting nurse, was probably related to the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), due to temporal relationship.  The subject&#39;s underlying Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune were likely the risk factors to the onset of the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The pain in my arm woke me up. I never felt like I fell asleep. I woke up at 530am and took my Thyroid medicine and went back to bed until 6:30am. Felt fine until about 830am. I noticed I was starting to feel lightheaded and had this pressure on my head. I went back to bed and tried to fall asleep but really never did. I noticed that I would lose track of my train of thought often. Got up at 11am and  took a shower and still just didn&#39;t feel like I had any motivation to do anything, so rested again. I then noticed my face, ear lopes and cheeks felt a little numb. I would pinch them and I noticed they were numb. Also, there was still pressure on the back of my head and on the bridge of my nose. Still light headed. I layed in bed until about 3pm when I did notice the numbness going away and the pressure on the back of my head and on the bridge of my nose getting a little better. Also, no appetite.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears.

She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away.

She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. For treatment, she took Mucinex tablets for allergy. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. This was the first dose, her second dose is due on 02Feb2020 and she wants to know if she can skip it.   Before she got it she contacted her primary care due to having allergies before the vaccine and asked if she should take; she was told to hold on but then she went ahead and took it. Within the first 30 minutes she was ok but in an hour is when she had the burning sensation in her chest. The burning sensation lasted about an hour. The dose was administered around 4pm on 12Jan2021.The caller reports that the Mucinex and she has breathing treatment, nebulizer treatments for her lungs, that she did and these things helped. Early this morning she felt she can now close her mouth and breathe normally. It was administered in the upper left arm. She did not require a visit to the doctor or ER. The patient has had no reactions to vaccines in the past nor were any administered on the day of or within the prior 4 weeks. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of allergy like symptoms, congested and blockage in her nose and shortness of breath which included Mucinex. The patient recovered from burning sensation in her chest on 12Jan2021, from allergy like symptoms/allergy and shortness of breath on 13Jan2021 while the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Severe Left Leg, Hip and Lower left leg pain (Sciatic Nerve) it appears the vaccine may have irritated sciatic nerve pain.  Left left leg numbness.  Decreased mobility, difficulty sitting, walking, and even lying in bed.  Started very quickly without andy known injury.  Pain continued to worsen.  Pain even worse after second injection.  Now two weeks after second shot, the pain is going away.  It is like the nerve irritation is subsiding.  The way the irritation is subsiding makes it seem that the vaccination may have caused irritation to the nerve. After receiving 1st and continuing through the second vaccine, started having severe sciatica pain going down left hip and leg.  Left leg pain and numbness.  Thought I had done something to damage the nerve.  Hurt to sit, hurt to stand and even hurt when in bed. The pain was so severe it caused issues with any mobility.  Took Advil, Aspiring, Tylenol and nothing helped.  Received second vaccine 1/12/2021 the pain continued and even got worse.  It was to the point I couldn&#39;t even walk.  I couldn&#39;t figure out how I had damaged the nerve.  I am now thinking it was from the vaccine.  I believe the vaccine irritated the nerve.  The nerve pain is starting to go away.  Normally if you  have a sciatic nerve issue, it just doesn&#39;t go away on its own.  I know there have been reports of severe back and neck pain.  I believe it can irritate the nerves which cause severe pain.  I wanted this reported in cases others complain of similar issues.  The good thing it is improving.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3302), other route on the right arm at the age of 60 years, on 02Feb2021 12:15 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included depression Depression, Hypothyroidism, High Cholesterol, Osteopenia, Occasional vertigo. Concomitant medication included simvastatin (SIMVASTATIN), duloxetine (DULOXETINE), raloxifene (RALOXIFENE), chlorthalidone (CHLORTHALIDONE), levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE) , calcium (CALCIUM), vitamin d [vitamin d nos] (VITAMIN D [VITAMIN D NOS]), folic acid (FOLIC ACID), fish oil (FISH OIL), vitamin b12 nos (VITAMIN B12 NOS) , calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 2000) and Tumeric. The patient had the first dose of vaccine on 12Jan2021. After the 2nd shot, the patient&#39;s arm didn&#39;t get heavy, just felt a weakness going from shoulders down to hands on Feb2021. She couldn&#39;t move or feel them for 15 min. Slowly she could move her fingers then hands then lift arms. The next day her brain felt kind of fuzzy and still a little &#34;off kilter&#34; on 2nd day (Feb2021). She did not have any anxiety about either shot, even with what happened with the first one. The outcome of the events was recovering.

This 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686), via intramuscular, on 06Jan2021 (at 14:30) at single dose at left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Age at vaccination is 61-year-old.  Historical vaccine included Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine (intramuscular, at single dose) on 15Dec2020 for immunization; and Shingles vaccine (intramuscular, at single dose) on 15Dec2020 for varicella immunization. Relevant medical history included usual tenderness. No relevant concomitant medications were provided.  On 07Jan2021, she woke up at 2:00 in the morning, she had a high temperature, she was chilled, she had a severe headache, nausea, fatigue, and body aches. She got up and took ibuprofen (ADVIL). She was basically in bed, she had to cancel all her appointments in the morning, she just laid in bed and the following afternoon her fever broke at about 4:30 in the afternoon then she just had a low grade temperature and a dull headache, nausea through the next day, Friday the 08Jan2021. She still has a very dull headache and just not right, kind of like a flu bug. She had no fever; she had not had any fever after Friday afternoon or Saturday. Fever started at 2 in the morning 07Jan2021 and she experienced the chills until after fever broke. Fever went above 102 degrees. She still had a little of the nausea, she just didn&#39;t feel like eating. She still had the dull headache. The nausea and headache have improved when compared to how it was on the 07Jan2021. She was back to work now she just has a dull frontal headache. The reporting nurse assessed all the events, except of &#39;Doesn&#39;t feel like eating&#39;, serious for disability. She stated she may have had usual tenderness but nothing like this. The patient had recovered from the event fever on 08Jan2021 and from the event &#39;chills/chilled&#39; on 07Jan2021; the patient was recovering from &#39;nausea&#39; and &#39;severe Headache/Dull headache/Frontal headache&#39;, while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  It is worth noting that patient had other vaccines not far ago, including Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine and Shingles vaccine on 15Dec2020 for immunization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                I had an immediate reaction to the covid vaccine within 30 seconds after the injection.  I felt a warm sensation after the vaccine in my deltoid muscle then felt it go up both my ears, around my head.  I then felt the same warm sensation in my abdomen, followed by buzzing of my entire body with light headedness.  I could breath, I could talk, but I had an urgency for others around me to know that I wasn?t feeling well and something was not right.  I asked my colleagues if someone could take me to the ER for monitoring.  They immediately put me in a recliner and elevated my legs.  This did not relieve my symptoms and asked to go to the ER.  I got to the ER and laid on the stretcher with continued increased buzzing sensation especially in my finger tips and arms.  My vital signs were 148/88 and HR 88 (elevated from my normal of 100-120/60-70, HR 60s).  The buzzing turned into a sensation in my arms that rumbled erratically.  I thought something bad was about to happen and that my blood cells would burst. Then I also felt icy cold in my arms and my gut.  Next what happened were teeth chattering shivers.  All these symptoms occurred in a matter of minutes.  They started an IV, drew blood, gave me Benadryl and ran IV fluids.  My vitals did not reflect what I felt inside, but as symptoms let up, my VS returned to normal.  As quickly as the symptoms started, they eventually calmed down and I was able to leave the ER in 1.5 hours to go home. I was very scared.  The ER doctor thought I had a hyperimmune response to the vaccine.

It was not like I could not work or anything, it was just there.  On the 9th day I woke up with fever and chills and a super bad headache and I felt so bad I could not even go seek medical care, I finally went after 3 or 4 days feeling like that. At the walk in clinic they tested me for flu, covid and strep and on the rapid the result was negative but when done the PCR it came back positive (around 12/29/20). I did not have any respiratory issues on this one. I do remember having diarrhea.

I left the center after 15 minutes and came back to Pediatric office where I work.  I did take a Zyrtec and felt completely better after approx. an hour.  After the 2nd dose I did mention I had felt odd after 1st dose and decided to sit for 30 min.  I felt about the same as I did after the 1st dose so I left.  when  I got to my car my face was flushed.  I was not tachycardia just a very odd felling in my head and then my tongue did start to itch (or feel funny)  .  I took a Zyrtec and went home.  I never had any swelling of lips or tongue, no trouble breathing.  Pulse stayed constant around 80.  This time the symptoms lasted approx. 4 hours.  I I did continue to take Zyrtec for 3 days after injection.

I took a couple of Aleve tabs 24 hours after the vaccine and then switched to 500 mg Tylenol 30 hours after the vaccine, with no relief of symptoms from either meds.  I&#39;ve been sleeping (taking 2 hour naps) and called off of work (I work in home health).   Today, 1.27.21 I feel better, still having &#39;hot flashes&#39; and some chills (again, without fever).  I feel tired, slept last night for 12 hours (no further insomnia).  I am eating, but really have no appetite.

A 61-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 18Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been otherwise well prior to receiving the bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020. Within 72 hours, she experienced fatigue, body aches, chills and sweats since 21Dec2020, though she was able to work Xmas week. On 31Dec2020, she contacted her PCP to report neck and leg muscle stiffness and pain, difficulty ambulating, fatigue, chills and sweats. She had a negative COVID test on 02Jan2021 and essentially negative blood work, other than an ESR of 124 mm/hr and CRP of 4 mg/dl. I had a negative PET scan on 12Jan2021. Currently, she had pain/stiffness in her neck and legs, and progressive difficulty w/ ambulation (both of which are worst in the early hours of the AM), and difficulty with ADLs since 31Dec2020. She had been unable to work since 03Jan2021. Her physician had not indicated or endorsed any relationship between her symptoms and the vax. She forewent dose 2 out of an abundance of caution. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events muscle stiffness , neck pain and gait disturbance appeared 13 days after administration of single dose BNT162B2. The Company considers that the events are less likely related to suspect BNT162B2 injection given the weak time association. The detailed clinical course and cause of the events would be helpful for further assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my medical office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 11Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism and back pain. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), ibuprofen and ergocalciferol (VIT D). The patient previously received 1st dose of BNT162B2 on 20Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization (left arm, lot number: EH9899). After receiving second dose on 11Jan2021 the patient was feeling tired but also edgy, nervous, anxious, unable to focus, some headaches. Discovered 18Jan2021 that blood pressure was much higher than normal and associated with the way I was feeling. Had to go to primary care to have medication prescribed. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. Patient was not pregnant. No known allergies. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19 (Nasal swab), on 13Jan2021 and 16Jan2021 both test results were negative. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                I am not sure this is what i shoud be filling out - just wanted to report what seemed like pretty bad symptoms on first dose by all info i have found. The actual shot was given by another facility than listed previously. I recieved the first dose of Pfizer at  Health Dept . No other location information was provided by them.  When i got the shot, a blood vein and possibly a nerve was hit. The nurse did everything properly i think to correct and notify other RN. It caused immediate pain in left fingers and arm felt heavy. That continued for days, but not too bad and injection site itself really was not very sore. My concern was how sick I felt starting within 6 hours of the injection and how long it lasted. I had pretty much instant nausea- no vomiting- mild but persistant, severe fatigue and general overall uneasy/sick feeling. Joint pain started within the 6 hours, along with a few odd pains in neck and right abdomen.  Was extremely chilled for hours, pretty bad tension /tight feeling headache, jittery feeling and foggy. I took a 500mg Tylenol about 8 hours after the shot, and it helped to relieve most symptoms to a degree that was nagging, but tolerable. I pretty much went through this for about the next 3 days and off/on to the 5th day

MRA and MRI, no evidence of stroke, transient global amnesia, it took a couple hours for me to get back to normal. I also had a shingles outbreak 10 days post both vaccines.

Headache started within one hour after vaccination and was severe 4 hours after vaccination. Next day morning I woke up with all my face swollen, runny nose, headache, stiff neck, pressure and pain at the base of the skull, pain and edema behind and below both jaws, pain in the right year and dizziness. Face edema and runny nose subsided 3 days after injection. Stiff neck, pressure and pain at the base of the skull, pain and edema behind and below both jaws, pain in the right year persists 7 days after injection. Dizziness and foggy head became  worth 7 days after injection.

A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (, Solution for injection, Batch/lot no: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 15:00 in the left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously did get a flu shot in Nov or Dec2020. The patient developed a bad rash, hives, all over her body and itching on 10Feb2021. She reports, her feet were incredibly hot over the next 3 days on 07Feb2021. What started off as a few bumps kept increasing up to 3 days later. She was unable to sleep from being so itchy. Her doctor said it was an allergic reaction and prescribed an antihistamine after which it left in Feb2021. She was due for the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021. The patient did not had any investigation assessment. The patient states that there was little information out there to compare the experience she had. Wanted to call to make Pfizer aware of that and maybe get some more information out there. Has printed out the fact sheet and assumes she should not get the second vaccine because of what happened the first time. Wants to clarify what happened and share with Pfizer this information since she can&#39;t find much information for people who have had a delayed reaction. Went to get the vaccine on 04Feb and doesn&#39;t consider herself an allergic type person. Has no allergy to foods, medicines, only gets poison ivy and bug bites like most people. By Monday, the 4th day (08Feb2021) after getting the vaccine, noticed a couple of bumps on the wrist and does not know where else and didn&#39;t think of it as anything else. Thought it was a bite or she touched a plant and then it went away. It was not much. In the evening of Tuesday she had a bad reaction and on the 10th (10Feb2021) she had rash, hives, and itching that just moved to different places over the body. Her feet were so hot on the 3rd day and had to plunged them into cold water and used Epsom salt off and on and it helped some. This happened only for 2 nights and the reason she didn&#39;t go to the doctor, it went away. Again, mentions the first night she had a couple bumps and didn&#39;t think much about it. The second night, it was all over her body, the rash, and she took Epsom baths that helped, but she didn&#39;t get much more than an hour of sleep. She tried to take pictures of her thighs and backside, but unable to take good pictures, not a selfie person. The next morning she had her husband take pictures in case it went away and she went to the doctor they would have pictures to show. Her husband thought it may be shingles. Called the doctor on Thursday and had pictures to show her since the rash went away. Again, mentions the reaction was so bad on Wednesday. The doctor didn&#39;t believe areas on pictures of her back were shingles since shingles does not come and go away like that and that she must have had an allergic reaction to something. Provider didn&#39;t believe it was from the vaccine. Was given a prescription for Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg and was informed if areas didn&#39;t improve or returned she may need to see an allergist or immunologist. After the appointment she didn&#39;t get much sleep and woke up at 4pm in the afternoon and felt a little off, it could have been in her head or maybe she was paranoid, but she wasn&#39;t going to wait for the reaction to be full blown over her body and took one Hydroxyzine HCL and went to bed at 7:30pm and didn&#39;t do anything since. Got up and the reaction/rash, hives, itching was all gone after taking only one. It&#39;s like an antihistamine or Zyrtec. No further details provided. Later mentions after getting the first vaccine on the 4th, the next day she had arm soreness up until that Monday when the rash started. No further details provided. Says as far as recommendations were concerned for the paper she printed, the fact sheet. It says pretty much listed, she shouldn&#39;t have the second dose if difficulty breathing, swelling in the face and throat. The only thing she had was the rash on the neck, not the face. Paperwork also lists heart beating fast, or severe allergic reaction. The patient had no emergency room visit. The patient visited the physician office. The outcome of the event hot feeling in feet was recovered on feb2021 and rest of the events was recovering.

A 61-year-old female patient received their first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 20Jan2021 18:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and high BP from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine, losartan potassium and sodium fluoride (CREST CAVITY PROTECTION). The patient previously took septra and experienced allergies. The patient reported that on 21Jan2021, they woke up and brushed their teeth then at 6:40am blood with large clots gushed from their right (rt) nostril. The patient went to ER and stopped bleeding after 2 hrs. On 22Jan2021, the patient woke up with bad headache, winded, vomited, diaherra (as reported), coughing. On 23Jan2021, they went to get covid test but due to blood in their nose, they received antibody test which was negative. On 24Jan2021, the patient was still feeling bad with all the above symptoms. Then on 25Jan2021, they went to ENT doctor who cauterized their nose and stated that since antibody was negative to take the maderna vaccine since they have no antibody in their system, the Pfizer vaccine did not work. From 26Jan2021 to 13Feb2021, the patient felt same started feeling better 14Feb2021 but still have sore muscles in their shoulders and cough. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 antibody test: negative on 23Jan2021.  The action taken in response to the event(s) for bnt162b2 was not applicable. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of epistaxis and clot blood which include the doctor cauterized their nose. The patient recovered with sequel from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the epistaxis and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.

By Friday, I went to my PCP and they noticed that my blood pressure was only 90/58 and they were concerned so she told me that she was calling my cardiologist who said to reduce the dose of my Diltiazem from 180 mg daily to 120 mg daily. She also said to take a few days off of taking the Diltiazem. I have also had a serious increase in Tachycardia. That evening I went to the ED because I was so weak and couldn&#39;t breath well. I am also retaining a lot of fluid. The lab work indicated an elevated Pro-B-Natriuretic Peptide level of 227. I am still not well and each doctor I have spoken to said they believe it is due to the vaccine. I do not know if I should take the second dose.

Lowered to the floor by vaccine staff.  Patient reports symptoms of weakness, other wise states she &#34;&#34;feels fine&#34;&#34;. Two additional syncopal episodes witnessed by myself when patient attempts to change position.  Past medical history is significant for mild persistent allergic asthma, pre-diabetes, OSA, obesity and BPPV.  Patient reports history of same reaction s/p previous vaccine.  At a approximately 0837 patient was noted to have a worsening rash present to her face.  EpiPen administered via left lateral thigh at 0838.  EMS called to transport patient the ED for further evaluation.    Treatment administered: epipen (lot 0FM406, exp 02/22) left lateral thigh at 0838.    Upon arrival to the ED, patient&#39;s temperature is 98.8° F, heart rate 92-103, respiratory rate 30, saturating 99% on room air with blood pressure 164/91.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were largely unremarkable.  While in the ED, the nurse was getting ready to get the patient up to the commode when the patient started to &#34;&#34;not feel right again.&#34;&#34;  She asked her to administer the medications for allergic reaction and reports wall the 2nd medication was being infused, she felt paralyzed and unable to talk, although she was able to hear everything and was aware, she was unable to move or speak for a short amount of time.  CT head with completed at this time and showed no acute intracranial findings.  Chest x-ray unremarkable.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, heart rate 80 and prolonged QT at 470.  The patient was administered Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, Pepcid 20 mg IV, Benadryl 50 mg IV, normal saline 1 L IV.  Pt was admitted to hospital for observation.    The patient was seen on the unit laying in bed with her husband at the bedside.  She reports that she is feeling slightly better and hungry and has never felt at paralyzed/unable to speak feeling before and is very nervous about this.  She was wondering if she had a seizure, although she reports feeling aware the entire time and did not lose bowel or bladder function. We discussed that that is not typical for a seizure, but even if we did an EEG at this time, it would not be able to tell us what occurred in the past.  We discussed continue the Benadryl, Pepcid, and IV steroids for today and likely decreasing them tomorrow. We discussed the workup of syncopal episodes as well. The patient and her husband were agreeable to this plan.    Patient was discharged from the hospital on 03/24/2021 in a stable medical condition.  Patient was instructed to follow-up with her PCP in 1 week.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that the patient vision wasn&#39;t as good. She also had glasses to read (eyeglass wearer and ongoing) and behind her eyes they were dry one (left) mostly. Concomitant medications included unspecified beta blockers. On 11Mar2021, she got chills on the same day. Right as she got the shot, she wanted to vomit also and got shaky. On 12Mar2021, she woke up with whistling in her breathing for a few minutes then it was done. At the same moment, her eyes were changed eventually. She had mucus in my eyes as her vision wasn&#39;t as good and behind her eyes, they were dry one eye (left). So, watching TV wasn&#39;t as good and became bothersome. She later noticed, the black in here eye was taken up most of her eye (as if her eyes were dilated). Her eyes and hearing were sharp also now sharp as she was reading better (without my read glasses) and had to turn down the volume in her TV. She also felt like she was getting hemorrhoids for a few days but then it went away. She also had black stool, then constipation (harder stool) eventually went the day right after the shot (12Mar2021). Then around 5pm, she had feeling like she had too much sugar and was dry which she needed water. Once she sat down, her living room door seemed like it was so much further away, stairs the spindles were larger in size, it was if she was high on something. It was different nothing but this injection. She was also experiencing a feeling of peace and calm. As if nothing was wrong, no stress (stressing about something) she couldn&#39;t even think of- everything was gone, a calming effect. It was high feeling. The next day (13Mar2021), she had a super watery bowel movement then went into clay like and drier consistency but still dark (she never had stool this dark). In Mar2021, she also stated that there was a movement under her skin like a pre-herpes or a pre-shingles. She mentioned that she knew herpes and the movement under her skin was shingles feeling. Her skin was also extremely dry. On 17Mar2021 (a week after the injection), she woke up to my heart spasm. It was beating real fast (beating like right under her skin), no pain and heart attack but more than a heart flutter. She didn&#39;t know whether it was going to beat or stop. She also woke up with a loud whistle (louder than before) out of a dream. She stated that during the day she doesn&#39;t get the stressed, but in her dream, it was magnified and woke up in a violent vicious fury. She had 3 nights of this (uncalm coming into my dreams viciously, morbidly gross) started on 14Mar2021. The heart spasms come as a few seconds and goes away but that&#39;s happened twice which it scares her. She also stated that there was feeling of hardness in her lower abdomen and heart area (belch) in Mar2021.  The injection almost reversed her beta blockers (which keep it in the 50s) it went to 79 (same as it was before she started taking beta blockers) but her blood pressure was normal 121/something (that was a good thing). She also mentioned that her energy was so much more while other people woke up early, cleaning up -would get sleepy and a little tired. But this (injection) gave her energy. Her injection site for the first 2 weeks also had an itch, that would come up (not constant) almost like a yeast infection which had an extreme itch. There&#39;s pain was there on touch (no throbbing pain) it took over a week before it was gone. She also mentioned that the chills were off and on for 4 days. The vaccine also did something to her weight as she was expecting to lose weight, but she didn&#39;t. One day, she gained 3.2 pounds then the next day lost 3 pounds. Her tooth also broke (but no pain in her tooth) even she had a sensation of her teeth being weak which she could feel it. Her tooth broke eating a tortilla chip and that&#39;s weird. She wanted to know if other people had called in with the symptoms that she had experienced. The patient recovered from breath sounds abnormal and constipation on 12Mar2021; cardiospasm, chills and vaccination site pain in Mar2021 while the remaining events were unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. Information on the lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 61 years old female consumer received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; NDC number 59267-1000-01) on 29Mar2921 at 14:15, in left upper arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same date or within 4 weeks. Medical history included allergic to hamsters (she found out that this one had the Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and she knew she had problems with those things), allergic to prednisone (crazy rash, itching), allergic to a lot of different things, sinus infection. Family history included allergy (the whole family had allergies). Concomitant medications included unspecified antibiotics for sinus infection (but it had cleared up by then) and unspecified allergy shots (but not a vaccine). The patient just wanted to report that she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Symptoms began minutes after getting vaccine. The patient experienced getting lots of saliva started with a couple of minutes of getting the shot, tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, couldn&#39;t control her breathing, heart rate it got faster, started getting confused, shaky, wheezing, swelling of her throat, blood pressure dropped, all on 29Mar2021. On 30Mar2021 the patient experienced sore arm and neck pain but she thought that was more of a vaccination saying it was working. Clinical course of the events included the following information: the patient had to stay for a while since she had allergies normally. She started getting lots of saliva and she thought that was her body saying, she did something, not a big deal. Around 15 minutes, she was at a grocery store, she started walking around, her tongue started swelling, rapid breathing, she couldn&#39;t control her breathing and heart rate, it got faster. She started getting confused, shaky, it wasn&#39;t too good. She made her way back to the place where the injections were done, they were trying to get her to use her epinephrine (EPIPEN). She took a diphenidramine (BENADRYL) while walking around looking for her husband and then took another and was wheezing. She thought BENADRYL would have helped. She should have taken her EPIPEN looking back, she thought BENADRYL would help. They heard wheezing, they contacted the other pharmacist, who contacted EMS then they came and took her to the emergency room on 29Mar2021 in the afternoon. When she was wheeled in, the doctor met her in the hall and he said they could give her a steroid shot. The patient stated she was allergic to prednisone, she got a crazy rash, itching, it&#39;s not just prednisone, it&#39;s an allergy. She got the shot at 14:15 and she was at the hospital by 15:00. The patient thought she was there for 5 hours and then she was sent home. Her blood pressure dropped. The only one she saw was 114/39 but her husband saw it went even lower than that. At the emergency room, they had the automatic thing strapped on so they watched her until it started going back up again. The vaccine shot was probably the easiest shot she had ever had. She had never had any problems. She did not research it very well in the beginning because she thought they should be good. The patient was told to not get the second vaccine. The events also required physician office visit. Allergic reaction symptoms resolved on 29Mar2021 but the swelling of her throat and heart rate lasted about four days, until 02Apr2021. Neck pain resolved on 01Apr2021. Sore arm resolved on 03Apr2021 or 04Apr2021. Blood pressure dropping resolved on an unspecified date in 2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

It was reported that 09Apr2021- got her 1st Pfizer COVID shot. Left arm. Felt okay afterward, got a little tired later on. On Sunday, she woke up w/an earache on her left side, which moved down into her neck - near her lymph nodes. Later, her neck started swelling/itching/stinging/feeling warm, and it hurt her throat to swallow anything. She went to get Benadryl and anti-itch creams, but they didn&#39;t work. The neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse, and at one point it felt like her throat was swelling and getting narrow, and she wondered if this was one of those anaphylactic reactions. So she took 2 Benadryl, and that seemed to help. That night she couldn&#39;t sleep for the neck heat, itching and throat pain. Monday AM (12Apr2021), she took her temp, which was 100.2. She did a Teladoc Zoom so the doc could see the situation, and he said that it could be a severe vaccine reaction, or some kind of infection. He prescribed prednisone &amp; clindimycin. The rash left scars, which are peeling. Ae resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Prescription drugs. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 62-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 28Dec2020 at 14:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included environmental allergies, she has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume, blood pressure (abnormal) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included ongoing lisinopril for blood pressure, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took novocaine but was allergic.  She got all this information when she got the vaccine on Monday at (place name) in (state name). It tells all the side effects from the first injection. She wanted to report that it is the same arm that she got the vaccine in. She has swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm.  It says you can have joint pain, but nothing about swelling. She thought she better report it. This was her first shot. She is supposed to get the second one on 18Jan2021. She wanted to make sure she can take it. She received the vaccine on 28Dec2020. She laid around that day. Today is the first day she doesn&#39;t have arm pain and swelling at the injection site.  It was the first time she has had arm pain. She has never had that with flu shot. The arm pain started within the 15 minutes she was observed. It hurt like hell until that day. She got a bruise at the injection site. It bled a little bit when she put it in. Swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm: she doesn&#39;t know if it was later that day. She can&#39;t remember. She really noticed it yesterday. She has never had joint pain or swelling. She doesn&#39;t have any problems with arthritis. Now her little finger is bigger than the rest of her fingers. It hurts because of the swelling. She doesn&#39;t want to take anything. It might be fluid. She has a high pain tolerance. She keeps bending it thinking it will get better. It isn&#39;t as bad, but its still swelled up. At first she thought it was better, but it is still pretty swollen. To her this is a reaction. She was thinking if she took paracetamol before, it wouldn&#39;t hurt as bad, but she can&#39;t remember if she took it that morning. She takes 500mg before bed for the heck of it at night. It helps her sleep better. She has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume. They think she was allergic to the preservative in the flu shot, but she has never had any trouble with the flu shot since. She has environmental allergies. They thought she was allergic to Novocaine once at the dentist office. Who knows, it only happened once. She&#39;s been to the dentist many times and who knows what they injected and why she reacted that way. She felt like she was going to pass out. They don&#39;t give it to her anymore. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it. She is worried since this vaccine is emergency authorization. She doesn&#39;t want to get the next one and have a worse reaction. She is not sure if she should be worried. The events of swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm were assessed as medically significant. Outcome of the event of &#39;swelling of fingers&#39; was not recovered, the other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event joint pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the event swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Finally on Thursday night I realized maybe it is the shot that is giving me all the itching. My whole body was flushed I kept scratching my arms and legs, especially  around my ankle, knee, under arm and goin area.  I took an allergy pill  and called Kaiser and spoke with an advice nurse. she   mentioned that taking an allergy pill will relief some of the itching.   I fell asleep around after midnight normally I go to bed around 9:30.  I also called pfizer and explained and the person took all my information and symptoms.

                                                A little over 12 hours after receiving my 2nd dose at 8:42 am, I woke up at approximately 11:15 pm to find that my tongue and throat were swelling. I immediately took 1 25mg benadryl and went to the Emergency Room (ER). After many questions and examination of my mouth. I was given another benadryl, prednisone, and famotidine. I waited and was observed for approximately 2.5 hours in the ER. At that time it was obvious that the medication was effective and I was comfortable leaving the ER to return home. I had prescriptions for more prednisone and famotidine to take for 5 days. On Wednesday, I felt well enough to go to work at my school, though I did light duty. On Thursday, I was also at school and also attended a physical therapy session and exercise class. I talked at length with my PT about my experience and she could tell that I was feeling good (presumably from the prednisone) and cautioned me about not overdoing things during exercise. I felt like my tongue was beginning to swell and the PT mentioned that my words sounded a bit funny (she was the only one to comment on this). I then went to dinner at my daughters house and began to feel tired from the benadryl. Upon arriving home and getting ready for bed, my husband and I both noticed how flushed my chest and face had become during the day. My throat and tongue were still somewhat swollen and my throat was beginning to hurt. During the day on Thursday, I had registered with the local  Covid information website and had received an email stating that I should feel free to call the triage phone number if I needed. At approximately 9:45 pm I called and talked with a nurse who urged me to return to the ER because of the flushing and continued swelling. In the ER I was seen by a different doctor who was concerned not so much about the swelling, but about the white streaks in my throat and had me swabbed for strep throat. That test was negative. He said he had read my chart from Tuesday night and felt that the medication that had been prescribed was appropriate and that he didn&#39;t feel anything needed to be changed. He asked about how bad my throat felt and wrote a prescription for Magic Mouthwash and I asked for an EpiPen, which he also prescribed. We arrived home at approximately 12:00 am, but it was still difficult to lie down and sleep. I had already decided that I would not go to school on Friday and stay home and rest. I needed to pick up my prescriptions when the pharmacy opened and I ran a few other errands while I was out, but returned home and slept most of the afternoon. I have not been very energetic this evening, but decided that I wanted to get this form filled out. At approximately 10:00 PM on Friday evening, I hope that I am able to sleep better than I have the last several nights.

For the past 3 years I have been medication free and virtually symptom free.  The symptoms of the last few days are consistent with those I had during the years when my MCAD  was active.  I am concerned that the vaccine has reactivated the hyper-sensitivity of my mast cells.

                                                I am submitting this as a supplementary report to the report assigned on March 1, 2021.  This is day 10 after the vaccine and my mast cell reactivity symptoms have increased by the day--internal and external swelling, flushing, pruritis, wheezing, tightness in chest, as well as pain and pressure in arm pits, groin, and ears.  By late afternoon I am severely fatigued, weak, and foggy-headed.  These symptoms are consistent with those I experienced during the twenty years when my mast cell disease was unstable.  Through identification of my triggers and avoidance of the same, I have been symptom and medication free for the past three years--until taking the Covid-19 vaccine.  It appears that the vaccine has reactivated an excessive degranulation response in my mast cells and that response is getting worse as my body responds to the vaccine.  I realize that the percentage of persons who suffer from a condition like mine is small, but I would have appreciated having the information that I am submitting to you when I was weighing the pros and cons of vaccination.  I know from the twenty years of navigating this disease that there is nothing that can be done at this point other than taking various H1 and H2 blockers.  This vaccine appears to be undoing the hard-won level of stability achieved through years of careful lifestyle management.

This consumer (patient) reported that a 62-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 62-years, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hadn&#39;t had her period for 8 years. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historically received first single dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 62-years for COVID-19 immunization. Patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine last Friday 19Feb2021, when she was driving home her eyes was runny, sort of hurting like salt in her eye, it was like that all evening she had to put a patch on her eye to help it. That same evening may arm was hurting where she got the vaccine in the right arm, and the lymph node under her arm got inflamed. The next morning on 20Feb2021 when she woke up she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed, but that went away. The armpit swelling has continued since the day of the vaccine. Now this morning in Feb2021 she had a mucus plug and was bleeding she haven&#39;t had her period for 8 years, every two days she had something new. Patient wanted to know what had been woken up in her body. Consumer added that she read on line that patients should wait for 5months before going to their doctor about the swollen lymph nodes because they might send the person for a test, mammogram and it may say they have cancer, in the clinical trials apparently some patients has issues with their lymph nodes and when they did testing it was found they had cancer, but it was not cancer it was the vaccine. Outcome of the event she felt something in her foot (right foot) under the toes like she had sept on something like the lymph node down there was inflamed was recovered/resolved in Feb2021; of the armpit swelling was not recovered/not resolved; while of remain was unknown.  Information on lot/batch has been requested.

A 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 12Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation; cyclobenzaprine, prednisone and hydrocodone; all via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated, &#34;First, I had COVID back in early December and then on 12Mar2021, I got my first vaccine and I have lot of aches and pain and very foggy brain. I was just with the &#39;chiropractor&#39; and he was just with me and I stood up and we were talking and I just got super dizzy and almost passed out, I just don&#39;t know. I missed, I can&#39;t even focus.&#34; When clarified the concern, the patient stated, &#34;When I stood up and I had been standing for a minute or two and it wasn&#39;t that I got up too fast and then I got very dizzy and almost passed out, luckily there was a chair to catch me. So, my concern is, do I get the second vaccine if I already had COVID, should I didn&#39;t had this first vaccine since I already tested positive? When I had COVID, I was very cloudy in the brain. I don&#39;t know if this is a part of side effect, I am trying to find out if I can get the second vaccine.&#34; The patient experienced kidney stone. The lab data is clear, upon checking, the blood and urine samples. CAT scan has been done and the report is clear. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (brand=Pfizer-BioNTech, lot unknown=true, lot unknown reason=unable to locate or read the details) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 26Mar2021 11:45 (62-year-old at vaccination date) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a bruit, ventricularomegaly, gastrointestinal (GI) issues, many female issues (before she got a hysterectomy), cancer activity, hepatitis C (Hep C), COVID-19 since 18Mar2021 (diagnosed as extremely positive, remained sick until 25Mar2021), and allergies to medications, food, or other products included Motion sickness meds. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination was reported as yes but unspecified. About 25 minutes after the vaccine, her throat area under her jaw line started to hurt, her left leg was achy and tingly, and she was started to get a bad headache. She became nauseated and weak. She made it home, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), and got in bed. Saturday her headache was on steroids, she had fever, and just didn&#39;t feel good. Later that day, she was so sick she went to the bathroom and she guessed she passed out. Basically, her husband said he found her on the floor after he heard a thump. He asked me what was his name. He said she responded correctly, but then her eyes rolled back, she became rigid, and he called 911. she knew 2 sets of paramedics arrived w/ambulances. They monitored her vitals and stayed until she was normal. They were willing to take her to the hospital, but offered other options for her husband and she to consider. They suggested she see her Primary care doctor (she did on 29Mar2021). Her doctor believed she should not take the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Adverse event start date was 26Mar2021 at 12:30 pm. AE resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was reported no treatment received for the adverse event. The outcome of event was resolving. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient felt okay right after the injection but about 2 hours later, on 04Jan2021 14:30, she started experiencing a pressure headache, gradually felt very poorly and took a nap for a few hours. Upon waking the patient felt okay but after walking around the house for about 20 minutes, the headache started up again and the same awful feeling of weakness so she laid down and took another 2 hours nap. When the patient woke up the second time she felt as though nothing had happened, was feeling fine. So the patient would say the side effects lasted for about 5 hours. The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Jan2021 17:00.

                                                The following day after patient received 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine, the area around the injection was light red, warm to touch and painful. The area was approximately 2.5 inches around.  On Sunday 1/10 it was bright red, indurated, hot to the touch and much more painful. It was also painful to move his arm.   On 1/13, the injection site was still tender to the touch and his shoulder area was sore with movement. Over the next couple of days his shoulder into his bicep had a dull ache and was very painful to any pushing, pulling or weight bearing. Ibuprofen did help but did not relieve it.   On 1/17 patient went to a local urgent care because at that point it was even difficult to sleep due to pain. They diagnosed him with bursitis of the left shoulder due to SIRVA. He was started on a steroid pack and today, day 2 of steroids it feels slightly less painful.

Chills on Friday morning in the middle of night; woke up and my temp was 101.3 and I was feeling bad all day; had headache and went back to bed. Still have pain in hip/knee and joints and those pains got really bad after the vaccine - increased. Doctor  vist told me to use Ibuprofen to 3 times a day for that pain.  Shortness of breath continues from Covid symptoms and so does the hip/joint pain - it has decreased.

I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

                                                Starting a couple hours after vaccination, I began to feel unwell, overall poorly, nothing specific.  Went to be early at 9:30 and awoke at one a.m.on February 26 with splitting headache.  Could not get back to sleep well and felt terrible all that  day with headache, nausea, and foggy thinking, not funcional after about 2:30 p.m.  Took Ibuprofen at 3 p.m., called doctor and went to ER at Medical Center.  Was seen at ER a few hours later.  Slept some in waiting room. Had sore throat, the worst splitting migraine type headache ever, and was extremely foggy headed, couldn&#39;t process thoughts, eyes had difficulty focusing, nausea.  My temperature was a little high for me, I am normally low and it was 99.  My blood pressure is usually low and it was 105/59, pulse was 82 and respiration was 16 with 96 % Oxygen Saturation. They did tests and had an ophthalmoligist give me an exam also.  They said I could go home with the same meds they were giving me in the hospital since they were working to alleviate my painful headache, 600 mg of ibuprofen, reglan and benadryl.  Before I left they gave me the potassium chloride. I am continuing my medications today, two days after my vaccine.

A 63-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 08:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included facial neuropathy, sleep apnea from 2003, and Guillain-Barre syndrome from 2001. Patient said she had Guillain-Barre syndrome 20 years ago and has residual neuropathy from that. There were no concomitant medications. Patient have not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. Patient called about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shot, as she was supposed to call about possible side effects, to report. She said that she had her first dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021 and hasn&#39;t had her second yet. She said that the first dose was injected in the morning, around 08:30AM. She said that there was a sticker on her vaccine card that says mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech, and (withheld), she didn&#39;t know what that means. She said actually that was abbreviation for (withheld), her vaccine provider. Her side effects included fatigue on an unspecified date in 2021, which she thinks a lot of people do have. She didn&#39;t know if this was available but she was hoping to advice about getting her second shot. She has had a runny nose since day after getting the shot, so since 26Feb2021, it hasn&#39;t stopped. She was not saying this was from the shot, it could be chronic runny nose, but it didn&#39;t stop. She said that the worst thing she was calling about was she has facial neuropathy flare in 2021, described as slight facial neuropathy which felt like it has flared since the shot. She was calling because she was nervous about second shot in 2021, since it flared with the first one a bit. She didn&#39;t want this to get worse, she can live with it currently, but she has heard people have more problems with the second dose and she didn&#39;t want to risk full blown neuropathy. She has done no treatment for the neuropathy, but for the runny nose there were a couple nights she took Benadryl and today she took Claritin, so put that she has taken sporadic over the counter stuff. No further details provided about Claritin or Benadryl. She has been experiencing continuous runny nose, flare of facial neuropathy, and fatigue. She was worried in getting the 2nd dose in 2021 and wanted to have recommendations as her doctor was reluctant in giving an advice whether she may have the 2nd dose or not. The patient reported that facial neuropathy flare as serious medically significant while the other events was non-serious adverse events. Patient was advised by the Pfizer colleague of the overall safety summary that indicated throughout the safety follow-up period to date, Bell&#39;s palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by four participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. Onset of facial paralysis was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of Bell&#39;s palsy were reported in the placebo group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19. The outcome of the events facial neuropathy flare, fatigue, nervous and worried was unknown. The event runny nose was not recovered.

She called on 13Mar2021, her blood pressure was so low-they got 58 for the top number, they were unable to pull up bottom number at that point. patient reported that when the ambulance arrived, they described her face as extremely pale on 13Mar2021; her major complaint was that she was so cold- she has never been that cold in her life. When she got to the ER- they had to use the old blood pressure cuff to get her blood pressure because it wasn&#39;t coming up on the machine- the kind where you pump it up and watch the needle, they said it was 58/38. patient states that they asked her about the rash that was all over her body in 2021; caller reports that she did not have a rash when she called at 4 PM. patient describes the rash as an extremely red sunburn rash- like you got really bad sunburn, most of it was on her torso, she also had it on legs on 13Mar2021. patient mentioned she remembers them taking off sock and her toes were purple on 13Mar2021. She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021. Discharge paper reads as anaphylaxis due to vaccination on 13Mar2021. patient states that she came home from hospital on Monday, 15Mar2021. patient reports she started a diet. 2nd day (12Mar2021)- From the time she got up, she was too cold to do anything; she couldn&#39;t walk and she was feeling like she was getting the flu. Saturday (13Mar2021)- She woke up and had the worst Charlie horse between ankle and calf- took forever to walk Charlie horse off. Really sharp Charlie horse. Even had less energy today. Really nauseated. patient reports that yesterday and today, she is just tired. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her body catching up on sleep or she&#39;s just tired; she will find out today when she goes to doctor. Caller mentions that she is normally more active than she feels right now. patient reports her eyes have been itchy and she has a rash on her eyelids. patient doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the shot; patient mentions that she decided on 01Mar2021 she would start a diet, get healthy, and see a nutritionist. patient reports that initially she didn&#39;t think her symptoms were from the vaccine and thought it was that she wasn&#39;t eating enough food on Friday. She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

                                                Only initial side effect following both injections was moderately sore arm and fatigue.  Following 2nd dose I experienced 1 episode of severe vertigo while just sitting doing nothing. Dizziness cleared completely in about 4 minutes.  Then on March 13th, was at work, sitting at desk and same thing happened again. After the dizziness cleared I got up and went to see a patient. I work in a rehab unit of a hospital.  Got pt approx 50 feet down the hallway when dizziness started coming back. Handed patient over to other staff. I took my blood pressure and checked my blood sugar. Both WNL . Dizziness never got better. Went to ER. They had no clue of cause. All labs were normal. Saw Physical therapist who performed Eply maneuver as well as a ENT. Both got same result. Negative for BPPV.  MD gave me Antivert. Didn&#39;t work.  Are waiting to be seen in May 2021 for NVT test and another with Neurologist. In the meantime the dizziness has remained constant rendering me unable to return to work.

States when she got old things shifted and changed. One ENT said she has neuritis, where something hit her ear nerve in right ear.

No Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). AEs following prior vaccinations: None; reported she hadn&#39;t had any flu vaccines in years because of the ingredients.

On 01APR2021, she could feel rush of pressure to back of head, tunnel vision, cloudy and pressure in her ears and was dizzy. Hx of Hashimoto&#39;s - autoimmune disorder, vestibular issue, concerns with getting the second one (dose). Read about adverse reactions and dizziness was on the list of severe reactions. The instant, within a minute, patient could feel this happening to her, she instantly could feel she becoming dizzy, light headed, out of body experience like floating. (didn&#39;t mention this in report) felt like walking on air. While sitting and chit chatting with other people to distract myself. Patient didn&#39;t have any anxiety. She will admit she was reluctant to get the vaccine because of my health problems.  She was more concerned, she instantly got a headache with the pressure, when she was leaving, she felt her eyes feel weird, almost like an allergy issue, burning, not quite burning either. Kind of like a burning, not quite like a burning, felt like when you walk into the wind that has lots of pollen,  that feeling. She didn&#39;t walk out side, she was inside when this happened, the pressure was already starting, no headache in front of head, it was in back of my skull, at top of her neck and pressure within the ears and ache and pressure on back of her head. Not dizzy, not like when you are in the hospital and they give she something and patient can&#39;t walk, or where you tried to stand and you couldn&#39;t , it was more like light headed, like walking on air like. It lasted all yesterday. As the night progressed by 10PM or 11PM her arm started to really hurt, patient took Tylenol and went to bed, took Xanax as she did and slept, woke up fine. This morning it felt like she wanted to have a headache but haven&#39;t had it since. It&#39;s almost like patient had intracranial pressure, because she had these conditions, so she read a lot. Investigation Assessment was No. States she is calling to report a potentially strange side effect. She states as soon as she got the injection, approximately within one-two minutes, she could feel a rush to the back of her head and the lower part of her head which then made her feel like she had somewhat of her vision clouded, like a tunnel vision. Clarifies her vision was clouded on the sides but she could see forward. Caller states that she was not dizzy like falling over and she does have vestibular migraines and vertigo issues, but she had that feeling of dizziness and when she got up and walked, it felt like she was walking on a cloud. Clarifies she felt a heavy pressure in the back of her head. States as soon as the injection was over, she could feel it. States she is concerned regarding the second dose because of her autoimmune and vestibular conditions. She states is caused immediate pressure in her ears. States that could&#39;ve affected her and put her into a migraine, she doesn&#39;t know. States a friend said jeez you should report that and she read more on the list of side effects and saw something about an allergic reaction and dizziness, and she did have some sort of adverse reaction. States she doesn&#39;t know and it is concerning to her. States she is doing fine today, other than a little headache that comes and comes. States it was bizarre with the  clouded, not cloudy, but tunnel vision. States she does not want to release any medical records; she declines for now to provide. She states CVS administered it, not her doctor. States she is going to discuss it with him. States she doesn&#39;t want to have a worse reaction with the second dose. Caller states a headache is a headache but the pressure she felt within one minute and continuing it concerns her on the second one with the larger dose. States she is also concerned with the second dose if dizziness is a severe allergic reaction, not saying she  fell over and wiped out. Patient wondering if that was an allergic reaction. States as the evening went on and she took Tylenol, it improved. States the dizziness improved as the night went on but had a bizarre feeling when she went to bed. States her arm was sore in the evening and is still sore to the touch. Clarifies that her eyes felt funny. States like walking through a stream of pollen, not that she had itchy eyes, but it felt like she had been effected by something. States it was not like a tired and burning feeling, states she can&#39;t explain it but something felt like had an allergy type situation if she has a problem with seasonal allergies. Treatment included took Tylenol. States when someone has an autoimmune issue they have a lot of issues regarding the stomach and take a lot of vitamins and supplements. Caller states she wants to report she has a lot of food sensitivities and environmental sensitivities because of her Hashimotos. States anything can set off an immune response. States what happens with that is she would get on her face, angioedema near her ears and the gland secretes and the passage way swells up. States she takes Pepcid AC to treat it. States this did not happen with her first vaccine. States she was very hesitant on taking the vaccine because knows she has these issues and she didn&#39;t want to have adverse reactions. States that her reaction to the first vaccine potentially concerns her for the second dose. States going to speak with the medical information department is a good idea. States the location she received her vaccine was very busy. States they did a nice and good job on getting people in. States the girl administering it did good, but she didn&#39;t mention unless you knew you had to wait 15 minutes due to possible adverse reactions, they didn&#39;t really check on people. States she just had to do whatever and she didn&#39;t know whether or not to report it then because she was not in distress. States she thought she just has to get home and drove 30 miles. All events (AEs) did not require a visit to Emergency Room nor Physician Office. The events of Tunnel vision, rush of pressure to back of head and the lower part of head, Headache, dizzy/Dizziness/light headed, cloudy and pressure in her ears/Ear Pressure, was recovered on 01Apr2021, of my arm started to really hurt/Sore Arm; sore to touch was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

Outcome of muscle pain in legs was not recovered, outcome of other events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I couldnt lie on my left arm at all that night.  By 11pm I also experienced headache, sinus drainage, sore throat, body aches, taste and smell were off, upset stomach, queezy stomach but no nausea or vomiting, very weak , dry mouth, fever at 99.2 then 98.6, chills, lots of chills. The covid hotline at my work told me I had a moderate reaction to the vaccine. Treatment was rest and tylenol which didn&#39;t alleviate any symptoms whatsoever. I had all these symptoms til Jan 6th at 4am.   At 4am all the symptoms left and have not returned.

She was given the vaccine in her left arm. The pt did not have any rash or hives noted.  The PA spoke with the pt and 50 mgs Benadryl was given p.o.(@ 1450).  The pt stayed to be observed and after an additional 40 minutes  (@ 1531) she said she was feeling better and was going to her unit to work (eve shift). The pt. spoke to her Nurse Manager upon arrival back to her unit and was sent home instead of working. Her unit was called at 4pm and we were informed that the pt went home, as she was concerned of being too tired to work.

A 64-year-old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EJ1685), via intramuscular on 28Dec2020 07:15 at single dose on deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hepatitis C which cleared in 2016, hysterectomy was done in 2004 or 2005, cyst removed from breast long ago, ongoing arthritis in left knee, urinary tract infection was treated in Nov2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She received the first vaccine on 28Dec2020. She did fine that day. She came home and laid down and rested. Her temperature went up to 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit but was resolved that same day/night. Early in the morning on 29Dec2020, around 3:30 a.m., she woke up and had a racing/pounding feeling in her chest. She took her blood pressure and it was 158/86, heart rate (HR) was 83. She felt really funny. She hadn&#39;t been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, so this was high for her. She took her blood pressure again about an hour later and it was 165/95, HR 73. She took it again about an hour later and her blood pressure read 180/98, HR 77. Her heart rate stayed in the normal range, but the force felt really strong. She did go to the emergency room around 5:00 am on 29Dec2020. She told them what she was experiencing and that she had received the COVID-19 vaccine. About the time she got to the hospital, her blood pressure was starting to come down. An EKG was done and they drew bloodwork. Her potassium came back a little low-they didn&#39;t tell her how low or what her level was. She was given 2 potassium tablets which did help. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the potassium she was given. It was given to her at the hospital. She was also given a sheet to monitor her salt intake, which she already does that. She confirmed she was not admitted into the hospital, she was discharged from the Emergency Room. She felt pretty good. She didn&#39;t go to work that Wednesday, 30Dec2020, but she went to work on Thursday, 31Dec2020. On 01Jan2021, the same thing happened to her again. She had elevated blood pressure, forceful beat. She went back to the ER early in the morning, around 5:00 am, on 01Jan2021. Her pulse stayed within normal range, but she had such a forceful beat. She informed them that she was really uncomfortable in her chest, the force was the most uncomfortable at this point. They wanted to make sure she wasn&#39;t have a stroke or heart attack, so they did their normal procedures to rule this out. They did 2 EKG&#39;s, 2 sets of labs, Chest X-ray, CAT scan and everything came back normal. She had a discussion with the physician that saw her about what she was experiencing and the physician was asking her about having anxiety. Caller explains she has never really had problems with anxiety before, but she can&#39;t say she hasn&#39;t had it. Being around COVID patients and getting the shot, sometimes anxiety can be there. The physician wanted her to try a low dose of Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg. She was to only to take a half dose by mouth, if her top number (systolic blood pressure) was between 140-160. Caller clarifies when she means half of a dose, the dose equals 12.5mg. She was instructed to take this 12.5mg dose until she saw her PCP. So, she did this and called her PCP and wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment to speak with a provider until the following Wednesday, 06Jan2021. She did a tele visit with her provider and let her know what had happened and that the half of the pill will only bring her top number (systolic blood pressure) to 130&#39;s-140&#39;s. Caller states she was used to her top number (systolic) being maybe in the 120&#39;s, low 130&#39;s. Her doctor increased her dose to 25mg. She was prescribed to take 25mg, tablet, by mouth, once a day. She confirmed she still checks her blood pressure before she takes the medicine. Caller verifies she has 2 bottles, one being the 12.5mg dose and the second being the 25mg dose. With the 12.5mg bottle, she sees refills and the date 05Jan2022. Caller clarifies both bottles are dispensed in pharmacy vials with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date. About a month prior to all of this and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, clarified as Nov2020, she was treated for a UTI. During that time, her blood pressure went up a little and kind of bounced around a little bit, but came back down. Then, she got the COVID-19 shot. She initially felt fine but later on by the time she got a chance to do the tele visit with her PCP, she was telling her about her previous UTI, and the provider put her on Cipro because it seemed like her UTI symptoms were coming back. Caller verifies she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration for the Cipro. She already took of all of that. She went to the ER for the third time on 08Jan2021 because she again felt the forceful beat feeling in her chest. She explained she felt really wiped out and worn down and she was tired. An EKG was done and they did labs. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any results with her at this time. She was taken off of work for a couple of weeks. She is currently getting in contact with a Cardiologist to make sure everything is alright. The cardiologist wants her to have a stress test. The caller states so this is where she is now. She is taking blood pressure medicine and getting set up to do a stress test. Sore arm outcome: Caller confirms she recovered from the arm soreness within that same day. Her arm didn&#39;t stay sore long at all. Racing/pounding in chest: This had improved. It&#39;s not like it was. She still has it a little bit of it now, but she is going to see her cardiologist and do a stress test. The blood pressure medicine has helped some. Elevated blood pressure: Today her blood pressure top number got to 161 and she had to take medication but her blood pressure has improved. Outcome of elevated blood pressure, racing/ pounding in chest was resolving; outcome of forceful beat feeling in her chest, UTI, potassium was a little low, felt really wiped out and worn down/tired, anxiety was unknown; outcome of arm a little bit sore, 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit fever was resolved on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

A 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 07Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital, not a Military Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient got the Flu Vaccine last part of Sep2020 or Beginning of Oct2020. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EK57530), via an unspecified route of administration at left Upper arm on 17Dec2020 9:10AM for covid-19 immunization. She only had a sore arm. It started the same day, a couple of hours after getting the vaccine. It went away a day to a day and a half after it started. After that she was fine. She got the second dose on 07Jan2021. After the second dose, immediately, like within five minutes her arm became very sore, this event was assessed as non-serious by HCP. Also, that Thursday (07Jan2021) night after getting the second dose of the Vaccine around 9PM-10PM she started to get chills, myalgia, severe headache, and nausea. She also mentioned she was so sick during the night she was not able to get up and around. She felt like she had a temperature and by the time it was checked her temperature was 101.9. She was febrile all through 08Jan2021. She started to become afebrile 09Jan2021 with improvement and by 10Jan2021 all her symptoms had gone away and completely resolved. Seriousness Criteria: Stated she felt these are serious. She was unable to go to work on Friday. She could not return back to work until Monday. The HCP assessed all events were related to the vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021. She stated, even though she got so sick with getting the vaccine she was just continuously telling her self this is better than having COVID. She stated she even told people even if she knew after getting the shot she would have this reaction she would still take it. She has seen death occur from COVID and does not want that to happen.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, clinical course and known safety profile of the product, the reported events chills, myalgia, severe headache, nausea and fever were likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs.

Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

                                                As the needle was being inserted and while the vaccine was being injected, I immediately felt intense pain like none I&#39;ve had during any prior vaccine administration . The needle was inserted very high on the arm about 1/2 inch below the shoulder.  About 4:00 pm that afternoon, new pain developed in the same shoulder, along with very limited range of motion, gradually worsening during next few hours. By 9:00pm the pain was excruciating, like there were multiple knives in all directions in my shoulder. By then I could not lift or move my arm any amount in any direction without excruciating pain.  I suspected a severe inflammatory response. This pain level continued for the next 2 days.  On the 3rd day the pain was a little less severe and I had slightly more range of motion, but was still unable to lift my arm without pain. On the 4th day (Feb. 18) the pain was a little better but I still had severe sharp pain if I lifted my arm in certain directions. I began to suspect a torn muscle or tendon. Today (March 5, almost 3 weeks after the vaccine), the pain and limited range of motion are the same as Feb. 18.  It is relieved only by complete rest of the arm, and easily aggravated by any basic activity (grocery shopping, dressing, etc.)  I believe my shoulder was injured by improper administration.

I am sure later I had a TIA. Was unable to communicate. I knew what I wanted to say but I could not get the words out. March 1/2021   I went on FLMA. It never dawned on me the vaccine could have affected my already stressed heart. I am still experiencing these symptoms. I just thought of this this week. I still have extreme fatigue, increased palpitations,  and increased SOB. I do not feel able to work right now.

Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (one is patient). A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6204), intramuscular, administered in right arm on 08Mar2021 14:10 (at the age of 64-year-old) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high cholesterol, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, arthritis, stenosis of neck and spine, allergies to dust and cleaners (when she cleans, the bottom of her neck swells up huge); all were ongoing. She has very high cholesterol, she believes it was close to 400 the last time it was checked and that&#39;s why she was given Repatha which brought it way down, but she doesn&#39;t know if she can take the Repatha again. She also has quite a few allergies - allergic to cats, sulfa, grass and Pre-diabetes. She has a fair amount of allergies. Her doctor thinks she has some asthma because she has had a little trouble breathing at different times, but she doesn&#39;t have an inhaler or anything. She mentions asthma and allergies run in her family. The patient also stated that a majority of her life, has had low blood pressure until about 9 years ago when her father passed. States that her blood pressure had been out of control for 6 months and was then put on a low dose of Carvedilol, and eventually evened out. Concomitant medications included ongoing carvedilol taken for blood pressure; ongoing loratadine (CLARITIN) taken for allergies from 1996 (has been taking for 25 years); ongoing lansoprazole taken for acid reflux; ongoing rosuvastatin calcium taken for cholesterol since Sep2020; ongoing calcium; carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure. The patient had a previous reaction to a cholesterol medication evolocumab (REPATHA) from 23Oct2020 to 23Oct2020 - her neck swelled up pretty big and she had hives on her chest, which ended up going away. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if she can take that again or not. The patient also previously took rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) 5-6 months ago and it made her legs ache really bad; esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) and had the problem; lansoprazole (PREVACID) for acid reflux. She took Nexium which was a different product with different ingredients and her blood pressure was still high the whole day. States that her doctor had prescribed another brand, which had the same main ingredient as the Nexium, and told her to double up on it one night, so she did that and about an hour later she just about hit the floor because her blood pressure shot up to about 200 over 100 and something, so she talked to the pharmacist who said that this was not a normal reaction to the ingredients in Nexium, but it happened to her every time she took it. She had been taking Prevacid for a long time but then started to get an allergic reaction. Clarified that feeling like she was having an allergic reaction after taking the Prevacid at night, was something that she has just started noticing within the last month. Wondering if the 2nd dose of the Prevacid is too much. States that she still takes this in the morning but not in the evening. States that she has started taking 15mg at night from an over the counter version of the same medicine (Lansoprazole). She explained that she hasn&#39;t had any vaccines as an adult, she never has had a flu shot. About 5 years ago, she had a bat in the house for 3 days and the bat ended up hitting her in the head and forehead as they were trying to get the bat out of the house, so she ended up getting a rabies vaccine. She was wondering and hoping there were no interactions with that. With the rabies vaccine, she did have a headache. She had to get 4 or 5 shots and she did not feel well most of the time. It took a long time to pass for her to feel normal again. The caller received the first dose of the vaccine last Monday on 08Mar2021, after the shot and while waiting those 30 minutes, she felt a lump in her throat which lasted all day and the next day, but it went away. She confirms by 10Mar2021, she recovered completely. Her arm swelled up and was sore for a day and half on 08Mar2021, but that went away. She isn&#39;t worried about that. She also has a really bad headache and was very dizzy on unspecified dates. She is concerned about the dizziness. She has been driving, but about the second day after getting the vaccine, she was leaning over talking to her mom and she felt like she going to pass out. She didn&#39;t, but she felt like she was. She has been using hot packs. It&#39;s like she has a headache around her temples and the back of her head seems to be hurting. In fact, she put a hot pack there while waiting to speak to this call handler. She doesn&#39;t know if its tension or what. She didn&#39;t have hives or none of that from COVID vaccine which she was excited about, but she is so dizzy she can hardly stand. She can&#39;t get rid of the headache and dizziness. She wants to know whether or not to go ahead with the next vaccination. This is the 5th day of having this dizziness. She was thinking the dizziness was going to last for a couple of days, but its going on 5 days. Even just sitting, She states it&#39;s kind of scaring her. She was thinking it would just go away, but it isn&#39;t. Her heart rate and blood pressure seemed to be very erratic on 12Mar2021. She woke up this morning (12Mar2021) and her blood pressure was very high, but she checked it within a few minutes and was dropping low. Her heart goes fast and then slows down, but she has had problems with this in the past. The dizziness has been bothering her a lot, she has been afraid to drive. The patient had a blood pressure of 150/102 on unspecified date.  On 17Mar2021, She mentioned she will see her HCP at 2:00 PM. She has already filed a report regarding the side effects she had. She filed a report and asked if she should get the second dose shot. However, she was informed if her HCP called, they may be able to provide her with more information. She was informed her HCP could call the medical line. On 26Mar2021, she stated that the first report was filed the first week and that during the second week, more not good things have been happening. She wrote down the report number from the first report but does not have it now. Since the vaccine, she has been having different symptoms; she is not sure if it is related to the vaccine but wanted to report it. She was a little concerned because she has allergies, stating she had just tried an injectable cholesterol drug and she did break out hives and her neck had swelled. States that she has not had any vaccines as an adult, so she was a little bit cautious anyway. She clarified that she did not have hives and did not have any breathing problems when she left. Stated that later that evening and the next day had a really bad headache and bad pressure in the back of her head, which she knew was typical. States that 3 or four times she felt a rush over her body and felt like she was going to pass out. That night and the next day (unspecified date), she was having breathing problems (was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days) and her chest was tight and she was starting to wheeze, and continued for about 3 or 4 days. She kept getting an icky feeling Monday and Friday when she got up and had unwell feeling all over like she was going to pass out on unspecified date in Mar2021. States she had real bad pressure in her head and high blood pressure and felt like her heart was skipping beats on unspecified date. States her blood pressure was around 152/100 on 09Mar2021. One-day blood pressure was real low, 88 over something but that kind of went away. States all that information was already reported. The next week, she thought she was feeling better and that Monday and Tuesday felt back to normal. Stated that on Thursday night (Mar2021), she was just sitting and around 8 o&#39;clock her blood pressure spiked within a few minutes to around 184/105 and she wasn&#39;t doing anything; she couldn&#39;t get it to go down. States that she went to the ER to check everything out last Thursday.  Every night since then, somewhere around 8 o&#39;clock, her blood pressure spikes really high.  Stated she then called her doctor. Stated she was on a really low dose of blood pressure medication, stating that she had occasional problems with her blood pressure in the past but it never went that high. Her blood pressure was usually in the 140&#39;s or 150&#39;s over 90 something. States that now it is much higher and happening every night. Caller stated that Wednesday night (24Mar2021) her blood pressure started to spike every 5 to 6 hours, stating it first started at 830 at night and again at 230 in the morning. She has been feeling unwell since that shot. Her doctor thinks it may be causing inflammation. States that they doubled her medication last night and her blood pressure is still going up and up, but usually goes down after a couple of hours. It is totally uncontrolled and her doctors are trying to figure it out. States that meds have been added, including Xanax and will be going to see a heart doctor. States that this has all been since the vaccine. Caller would like to know if people are reporting these symptoms. States that it is pretty terrible, and that she feels normal and then it rushes over her. States that it is exhausting and that she almost went to the ER last night. States that she does not want to go back if she does not have to. When she filed the first report she did not have issues with blood pressure yet. Again, she had the vaccine on Monday 08Mar2021 and that the next Thursday she felt like her heart rate was really high. During that first week, she felt out of rhythm, like missing beats. Her blood pressure dropped low the first week and that just one time was around 152/100 but it didn&#39;t sustain. It then dropped pretty low one day. The next Thursday, it was uncontrollable. It was around 180 over 104 or 105 and that it kept going up, but then back down to 160/90 something. Took Xanax and went to bed, when she woke up this morning it was low, but went right back up within 5 minutes. In the first couple of days, they increased her blood pressure medicine and it seemed to be bringing her blood pressure down and she was able to go to bed. The caller stated that Monday, it will be three weeks. States that a day and a half after the vaccine, her arm was not hurting but was still puffy, but not bad. States that when she runs her hands over it, it is still sore to the touch and a little swollen but nothing extreme. She was concerned that her blood pressure keeps going up and then down. States that the blood pressure started spiking on the 18Mar2021, in the evening very quickly and was very high. Stated that this was happening every night since then until the 24th, when it started spiking every 5-6 hours; and her blood pressure medicine wasn&#39;t controlling it like it was earlier in the week, even though the dose was doubled. For one day it worked good and brought it down low but then, it wasn&#39;t controlling it anymore. She stated no relevant tests, related to this event but states that in her last 2 labs her cholesterol was high. States that it was over 300 and her bad cholesterol double or more triple. States this has been going on for many years. States that she changed her calcium to calcium with vitamin D and her vitamin has come back up. When she was in the ER they did a Metabolic panel and everything looked okay. The adverse events require and emergency room visit. The patient recovered from the event lump in throat on 10Mar2021; the events arm swelled up and was sore recovered in Mar2021; the events erratic heart rate, chest was tight, was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days, wheezing resolved on unspecified date. The outcome of dizziness, blood pressure seem to be very erratic was not recovered and the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

Patient only called the doctor and would have had to go in today if the fibrillation did not stop. Patient also stated that well, it was not a good thing to fibrillate for that long, with due time it can cause congestive heart failure and stated its dangerous. Patient was resting at the time of report and was relieved she is not fibrillating anymore. Patient reported that her body feels like it was hit with a mac truck on Mar2021. Heart fibrillating for 36 hours makes you really tired.

                                                When I signed up for the vaccine, the website said that i was at high risk for the vaccine and would need to wait 15-30 minutes after the injection.  I checked with doctor re: this warning and she felt the vaccine was still beneficial but to do my research and make a decision. I received the vaccine at the Center.  I sat down as instructed. 5 minutes later, something felt off and I removed my protective visor.  A paramedic came over about a minute later and asked if i was ok.  I said that i didn&#39;t feel well.  He said that he was going to get a chair with wheels for me and at that time i must have passed out.  The next thing that i remember was waking up laying on the floor. My husband said that there were 4 paramedics in attendance.  The primary paramedic was telling me that my BP was 72/60.  An ekg was being run, an iv inserted and run full force.  they checked my blood sugar which was fine. The primary paramedic kept talking to me to check my level of consciousness.   I was there for quite a while. Not sure who the paramedics checked with, but they decided that i needed to go via ambulance to the hospital. The paramedics were very concerned that the ambulance go to the back door to pick me up so others getting the vaccine would not be frightened. I was transported to Medical Center for further evaluation. I was there for a few hours and my labwork was normal. EKG and chest xray were completed as well as cardiac monitoring.  I called doctor&#39;s office the next morning to notify her of the event. It was very scary!!!

Other medications included estrogen, vitamins, glucosamine supplements, and takes a cream for injury: sprained wrist, she doesn&#39;t know the name of it, it is an anti-inflammatory cream, she doesn&#39;t think any of that will do anything. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had the vaccine on 16Jan2021 Saturday and within 15 minutes (also reported as 20 minutes after shot and at 12:00), the patient experienced severe ringing in ears. She had severe ringing in her ears, it was really loud, and was still there. She can&#39;t seem to figure out if it was normal, what&#39;s causing it and could it be from the vaccine. It may have been anxiety because of that, but right after she heard ringing, there was a lump feeling in her throat on same day, like something was in her throat, she thought she had throat swelling, it lasted a couple of days, but she had no shortness of breath or anything. Ringing in ears was a lot worse in the morning, and gets better during the day, maybe because she was around noise, but it comes and goes, there are two separate sounds, one was a high pitched and continuous, the other one was lower pitched, a little fragmented, if she drew a picture, there would be little dust particles in the air, but the other is constant, she tried really hard to ignore, but it was driving her nuts. She is hoping it will go away. The lump feeling in her throat was gone, she was wondering if it was anxiety. It was mentioned, &#34;She gets nervous, gets a lump in her throat a lot&#34;, but this was really severe, but she saw a man being taken away in an ambulance, and that scared her, she was waiting in the waiting area, and saw that, so it scared her. Recovered completely from the lump feeling in her throat. Throat was normal in 2 days but ears ringing still there after 4 days. There was no treatment for the events severe ringing in ears and Lump feeling in throat. The outcome of the events severe ringing in ears was not recovered; event Lump feeling in throat and throat swelling was recovered in 18Jan2021; and unknown outcome for the other event.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

Awoke at 3:40 am and rolled off of arm where injection given and a wave of pain and nausea and malaise overwhelmed me. I passed completely out still lying in bed (so out that I wet myself in bed) and gradually came to, still feeling horrible. Got up, changed clothes, and major chills when I returned to bed. Around 6am I felt nauseous, got up to vomit, but instead passed completely out on the bathroom floor for about 15 minutes.  Remainder of day I felt very stiff, low energy and slightly woozy. By afternoon, energy was returning (I vacuumed the house). Minimal pain in arm this time compared to previous.

                                                Second COVID vaccine on 1/14/21 - The patient is  received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine at Hospital.   Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

There were no concomitant medications. On that day, 19Jan2021, after she received the vaccine she started feeling pain in the injection site, joint pain, muscle pain and fatigue. On 25Jan2021, she was feeling pretty bad, she doesn&#39;t want to eat, her back hurts, she&#39;s irritable and depressed. The patient would like to know if these side effects could be associated with the vaccine in someone who had the virus. She felt awful and she felt like she has gone right back to where she was 8 months ago, 10 months ago and started over with fatigue and everything. It was awful. She thinks she could have had COVID in Mar2020 and the symptoms she was having now, she had then and when she has had basically the whole time and that would just come back worse. There was no treatment received for the events. The outcome for the events was unknown.

                                                About 10 hours after vaccination a headache started. Then my joints started hurting almost like a nerve was firing off but only at the joints, ie knee, shoulder, toes, ankle, fingers, toes, etc. It would happen randomly. Never all joints at once. Very weird. Continued throughout the night making it difficult to sleep. In the morning, at 7 am, got up out of bed. Took 2 Advil. At 10:20 I  still have the joint happening but not as frequent and not as strong. I still have the headache. It hasn&#39;t changed.

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                I had injection site discomfort, about 4-6 hours after vaccination. I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: L9261) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 27Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Sjogren&#39;s syndrome from 2015 (sees her Rheumatologist/ do blood work once a year to make sure her inflammation levels are okay), ongoing rosacea; dry eye syndrome (related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome); spasming, burning and twitching (last 2 medications she was on in November and January she had similar type reactions in her muscles); arthritis flareup from Oct2019 (in her left leg, she saw her neurologist who did tests and they came back normal) and sinus infection in 2020. Ongoing concomitant medication included ciclosporin (RESTASIS) for Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) for blood test: deficient and ascorbic acid, betacarotene, cupric oxide, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION) for dry eye syndrome related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient previously took prednisone from Nov2020 and experienced weirdness in her legs got strong enough to keep her up at night and bad flare up for her leg symptoms; metronidazole for flare up or Rosacea (0.75% as needed, which she has used daily for last few weeks), meloxicam in Nov2020 and pantoprazole in Jan2021 and had bad flare up for her leg symptoms (symptoms subsided as soon as she stopped taking the medication after about 5 days); ibuprofen, acetaminophen and pepcid for her stomach. She had the vaccine, her first dose, on 27Jan2021, about a week ago. The first two days she didn&#39;t notice anything and then she had weird sensations in her legs on 28Jan2021. The second night she had a weird sensation in her legs which was similar to what she had experienced with the two medications she took in November and January. On 30Jan2021 the sensations spread through her body, she describes these sensations as twitching, burning, cramping, and tingling. She clarifies the sensations moved to her arms which did not happen with the other medications that she tried in November and January. Monday night, 01Feb2021, she was up all night and couldn&#39;t sleep and says she called the family doctor yesterday and he called in a prescription for Gabapentin 100 mg. She said she took the medication last night and she did sleep last night, but she was unsure if it was from exhaustion from the last few nights from not sleeping or the medicine, but she did sleep better and her symptoms were a lot less last night. Patient said she wanted to report this and that her concern is with the second dose; will she have a worse reaction, is there anything she can do or take and should she be concerned about it. She said the events gradually increased, they started mildly and then became significant. She felt the sensations a little bit in the day time but they start big time in the night when laying down. These sensations experienced in her legs started the second night, 28Jan2021, and then spread to her arms in the last couple of days which had not happened with her other incidences (with the medications mentioned above back in November and January). Clarified that the sensations spread to her arms on 29Jan2021, but the worst nights were 31Jan2021 and 01Feb2021. She said they were bad nights. She said in regard to her sleeping, starting on 29Jan2021, she was restless, she had trouble getting sleep and trouble getting in a comfortable position. She woke up frequently. Saturday the sleeping was a little worse, but she did sleep. She said on Sunday, 31Jan2021, and Monday, 01Feb2021, she hardly got any sleep. The sensations spread to her arms and it probably started a little on Saturday night, but Sunday and Monday it was very noticeable. She started Gabapentin; it was one a day before bed. The leg symptoms were still there last night. The sensations in her arms were not much at all. She did get up once with the leg cramp and was feeling tightness in her left leg but it never went into a cramp. The cramp was in her right leg, which was unusual because it was usually in her left leg. She stated she was unsure if her symptoms were starting to subside or if the Gabapentin had an immediate effect. The events did not require a visit to physician or ER. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                She did not have any reactions initially, but noticed the morning after the vaccine that her regular cup of coffee did not taste good.  She then had a rash that started on the left side of her neck, went towards the back now.  This started a few days after the vaccine, all on the left side.  She also got a cold sore on her lip which she had all the time as a child, but not as an adult, which has pretty much resolved.  She has been cold, chills and some dizzy spells.  She did get a bump on her head concussion in December.  One day last week she just stayed on the sofa with a blanket due to feeling poorly.  3 days ago on her back by her shoulder blade an area has been really sore.  She did take some Tylenol for the back pain which did not help so she stopped this.   She did not call her doctor.    The rash is still there but not as intense.  It has not itched, but she has felt it.

For the 5 nights I had one night I actually slept well - I took Lunesta. Last night I tried 3mg melatonin- fell asleep but woke up after 2 hrs, read for 3, then &#34;twiliight slept&#34; , maybe actually dosing off a little.  This is very unusual for me. What can I do ? Will my normal routine return?

The patient&#39;s thoughts were getting mixed up, she was not thinking clearly. This was one of first things that happened. The patient stumbled a little bit and the nurses were there around her and said she better sit down now.

The patient started getting dizzy and her thinking was not clear, her tongue swelled, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, she was gasping for air, she needed a moment to regulate her breathing. In regards to swollen lips she added at first she had a tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips, restriction in her throat, then she started slurring her words before the ambulance got there.  On site they responded and watched her because she did not know if the symptoms were going to get worse. The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol. Patient commented, she knew it was not recommended, but some people do it. The patient mentioned started speaking very badly and very fast, she started gulping for air, and was informed the histamines are hitting her.

She had to go hospital twice in last four months. One was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril which is another blood pressure medication.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 23Mar2021 19:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing laryngopharyngeal reflux diagnosed about 5 years ago, ongoing anxiety, usually happens during stressful circumstances; diagnosed about 20 years ago and she had had the sensation of labored breathing, dry mouth, and accelerated heart rate then yes for work like with public speaking; sensitive: Sulfa drugs, aesthetic filler in her face and allergic reaction Hyaluronic acid filler collagen and she doesn&#39;t smoke and drink. Family history included daughter was diagnosed with psychotic episode and diagnosed with mental illness and it was stressful getting that under control and she was sensitive to medication and surgical procedures she doesn&#39;t tolerate narcotics. Concomitant medication included clonazepam (KLONOPIN). She reported that she was prescribed .125 of clonazepam and it was a dissolvable sublingual and she doesn&#39;t use it frequently as she has read about reliance and potentially addictive and she will take a walk or watch a boring video to try to get her mind off it. The patient previously took oxycodone hydrochloride; oxycodone terephthalate; paracetamol (PERCOCET) and she was sensitive to Percocet; and darvocet and experienced sensitive to Darvocet post surgery; and codeine, and vicodin and was sensitive to both drugs, advil and causes her stomach to be upset, shingles vaccine, HPV vaccine, chicken pox vaccine and got 1 pox from that about 15 years ago when it first came out. The only post-surgical medicine pain reliever she can take was Tramadol and more often than not she doesn&#39;t have to do anything beyond Tylenol extra strength. On 24Mar2021, 04:00, the patient experienced extreme chills, and anxiety accompanied with tight, shallow, and labored breathing. She had troubled breathing due to this. She mentioned that she went to the emergency room (ER) that morning. On 27Mar2021, the patient had emphysema and agitation. On 26Mar2021, early in the morning, she had the breathing issue that she mentioned first concurrent with agitation and anxiety like at same time with the extreme chills. The sensation of agitation was all combined together, it like hit out of the blue while she was getting ready to go to sleep. She stated that at 4am it hit her with a sudden bout of extreme chills and at the same time a sense of anxiety, it felt like she hit a wall and couldn&#39;t get a full breath. She stays up late but wasn&#39;t doing anything anxiety provoking, she thought she was reading recipes. She sat to calm herself as she was not sure if it was a reaction or anxiety at the initial reaction fueling it further so she tried to sort of lower everything in her system and was concerned it could accelerate and not subside. At the hospital, they took her in an exam room and did her vitals and she was there about 2-3 hours and it was early in the morning and at that point sometime they took a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood work and at that point prior to that while she was waiting she was feeling a little better, the worst had subsided and she suggested she go and they asked her to stay since she was already checked in and to be seen. The doctor looked at the results and read the film and questioned about emphysema and she felt that was unrealistic reading as she doesn&#39;t smoke, doesn&#39;t drink and it&#39;s not in her genetic make up. The doctor told her lungs were showing a lot of air and she said maybe it was because she was gasping and they told her to take a big gulp of a breath and hold it to get the X-ray. The doctor suggested she see a pulmonologist and she didn&#39;t feel that was warranted. She contacted her general practitioner and they recommended she get the 2nd shot and had her see an allergist who also suggested she get the 2nd shot. The patient stated that she was not really overweight and doesn&#39;t drink and doesn&#39;t smoke and the allergist didn&#39;t mention but she saw in the paperwork that a side effect could be difficulty breathing. She had no swelling, body rash, dizziness or weakness. Since that episode, she periodically throughout the day, and she can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s anxiety or allergies or something but she felt labored breathing and tightness in her chest and can&#39;t get a full intake of breath. She reported that when she sleeps on her back the sensation disappears completely and when she sleeps on her side it reappears a little; 1-2 nights after, it woke her from sleep and she doesn&#39;t think she was dreaming about anxiety. She stated that she has never had anaphylactic if this should escalate what to do and she decided to go to the ER and they had her wait an additional 2 hours for a follow-up reading that was all clear, all fine, except emphysema thing which was again, she was just researching and forgot the medical term, she this it was hype aeration, too much air sucked in. Her general practitioner recommended she see an allergist for a 2nd opinion and was surprised she was up on anything and didn&#39;t mention side effect and the handout said it could be a possible side effect. She has to yawn a lotto get the air in. She does have laryngopharyngeal reflux prior and she clears her throat which is probably annoying and controls that through diet instead of taking Pepcid AC. She has had to clear her throat a lot but never had labored breathing or shortness of breath, that to get a full breath sometimes she has to yawn to get past that tightness of shallow breathing or labored breathing. On certain days she doesn&#39;t feel it and thinks it was done and she will have a spate and it happens and she thought there was something stressing and does a reality check and again it&#39;s that time of year and when she was taking her walk and walked past a certain block she started to wheeze from the pollen on an unspecified date and she called her allergist to see about getting something. She had a mask and that helped a little. Her allergies were not exacerbating on 23Mar2021 or 26Mar2021 but started the last few days and she has a wheezing cough that had an extended sort of wheeze at the end of the cough. Before her cough for LPR it was annoying throat clearing. After the vaccine, she took that walk through that one specific spot on her route she got to coughing and thinking she needs to call and get something prescribed something if anything if she gets the second shot it will address any of the side issues if they were related to allergies so don&#39;t have to contend. It was every night where she sort of feels it and she sleeps through the night so if it was tension related it subsides and can&#39;t distinguish what is emotional and physical but she was sleeping through the night and it was an indication that it was improving. She reported that when she visited her son and after she returned he told her he was unaware he had strep and didn&#39;t know it, he was asymptomatic and she had a sore throat and went to urgent care and had an exam and didn&#39;t have strep and doesn&#39;t know what it was but she was feeling better by the weekend. She was supposed to go back and everything was shutting and she didn&#39;t go. Maybe she was exposed and just had a mild thing while she was there. She was tested for Covid on 26Mar2021 and her result was negative, but they did not do an antibody test. She wanted to know if difficulty breathing was a common reaction with the vaccine, and if the side effects would be lesser after the 2nd dose since she already had a severe reaction after the 1st dose and if she should still receive the 2nd dose of the vaccine. She was concerned the 2nd shot will be more pronounced than the 1st and she doesn&#39;t want to go through that and it be more severe.  She has heard if you had that reaction you may have been exposed to Covid before and she may have been around people with Covid that had positives and she may have antibodies from an asymptomatic experience and it may do more harm than good and she should do the 2nd shot. She mentioned this to her allergist and was told if she has a similar symptoms to call and get a bronchodilator.

No history of all previous immunization with bnt162b2 considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included breast cancer from 9 years before 19Jan2021 (2012) and she has been Anastrozole since, she was only supposed to take Anastrozole for 5 years and when she was one month away from being done with it she had a Seizure and she was found to have a Tumor in her brain, she had had Srs surgery on her brain on 13Apr2016, she was prescribed Levetiracetam, a seizure medication, for two years and had not had any problem since.

Sleeplessness was worse each night, with inablilty to sleep even with 50 mg of Benadryl and Valium.  Did sleep about  two hours a night with those meds but continued to be wide awake all day also.  My body felt like it hadn&#39;t slept but was unable to do so.  These symptoms left me suddenly with a severe chill and the brain fog litarally lifted and was gone.  The next week following developed mild red itchy skin that comes and goes on hands and torso and that symptom persists.  I am now able to sleep.

                                                Cough; Chills; he came home and said he felt like crap, really bad, she said she did too; they are both so fatigued, so tired/exhausted; sore throat; major headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via a Pfizer Sponsored Program. This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 66-year-old female patient (wife) received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 13:00 at single dose on the left upper arm for COVID-19 immunization, reported as &#34;doesn&#39;t want to get the COVID&#34;. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The reporter said that she and her husband got first dose of COVID vaccine last week (27Jan2021) and they both got sick, had a major headache in Jan2021, cough and chills both on 27Jan2021, and also she wanted to know if she and her husband can take the second dose, scheduled on 17Feb2021. Patient stated that major headache went in on a &#34;Wednesday&#34;. Her husband and her did, and went through vaccination portal, to get an appointment, appointments were very trying, as they were to do all healthcare providers first, which is understandable, and then the vaccine. They were trying to make it available for teachers, as they are going back to school, in school learning in March, so all teachers were the next step and then also anyone over 65 was able to go on the portal with the state to get an appointment to go and get a vaccination. She and husband  have a daughter who was a teacher, and she said to go on the portal to get the shot, and they said they didn&#39;t have access to it, so she went on the site, and they got it in on 27Jan2021. The headache occurred after the 27Jan2021. Patient stated that as soon as they got home, her husband works full time, she lost her job in October, and she was home and he said &#34;how are you feeling&#34;, he went back to work, patient came home and said she felt alright except for her arm then she got a really bad headache. The husband came home and said he felt like crap, really bad, patient said she did too, she was the type of person she never ever gets sick and if he was sick she does not say she was sick. Patient had such a bad headache, she thought her brain was ready to jump out of her head. Headache subsided after two days. She has recovered completely from the headache. Cough started almost immediately (27Jan2021), but patient did not cough today, but did last night, it was usually a deep cough. Today she has not coughed at all. Chills started probably that evening (27Jan2021), when she came home, the shot was around 1PM and chills started in the evening, and went away probably, they had gone back and forth for around two days  but they were gone, she has recovered completely. Patient wished to add that they were both so fatigued, so tired, almost like, both she and her husband were very active, when they were down for the count, really exhausted, after this whole vaccination experience, both of them have been exhausted, to the point of going to bed at 8, and they were not 8:00 going to bed people. she doesn&#39;t want to be a pain, as she knows people have legit concerns, Patient doesn&#39;t want to waste time, her main concern is the second vaccination, if she does not have to, or is suggested to not take it, or her husband, she doesn&#39;t want the second vaccination to cause more severe side effects. The patient further reported, that they both experienced major side effects: chills, headaches, sore throat, major cough, fatigue that was &#34;just unbelievable, both of us are exhausted.&#34; Her second dose is scheduled on 17Feb2021 and his husband is scheduled on 20Feb2021. Patient was asking &#34;if this was after the first dose, what&#39;s going to happen after the second dose?&#34;. Outcome of the events headache and chills was recovered in 2021 for cough was recovered on 02Feb2021 while for other events was unknown.

                                                After getting the  second Pfizer vaccine, I experienced shortness of breath. Riding my bike the shortness of breath was noticeable as I had to walk up hills I normally ride up and I was winded.  I went for a complete nuclear stress test with a known cardiologist and got a completely normal heart reading.  My heart is healthy, but I am experiencing shortness of breath all the time, more so when I exercise. My cardiologist said that even though there is only anecdotal evidence, other people have complained about symptoms lasting after the second shot and he recommended that I see how I feel in a month from now, although as an active person, I feel anxious about my symptoms.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration, on 26Feb2021 (received at the age of 66-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cold sores, 2 knee surgeries, and ADD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) from an unspecified date and ongoing (diagnosed at 30-years-old). Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) and other regular medication. The patient received first dose of Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and developed numbness of the right side of her face from her jaw to her ear and up to her right eye on 26Feb2021.  It felt like she had received a lidocaine injection.  Her doctor said this can happen with RNA vaccines, affect the 7th cranial nerve and develop Bell&#39;s Palsy.  She was prescribed Valacyclovir 1mg and has taken it for 3 days.  She wants to know what the other Bell&#39;s Palsy cases were like. She wants to know what their treatments were. Her doctor said it was okay to receive her second dose at 8am on 20Mar2021 but she wants to do her due diligence and see if there is a case report or study on these patients that developed this side effect. The patient further explained that she had her first dose on 26Feb2021 and was she was there for the 15 minutes for observation. On her way home, the right side of her mouth and the right side of her nostril were numb like Novocaine that you get at the dentist. She said that the numbness traveled up the right side of her jaw to her ear and then over to her right eye. When she got home, she told her daughter and she said that she thought it was because she volunteered all day and was worn out and anxious (26Feb2021). She said that she slammed water and ate crackers and after about a 1.5 hours she started to feel better. She said that she then she called her physician and the doctor told her that it was flaring the nerve root like bells palsy and that it is a RNA Virus. She said that she was placed on some medication for it, but was wondering if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. She said that the doctor asked her if she had previously had cold sores and she said yes. The caller said that her doctor said that it is exactly what that is. The patient stated that she was also short of breath on an unspecified date, but thought it was from fear and anxiousness. She does not know if it was from fear and anxiety or from the vaccine. She said that the doctor told her to take the medication 3 days before and 3 days after her second dose. She clarified that the doctor put her on Valacyclovir HCl 1Gm tablets 1 a day. She said that she broke out with fever blisters on 02Mar2021. She really did not think anything of it until speaking with friends in the medical field and they told her to follow up with this. She added that the fever blisters are healing and only a tiny bit left. It is at the scab and end of healing. Outcome of numbness of the right side of her face from her jaw to her ear and up to her right eye was recovered on 26Feb2021. Outcome of fever blisters was recovering. Outcome of other events was unknown.

The patient previously received the second dose of VARICELLA ZOSTER VACCINE RGE (CHO) (SHINGRIX) for shingles and felt like we were getting the flu and the next morning was fine.

She showed a nurse practitioner her hand and nurse practitioner said patient needs to report that. Patient states it swells right under her finger, swelling under her middle and ring finger. The joint went stiff and the pain. She can&#39;t bend her fingers, it is mostly her ring finger. She couldn&#39;t straighten it out or bend it all the way down, it was like it was locked. Following her second vaccine dose she has had pain in the center of the palms of her hands and bottom of her feet. The pain is inconsistent as it comes and goes. The feet pain come and go not bad like the hands. The middle of the palm pain comes and goes and the joint on 1 finger never did get better, it is worse at night and a teeny bit better in the morning. She felt pain in 1 of her feet for a moment yesterday and not continuous like her hand. The left hand is not swelling, the center of her palm has a weird feeling, states she has never had shingles before but imagines that is what the palm of her hand would feel like, it is an achy pain. States she kept telling her husband she has pain in the center of her hands and on the bottoms of her feet and feels like she is about to have a break out and didn&#39;t. Patient states it has been a month since she had the 2nd vaccine. States the symptoms all started within 24 hours of the 2nd vaccine. On 07Apr2021, nurse practitioner put a lubricant injection (name unknown) into her hand where the swelling was. Patient was told it was a lubricant that might help, and it has helped some. It is moving a little better today after the injection but she still has pain. Adverse events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event &#34;swells right under her finger&#34; and included lubricant injection. The outcome of swells right under her finger, joint stiffness, and joint lock was recovering; other events were not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 17Mar2021 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 66 years old) (Lot Number: EN6205, unknown expiration) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing anxiety (40 years or more), ongoing depression (46 years ago, at the age of 20), ongoing acid reflux (maybe 25 years), ongoing GERD (maybe 25 years), ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus (for 12 years), mild to moderate COPD since 2011, gastric bypass (a year and a half ago), and lost 120 pounds. Concomitant medications included bupropion for anxiety depression and omeprazole for acid reflux, both ongoing.  The patient previously received flu and tetanus on unspecified dates for immunization and both experienced hard red welt on arm (welt was hard and lasted for 5-7 days). The patient reported no side effects for 12 hours, but a little soreness at injection site on 17Mar2021 at 20:00 (8:00 PM). Her arm wasn&#39;t heavy, but she had an awareness of the soreness.  She has had life-long anxiety and depression. Several weeks ago (on 26Mar2021), her anxiety reared up, and it could have been due to a family situation. On the 9th day after the first shot, she was having a therapy appointment on the phone and talking about her anxiety, and she got a stiff neck, like an iron claw (26Mar2021 at 10:00 am). It lasted for a couple of 5 minutes and she laid down on the couch then on the floor.  Her therapist said to call 911. Emergency medical technicians came to her house and they said all of her numbers looked good.  She went to the hospital, and was in the emergency room for several hours, but she only remembers one hour of it.  She also had diarrhea and nausea on 26Mar2021 at 11:30, and it felt like Dumping Syndrome, that one can have from a gastric bypass. She was only aware for one hour at that point and blacked out (on 26Mar2021). With regards to nausea, she mostly saw bile in the bag, all she had that day was a protein drink. She was back home and the next day, she did not remember how she got home. She hasn&#39;t had blackouts anymore but feels it may be from heightened anxiety.  On 27Mar2021 at 09:00, she had no appetite, lost 6 pounds in a week, and was tired. She had headache lasted for days and days on 29Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. She is slowly improving but she still doesn&#39;t sleep through the night on 29Mar2021 at 16:00. It was like a feeling like she was resetting her surgery, like she didn&#39;t care about eating.  The also experienced back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica on 31Mar2021 at 16:00 and was constipated. She is using a stool softener and is back in her routine. She called her primary doctor and could not tell her what happened, and she went in a loop trying to get information and authorizations for her to make a determination of what had happened.  Her doctor felt like she should have an MRI. Her heart and all of her numbers looked good, as the emergency medical technicians said. Her primary doctor recommended her to get the second shot.  She had cancelled the second shot for this week, and she has rescheduled it for another date.  She was afraid that she will black out again, after the next vaccine, and is not sure if that is how her anxiety manifested. The main reasons she is calling is that she had no concerns of side effects prior to the vaccine, and a couple of her neighbors said they had read about side effects of the vaccine, but she was not worried.  When the patient started to read about side effects of the vaccine, she understood that on the 10th day, the vaccine starts to be in a person&#39;s system and that maybe is why she didn&#39;t have initial side effects, but then she had side effects several days later because the vaccine was in her body.  By day 10, the vaccine is in effect in the body and she is nervous. Her second vaccine is scheduled on 26Apr2021. The patient would like to know if there is any information on people that have had a gastric bypass. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The events resulted in emergency room visit (except nervous). The patient recovered from soreness at injection site on 18Mar2021; recovered from diarrhea, nausea,  felt like Dumping Syndrome on 26Mar2021; recovered from stiff neck on 26Mar2021 at 10:05am; recovered from constipation on 02Apr2021; and recovered from no appetite and lost 6 pounds on unspecified dates. The patient also recovered from headache with sequelae on unspecified date; and recovered from blacked out on 27Mar2021 with sequelae. The patient had not yet recovered from anxiety reared up; tired; doesn&#39;t sleep through the night; back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Vertigo started after lying down the same night of getting the vaccine.  Vertigo continued every night and was accompanied by nystamus upon waking each morning.  Symptoms continued for the first several hours after awakening then would gradually get better and was much lighter during the day.  Would return every night and next morning and this continued for the next 7 days.   My head felt like it was in a fog and it seemed harder to think.  It was also very sinus like.  No nasal congestion, no post nasal drip, no cough, but my head felt thick and full.  I had headaches which I never get.  I took my blood pressure to be sure and it was normal.  I took Claritin (without the D), Flonase alone and then also Dymista, did the Neti pot, and took Ibuprofen.  Headache got better but still had the head fog.  Today is post vaccine day 8 and I finally woke up this morning feeling better.  Hope it lasts but I answered &#34;Unknown&#34; to Item 20 below because it&#39;s too soon to tell.

                                                Immediately after medicine went in my arm I felt a warm flush from my neck all the way to my toes (the same as when I have had radioactive dye),    during my 15 minutes of observation my hands and feet were cold and sweaty and I felt a little shaky.  I waited 20 minutes and went to the restroom and had diarrhea (very rare for me).  I went to my car and looked in the mirror and my face was bright red and  the whites of my eyes were red and my eyes were glassy.  I went back in to the observation area and was given oral Benadryl. and monitored for 45 minutes.  Right after I took the Benadryl my throat felt itchy (not sore - itchy).  My blood pressure was 157/62 when I first sat down but came down to 130/ 60 by the time I was sent home.  My bp is normally about 106/60.   I was really tired at home for the rest of the day so went to be early.  The next day I felt fine and my arm was only slightly sore.  The doctor at the immunization clinic told me not to get the 2nd shot.  I called my GP,  and he too told me not to get the 2nd COVID shot and wait until more information has come out about adverse reactions to the vaccine.  I did not have any difficulty breathing.  I don &#39;t know if the redness on my face went down my neck to my chest.  I didn&#39;t look.  I did not have a fever.

A 67-year-old female patient received her first dose bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9262; expiration date: unknown) at vaccination age of 67-year-old via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 09:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure (blood pressure abnormal), cholesterol (blood cholesterol) and several bypass surgeries. She mentioned that she was pretty healthy for her age. Family history included father died of heart disease and her sister has heart disease. Concomitant medication included unspecified blood pressure and cholesterol medication. The patient has no previous vaccination within 4 weeks and did have other vaccines given on the same day. The patient reported that she did not feel bad on the first day, but she started getting a cough on Saturday night (30Jan2021) and on Sunday (31Jan2021), she started getting a really bad headache with aches all over. This morning (02Feb2021), she is running a low-grade fever (99.4F). She added that now she was sick, she has a low-grade fever, chills, is hurting all over, all the things on the list. She inquired if these are common side effects of the vaccine and was asking if she should get tested to see if she&#39;s diagnosed with COVID-19. She inquired will her getting the shot effect the results of the COVID test, would she test positive for COVID now that she&#39;s had the shot. It is confirmed she has not tested positive for COVID. She did have 2 tests previously in Dec2020 before and after traveling. She further explained that she didn&#39;t feel bad until Saturday night and that is when she started with nagging cough. The aching all over started on Sunday (31Jan2021), feeling like she had been run over by a truck. She hadn&#39;t had a fever until this morning (02Feb2021), she woke up with a low-grade temperature of 99.4. She has been taking acetaminophen (TYLENOL) that helps. The call also notes later in the call that her head has been hurting really bad and this started yesterday (01Feb2021 [also reported as 31Jan2021]). It is remarked that she will probably be tested if the vaccine doesn&#39;t affect the results. The adverse events did not require emergency room or physician office. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

I say I was fine until 3-4 hours later, I had extreme headaches. At 430pm, I still had the headaches and I took Tylenol 500mg. At night my headache got worse and it felt like I had the flu. I then went to bed and when I woke up my left arm felt intense like hornets and it was swollen. I then took another Tylenol and Ibuprofen 600mg. At 4am, I felt awful and horrible. I had joint pain with aches, felt nauseated. I called my PCP and he told me to take Prednisone 10mg. My fever was 101.4F. By the night my fever was gradually coming down and it was 102F. By the next day I felt much better.  I also had Covid-19 on March 2020 and also got tested for antibody test in July 2020.  I spoke with my PCP and he is recommending I do not take the 2nd dose injection.

The biggest problem was that my eyes became strangely affected, like there were shutters being opened and closed in rhythmic waves inside my eyes. They were also very photosensitive and blurry. My whole head felt wrong. drove me home, (I could not have driven).  This lasted several hours. I had chills and stayed laying down with my eyes closed. By the end of the day I felt mostly recovered.  This series of events recurred 6 days later,  on Jan. 20th. This time it also lasted most of the day, but I continued feeling moderately unwell the next day, and today it continues. I feel weak and unsteady. My eyes are better but  not entirely. They ache and feel insecure. I am not currently feeling up to any activities besides resting.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 11Jan2021 5:15 PM at a single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing shellfish allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing iodine allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing Mitral valve prolapse (for 20 years), blood pressure high, and cholesterol. The patient had mitral valve prolapse for about 20 years now. They are just watching it now. She just saw the cardiologist, and had an echo done. If the symptoms worsen, they will proceed. Concomitant medications included diltiazem for blood pressure high and atorvastatin for cholesterol, both from an unspecified date and ongoing; she has been on these medications for 30 years now. On 11Jan2021, the patient experienced facial tingling, immediate pain in arm from injection, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all, left eye twitching, chills, nausea, no appetite, whole body ache, tired, whole body trembled, nervous. On 12Jan2021, the patient experienced back pain. The patient explained that on 11Jan2021, evening at 5:15pm, she received her first COVID 19 vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine was being given out at that time. She has shellfish and iodine allergies. So, they made her sit and wait 30 minutes after being injected. One of her daughters took her. On the drive home, a few minutes after leaving she developed facial tingling. At first, she thought nothing of it. She did have immediate pain in her arm from the injection. By the time she got home, she couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all. It was that painful. The next morning, she couldn&#39;t lift arm, and if she tried, she would be in pain. Also, her left eye started twitching right away also. That night she really noticed it. It was not a constant twitching. She thought at first it was because she was tired or from the pain in her body. But then she noticed the next day it was still doing that. It was still twitching. It is not constant, but it was here and there. She still had it on 13Jan2021, but so far nothing at the day of report (14Jan2021). She also had chills. She had on double clothes, and coverings on her feet and hands. The chills wouldn&#39;t go away. Her whole body trembled. On 13Jan2021, Wednesday morning, they went away. She experienced nausea and no appetite. Her whole body ached. It was so brutal. The problem was with her left eye. It didn&#39;t twitch constantly, but it got her nervous. She is pretty sure she is going to refuse the second dose. She has heard that the 2nd part is when most people have the worst side effects. So, she is not comfortable getting it. She also got back pain. It wasn&#39;t severe, but it was there. She is against getting the second shot. She stated that she is a medical assistant at a pediatric office. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got it (vaccine) because of her age. She was advised to get it as she was around patients. Work gave them the option. The inability to move her arm ended in the middle of night at 4 am 14Jan 2021. She noticed she could move her arm. Her second dose is scheduled for 01Feb2021 at 8:45 am. She does work in a pediatric office. If the second part of side effects are worse, then she doesn&#39;t want to take the chance. The eye has her concerned. Outcome of the events were as follows: facial tingling recovered on 11Jan2021, immediate pain in arm from injection recovered on 13Jan2021, chills recovered on 13Jan2021, nausea recovered on 13Jan2021, no appetite recovered on 13Jan2021, whole body ache recovered on 13Jan2021, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all recovered on 14Jan2021, back pain was recovering, while outcome for events left eye twitching, tired, whole body trembled, and nervous, was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

After 3-4 days, my hairline started receding slightly on the sides of my scalp in the front.  This continued each day and I had to increase my blood pressure medicine and double the dose because it was getting so high.  I was anxious and upset and am afraid to take the second dose because I feel that I will get a worse reaction, and am frightened.

This 68-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unknown route, on 14Jan2021 (at 08:30) at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included orthostatic intolerance, myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Relevant concomitant medications included hydrocortisone (CORTEF), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), fludrocortisone acetate (FLUDROCORTISON) and pyridostigmine.

Her eyed began swimming with a sensation of shutters being opened and closed in front of her. She could not see very well, eyes were very photosensitive. Layed down and slept, rested in a dark room most of the day. She had also chills and headache. But nightfall she felt mostly recovered, although not very energetic. About one week later, on 20Jan2021, it all happened again, all at once. She also rested for the day and slowly recovered. But this time it hasn&#39;t all gone away. She is still weak, fuzzy, unsteady, fatigued, she had headache, and &#39;my eyes are not right&#39; (as reported). Pre-vaccination and post-vaccination COVID tests were not performed. No treatments were given for the events. The outcome of the events &#39;unsteady&#39;, &#39;weak/not very energic/fatigued&#39;, &#39;Lightheaded/Dizzy&#39;, and &#39;chest tight&#39; was not recovered while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                Beginning about 12 hours after injection, for apporximately 36 hours after injection, I had a fever (high of 101), chills, pounding headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrea. I felt incredibly tired and slept, restlessly, on and off for 24 hours. I was unable to even drink anything for about the first 15 hours. Finally I was able to eat two crackers and tea and take tylenol which took the edge off the headache. All of these sympoms persisted for 36 hours.  It was miserable and I honestly have never felt so sick. That is coming from someone who has been through labor, childbirth, c- sections, and several major surgeries. I don&#39;t think I could do another vaccine without being supervised in a health care facility to help manage the side effects for the first few days. Also, I had a mild case of Covid beginning November 9, 2020 that lasted about 2 weeks.  I was only exposed to one person who had covid that I am aware of. When I was with that person for about 15 minutes, we were masked and 6 feet apart. I do not go anywhere but work and am always masked,  as is everone else I work with and we are always at least 6 feet apart.

                                                lower back pain; nerve pain; excruciating pain/getting pain; muscle pain; couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain; Her husband had to pull her out of the bed because she felt she had no muscle activity; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot #: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 17Jan2021 at 15:00 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign spinal cord tumor from 1987 and unspecified if ongoing (a lot of bone had to get cut), lot of scar tissue (wonders if it is a weak spot) from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing, thyroid removed in 2015, neurosurgery (to remove the benign spinal cord tumor) on an unspecified date, thyroid on an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing and cholesterol from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing levothyroxine (strength: 125 ug) taken for an unspecified indication at 125 ug, 1x/day, ongoing pravastatin (strength: 40mg) taken for cholesterol from an unspecified date at 40mg, 1x/day and ongoing multivitamin. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient experienced lower back pain, nerve pain, excruciating pain/getting pain, muscle pain, couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and her husband had to pull her out of the bed because she felt she had no muscle activity, all on 17Jan2021. The patient called and stated &#34;she had a very extreme reaction from the first dose of the vaccine, which she had last Sunday the 17th. It began with lower back pain, which did not alarm her too much but then it went in to nerve pain. By the end of the evening, by about midnight, she was in what she considered to be excruciating pain. She changed positions and it was hitting the nerve and she was getting pain and having muscle pain. She was up all night because she could not sleep with the pain. Monday and Tuesday were very excruciating, and she took Tramadol Monday after consulting with her doctor. She did not get any relief until Wednesday, 3 days after the shot. Even today she had some lower back pain, but it is way better than it was. It was improving from Wednesday to today but Sunday to Wednesday was excruciating since it was giving her nerve pain. Her husband had to pull her out of the bed because she felt she had no muscle activity. In 1987 she had a spinal cord tumor and a lot of bone had to get cut and she stated she was sure she had a lot of scar tissue and wondered if it was a weak spot. She stated this could be an isolated incident, but she really thought she had another tumor at first until it started dissipating on its own. She stated she did not know anyone who has had this reaction and asked if it was safe/advisable to get the second shot? She stated she was afraid of the permanent nerve damage but as long as it cannot do anything permanent, she wanted to get it. Was this a reported symptom? Has anyone ever gotten paralyzed? After verbal response she stated she will talk with her doctor and maybe see a neurologist.&#34; Upon follow-up the patient called and stated &#34;I had two questions actually. I received the Pfizer Vaccine yesterday and last night I started with the excruciating back pain, my lower back. I do not know if it was coincidence or not because I have back trouble before. I did not do anything to throw my back out. However, I was told it would be okay to take Extra Strength Tylenol. I took 4 Tylenol within like 3 hours period because it was not working. I took another two this morning. Tylenol was not doing anything at all for the pain relief. My question was, I have a prescription of Tramadol which I took for pain for different reason, but I have it. First of all, I hope by taking the Tylenol yesterday that it did not interfere with the efficiency of the vaccine. My other question is can I take the Tramadol now? Since the vaccine was 24 hours ago would it interfere with efficiency?&#34; Upon follow-up the patient called to report that &#34;she went to her chiropractor late Wednesday afternoon, and he did some stretching, but her spine was not out of alignment, so he felt her pain was due to the vaccine. Stated that it was not until her back started getting better on Wednesday without treatment that she first started to attribute it to the vaccine, because her back just did not get better on its own. Stated that the first day she did not take anything for the pain because she was worried that it might interact with the vaccine or its effectiveness, but the next day she began taking Tramadol pain meds that she already had in the house for her knee. Stated that the pain in her back was so bad, that even a strong medication like the Tramadol did not take away the pain. It did not help all that much, she had to take a 2nd 50mg tablet 3 hours later. Should she get the second dose of the vaccine? Could it possibly do more nerve damage; could she be jeopardizing her nervous system? Have there been any other reports about this? Stated that other people had minor things like, one person reported being tired for a couple days, and another person reported body aches like with the flu, but after 3 days they both were fine. Her husband was 74 and had the vaccine and he had no side effects.&#34; The events prompted a visit to her physician. The patient stated that &#34;this was the first day since Sunday that she was feeling almost 100%. She had the pain from Sunday evening all the way until noon on Wednesday; at that point it improved about 50% and she had some mobility.&#34; The outcomes of the events lower back pain, nerve pain, excruciating pain/getting pain, muscle pain, couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and her husband had to pull her out of the bed because she felt she had no muscle activity were all recovering/resolving.

By the next morning no more chills and temp 97.6.  I do have a lingering headache on both sides of my head which meanders down my neck. The site of the injection is still sore and seems to have moved 3 inches down my arm. And there is also a lingering phlegm problem building up at the back of my throat.

                                                First shot only chills and mild muscle aches gone by the next morning.  Second shot aftereffects were very different. Received the shot around noon on Tuesday , February 23, 2021. Later in the afternoon experienced muscle aches and chills. My head felt kind of weird. Hard to describe except I once had a morphine shot that made me feel close. I spent the next ~60 hours in bed. Fever, severe joint and muscle pain, migraine like headache, and brain fog is about all I remember. It could have been 2 hours or 60  hours, I don&#39;t remember. On Wednesday and Thursday my sedentary heart rate was 101 and 95 according to my Apple watch up from 77 on Tuesday. Couldn?t eat. Food tasted and smelled differently but not in a good way. Woke up this morning,Friday, with a mild headache and very fatigued but mostly back to normal.

Treated in an ambulance at vaccine site with IV Benadryl, had some skin tingling, also given IV solumedrol and observed for almost 2 hours with no other symptoms. I was also hypertensive, probably due to anxiety.

                                                Intense pain in lower back and right hip and pain down my legs (all weak and vulnerable areas where I have issues now and then). It is bothersome to the point that I cannot find a comfortable position to relieve the pain.  It feels like my lower body is being seized up, so to speak.  The only way I can sleep is to take 2 Aleeve PM tablets. I take regular Aleeve throughout the day to take the edge off the pain.   The reason I suspect it is a side effect is that a year ago I took the new Shingles 2-dose vaccination.  I had this same reaction after taking the first dose - and it occurred about 2 weeks after that shot.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular injection on 20Jan2021 (at the age of 68-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing breast cancer stage IV, patient was in treatment for breast cancer stage IV, she had cancer 13 years prior the report in 2008, and then was found again and diagnosed 3 years prior the report, in Jun2018; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a long time, a lot of her adult life. The patient was on oxygen; she had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer; patient tested positive for COVID in 2020 (Feb2020 or Mar2020, as reported). She and her roommate tested positive and had a cough. They had no fever or other symptoms. Both in the nursing home got over the cough and 21 days later tested negative. Patient tested negative for COVID ever since. The nursing home tested the residents and staff every week. They had tested the patient so much to the point her nose was bloody which the reporter got upset about; hallucinations and paranoid thoughts. Concomitant medications included ongoing perphenazine (TRILAFON) taken for hallucinations and paranoid thoughts; treatment for breast cancer stage IV and oxygen. The patient lived in nursing facility and had received both Pfizer vaccine doses. The patient received the first vaccine for COVID-19 immunisation in Dec2020. She was fine. She got the second one on 20Jan2021. Since patient received the 2nd vaccine dose, in Jan2021, she was having confusion and dementia, which was not an issue before the vaccine doses. The patient was having trouble putting words together. Patient initially had vomiting, nausea and brain fog where she could not concentrate on her TV, in Jan2021. She was hospitalized from 17Feb2021 to 20Feb2021 to have all kinds of tests run and see if her cancer had spread to her brain. Patient had 3 years with stage 4 breast cancer and had fought so hard and was aware of her confusion and it was very upsetting to her. She had days of vomiting and nausea. She complained of brain fog and could not focus on the tv or her programs. Within days, she went into this kind of like dementia-like state where she talked incessantly and could not get a thought completed. Patient would go from one thought to the next. It was very bizarre. She had never had this kind of issues. This went on for so long, they finally put her in the hospital. Patient had stage 4 breast cancer, and the doctors thought maybe her cancer had gone to her brain. The doctor did not think it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was checked for a urinary tract infection (UTI), for brain cancer, for a stoke, for everything. She saw so many doctors. She still had not come out of this a month later. She was currently on psych meds because she had mood swings, since Jan2021. It had been one thing after another. The patient could not tell the time. On some level, patient knew something was wrong. She was in a very confused state. She did not know how to tell anyone what she wanted to tell. It was very distressing to say the least. She had made a little bit of progress. She could tell time with some struggling but she got upset and cried. Patient could only tell that the time was 3, but not 3:15. But, then she cried and got upset. She had been able to tell time a couple of times, but if you asked her what day was it, she had no clue. She had no clue what day it was and would ask &#34;what day is it?&#34; Her moods all over the place. The patient was still very confused. The reporter explained the patient could be 5&#39;3&#39;&#39;, she was unsure. The reporter really did not know the patient weight, she was guessing around 270lbs. She had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer, and reporter had not seen her since COVID started. Patient told that her weight was up around 300lbs. The reporter declined to include a healthcare professional for the report, stating she had not spoken to her sister&#39;s primary care doctor. She was waiting for her to call back. The patient was sent to the ER and admitted into the hospital on 17Feb2021. She came back from the hospital on 20Feb2021 at 6:30pm. She had a CAT scan, MRI, bloodwork done, in Feb2021. She saw a psychiatrist, neurologist, her oncologist. There was so many doctors seeing her and talking to the reporter. The last doctor the patient saw in the hospital said that she thought the patient was dehydrated from her vomiting episodes, but did not know for sure. In Feb2021, the nursing home did blood tests and a urinalysis to see if she had a UTI. The blood work would have shown if patient was dehydrated and she was not. The head nurse thought it was the vaccine, but she was not sure. Everybody was not sure. No one could tell her anything concrete about patient. She was not normally like this. Patient had recovered completely from the nausea and vomiting. They tried for a while to give her an anti-nausea medicine, but she could not keep anything down. It was given to her orally, she did not know why an injection was not given. This lasted for a few days, clarified as maybe 3 days. The reporter had no name, NDC, lot number or expiry date for the anti-nausea medicine the patient took. She knew it was given to her once and when they tried to give it to her again, patient refused. Reporter had no product information to provide for the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, did not have the patient vaccine record card. This would be with the nursing facility. She mentioned patient went into the nursing home on Jan2018 and then was diagnosed with breast cancer Jun2018. She did not know if there were any interactions there with the patient having the breast cancer and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The reporter had no product information for the first dose. When probed for the date in which the first dose was given, she explained she was sent constant emails which could have provided a date, but she did not know this information offhand. It was approximately a month before the second dose, or it could have been on 27Dec2020, which was a little closer than a month apart. No additional vaccines were administered on the same date of the Pfizer vaccine. The events required a visit to emergency room. Patient had constant testing while in the hospital. In the hospital, in Feb2021, they did MRI and CAT scan to see if the breast cancer had gone to the brain and both were negative. They tested for UTI. They did the first UTI test at nursing home in 2021 and they said she had a UTI and patient was put on an antibiotic. They tested her again for a UTI when she was admitted into the hospital in Feb2021 and they said she did not have a UTI. She did have a buildup of urine in her bladder because her kidney functions were not good enough for the MRI at first, in Feb2021. Her bladder was relieved of the urine build up and her kidney functions improved and she was able to get the MRI. The MRI did not show any cancer in the brain. None of it relieved her symptoms. This was just bizarre. It happened within a week of receiving the vaccine. She could not talk with patient and patient had never been like that. The patient had always been lucid and open and you could talk about anything: the past, the present, she had no problems. She could remember everything crystal clear from the past but she could not remember or know everything from the present. The reporter would ask her what day was it and the patient did not know. The patient would absorb the information she was told but there was like this strange disconnect, almost like a dementia of some form. About concomitant medications, the reporter explained the patient had not started anything new. She had been on the same stuff for many years. She had psych meds that she had been on, but she had been on those for many years. She clarified further that patient had been stable on her psych meds for many years, and the nursing facility had the patient stable for 3 years at the nursing home. At the time of the report, her mood swings were all over the place, she had never had that before. She had hallucinations and paranoid thoughts in the past, but she had never had mood swings like this and never had dementia. She had been on the same medications for a long time, but they were currently trying to play with them and trying to adjust her psych meds. It was apparent it was not working and this was something more organic, something going on in her body. The psych med was perphenazine all of her life. The psych nurse was a new nurse and was not familiar with the patient. The psych nurse informed the reporter she raised the perphenazine to the highest dose she could possible go on and told she could have to try the patient on a mood stabilizer and could have to put her in a psych unit. The reporter would not have any NDC, lot numbers or expiration dates, or anything like that. The reporter had been told an UTI could have caused the patient symptoms. It could have been brain cancer, or this or that. She did not know what was going on. Reporter asked if there had been any reports or had other people called in with these types of reactions or adverse events. The patient had recovered from vomiting and nausea on an unknown date in 2021, had recovered from kidney functions were not good enough and UTI in Feb2021, the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She mentioned she had felt a weird sensation on an unspecified date and as she noticed some spikes in her blood pressure, her MD told her to take another 2.5 mg amlodipine if needed (once or twice a day as needed). She confirmed she had no heart rate problems but she actually experienced high blood pressure instead. She never had numbness, instead she had a tingling sensation still present.

A 68-year-old female patient the second dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN5318) on 04Feb2021 at 1:00 on Left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was ongoing Arachnoiditis (this is a spinal cord disease). Concomitant drugs were not reported. Historical Vaccine was 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL1283) on 15Jan2021 administered in left arm for covid-19 immunization. She was calling to report a severe reaction that occurred after the second injection. On 05Feb2021 she started to have extreme chills with teeth chattering at 3 AM. She knew this could be part of the symptoms. At 6 AM on 05Feb2021 she got up and with her husband&#39;s assessment who is also is a doctor it was determined by her husband she was in a cytokine storm that attacked her spinal cord disease. The extreme chills ended within a couple of hours on 05Feb2021. The cytokine storm has pretty much resolved. It is still there, but better. She still has fatigue. However, the extreme pain, mental fog, and disconnect that came with it has all subsided. Caller stated she knows from research and talking to other people most people might have the chills after the COVID Vaccine. The chills is not the severe side effect she is referencing as severe. The Cytokine storm reaction for her wit her spinal cord disease is unexpected and not normal. This was the severe event. No Emergency Room visited. Physician&#39;s Office visited for Cytokine Storm. She should have gone to the hospital, but she did not want to go. Seven days after event started, she went to her physician. This was as soon as she was able to get up and get out of the house. Treatment was mainly self-treating. Her husband is a doctor and they did what they needed to do at home. These side effects were pretty horrific. Outcome of the event cytokine storm was recovering, for fatigue was not recovered, for other events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information expected.

Will see internist if symptoms continue after 2 weeks.

                                                She had the vaccine at the facility where she lives.  She fainted less than 24 hours after the vaccine, got up from that and had dry heaves, lost her speech and had loose stools.  The aide caught her as she was fainting as she would have fallen on the floor.  She said it was weird, she looked at people and it looked like they were 2 dimensional and knew something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t figure out what as they attended to her.  They asked her questions, but she was not able to speak to them.   They apparently spent 2 hours with her, but she doesn&#39;t believe it was that long, and then they knew she wanted to go to one Hospital and not the other.  She had been loosing words before this happened, but not as bad as this one.  This was about the same reaction that she had when she got the COVID virus in January.  She was then taken to the hospital where she was given fluids and hydrated her and checked her heart, saw a cardiologist and a neurologist to see if those things caused the fainting and had blood work done.  They also did a CAT Scan of her head and neck.  They told her that she was fine and was discharged back home after 5 days, which was 3/11/21.  Since then she has been very tired, she does have GERD and her stomach has been hurting a lot as well.

The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included multiple sclerosis from 1994 and ongoing Verbatim: MS. There were no concomitant medications.

Weight: Caller stated she would give her Covid weight. HCP: Caller reported that she is unsure of MD zip code.  She reported that the phone number for her MD ends in DOCS but she did not know which numbers that corresponded to. Caller reported that she did not experience any of the common side effects from the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  She did not experience a sore arm, fever, muscle aches, none of that.  She reported that she did not have any side effects until the afternoon of Saturday, 06Mar2021. Caller reported that she&#39;s had MS for many many years and that it has been in what she calls remission for a long time.  She stated that the last exacerbation she experienced was following a Tdap vaccination five years before.  Because of this experience, when the Covid vaccine came out, she went through her doctor to see what she should do, if she should get it.  Her doctor recommended that she get the Covid-19 vaccine, but told the caller that she should make sure to go to a health care facility to receive it instead of drugstore or a clinic due to her experience following the Tdap vaccine in 2016. Caller reports that she is now having a similar exacerbation following the Covid-19 vaccine. Exacerbation of MS: Caller stated that it is an ongoing exacerbation that is not getting better.  She stated that she&#39;s sure that it will get better, but she is not sure what she should do about the second dose. Legs weak, numb, tingly: Caller reported that the weakness, numbness, and tingling in her legs was progressive.  She stated that the weakness, numbness, and tingling began on Saturday afternoon, 06Mar2021, in her feet and lower legs, and had then progressed to her thighs by Sunday 07Mar2021 or Monday 08Mar2021. Arms are weak, numb, tingly: Caller reported  that she noticed on Sunday, 07Mar2021 that her hands were a little clumsy.  She reported that throughout the day of Sunday, 07Mar2021 and Monday, 08Mar2021, the numbness and tingling progressed into her upper arm. Facial tingling: Caller originally stated that she has been experiencing a lot of nerve sensation, then clarified as facial tingling, in particular around the mouth, below the nose, and on both sides of her face.  She stated that it began on Sunday, 07Mar2021 and was intermittently present on 08Mar2021 probably into 09Mar2021, then it just went away.  She stated that it would come and go. Caller reported that while she is able to walk and has not had to use her wheelchair, that it is a struggle to walk.  She also reported that it is a struggle to do things with her arms and hands.  She stated that if she wanted to eat, in order to pick up the fork she would probably be using 2 hands to get the fork up but can use it once it&#39;s in her hands.  She also reported that a pencil is difficult to pick up as well, stating that she would need to use both hands to pick it up but would be able to use the pencil once she had picked it up. Caller reported that the tingling comes and goes, and she experiences varying degrees of numbness.  She reported that they are a little numb throughout the day and it may get worse depending on what she&#39;s doing. She stated that she isn&#39;t a sitter, she has to get up and move. Caller reported that she called her physician, about the side effects she was experiencing and they instructed her to go to the Emergency Room.  She stated that their concern was what was going on and if it could be Guillain Barre disease, which she stated is extremely rare. Caller reported that when she went to the Emergency Room on 09Mar2021, they did not really do any tests.  She stated that in order to see if there were any new lesions for the MS, they would have to do an MRI of her brain. Caller reported that they did not believe that there were any new lesions, that they thought it was old lesions.  Caller reported that they told her to go home and make an appointment with the neurology resident clinic for that week, clarified as last week, week of 09Mar2021.  Caller reported that she called the neurology clinic as she does not currently have a neurologist, and they informed her that they would not be able to get her in for an appointment until the end of Apr2021.  She stated this was not doing her much good. Caller stated that they had wanted to admit her to the hospital, but told her that she could go home if she promised to follow up with the neurology resident clinic. Caller expressed some frustration, stating that she was really trying to reach out to see what she should do regarding the second dose.  Her physician tells her to go to the Emergency Room, the Emergency Room tells her to go to neurology.  She wants to know what will the second dose do.  She stated that she called the (state) chapter of the national MS society this morning, where they informed her that they had not heard any reports of exacerbations from the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller states that getting additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine is a lifelong decision.  She stated that Covid may not always be a pandemic, but it could come back like a yearly flu.  She stated that because additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine could be required, she wanted guidance on how to proceed. Her second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is scheduled for 25Mar2021. Clinical outcome of facial tingling was recovered on 09Mar2021, while for the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                her MS symptoms exploded; head became foggy; blurred eyes; slight headache; This is a spontaneous report by contactable consumer(patient) from Pfizer Sponsored program.  A 68-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose on 17Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Multiple Sclerosis (MS) for 20 years and autoimmune disease. Concomitant medications included interferon beta-1a (AVONEX) for MS. The patient previously took Avelox for MS. Caller also states she would like to report that she has a history of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and she goes to the clinic. Caller states since no studies were done on people with MS, she would like to report her experience. Caller states she received her first dose of the vaccine on 17Mar2021 and hours afterwards her MS symptoms exploded. Caller states she has had MS for 20 years and she doesn&#39;t even realize she has it because she is able to walk the dogs at the pound and she does 3600 steps a day and it doesn&#39;t keep her from doing anything. Caller states after the shot she has torn meniscus in her knees and her knees were so tight and she has heel spurs, and they were burning and hurt. Caller states she hurt her hand previously and her hand was tight, and it felt like it was going to explode. Caller states every injury she has ever had it felt like it was exacerbated and got worse. Caller states she was instructed by the Clinic to take Tylenol every 6 hours and these symptoms lasted for 12 days. Caller states she takes a medication called Avelox for MS once a week and she didn&#39;t take it after the shot because it is known to cause flu like symptoms, but she is back taking it now. Caller states she was working on the computer and her head became foggy and this lasted for six or seven days. The caller has MS and is on Avonex, it&#39;s a beta 1 interferon injectable that she has been taking for over 20 years. The caller&#39;s doctors told her it was okay to get the shot. Because of the caller&#39;s autoimmune disease, the caller&#39;s doctors don&#39;t know how effective the shot will be with an autoimmune disease. The caller has done well with Multiple Sclerosis; her Multiple Sclerosis was really good she was walking 3600 steps a day. The vaccine seems to have flared up everywhere the caller has been hurt. It made those spots worse. The caller had a torn meniscus and it felt like her knee was stiff like a board. The caller had a bone spur in her foot that it began to hurt where that was removed. The caller broke her left hand and then it felt like it was going to explode. The caller also had head fog and blurred eyes. It took 6-7 days for head fog to get better. The other symptoms it was 12-13 days to get better. The caller also had a slight headache. The clinic said there were no studies in someone with MS who took the covid vaccine, they only reported to them about the autoimmune disease. Someone on the thing said the second dose was 10 times worse than the first one. Then the caller was told if she gets those symptoms with the first shot then the second one will be better because your body is used to it and knows what to do. It is kind of like a trial by fire and no one knows what to expect. The caller wants to know if Pfizer had any information on Avonex interfering with MS. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

By Sunday afternoon the pain became debilitating and the pain spread to my underarm and the edge of the breast area. I applied heat and rested.  The sharp pain interfered with sleep and regular life activities.  On Tuesday morning I applied an ice pack, which relieved the pain.  After applying ice for two more times, the pain subsided and the swelling under my arm disappeared. I was able to resume normal activities with slight discomfort.

                                                I give the girl in front of me the Covid vaccine way high on her arm. I told MA do not give my shot that high up. She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times. I still have ongoing pain 24 seven and I want to report a complaint against the girl who gave my shot I thought she was an LPN but she is a MA.  We both work at healthcare clinic. I am a 26 year RN and she did not listen to me and she stuck me anyway against my will.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in the left shoulder area on 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included COPD (has it for lots of years) and nickel sensitivity. She does not have any reactions to her previous unspecified vaccines but had a normal reaction like sore arm. Concomitant medication included bimatoprost (LUMIGAN).  The patient previously received flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, both for immunization in 2020 around the end of Sep or beginning of Oct. The patient reported side effects regarding the COVID vaccine and said she was a little confused and unsure if she was having a problem or if she should see a doctor. On 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM, she had the first dose of the COVID vaccine and afterward she had a lot of effects which were mostly muscle and body aches in Jan2021. She also experienced some ongoing congestion in one nostril but saw this as just more congestion and that she was having to blow her nose more in Jan2021. She did the (app name) report but didn&#39;t report the stuffiness. She did report that in the first few days she felt like she was having the onset of pneumonia and felt tired and run down (Jan2021). Two days ago, she started feeling itchy (Jan2021) and she didn&#39;t know what it was, she didn&#39;t know if she ate something or what. Now she has developed a rash (Jan2021) which is ongoing until now. Her paperwork said the rash would happen right away if it was caused by the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if this is something she should be concerned about and if the rash could appear or started this long after she had the vaccine. Her second dose is due on 06Feb2021. The patient wanted to know if the vaccine contains nickel or any metal substances in it since she had compared her rash to her nickel sensitivity. The patient wanted to know if rash is a side effect from the vaccine and how long it will last. She didn&#39;t put rash down for the safety check either as she didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine. Today her rash, she is so itchy. She does have it on her neck and certain areas but not everywhere. It looks like what would happen after a bad fever. It is not raised but is like a fever type rash.  She did note that she had an increase dose of a medication eye drops (Lumigan; Lot: T and a 0 or O followed by 544, and NDC: 0023320503. Expiry: Jan2022) around the time the rash started but after getting the vaccine. Her head, neck and back are very itchy. She mentioned that she waited 2 days and did not put this event in the (app name). She would have reported it yesterday, but she didn&#39;t get one yesterday. She also noted that it was very dry there and cold and a person is going to get dry skin.  She does have an allergic to metal and wondered if that was in the product. In her neck area, it looks just like when she would wear a cheap necklace. No treatments received. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit.  The patient has no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient had not yet recovered from events rash/like a fever type rash and congestion in one nostril/stuffiness; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis, ongoing high cholesterol,  ongoing high blood pressure, celiac disease from 2005 (this has been tested too many times to count and it has been negative since after initial diagnosis 2005), arthritis (all her life) ongoing, hip replacement surgeries first done in 2005; repair of same hip in 2015; other hip in 2017. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Historical vaccines include Pneumonia Vaccine, Shingles Vaccine and Flu vaccines; all on an unspecified date for immunization. She never had adverse events with those. Ongoing concomitant medications included rosuvastatin (5 mg tablet) for high cholesterol, mesalamine (400 mg capsule) for ulcerative colitis and lisinopril from 2018 for high blood pressure. According to the patient, she knows that mesalamine is an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory to keep inflammation in the colon down. This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021 14:30 with immunosuppressant mesalamine. The night of 14Jan2021 patient had headache, chills, body aches, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and dizziness like Covid 19 symptoms. She went to the ER during the past 11 days for IV fluids due to deyhydration from the diarrhea.

It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired. She will fall asleep through the day for 3-4 hours at a time and she does not even nap usually (Jan2021). She has not driven yet but assumes probably once she is a little stronger she will be able to drive again. She did not have upper respiratory, chest or cough issues. The outcome of the events fever, headache, body ache, muscle pain, neck ache was recovered on Jan2021; fatigue was not recovered. The outcome for the other events was unknown.

She does have an IV contrast reaction, and some other things, nothing she knew was in the vaccine, she was fine and wasn&#39;t worried that she was aware of. She thinks she got too hot, she had on a coat, she was sitting and panning through stuff, reading on her phone, and all of a sudden she had terrible lightheadedness, she never fainted in her life, she is pretty sturdy, she didn&#39;t know what to think, she was lightheaded, and it was not vertigo, not like the room was flying, but she was like out of balance, her balance was messed up, and she sat there a minute, she was too hot, she got out of her coat, and it got worse, she could feel her heart racing, and she was talking to herself, she thinks she nervous, she could feel her heart pounding, and was instructed to raise her hand if she had issues, so she raised her hand, a nurse practitioner came over, she raised her hand, and the doctor making rounds came over and he said take off your mask off, she did, that helped somewhat, it was that blasted mask, she couldn&#39;t get enough air, he gave her water, she thinks she got too hot and perhaps got nervous and didn&#39;t think she was she said she&#39;s not been around people, and was suddenly in a huge crowd, everyone was appropriately distanced, it was an extreme presentation, after 5-6 minutes, she was good, it went away, but for 36 hours she didn&#39;t feel right, she could feel sometimes her balance wasn&#39;t right, she was just not herself, she could do her usual, she lives on a farm, she did usual farm stuff, but was not herself, and in the night, she woke several times, her heart was beating too fast, too much, but she went back to sleep, and she told her son, she said it felt like she had had 4-5 cups of really strong coffee.

I was approached by our CIO to see her immediately. Another Nurse  came to the rescue and we both assessed the patient. She was awake, alert, oriented but anxious and stating she&#39;s dizzy. The back of the seat was lowered down for her comfort and blood pressure was taken. It was 172 /100 mmhg. PR = 72 , Temp = 97.5. RR = 18. Two other RNs came to help. The patient was conversant, her husband was upbeat and being funny. Pt started to play with her dog from the backseat reaching for it. The patient was talking but I decided to tell patient to relax since vital signs will be taken again. BP repeated after 6 minutes and its now 155/100, PR= 75, RR=19, TEMP= 97.3, 02 Sat @89 % . Pt?s hands were cold now. O2 Sat was also hard to get a good reading on all of her fingers. Called Dr. Cat Forest and she came to the scene comforting patient while vitsal signs were repeated again after 5 minutes  after they were taken Now getting BP=  55/110 mmhg, PR: 80, Temp 97.2 and O2 Sat still at 89% Pt was adviced to go the ER after the Patient?s O2 Sat stayed at 89% and also after finding out that patient haven?t had any physical for two years and that patient doesnt check her blood pressure. Pt and her husband were counselled on the importance of getting regular check up especially at her age of 69 years old. Husband drove patient to the ER per order. Called patient on Monday, 2/23 and Tuesday, 2/24 with no answer. emailed patient and patient answered back and she said that she went to the ER with her husband that day and was discharged and feeling better and wanting to thank the staff for the way she was taken cared of and hoping they will be there for her second dose when she comes back.

                                                Within 10 seconds I began to feel that something was wrong.   A full body response of a swirling congestion, extreme weakness. very blurry vision and couldn&#39;t think straight.  I had trouble walking to recovery room, felt nauseous and weak and had a very fast heartrate.  I had to stay in private recovery room for 45 min.  I was still very ill and nervous at this point.   I left with a family member and asked to be driven to the nearby hospital emergency room.  For a precaution .  We parked across from ER entrance for another 1 hour till I slowly regained strength to 50% normalcy.  I went home afterwards and had to go to bed. I was unable to drive my own vehicle home.  Day 2, still feel weak, shaky and not normal.  I consider this a serious adverse reaction that did not receive medical intervention but will prevent me from getting the second Pfizer shot.  After 5 hours post injection I felt 60% normal .  Day 2, 70 per cent normal.   The vaccination facility was not able to do blood pressure monitoring ( which is a problem for anyone experiencing reactions.)  They said their protocol was to call 911/ambulance.   My blood pressure was checked by a certified PA with professional equipment at the 3 hour post injection time and the diastolic pressure was still below 50.  And heart rate above normal.  Still weak and nauseous.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3248, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 24Jan2021 07:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetic. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient&#39;s granddaughter had COVID virus and passed to the patient. The 2nd dose appointment scheduled for 14Feb2021. Patient stated she had the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 24Jan2021 at 0715AM in the right arm. After that, she found out she got infected with COVID 19. On 01Feb2021, she tested positive for COVID 19. On 28Jan2021 (also reported as on 28Jan20201 or 29Jan2021), she was feeling bad. Her little granddaughter had COVID virus (was infected at the school) and passed it on to her. Now she has been going to different places checking it out and she went to urgent care because her heart was beating fast on 02Feb2021. She had an electrocardiogram and her lungs were okay on an unspecified date. They told her was eligible to get an infusion but she doesn&#39;t know what it is. The urgent care clinic told her she could get the infusion but then she can&#39;t get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She wants to ask if this is true. She was being offered a monoclonal antibody infusion. When ask if this is the first time to call, she stated she called once before right after she found out that she had the COVID 19 infection to ask if she could still get the second shot. She did report at that time that she had gotten the first dose and then tested positive for COVID 19 and she previously provided product information including the lot number from her vaccine card. She added that her heart has been going very fast and has been having fever on 02Feb2021 for two or three days. It is not as high today as it was before. She does want to get the second dose. The first dose helped her so much. On 04Feb2021 (reported as yesterday), she was checked at urgent care because of heart concern and a bit of pressure in chest. Patient stated she only had a little cough, sore throat and runny nose, but she hasn&#39;t experienced any other symptoms on an unspecified date. The patient&#39;s weight was 54.43 kg on 01Feb2021.

She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of NT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 08:30 (Lot Number: ER8727; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021, at age of 69 years old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies: Penicillin, Ampicillin, hair color product. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She was allergic to Penicillin, and Ampicillin. As a child, always reacted strongly to any vaccination she was given with a fever and flu like symptoms for a couple of days. With Ampicillin, she thought she was having a heart attack. Was told to stop Ampicillin immediately because she could get a heart attack. This was when she was 25 years old and she never went to the ER. She was allergic to a hair color product in the 1990s and it made her scalp itch really badly. Was given a cortisone shot, which she reacted immediately breaking out head to toe in hives. Has no NDC/LOT/EXP for the vaccinations she reacted strongly to as a child. Stated this was in the 1950s or early 1960s. Clarified she did not have a heart attack with Ampicillin, but it felt like she was having one. Has had cardiograms per her request and her heart and heart walls are perfect. The patient received the first dose of the Covid vaccine at 8:30 a.m. this morning on 26Mar2021. Caller reports around 11 a.m., she experienced excruciating leg cramping going from her buttock down behind her knee and rolling to the inside of her thigh, states that the pain lasted 15 minutes. The patient reports the same pain occurred on the opposite leg around noon and lasted for 15 minutes, states that &#34;the pain was so excruciating that she could barely stand up and it was so agonizing it was unbelievable.&#34; The patient noticed that the inside of her thighs were a little red on the side, both legs from her thighs to her knees. The patient states that she has not been in the sun, and didn&#39;t think it was anything alarming, but this is abnormal for her, states that she received the vaccine in the right arm and her upper torso is fine and her head is clear, asked if anyone else had reported this reaction. She was planned to received the second dose on 16thApr in the early afternoon. The patient stated the COVID shot was already fogging her mind. The patient felt pretty good after first shot. Felt nothing. Fifteen minutes before leaving the diner she got a leg cramp. Was sitting in a booth and didn&#39;t think much of it. Attributed it to the way she was sitting. Around 11AM when she got back to her garage, she was in agony. It hurt from the top of her rear all the way down the side to the back of her knee and rolled to the inside of her thigh. She was in such agony and didn&#39;t know if she could get out of her chair and walk. By the time she reached her apartment it has subsided. An hour later, same thing happened in the left leg. She was laying in bed and texting because she didn&#39;t&#39; know if she would get any other reaction. This leg cramp was even worse. She was in tears. Got off bed to try and walk it off. Initial leg cramp happened in right leg. Was excruciating. Both times it lasted for 15 minutes. Both cramps were from her buttocks, all down to her knees, and rolled over into her thigh. Didn&#39;t know if that was a reaction. It is not typical of anything written on Pfizer&#39;s information or that she had heard. She was concerned. Heard about blood clots, but not with this particular product. Stated second leg cramp subsided. If it hadn&#39;t, she wouldn&#39;t have gone to the ER. Leg cramps was so excruciating. Originally thought it was coincidental and stated she will be 70 on (Date withheld). To say she has never had leg cramps before would be a lie. The way the leg cramps were timed was kind of weird. It was absolutely the same kind of cramp and location just on the a different leg. Weight: Gained 25lbs. Doesn&#39;t have COVID or any symptoms. Tested three to four months ago and was negative. Received first dose COVID-19 Vaccine today, 26Mar2021, at 08:30AM. First leg cramp began 11:00AM in right leg. Second leg cramp began Noon in left leg. Each time lasted 15 minutes. Not having leg cramps right now. Could barely talk when having leg cramps. Was worried about getting clots in legs. Otherwise she would think it was because she was getting older. She doesn&#39;t get leg cramps very often. Doesn&#39;t know when the last time she had leg cramps prior to today. Nurse technician at vaccine faculty stated caller&#39;s allergy history wouldn&#39;t be a problem and she only had to sit for 15 minutes. Received the COVID-19 Vaccine and hardly felt it. Waited for 15 minutes. She was fine until 11AM. She was fine now, but her arm might get a little stiff tomorrow. Arm was slightly tender. Surprised she felt something in her legs. Doesn&#39;t know whether to associate it with COVID-19 Vaccine or not. Has nothing to complain about in the upper torso or from the waist up. Wants to know if this is a reaction or coincidence. Stated she expected to have a stiff arm. The outcome of the event &#34;Cramps in legs&#34; and &#34;pain&#34; was recovered on 26Mar2021. The outcome of other events was unknown.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number:  ER8737, expiration date: 30Jul2021, NDC number: 59267-1000-02), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left deltoid on 08Apr2021 10:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia. Patient stated she has had fibromyalgia for about 20 years. She said she had a fibromyalgia flare up with increased back pain, and had a Toradol 60mg intramuscular injection in her left hip on Tuesday, 06Apr2021. Concomitant medication included ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL) for fibromyalgia from 06Apr2021. It was reported she had her first COVID-19 vaccine injection on Thursday 08Apr2021 at 10:30AM. She said that night (08Apr2021) she couldn&#39;t sleep and woke up at 3:00AM (09Apr2021) with shortness of breath, productive cough, and throat congestion. She said she had so much throat congestion, she could hardly talk. She clarified she felt like she woke up with a cold. She said she still had the productive cough, but her other symptoms went away by 8:30AM-9:00AM on 09Apr2021. She said she hadn&#39;t had a cold in 4 years. She said she read something on the internet that suggested her symptoms may be due to having the COVID-19 virus prior to getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said if she had the COVID-19 virus prior to getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine, she was totally asymptomatic. She said she wanted to know what she should do. Patient further reported she felt her shortness of breath was medically significant because she was mouth breathing. She clarified she felt hot during that time, and took her temperature, which was 97 degrees. She said she thought the fact she was hot was medically significant because she thought she may have a bad respiratory infection or something. The patient was not brought to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office in response to the events. The patient recovered from shortness of breath, felt hot, throat congestion on 09Apr2021; recovering from productive cough, and unknown outcome for the remaining events. The events were assessed as related with bnt162b2.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 29Mar2021 at 09:20 (at the age of 69-year-old) at hospital facility as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no relevant medical history. Patient reported that she has people in the family that have had heart problems. Concomitant medication included unspecified vitamins. Historical vaccine includes first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9990 or EM9890) administered in the right arm on 08Mar2021 (at the age of 69-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and had a little fast heart rate but not constant, little fatigue and site pain. The patient previously took steroid injections 2 years ago (2019) and had heart palpitations before. The patient further mentioned that normally after the steroids wear off, the heart palpitations go away. The patient reported that she did not have any problems following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she had a little fatigue and site pain for just a couple of days but that everything was fine. Patient reported that she felt a little heart palpitations for maybe a day or two and then it was gone following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. After she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, she noticed the heart palpitations again and a little shortness of breath. The heart palpitations and shortness of breath were nothing that she felt that she had to run to the emergency room or anything over. The patient reported that now it was getting difficult for her to sleep sometimes at night because of the heart rate. The patient also reported that she was trying to figure out that from this length of time between her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021 and time of call on 14Apr2021, could the heart palpitations be a side effect from the COVID-19 vaccine. Patient also mentioned that when she experienced heart palpitations before, a whole work up was ordered and she was referred to cardiology and that nothing was found during the work up after previous experience with heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that she has been fine, that she has been able to work and walk and that she gets her 10,000 steps every day. After getting the COVID-19 vaccine, she was tired and didn&#39;t feel like her normal self. The patient also reported that when the time had arrived to get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, about a week before, she may have had a little fast heart rate but not constant. It was also reported that following her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Mar2021, the fatigue started about the same time as it did following the first dose, on the second day post-vaccine on 30Mar2021. Patient reported that she was kind of tired and just taking a nap during the day. The fatigue was still ongoing. It was also reported that patient was starting to feel better other than the heart palpitations. The patient reported that yesterday, 13Apr2021, she felt great and could do her normal routine, other than feeling chest pains and palpitations. The heart palpitations are not constant, but are more regular during the day than she was used to. The heart palpitations were really bad last night, 13Apr2021, and that she had difficulty sleeping because of heart rate (couldn&#39;t hardly sleep at all). The patient&#39;s doctor was scheduling her for an echocardiogram. The patient&#39;s doctor did an electrocardiogram (EKG) on her on 08Apr2021 and there was nothing there (normal). The patient&#39;s doctor was scheduling her for a stress echocardiogram. The patient also mentioned that after returning from the physician&#39;s office, her husband went back and looked at the symptoms from the COVID-19 vaccine information sheet. The patient reported that her husband thought that she needed to call to eliminate everything, that they are trying to figure out why the patient was experiencing the heart palpitations. The patient also mentioned that 2 days ago she got on her treadmill to walk and went for 30 minutes. Patient reported that it normally takes her 5 minutes to recuperate, but that time it took her 20 minutes before she felt comfortable after her walk. The patient also reported that the site pain was nothing serious following both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The site pain began shortly after receiving the vaccine and went away after the second day following both vaccines. The shortness of breath probably started about 5 days after she got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The shortness of breath wasn&#39;t enough that she felt that she needed to run to the emergency room. It just felt like when she would breathe, especially at night as she normally breathes with her mouth closed at night, the patient felt like she had to open her mouth to breathe because she can still feel the pressure in chest. The patient was still experiencing the heart palpitations. The heart palpitations are a little worse because they happen so often. Patient reported that initially, she would have a few heart palpitations and then go for hours with none. Patient reported that now, she was feeling the heart palpitations quite a bit. Patient reported that it feels kind of like a little pressure in her chest and then it&#39;ll feel like little flutters. The patient further reported that she experiences a little pressure in her chest when she experiences the heart palpitations. At times, the chest pressure would go away, but she always feels the chest pressure there now. The chest pressure has gotten worse over the past couple of weeks and that she was thinking that it would go away like the first one did. Patient reported that she went to the doctor last week and was given an EKG. Patient reported that the EKG was fine and that her physician was scheduling other tests to make sure it&#39;s nothing with her heart. The patient didn&#39;t think that the heart palpitations and shortness of breath were from the COVID-19 vaccine, but that her husband looked at the vaccine information paper after her doctor&#39;s appointment and said she should call Pfizer. The patient had not yet recovered from heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pressure while outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL8982, unknown expiration), via injection in right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 prevention.  Medical history included ongoing vertigo (in car accident a little over 5 years ago, that affected a big nerve in left temple, and so every once in a while she will get vertigo so bad that she falls over), ongoing GERD (from a hiatal hernia; diagnosed many years ago), ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed about 15 years ago, ongoing bad cholesterol diagnosed 10 to 15 years ago, ongoing heart burn, ongoing hiatus hernia, and car accident a little over 5 years ago. Concomitant medications included ongoing omeprazole sodium (OMEPRAZOLE) for GERD, heart burn, and hiatal hernia (started this product at least 10 years ago; takes the product as needed if she is having heart burn or is going to eat spicy food); ongoing vitamin D3 for vitamin supplementation (started product about 8 months ago, because her doctor told her too, she guesses her vitamin was low); ongoing metoprolol for high blood pressure and to prevent stroke (started product at least 15 years ago; her BP could be regular but it could shoot up when she is upset, so she takes this to prevent stroke); ongoing hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure (started product at least 5 years ago); pravastatin for bad cholesterol  (started the product at least 4 or 5 or more years ago); and ongoing acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) to prevent stroke (has been taking this product forever, at least for 10 years).  The patient reported that she received the first COVID shot on 13Jan2021. She was okay on the 13th, 14th, and 15th. However, on the 16th (16Jan2021), she woke up and threw up once and was very dizzy for three days. She mentioned that she had like vertigo, she couldn&#39;t even walk, she had to crawl and her husband had to walk her around, she couldn&#39;t do anything. She had vertigo (16Jan2021). She was that way on Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, the patient&#39;s son took her to acupuncturist for her dizziness and was able to get up fine and walked away. After the acupuncture, she felt fine, like she was all better. On 19Jan2021 (reported as yesterday), she was fine. She woke up at midnight and had terrible acid reflux for 3 hours even though she had hardly eaten. She does take omeprazole for heart burn, and she had taken omeprazole earlier in the day, but it was just coming up, that acid and burning. She drank milk to coat the stomach and it went away at 03:00 AM. She had very bad chills/terrible chills (20Jan2021) and her teeth were chattering, she couldn&#39;t even talk, and couldn&#39;t control the chills. She is fine now. She clarified that she got vertigo from a car crash years ago and haven&#39;t had it in almost a year. Chills are not ongoing at this time, she has not had any for about 4 hours now, and she is hoping she is recovered completely, but it may be too soon to tell. She did not receive other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient is wondering if all this could be from the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if it is safe to take the second shot. She was scheduled to receive the second dose on 03Feb2021. The patient recovered from the events threw up on 16Jan2021; unable to walk and vertigo on 18Jan2021; dizziness on 19Jan2021; and terrible acid reflux on 20Jan2021. While unknown outcome for chills.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first does of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, acid reflux, allergy. Concomitant medication included lisinopril for high blood pressure, oxymetazoline hydrochloride (CLARITIN ALLERGIC) for allergy, cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY) for allergy, omeprazole magnesium (PRILOSEC) (reported as it&#39;s like Prilosec) for acid reflux. Patient received the first vaccination on the 15Jan2021 and she did not have any symptoms until Tuesday (19Jan2021), she started feeling kind of bad, she was very prone to allergies, she just thought it was back, this was her season to get sick if she had to get allergies, this was when it happened like January early February, so she went to Urgent care and she wanted a cortisone shot and she didn&#39;t think she should get a cortisone shot because it would effect the effectiveness of vaccine, so they said no and they would like to swab her nose to rule out that she didn&#39;t have COVID, and he did and it came out positive, so she wanted to get our opinion that if we thought it was a true positive or false positive. She thought she couldn&#39;t get COVID after she got the part of vaccine, and the second question she had was her second dose would be on 05Feb2021 by that she would be out of quarantine so should she plan and take the second one. Patient guess the lot number was EL0142. Th outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Unable to fall asleep the night of the second dose.  Felt progressively worse as night went on.  By 3am, had fever, chills, couldn&#39;t stop shaking or get warm, had headache, skin sensitive almost hurt when touched.  Felt too bad to get out of bed but eventually got up, took acetimetophen, drank water, added clothes and blankets and returned to bed.  Body kept tensing up very tightly so that all muscles were constricted/tights and impossible to relax.  This continued for a few hours.  By morning, I thought I was starting to feel better.  These symptoms returns for a second round about 2pm that afternoon and continued until about 6pm.  On the nights of 2/3, 2/4 and 2/5, I wake up around 3am extremely hot and sometimes damp, despite air temp of 66 to 68 degrees.  This resolves after about an hour and body feels normal.

By the following afternoon I was exhausted and no longer feeling that effect.  Nothing was done since it did not last.  It was suggested that I report it since it is not mentioned as a side effect in the list of information.

                                                A little after midnight, I woke up shaking because I was so very cold.  It felt almost like a seizure because my lack of control was evident in my movements.  With my heaviest PJs on, it took 8 blankets to finally warm me up.  I am on a CPAP machine but I was having a hard time getting my breath.  I was also nauseous but never threw up.  I finally got back asleep a little after 3 am but  woke several times after that.  This morning, I had a terrible headache and can&#39;t get rid of it. Although I feel better than last night, I feel lousy.  It is now 2 pm and I just want this to be over.  On the first shot, I didn&#39;t have any reaction at all.

My husband was up every half hour urinating from 6pm  until about 3am.  We both felt fine this morning but about 11am I got super dizzy and had to sit down, the dizziness caused vomiting and a sever headache.  I laid down for about an hour and feel a bit better but the headache has remained!!   Hopefully this too will pass in a few more hours!  Just thought you might want to know.  If it gets worse I will contact my doctor.   My husband has not had any other adverse reactions.

                                                Patient was alert and conversational throughout first COVID-19 Pfizer vaccination. During post vaccination waiting period, patient became unresponsive and exhibited convulsion like movements in her waiting chair. Pharmacist quickly evaluated patient and patient was only minimally responsive to painful stimuli only. Breathing was rapid, shallow, and irregular with an expiratory wheeze heard upon auscultation. Patient was slouched in chair but supporting self and had a strong grip with her left hand. Skin condition was warm but diaphoretic. Ambulance 911 service was called. No swelling of the throat, mouth, face, nor lips was seen. Patient continued to be non-responsive, with non-comprehensible sounds, and was not opening eyes or following commands. Due to worsening ability to breath and wheezing on expiration, epinephrine 0.3 mg was administered intramuscularly into the left thigh at 1230 on 2/25/2021. Approximately 5 minutes after epinephrine administration, the patient?s work of breathing improved, wheezing was diminished upon expiration, and respiratory rate had slowed to 16 breaths per minutes. BP was 160s/80s and HR 98 (after epinephrine administration). Patient began opening eyes spontaneously but was still not following commands. Ambulance service then arrived, report was given, and patient was transported to Hospital Emergency Department.   Patient was under the care of Doctor at the emergency department and received albuterol/ipratropium nebulization, dexamethasone 10 mg Iv, famotidine 20 mg IV, and magnesium sulfate 2 g IV. After the physician evaluated the patient and talked with family, the patient?s family stated that the patient has a history of anxiety related reactions such as this with convulsion like activity. Doctor then determined that the patient did not have an anaphylactic/allergic reaction and instead had a anxiety related vasovagal type reaction. Doctor stated that the patient could receive the second COVID-19 vaccine dose in 3 weeks without issue. Patient then discharged from Emergency Department (unsure if AMA). Patient then presented to the pharmacy with her daughter after discharge to fill in staff on the outcome of the reaction. Patient appeared to be at baseline mentally and physically. Pharmacist contacted Emergency Department to discuss case with patient?s nurse to obtain information about medications received in the emergency department. Patient daughter stated that she would like to be present for second dose of vaccine to help avoid a similar anxiety related reaction from occurring.

A 70-years-old female patient started to received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dystonia and migraines from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 antibody test positive from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medication for dystonia and migraines. The patient experienced a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; to her first dose of BNT162B2 in Feb2021. She had all-over body rash that was &#34;very red, like a tomato&#34; and showed up 35-40hours after her dose.  She states her doctor does not recommend she get the second dose. The patient meant by allergic reaction, she had a number of things, she experienced tiredness, injection site pain, joint muscle pain, she felt unwell, this all happened on the Saturday, the same day she got the vaccine on 13Feb2021. Then on Sunday 14Feb2021, all the symptoms she spoke about were still there and so she rested all day. On 15Feb2021, she looked at her elbows, clarifying the inside of elbow, her elbow creases, and on both elbow creases the skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen down to her thigh, it was working it&#39;s way down to the knee, the color was like a beet red, tomato color,  it was under the arms, started with elbow, was at her neck. The more down the redness spread, the more it red in color it also got. When she noticed this she called the doctor. When she called the doctor, the doctor said get over to the Emergency Room right away. Her husband and her were both on the phone and were telling the doctor that she doesn&#39;t want to go to hospital,  she asked if she can just come into the doctors office. The doctor said No. He told her that needs to get special lab work done, and he needs to send her information over to the ER. He said this could do possible damage to the kidneys. The doctor said lets not forget the last time she did a blood test, which was in Nov2020, at that time she came up positive with COVID antibodies. It could have been possible that she had COVID and was asymptomatic, or she had it. The doctor said that they need to do another COVID test or it could be she had a COVID cold or a cold with antibodies, her doctor doesn&#39;t know. The fact that she had that test that came back with COVID antibodies  test but not have COVID in Nov2020 was something to consider. He was concerned may be there is more to this, or just a rash. The doctor said that he is not equipped say what it should be. The doctor said he will speak with them at the hospital. Tiredness subsided yesterday afternoon on 15Feb2021, it subsided before she went to the ER visit. Right now, it&#39;s kind of like a lasting effect because she is not feeling normal. The injection site pain was still there but not as bad. The joint muscle pain subsided this afternoon around 1 o clock. It first began a half hour after leaving the stadium and she was experiencing it while driving back home, the pain continued and got worse. When she got up on Sunday morning her whole body was in pain, she was not getting better on Sunday and that&#39;s when she sat on couch rest of the day. For red skin, with the temperature of the skin, she didn&#39;t feel it to see if it was hot or anything, it was more this feeling that its just not going away getting worse, it didn&#39;t feel hot, there was no texture on the skin either. She just noticed she was flushed red. She called the doctor first, and he said that he was sending information to the emergency room. Then she went to (name of place withheld) ER. They took her temperature, there was no fever. She was then relieved from the ER in 2.5 hours and went home. She still has redness on the skin. In the hospital, they gave her 40 mg of prednisone and an injection or Benadryl, and prescription for prednisone to take for the next 4 days while tapering down. She did take Benadryl about 2 hours ago, she did notice all the sudden she was getting itchy. She is less itchy now. With the itchiness, she just observed this about 2 hours ago. She took Benadryl, she has somewhat improved, she is still itchy but not to the point that she will scratch heavily. She does not have her COVID CDC Card at the moment, her husband has that information but he is on a conference call with a client and she cant disturb him. The patient was scheduled for a second dose on 06Mar2021. That&#39;s where she has a question, the doctor is saying that he is not sure about getting second shot. They took lab work at the hospital and said everything was fine except for white blood cell count, it was on the lower side in Feb2021. She has had no vaccines on the same day or in the 4 weeks prior. She hasn&#39;t had any vaccines. She did have to visit the emergency room. She only called the doctors office, the doctor said not to come in and go tot he ER. She has No relevant family medical history that she would like to share.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

The next day I felt tired, foggy brain, and dizzy.  Assumed it was from the shot.  Side effects continued/worsened.  4/6/21 I saw my Dr.  She checked me over, labs. found nothing wrong with me.  Likely side effects from Pfizer.  Unlikely that they would last two weeks.  Rx Meclizine for dizziness, which didn&#39;t really help.  Now it&#39;s Day 15.  Tired and brain fog are gone.  I don&#39;t feel as dizzy.  BUT, when I try to drive, I feel QUITE dizzy with blurred vision.  This side effect persists and clearly effects my quality of life.

                                                On the morning of Friday 4/16/21, patient came to vaccine clinic to let us know that his wife passed away the night of her second dose of her Pfizer covid vaccine. He states that she complained of arm pain at the injection site that evening (4/14/21) and went to bed around 9:30pm because the pain was excruciating. He said around 2:00am, she woke up stating she couldn&#39;t breathe. This has happened before, so she went and sat up in the living room which helped her last time. For whatever reason, she then went into her bedroom where he said she fell out. He noticed foam coming from her mouth and called 911. EMS was unable to revive her. She passed away at home.

When I woke up on 1/13/21, I was very sick.  I felt like I had a severe, very bad, horrible flu.  I didn&#39;t get out of bed until 5pm that evening.  No fever.  No body or joint aches.  Just extreme, overwhelming fatigue and feeling flu-y.  This phase lasted about 24 hours.  (my right am also hurt, but that was minor) I have a severe case of Sjogrens, a systemic autoimmune disorder.  My most debilitating Sjogrens symptom is overwhelming fatigue.  If I weren&#39;t retired, I would be qualified as disabled.  Handicapped tag, etc.   Since the vaccination, my Sjogrens has &#34;flared.&#34;  I feel terrible, exhausted, can&#39;t do anything. I have cancelled everything.  All I can do is sleep, and feed the cat.  I am directly connecting this Sjogrens flare to the vaccine.  When I&#39;m in a flare this bad, I usually take a course of prednisone.  I have not done this because I don&#39;t want to modulate my immune system while it is building covid antibodies.    I can&#39;t wait for the 2nd vaccine on 2/2/21!

On my way home at 25 minutes post injection I had an over-all body wave-type feeling (somewhat similar to a sustained hot-flash) and over-all disconcertingly odd feeling. This lasted about 4 minutes and was followed by shakiness that lasted about 5 minutes (total time a bit less than 10 minutes). Took my bp, pulse, O2 as soon as I got home (approximately 5 minutes post symptoms) and the readings were fine.

Tried to push fluids and tried to just eat bland foods.  Would wake up sporadically but was unable to awaken enough to watch an entire TV show. Pretty lethargic and brain fog.  Was able to wake up a little more on Wed 1/20 but still had the queasy stomach.  Started getting Headache and Eye pain and severe upper leg  and lower back burning &amp; cramping, I tried taking tylenol which helped a little.  By Thursday  the pain was worse.  I was still tired  only walking helped the pain. It got worse if I sat down and extremely bad if I laid down to try to sleep. It&#39;s Friday morning &amp; I am planning to go to med check this AM.  Symptoms still ongoing

Probably after 8AM I took my temp and I had a fever (102F) for about 10 hours. Started aching all over, joint and muscle aches, I also had headache (took Motrin and headache went away),  no pain at the injection site. Almost like I had flu symptoms. I felt miserable all day but next day when I woke up I was fine. Went to work as normal the next day. I forgot to state I had COVID in March 2020 and the symptoms I had felt very much like it.

A 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9269), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at 10:40 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization, ibuprofen (manufactured by other company, strength: 200 mg, lot number: 7AE1784B, expiry date: Nov2018), oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 400 mg, as needed for an unspecified indication, hydrochlorothiazide (strength: 25 mg), oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 25 mg, once a day (about 8am) for high blood pressure, and valsartan (strength: 160 mg, expiration date: 11Nov2021), oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 160 mg, once a day (about 8am) for high blood pressure. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took flu shot about 15-20 years ago for immunization and experienced swelling. On 03Feb2021, patient received the vaccine.

She had a cup of coffee this morning and not a lot of water, so she started drinking water and had 3 bottles. After the heat passed she noticed a feeling of needing to swallow and figured out it was just a knee jerk reaction to make sure she can swallow. She is still having the swallowing and is continuing to drink water even at home. She also congested head, head felt congested, but not like pressure. She does not get headaches so she guesses she is getting this instead of a headache. She noticed her fingertips feel a little numb and tingling, but overall feels okay. She mentioned that on an unspecified date, she just got this nervous feeling and had allergic reaction to bee sting. Mentioned that her husband and brother in law got the shot and were feeling fine.

Took BP meds (.5 mg Ramipril and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide). Waited 15 minutes and BP was 167/101. Waited another 15 minutes and BP was 149/91. Saw doctors PA in the afternoon, BP was 162/81.  PA administered EKG, blood work, and spent a significant amount of time listening to heart, lungs and carotid arteries. Everything was in normal range except sugars, but an A1C test was normal.  PA said to take an extra Ramipril at night and track BP at home for 7 days.  BP went down each day and on  2/26 was in normal range. However, after 7 days, she said to permanently stay on the evening addition of Ramipril.

                                                This patient developed a severe, multisystem inflammatory syndrome after covid vaccination that necessitated hospitalization for 6 days. It involved skin (rash), liver (elevated bilirubin and asT/alt), bone marrow (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), cns (hallucinations, visual disturbance), and musculoskeletal system (synovitis).

Taken by ambulance to medical center.  On route,  ambulance stopped and another team came in. I was given epinephrine, zofran, Benadryl, and maybe a steroid? Not sure.  When I arrived at hospital, t think I was given dexamethasone and famotidine.  I was barely awake but could speak. Could not hold anything. After several hours, they woke me up, I felt myself again, and I was discharged.  Following days I felt exhausted and dizzy, and had a headache. Took prednisone for five days.

                                                The patient initially presented (3/3/21) with headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, malaise. Patient related she was in her normal state of health and only started to feel poorly after she received her second COVID-19 vaccination three days earlier.  She interestingly related that after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination she had significant burning in her stomach that she noted but no other major symptoms and notably did not experience this severe burning in her stomach after the second dose. She denied any chest pain, current dyspnea, productive cough, sore throat, urinary symptoms, sick contacts.  She has no history of C. difficile, no recent antibiotics, no recent spoiled foods, no recent travel, no history of radiation.  She does have a history of GERD and has had gastritis with mild gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and undergone EGD negative for H. pylori infection.  She also has undergone colonoscopies with polyps that have been removed and reported as tubular adenomas.  As her hospitalization progressed, she was diagnosed with Severe Sepsis due to E. Coli bacteremia in setting of liver abscess, Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Transaminitis (which resolved). Patient was appropriately treated for these conditions. Also, her known uncontrolled diabetes was treated. Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake. Difficult to state definitively any relation to COVID-19 vaccination, though may have resulted from associated dehydration.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 71-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 10Apr2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS), tamsulosin, and iron. The patient got her first injection on Saturday, 10Apr2021 at 1:30 pm in the afternoon around 7 o&#39;clock the same day she started to itch, it was mild across her breast and stomach but her thighs and bottom legs were turning red, swelling, hives there too, and she rubbed alcohol (treatment) on this to stop the itch, that seems to helped a little bit, but the swelling was not that bad today but the redness was still there. She has scabs on her, blood was coming through, and slight bee stings all over and thigh on an unspecified date, she used hydrocortisone cream (treatment), she was lucky she have some of that here because she keep that when going or here but she rubbed that on last night and that was the only way that she was able to get some sleep. The patient doesn&#39;t think that she was going to get the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to experience that again. It feels like that today it was not that bad itching today but at 71 that was miserable yesterday so probably she would not get the second shot. She hopes that the first one can protect her to a point, but she cannot subject herself to that again, that would be senseless for her to experience that again and get a second shot. The patient also stated that her eyelids have been a little itchy too so hopefully you all understand it was 71 years old was suffering from that kind of misery second time. The patient was unable to probe the more question, patient was in pain and not willing to proceed. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Feb2021 at 15:00 (at the age of 71-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago, obesity, asthma with bronchitis as a child, allergy to other medications, anaphylactic reaction to sulfas twenty years ago (also reported as 50 years ago), muscle hurt/sore arm usually when she got a flu vaccine (unspecified) once a year, allergies to makeup and clothes (diagnosed at least 50 years ago), heart beats fast, low thyroid and borderline high cholesterol. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for 30 years for low thyroid, nebivolol hydrochloride (BYSTOLIC) taken for 25 years, rosuvastatin calcium, (CRESTOR OD) taken for 2 years for borderline high cholesterol and insulin (unspecified). The patient did not receive any other vaccinations on the same day or within 4 weeks of the vaccine. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) as pre-medication since she had allergic reactions to some things and would get this before the flu shot; as well as salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA) for runny nose and coughing. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 28Feb2021, and &#34;they&#34; wanted to give her diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) after the vaccine but could not since she was driving. After the vaccination, the patient was not feeling well for 2 days (as of an unspecified date) and thought she was getting better. On 28Feb2021, the patient experienced anxiety. She was more anxious when &#34;that stuff&#34; appeared on the news on day 4 and 5 after the vaccine. She took a small dose of clonazepam 0.5 mg, dividing the pill in 4 pieces as she never took the whole thing. She took it when she got extremely anxious and tried not to take it because it can be habit forming. She may take it 3 times a week or in the middle of the night. It helped a little bit, but she still felt panicky and upset. She woke up feeling anxious. She did not normally take these medications. The patient reported that she experienced headache (constantly several times a week) and left arm sore at injection site, itchiness/ itching all over body (not constant but still happening) from 28Feb2021. On Mar2021 (day 4), the patient experienced dizziness (comes and goes and was not constant like it was), was very exhausted, nausea (tapered off after 2 weeks), diarrhea, some cramping in stomach, brain fog (still struggling and forgets to take her insulin, not as bad as when she first noticed), body aches. At first, the body aches were a pain in the left knee and left elbow and then moved to various joints and muscles.

She was having worsening anxiety because she had not been feeling well for so long, going on 7 weeks. She visited her physician&#39;s office 6,7, or 8 times. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included an ultrasound of the leg (did not have a blood clot), an X-Ray of the back (unknown results) and an MRI of the back (did not find anything) to determine the pain. The physician thought it might be a compression fracture, but the MRI did not show anything. The patient was tested for antibodies on 05Apr2021 and had zero antibodies. The clinical outcome of anxiety, felt panicky, neck pain was unknown; dizziness, headache, runny nose, itchiness, pain in the joints, muscle pain, back pain, fever, very exhausted, nausea, diarrhea, some cramping in stomach, brain fog, body aches, stinging pain in left leg / pain in left arm, weak feelings in arms and legs, body feels heavy, left arm sore at injection site, red circle around injection site, not feeling well,  was resolving.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 14Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Age at vaccination: 72 years old. Medical history included hypertension, infection (term highlighted by the reporter: Yes; patient was admitted to a hospital from 29Dec2020 to 30Dec2020 due to infection), dyspepsia (reported as stomach, digestion), psoriatic inflammatory arthritis (she receives infusions for her arthritis once a month), sinus infection/sinus problems a month or two months ago, had cancer back in 1996 (had lumpectomy), stomach problems, and gastric endoscopy. Ongoing concomitant medications included losartan potassium, hydrochlorothiazide, omeprazole, and methotrexate. Other concomitant medications included folic acid, and plantago ovata (METAMUCIL). The patient had a regular flu shot a month ago (Dec2020). She can&#39;t remember when. The patient experienced headache on 14Jan2021. At the beginning, she had one, but then she got home, and the headache was like in the back of her head, like in her neck. She had pain all around her neck. She was feeling dizzy. She was able to sleep, however, the pain in her head is still there. She took aspirin along with her regular medication. When providing details, the patient made the comment that she can&#39;t think straight. She also has sinus problems, so she doesn&#39;t know if she has a headache from the sinus problems or because of the shot. She doesn&#39;t have a fever. She just feels like her head is big. She sees the date of when she is supposed to return for her second vaccine, 04Feb2021. She sees the lot number and then it has (name of center). The actual dose is unknown, she knows this is her first dose. She also receives infusions for her arthritis. She receives an infusion at a facility once a month, she used to receive it less than that, but her arthritis has been really bad, so she now does it once a month. She was supposed to go today but she didn&#39;t go because she didn&#39;t feel good. She had three COVID tests done because she had the sinus situation going on. A COVID test was done yesterday (14Jan2021) and it was negative. Another one was done when she had a gastric endoscopy on 09Dec2020. This test was also negative. She doesn&#39;t remember if she had another one in Dec2020 when she was at the emergency center, but all of her COVID tests have been negative. The patient has not recovered from headache. Outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

                                                Blood pressure 170/84; lost ability to speak intelligibly; foggy; headache; scratchy throat; fatigue; Body aches; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer. A 72-year-old female received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose on 28Jan2021, 11:00 AM (lot number:EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient medical condition included right Bundle Branch Block, cardiac from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no known allergies. The patient concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and Upgraid. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in the left arm on 06Jan2021, 02:00PM (lot number: EL3249) at the age of 72 years for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested after the vaccination for covid-19. Twenty-four hours after vaccine received, on 29Jan2021 at 03:00 PM, the patient suddenly lost ability to speak intelligibly. The patient stated &#34;I was completely aware though a little &#34;foggy&#34;. Blood pressure 170/84. Friend present thought I was having a TIA and called 911. Ambulance came.  Within 25 minutes, my ability to speak returned slowly. By the time I got to the ER, (45 minutes after onset), my ability to speak had mostly returned.&#34; Many blood labs were drawn, CT of head done, MRI of head done. EKG done. No cause of incident or evidence of TIA seen. After 5 hours, the patient was discharged with orders to come back if symptoms reoccurred. The patient had a headache, scratchy throat, fatigue and body aches in 2021. Since then the patient had a variety of tests, labs and Dr. visits. Blood pressure has been higher than her normal of 120/80, at intervals during the day in 2021. Since no evidence of TIA has been found, the patient was wondering if there have been any other reports of this loss of speaking ability (aphasia) occurring with any other vaccine recipients. The patient received treatment for the events. The consumer considered the events as non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                On 2/2/21 I developed chest pressure and irregular heart beat at 4:00 pm.  Went to ER and it spontaneously resolved while staff was telling me how they would treat it.  Gave me Metoprolol 5 mg IV with 500 IV fluids and discharged.  Then on 2/6/21 I slept poorly and felt very jittery and had more chest pressure but pulse was regular.  then on 2/8/21 at 6:00 am I awoke and felt terrible with chest pressure.  Took my blood pressure at home and it was  193/103, and I was very shaky.  Went to  ER where they did blood work, X-ray, and monitored my heart and blood pressure for 4 hrs.  Gradually my blood pressure came down, and my blood work and X-ray probed to be WNL.  I was discharged without medication change but had echocardiogram scheduled and follow-up  appt. with Cardiologist, on  zoom.  He started me on Flecainide 100 mg bid, and stress test on  2/24/21 and follow-up appt. with him on 3/3/21.  I also had a follow-up appt. with my GP the day after the first ER visit and she ordered more labs, and the echocardiogram.  I have continued to have feelings of fluttering and pressure in my chest off and on and they continued after my second vaccine.  But my heart has remained regular since starting the Flecainide.  But my blood pressure went up to 150/85 on 2/9/21 and again to 142/81 on 2/10/21 both times with feelings of jitteriness and pressure in my chest.

                                                feeling weak; shaky; fever, 100.4; her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever; her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever; arm was a little sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of 2 reports.  A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at the right upper arm close to the shoulder on 02Feb2021 07:30 at single dose as she doesn&#39;t want to get COVID again or give COVID to anyone else. Medical history included metabolic syndrome from 1994 and ongoing, it all started when she was 46 and it runs in her family and it was a genetic thing; ongoing diabetes mellitus, was diagnosed when she was 65, so 7 years ago; she had COVID in Nov2020 but it was just a very mild case and she just had a cough; and cardio artery problems. She takes a lot of medications and she has metabolic syndrome which includes cardio artery problems and diabetes, but she has taken all of those medications for a long time. The patient says she was calling to report a couple little concerns she has. She received her shot on Tuesday, 02Feb2021 at about 7:30 in morning and her arm started at about 2 to 3 in the afternoon and she noticed it was getting sore, but it was no big deal, she did not think anything of it, and on the second day she thought that was it and she was over it on 03Feb2021. She states her husband also mentioned that he had soreness in his arm after his vaccination. She says at three in the afternoon on 03Feb2021, she started feeling weak and shaky, but she didn&#39;t think much of that. She says this began around 3 to 4 when yesterday afternoon, 03Feb2021, she had a fever. She says she took her temperature and it was 100.4 and that all kind of was gone by the evening but when she woke up this morning, she was weak and shaky again. Today she got up and was weak and shaky and it never left, she was still weak and shaky. The patient mentions that she was diabetic so she can get weak and shaky when she needs to eat something, but she had just eaten, and she ate yesterday so she doesn&#39;t think it was caused by that. The patient says she thinks we should know that she was diabetic. She says then she could tell that she had a fever, so she took her temperature and it was 100.4 which for her was high. She states she didn&#39;t even have a fever when she had COVID. The fever began yesterday afternoon (03Feb2021). She says her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever and they felt that way so that&#39;s why she took her temperature. This was the highest it has been in years. She says last night she took her temperature again and the fever had gone away in 30 to 40 minutes, so she thought it was over. She took her temperature again before she called this morning, 04Feb2021 and it was 99.2, which was still a little hot for her. She says for her that&#39;s a fever. She was 96 and 97 usually. The patient says she still feels like she has a little fever. She was not someone who usually has a fever and it can be just a little bit of a fever for instance like this morning when she was 99.2. Her eyes were still feeling funny and burning this morning and that was why she took her temperature this morning. The outcome of the event arm was a little sore was recovered on 03Feb2021; feeling weak and shaky was not recovered; fever and her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021162089 Same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

A 72-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), at the age of 72-years-old , via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 31Mar2021 11:40 am as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing food allergy, she had anaphylactic shock from a food allergy (she was 40 at the time and she doesn&#39;t eat anything she is allergic to), sinus infection and then got horrible hives under her eyes. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Concomitant medication was eye drops every night. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient previously took epipen had two episodes when she was 40. She is bad about carrying her EpiPen, she forgets it. She was allergic to Amoxicillin. At 11:40 am last Wednesday patient had the vaccine, and around 4 or 5 pm, her heart started pounding for 10 seconds, and it felt like forever. An hour later, her heart started pounding again. It happened twice an hour apart and the second time lasted longer. It described as hard pounding. It started at 4 or 5 pm and then for 4.5 hours there was nothing, but then her heart started racing. At around 4 or 5 pm her heart was pounding, than around 9:30 pm her heart started racing and beating fast, she could feel it. She lives in a rural community and her husband called the local fire station and asked if he could take her there, to the station, so that she could have her heart checked. She was hooked up to a monitor and the paramedics said that she had an irregular arrhythmia and needed to go to the hospital by ambulance. Her heart rate was 115 to 130 beats, then 140 beats, at the hospital. It was about 11pm when she was evaluated and then left in the ambulance, as she was 45 minutes from the hospital. The paramedics would have, the arrhythmia, on record and that 5 minutes before she got to the hospital, the paramedic said her heart rhythm was normal. She was not admitted to the hospital, but held in observation and left the hospital at 4:30 in the morning. She hasn&#39;t felt anything after that. it was only one time she thought her heart was going faster, after that, but it didn&#39;t happen again. It is currently no problem and even at the hospital, the heart racing stopped and it was normal. The doctor in the emergency room said she was totally normal. Her arm was barely sore, when touched, and noticed this when she was being helped to the bathroom in the emergency room, maybe later in the afternoon, it was not hurting. But she didn&#39;t have any other events. She was tired the next day on 01Apr2021. She was up all night in the emergency room. people say that one will be tired, as an effect, but she can&#39;t say that it is because of the vaccine, or if she only had 3 hours of sleep. She hasn&#39;t been sleeping but she can&#39;t attribute it to the vaccine. She can&#39;t attribute this to the vaccine, that she has been tired lately and not sleeping. Event outcome of irregular arrhythmia and Heart racing, described as irregular arrhythmia/Heart pounding, hard pounding was recovered on 31Mar2021, of Arm barely sore was recovered on 02Apr2021, of the remaining was unknown.

                                                Vomiting; Diarrhea; lost alot of weight; diverticulitis; brain fog, can&#39;t think clearly; stomach pains; violently ill; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39; medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced vomiting and diarrhea. Mostly diarrhea. The vomiting started 05Mar2021 in the middle of the night. She was vomiting so much she went to the Emergency room by ambulance. They kept her in the hospital for a couple of days, but she did not have diarrhea at this time. It was like three days later that she suddenly became violently ill. At the time she did not tie it to the vaccine administration, she thought she had food poisoning or something. She then had severe diarrhea. She cannot recall the exact onset date of when the diarrhea began. She can&#39;t get the dates together because she knows she became very sick. Patient recalls that when she got out of the hospital, she was having stomach pains. The stomach pains were feeling more severe on 18Mar2021. On 19Mar2021, she went to a check up with her gynecologist for an annual check up and did tell her gynecologist about the stomach pain and having a lot of stomach issues, but the doctor had no idea about it, she&#39;s a gynecologist. The patient&#39;s gastroenterologist thought maybe she had diverticulitis not related to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and on 27Mar2021, they started her on Cipro and Flagyl, but the diarrhea just kept getting worse even with the meds and its just been getting worse and worse and worse. Cipro and Flagyl were stopped after 5 days because her gastroenterologist told her that maybe all of her flora was cleared out, and the flora was causing the diarrhea. No one knows what was causing her diarrhea.  Oddly enough, she was feeling a little better today. She feels like she doesn&#39;t have diarrhea today, but she doesn&#39;t know because sometimes she has diarrhea for a couple of hours and then she feels just fine for a couple of hours. She also has brain fog. She was feeling like she could not think straight. She confirmed she does not have this feeling today. It got really bad after the second shot. The brain fog started between the time of first and second shot, when she had the diarrhea. It was like a week to ten days after the first shot, but she does not know exactly when brain fog started. It comes and goes, doesn&#39;t have it right now, and didn&#39;t have it yesterday. She stated that the brain fog seems to have gone away about 5 days ago. She had all these blood tests and cat scan and they all came back negative that she is in perfect health. She has no other issue except this constant diarrhea. Caller states she doesn&#39;t have any issues with any of her abdominal organs, her gall bladder and intestines are all fine. She has lost 5 pounds explaining that a month ago she weighed 136 pounds and now she weighs 130 pounds. The diarrhea is without any known medical known ideology and is very debilitating because she has lost a lot of weight. The outcome of events was reported as &#34;unknown&#34;.  Follow-up attempts are completed. The following information on the batch number has been requested.

                                                Started with join pain for a few days, started taking one Aleve a day. The muscles became extremely sore. Joint pain increased, involving shoulders, hands, legs, arms, knees and hips. Left hand began swelling on January 23rd and continued so I could no longer see my knuckles and it ballooned and it was hot and very painful. The knees were so bad it was almost impossible to stand from a sitting position and walking was stiff. Could not sleep laying down because pain in shoulders and knees would increase.   I went to the doctor on the 26th.   he prescribed Prednisolone for one week and I am scheduled to see him next Tuesday February 2nd.

A 73-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: SL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 12Jan2021 at 10:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took varicella zoster vaccine (SHINGLES VACCINE) for immunization and had a little reaction but just the normal things. On Tuesday morning, the patient got the COVID-19 shot and was fine. This morning (15Jan2021), the patient was not feeling great, has a slight headache, her breathing is heavier, and below her breast line is a tightness she can&#39;t really describe. The patient asked if these were a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine and wondering if this is normal. As a treatment for the events, the patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient asked if she can or should get a test, a COVID-19 test. It has been so many days since having the vaccine, 4 days later, she is wondering if she might have COVID-19. The patient isn&#39;t sure and is just asking a question. It is confirmed that she has not had a test or tested positive for COVID-19. The outcome of &#34;Not feeling great&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

A 73-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 10Jan2021 and didn&#39;t have a reaction, but had a slight pain in her arm on 10Jan2021. Her sore arm started on 11Jan2021. There was a sore spot and when she would pick up her arm it was sore and achy. No pain, but sore and achy. It lasted for a day or two. She didn&#39;t have any symptoms until Saturday the 16Jan2021, this past Saturday she thought she was dying. She had chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and had a headache. She thought she was losing her mind. The headache just stopped today. She had the chills that would not stop and she thinks she broke the sweat on Sunday (17Jan2021). She had a little nausea and couldn&#39;t eat anything on 16Jan2021. She had a terrible headache, which just stopped about 2 hours ago. She stated she must have to take 10 Tylenol over the course of time, every 4 hours. On Saturday 16Jan2021 she was just laying on the floor in pain. She was not even eating, just drinking water. All of her symptoms stopped this morning around 5 AM (18Jan2021). She had a big sweat. She is unsure if she had a fever because she does not have a thermometer. She is unsure if she has recovered completely from these symptoms. She feels weak, and is still weak (on Jan2021). She cannot go out or get dressed or shower. She is not strong enough. She is just sitting up now, no longer laying in bed. She couldn&#39;t walk (on Jan2021) and was afraid she was going to faint on 16Jan2021. She can walk a little bit now and feels a little bit better. She has been out of it for three days, She hasn&#39;t felt good. She asked if side effects can appear 6 days later? Is this normal to have a reaction 1 week after getting it? She asked are the side effects worse after the second dose? She asked is this Covid or side effects, what are the COVID symptoms? She asked should she take the second one if she had these side effects? Caller clarifies this is the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Whoever vaccinated her did not give her the paper about it afterwards. Her neighbor brought it to her cause they went together. She did not realize she could experience these things. She did not expect them a week after getting the vaccine. She thought she had COVID. She asks, &#34;do you think I have COVID?&#34; She is just now getting better and it has been 3 days of experiencing these symptoms. Should she get the second vaccine? She is trying to do the right thing. Event outcome of chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and headache was recovered on 18Jan2021, for was going to faint and couldn&#39;t walk was recovering, for weak was not recovered, while for others was unknown.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fever, being ill (deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks) and bug bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient is the type of person that takes a lot for her to take medications. She is allergic to a lot of things; she always has crazy reactions. She can&#39;t take morphine. It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn&#39;t think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn&#39;t breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can&#39;t describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn&#39;t drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn&#39;t take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn&#39;t like it. It wasn&#39;t like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, &#34;what is this Parkinson&#39;s?&#34;. She doesn&#39;t even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn&#39;t debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it&#39;s like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can&#39;t even think of what that area is, but it&#39;s the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don&#39;t atrophy or won&#39;t pull. She hasn&#39;t told anybody about it. She doesn&#39;t like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn&#39;t figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her &#34;brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep.&#34; On Monday she experienced, &#34;horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band.&#34; Stated that it wasn&#39;t a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of gas (flatulence), muscles became tight/contort, minor nausea, horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band and shingles. The outcome of the event &#39;the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot&#39; was not recovered while of the rest of the events was unknown.

                                                When I cough it was blood in that cough couple of times; Left leg swell up from my feet to all the way up; When I woke up, I didn&#39;t know what time, what date, nothing; I was all confused; Feeling achy/ body ache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer COVID vaccine), lot no. EL347, via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a health department because she was at high risk and she was 73. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient had an injection done 2 weeks, not this last Friday, the Friday before that. They had to make her wait for half an hour before she left and she was okay. Then Saturday (23Jan2021), she started feeling achy but to she was okay. Then Sunday (24Jan2021), she had a very bad experience, she went and start watching TV and she fell asleep. When she woke up, she didn&#39;t know what time, what date, nothing. And she looked at the time on her TV and it said 6:45, she didn&#39;t know if it was am or pm. And it was dark outside and she didn&#39;t know if it was Monday or Sunday. She was all confused, she called someone to make sure what day and time and all and still she was still confused. And then she had to call her aunt and then she told her no it&#39;s Sunday and it&#39;s night time and so on. Then she got better. Then during the week she didn&#39;t have that much body ache, she expected that because that was in that papers. Then today is Sunday, Friday morning (29Jan2021) she got up and she coughed, when she coughed it was blood in that cough couple of times. Then her daughter came over and took her to the hospital (hospitalization details were not clarified). She had lab work the day they took her in the emergency room. At the hospital, they did all kind of tests, on top of that her leg, her left leg swelled up from her feet to all the way up, all the way up. They thought that it could have been some blood clot. And they took test and all and nothing, everything was okay. They couldn&#39;t find out why her whole leg was swollen. On top of that, they did chest x-ray and they did something else she can&#39;t remember, another test. And they took all kind of blood work and all. And they did to see if she had the virus, the COVID. And yesterday they called her from the hospital and they said that she didn&#39;t have the virus. And she asked them about the blood work and they told her if there was anything more than they would call her. So, she thinks all this came from that injection. She called because this was not guaranteed if this was from injection. When confirmed that COVID test was negative and blood work report was not out, she stated they haven&#39;t called her that meant her blood work was okay. The swollen leg has been gone down and blood once in a while she sees a little bit. They gave her 2 prescriptions, one was antibiotic and one is steroid. Due date for the next shot is 12Feb2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 73-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP7533), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 07Apr2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included breast cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2 on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 73-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced Sore arm and feeling blah. Clinical course was as follows: She spent 50 years in neurology and neuroscience, she was a crazy RN that did neurology right out of school, she was recommended for that specialty. She is not sure if she had a reaction to the vaccine or if it is just her. Her 2nd dose was last Wednesday, 07Apr2021. She had a sore arm and felt blah. Just like after the 1st shot. On Saturday night (10Apr2021) at 0200, she was awakened with chills, cold sweat, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. She was sick as a dog for 2 days and didn&#39;t eat or drink much of anything. She went to the doctor who sent her to an infusion center. She is down to 5&#39; 2&#34; and weighed too much. She has not been able to lose weight for a couple years. She gained 40 pounds when she turned 50 years old. After the shot, she had a sore arm and felt blah like she did after the first dose, but she thought everyone felt that way. She missed a day of gym class because of her really sore arm. This got better like after a flu shot, it was nothing. This time she had a really sore arm and felt blah after the shot but then on Saturday morning this whole thing started happening. She woke up very restless, was all sweaty, cold, dizzy and was too miserable to try and take her blood pressure. Her blood pressure tends to run low. Her symptoms of the sore arm resolved at 06:00 Saturday (08Apr2021). She had nausea and vomiting and couldn&#39;t eat or drink. That lasted through Monday morning. She had some back pain with this, but she has back pain normally as she is a little old lady. She had a scheduled Oncology appointment Monday, as did her husband. She experienced orthostatic dizziness. She woke up plain dizzy. Her doctor gave her a liter of fluids and it helped her. This was something that needed to be addressed. It was serious. It was all serious. She had nothing left to vomit. She is an old lady with Breast Cancer. Her creatinine level of 1.10 which dropped her GFR of 52, she calculated the GFR using a computer program. This is what lead to the doctor giving her a liter of fluid. She had an appointment scheduled and her doctor sent her to the infusion centers for a liter of D5NS. She was sent home afterwards and encouraged to drink fluids. She also had a CBC and chemistry panel with her blood work. She was worried because her skin was tenting badly, and she couldn&#39;t keep anything down. She was probably dehydrated. Her blood pressure at the doctor&#39;s office was 82/50. She didn&#39;t care that her skin was tenting. She has been drinking a lot of fluids as advised after her liter of fluids at the infusion center. She is interested in researching the MRNA process because it is used it in other things. The way the vaccine was developed, it should have dissipated after 48 hours. She likes to research everything. She and her husband experienced a year from Hell starting in August of last year. All events are considered serious. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatinine: 1.10 and blood pressure measurement: 82/50 on 12Apr2021, blood test, full blood count and investigation with unknown results and glomerular filtration rate: 52 on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events chills and cold sweat was recovered on 12Apr2021, skin tenting and orthostatic dizziness was recovered on 13Apr2021, vomiting and nausea was recovered on 14Apr2021, pain in arm was recovered on 10Apr2021, feeling abnormal was recovered on an unspecified date, while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a temporal association and the known drug safety profile, the reported events are considered possibly related to BNT162B2.

Also add headache could not hardly stand to lay my head on the pillow. About 4 AM I could not tolerate the situation any longer and took 600 mg of Tylenol. After that was able to rest some. The next day after the vaccination my joints were achy moderately and I have a headache. The injection site was tender to the touch and arm range of motion decreased and arm sore. Took 400 ibuprofen about 4 PM day after injection to ease Reactions

By evening head movement was very difficult, I could not sleep in bed that night. I slept on the couch sitting up trying to immobilize head. During the night pain spread into the base of my skull. I applied heat to help relieve the pain and tightness. On 01/20/21 the pain (6 of 10) spread into the left side of neck and skull, it became difficult to eat, swallow and to get up from couch. I tried to sit motionless most of the day. On 01/21/21 the pain (6 of !0) moved down into my left rear shoulder, I continued to apply heat and immobilize sitting on couch, eating and swallowing still difficult. On 01/22/21 pain in neck and base of Additional information for Item 18:  skull subside to level 5, movement of head still difficult, able to to get up and move slowly. Could not lift head to drink, still needed to use straw. Slept on couch again this night. On 01/23/21 pain still subsiding to level 4, head movement still difficult, still needed straw to drink, slept on couch again. On 01/24/21 pain continuing to subside to level 3, head movement still difficult, still needed straw to drink, slept on couch again. On 01/25/21 conditions unchanged. On 1/26/21 pain subsided to level 2, head movement stiff but not difficult, swallowing less difficult but still need straw to drink. Slept in bed for first time since 01/19/21. On 01/27/21 pain continued to subside to level 1, head movement improved but still limited, still need straw to drink, able to move around more freely but still not normal. Improvement is slow but I hope to be back to normal in a few days. I am concerned that my second vaccination may cause a more severe reaction, please have someone call or contact me so I can discuss this issue.

I was not dizzy-by definition but vertiginous -trying to turn over in bed made my head feel like it was spinning. I think this is much more common than reported. As a physician in the community people frequently reach out to me for advice and I  have been told several times about serious  vertigo in elderly people with new onset after Covid immunization.  I have no intention to delay or abort my second dose. My only current symptoms is fuzzy headedness that is sporadic. The elderly might need to be warned about this and advised accordingly-re not to drive etc. i am former physician and after TNTC immunizations in the past this was unique.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had her first COVID19 vaccine dose. Immediately, on 16Jan2021, she felt very cold and unwell. She also experienced dizziness, headache that started right after the shot, extreme fatigue that started later in the day and fogginess that started right after the shot. Strong chills was not going away almost like a feeling of ice in her veins. She is taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for these. The events were not improving. She was just surprised, she was ok with a day&#39;s worth, but it was hanging on dizziness (not enough to fall down), but she has to hold onto a rail to go upstairs which was not normal. She doesn&#39;t feel like she is real anchored. Headache was described as very bad and is not changing. Foggy brain was described as she was not able to focus very well. She was not able to get work done on Jan2021 due to extreme fatigue and foggy brain. She also experienced arm ache at the site on 06Jan2021 for which the patient expected. It is reducing some, the ache is not as bad as it was while the other things seem to be growing and it is still there. She had to be set aside when she took the shot, because she had these reactions after she got the shot. She had to be watched because of her almost immediate reactions. The patient wants an advice on what to do now, if there is any help for the side effects, and if this will go away. It was very disturbing and interfering with ability to do work. Outcome of the vaccination site pain was recovering while of the remaining events was not recovered.

A 74-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 20Jan2021 at 9:30-9:45 am at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included exposure to radiation from 2017 to an unknown date and did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017). There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included two doses of shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) for Immunization and experienced shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain after the vaccine. The patient experienced bad headache (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, Severe shaking chills (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, muscles and joints ached (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, couldn&#39;t hold a cup to drink on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, painful bilateral lower back pain on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, cough/dry cough on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of not recovered (reported as worsened), strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, taste started to diminish on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, pharangitis on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, couldn&#39;t get warm on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the patient received the COVIED in the morning of 20Jan2021. By 5pm she had developed a headache, severe shaking, chills, muscle and joints pain, severe lower back pain, and a dry cough; she was miserable. A few years ago after her double dosing of the shingles vaccine she had a similar reaction of shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain. She has no product details for that product, no NDC, Lot, or expiry to provide. The patient confirmed that the shingles shot was 2 doses, not a double dose given at one time. When asked a seriousness criteria it was explained that the symptoms that started on the 20th, she felt they were disabling. She couldn&#39;t get warm, stop shaking, couldn&#39;t hold a cup and the pain was severe and she has high tolerance for pain. By around 3pm that day on the 21Jan2021 everything but the dry cough had resolved, and that had gotten worse. She also developed new symptoms. She had strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic and her sense of taste started to diminish. She did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017, She has no product information, NDC, Lot or Expiry for that radiation but after that she did have taste, some of it did come back. On the 21Jan2021, it was less, the sense of taste and now today she has no taste at all. For the muscle and joint pain she took Aleve. She was told if she was feeling worse over the weekend to go to the ER or urgent care. The patient was wondering and thinking this was her normal response to the vaccine just like she had a normal response that shingles vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reported muscle tightness up through her left shoulder into her neck. She was extremely anxious. Her initial blood pressure was 190/100. She reported being extremely scared of coming to the clinic today for the vaccine and that she got no sleep the night before. We talked extensively and I tried to get her mind thinking about anything else possible. Repeated her BP after a time and it was 142/82. Once her required 15 minute observation was over, she requested to leave, because  part of her apprehension was just being there. Her neck tightness has subsided.

A 74-years-old female patient received BNT162B2, dose 2, via intramuscular, administered in right arm on 16Mar2021 10:00 AM (Lot Number: EN6204; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility type was hospital. Medical history included eczema from 2017, she had eczema all over her back and arms and had mild allergies to mold and juniper. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 74-year-old on 23Feb2021 at 10:00AM (lot number: EN6198, Expiry: Jun2021) intramuscular injection in left arm and experienced pain at injection site and couldn&#39;t sleep. The patient also took Prolia shots for arthritis. The patient experienced headache, nausea, pain at injection site and hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold on 16Mar2021, passed out, weakness and disorientation when walking on 17Mar2021, a little tired on 18Mar2021. The clinical course included: The patient was calling about the second vaccine that she got on 16Mar2021 (Tuesday). She was calling about the after effects. They were quite huge. She had a headache, nausea, weakness, and disorientation when walking. Stated she obviously had pain at the site of injection. Stated some of it was her own fault, and at first she felt fine. On the same day that she got her second dose of the covid vaccine, she had a glass of wine and was not too hungry. She ate a little that evening. The next morning she passed out. Clarified that she had two glasses of wine, not one. Caller&#39;s daughter was a doctor. Caller referd to her daughter as doctor daughter. Stated that she told her daughter about what happened. Her daughter told her it was because she was dehydrated. Her daughter told her that it was called vagus something or another. Her daughter was not there with the caller. Her daughter called it vagus something, she does not remember. Her daughter told her that it had to do with inflammation and her immune system. Caller stated she also has arthritis. Her daughter told her that she was stupid for drinking wine after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine and not eating a full meal. Whenever she passed out and fell, she did not hurt herself but it was a wake up call. She realized she was vulnerable. She was calling because she did not know why no one told her to drink a lot of water after receiving the vaccine. She got a Prolia shot in July and the nurses told her to drink a lot of water. She was asking why the nurses who gave her the covid vaccine are not saying that to people. Her daughter told her to call the doctors office about this, and she told her daughter that it was over with now, she&#39;s 95%, she was a little tired on 18Mar2021. She was unconscious for 15 seconds per her husband. Her husband was shouting her name, and she did not hear anything. She wanted to call and report that the nurses should tell people to drink water. One more thing, her daughter told her that the covid vaccine was slowly released. About 10 hours after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold. She got the vaccine about 10AM, and about 10PM at night is whenever her hand got cold. She had pain at the injection site where she had the first dose of the vaccine too. She had more pain at injection site after the second dose of the vaccine. It was not awful, but only if she pressed on it. Clarified that she gets Prolia shots twice a year for her arthritis. Luckily whenever she started to get dizzy, she braced her self, whenever she fell, she did not fall from an upright position. She was crouched over, and fell against trays that fell with her. Her doctor daughter told her that inflammation was because of her immune system. One other thing was that she has been stung in the past and had extreme reactions from yellow jackets in the 90&#39;s. She thought her immune system was sensitive. One other things related to her autoimmune from 3 years ago. She moved to a city in 2012. Everyone told her after 5 years she would develop allergies. In 2017, she had eczema all over her back and arms. It was not just like a topical thing where she scratched and itched, it was under her skin. She went to a dermatologist and he took a biopsy, but the results just said eczema. She went to an allergist, he finally found a space on her underarms where he could do a test. The test showed that she had mild allergies to mold and juniper. Juniper is a tree that they have there, she has one in her back yard. Her allergy was very mild. She tried everything, and in 4 months it went away. Now she just latherers her skin with coconut oil. Her diagnosis that this autoimmune issue was related her immune response from the yellow jacket reaction is a self diagnosis. A doctor had never told her this, this was coming from her own self. Clarified that she is calling about the second dose of the pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Headache: It was not a bad headache, it was more like pressure all across the top. Whenever she went to sleep, the headache started. She got the second dose of the covid vaccine on 16Mar2021. She had a little bit of a headache this morning. A cup of coffee with milk made it better. Nausea: It started whenever she did not want to eat dinner. She could tell her stomach was not right. The nausea and headache started together about 12 hours after her vaccine at 10:00 PM. Weakness: She noticed weakness on the next day whenever she got up to use the bathroom. Clarified as the early morning of 17Mar2021. Her weakness was about 90 percent resolved.

Second dose: pain at injection site: The pain only lasted for about 2-3 hours. It was now absolutely minimal. She would have to press on it to feel anything. Her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold: She got the second dose of the covid vaccine around 10:00 AM, and noticed her hand was cold about 5:00 PM., about 7-8 hours later. Whenever she went to bed, she was cold. She thought that it resolved by the next morning. The morning after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine, she passed out: She passed out about 8:15 AM. The outcome of the events headache, nausea, weakness, pain at injection site was recovering.

I was anxious as I have anxiety disorder! But my face was RED and TIRED looking. I asked staff what wrong. No swelling at that time! 4:40 PM.  That nite, my heart started POUNDING HARD all night, not stop. Ativan not help. I slept, weird dreams, wake up and still heart pounding.  8 am --- got up and hands, arms, extremities SWOLLEN!! Heart still pounding,  Felt like allergic to MSG or nitrates or preservatives or too much salt. Felt weird.. Not faint-- just weird. Tired from the pounding heart. Not fatigued.  I did have sore arm, but it was NOT an issue.  My hands, toes were red.

                                                I had two symptoms that are normal, they were on the list of side effects, I had soreness on my left arm, I couldn&#39;t sleep on my left arm due to this soreness. This started the day the soreness started. The following day and up till now I felt very tired and like I needed to take a nap. Due to work I have not been able to nap. On Sunday I noticed I had a fever blister on the right side of face, under my lip by my chin. It looked like a herpes blister. I rarely get them unless there is a serious stressor to my body or if my body is emotionally stressed. Valacyclozir I took 4 of those in the morning and 4 tablets in the evening after noticing them. I put a cream on the blister. On Tuesday or Wednesday 3 or 4 days after the vaccine I felt a pain in my gum by back two teeth, the gums were very painful when I brushed my teeth or put my tongue on it.  I went to the dentist Friday the 22nd, however the dentist said it was intraoral herpes that he believes it is looked to the vaccine. Dr. believes the COVID vaccine activated the dormant herpes in my system . He said says it is located over the Greater Palatine Foramen.  The herpes on my chin went away. I still feel light sensitivity and fatigued. Dr recommended to see my dermatologist. Either the 22nd or 23rd I had a virutal appointment with my dermatologist. She recommended I take 4 Valacyclozir in the AM and PM. And then 1 day for 10 days. Both doctors recommended not getting the 2nd dose until the herpes vaccine goes away. Once it goes away they suggested taking the Valacyclozir before taking the 2nd dose. I am still not feeling normal. My dentist said he was going to consult a group of dentists to see if any other dentists have seen the correlation between the COVID vaccine and activating the herpes virus.  I plan to consult my PCP about if I should delay the 2nd dose.

A 75-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1686), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 15:45 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Leighten Plantar Alopecia (hair follicle is an enemy), skin infection (infection in body most of the time, at least on skin), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, obesity, autoimmune disorder (diagnosed 8 months ago). She has lost some height, prior to taking the vaccine and she said it was related to age. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced feeling unwell on 10Jan2021; blood in urine on 10Jan2021 at 17:00; nausea at 10:00, chills at 11:00, almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office at 10:00, felt cold - all on 11Jan2021; getting really tired/fatigue on 14Jan2021 at 09:30; gets really sweaty on 13Jan2021 at 10:00; and dizziness on unknown date. The patient had the first shot on Friday (08Jan2021). On Sunday (10Jan2021), she started feeling bad. She was feeling good about getting it and had no reaction. She has an autoimmune disorder that made her a little afraid to take, but with all the indications, they said it would be much better for her to take it than to get the COVID virus. Sunday (10Jan2021), she does not feel good. So, she started having blood in urine. She thought she had a UTI and had not had one in 20 years. It felt like that is what she had and with the blood in urine. She just took Tylenol and waited until Monday morning because she does not like sitting in doctor&#39;s office. They gave her a cup to give sample and said she didn&#39;t need to see provider. They will have it checked and in the meantime call in a prescription. It kept getting worse and worse. She was about to passed out in the doctor&#39;s office on 11Jan2021, she got nauseous and almost threw up. She got in the car with her husband and he was trying to get her home. She got chills and got so cold and could not warm her body up. Her husband gave her Phenergan and it kind of knocked her out for a while to ease her nausea. She was thinking of going later today (14Jan2021), when she gets enough energy, to get a COVID test. She does not know if it will give false positive or not. She had chills and now she gets sweaty since 13Jan2021. She took her temperature and she did not have one. She just now got up. It is 10:00. She got up this morning (14Jan2021) and was really tired. She was not sweating this morning. Tiredness is kind of new, and when she talked to the nurse, she sort of felt like maybe it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine, but then she talked to her daughter and she said the symptoms she was having are usually symptoms that occur with second dose of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for people to have symptoms she was having. She wanted to know if she should have a COVID test. If she has had just one shot, would the test give a false positive coming from the COVID. They were asking if patient should take the second dose, and should she continue her UTI medication. Doctor&#39;s visit to give urine sample on 11Jan2021 (results: negative for UTI). She did not see a doctor though. They sent sample and prescribed a sulfa based medication for a UTI. She did start feeling a little better and stopped having blood in her urine. She plans to continue it because she does not like to stop taking an antibiotic. She did not have any clue that it was not a UTI until the nurse from her provider&#39;s office called to tell her results of urine sample was negative. Outcome of event getting really tired/fatigue was not recovered; events almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office, blood in urine, chills, and gets really sweaty was recovering; and unknown for other events.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I woke up feeling sick with headache and pain in abdomen, went to bathroom and sat down, I was burning up and perspiration was dripping down my body, i felt like i might throw up and that was the last though until I came to on the floor of our walk in shower.  It took me a while to orient myself and get up and sat down again on toilet still with pain in head and disoriented. next thing i know i am coming to wedged between the toilet tank and the vanity.  I managed to get back on the toilet and sat there wondering what was happening to me.  I could tell i was getting better so i just sat there a while longer until i though my legs would hold me so i could get back to the bed.  I laid in bed the rest of the night unable to sleep with headache and shivering with being cold even under my blankets. I stayed in bed Saturday then called the doctor first thing Monday morning. I got in to see her at 10:30 Monday morning.  She ordered a full blood panel and urinalysis and heart monitor for 48 hours.  The blood panel and urinalysis reports are all ok.  Have not received report yet from the heart monitor.  Doc said I cannot take the second shot.

When she woke up at 8:30 AM her headache was very severe and was accompanied with very severe chest pain. She immediately took her to the ER. They did a very thorough work up to check on her heart and Aorta. They managed her severe pain with two doses of morphine followed by two days of Dilaudid. The imaging and symptoms left her with a newly discovered diagnosis of Pericarditis. The medical professions were sure this was a result of the COVID vaccine. They continued to treat her for a few days and sent her home with anti inflammatories to help. She continues to have muscle pain, weakness and shortness of breath when she walks. She is scheduled to take her 2nd dose on February 5th but we are very concerned and hesitant as we don&#39;t want to cause any more damage to her heart.

After waiting 15 minutes I left with some discomfort but figured my  arm will probably be sore for a few days.  A couple hours after getting the injection, I couldn&#39;t move my left arm without excruciating pain. I&#39;m only assuming she gave me the shot to close to the shoulder joint.  It&#39;s now Tuesday, February 10, and it is improving with more mobility and not as painful.  But, still hurts.  Cannot sleep on my left side.  I&#39;m concerned about getting the second dosage on February 27 and if this has caused any damage to the joint.  So far, I have not seen this side affect listed in  any Covid fact sheets.
