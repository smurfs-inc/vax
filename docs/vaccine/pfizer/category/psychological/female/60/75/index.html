This 60-year-old female nurse (Patient) reported that received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation, Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune. Concomitant medications included Metoprolol at 12.5 mg for Atrial fibrillation and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN). No diabetes, no hypertension. None of the usual common diseases. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was &#39;weird&#39; sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday. What happened it looked like an encephalopathy but my head swelled, my face was all swollen, complete brain fog, fatigue and I couldn&#39;t talk. I was in so much pain in my head resulting in (incomplete sentence).&#34; Lab work included the only thing is the PCR swabbing. No blood test. Registered Nurse further stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know if that is important. But I will tell you and if it is you can send me the questions. I do have a history of Autoimmune. So my Physician thought that this was just like an enhancement of like my bodies reaction I have Chronic Lyme and I have lupus like my ANA has always been stressful. But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body&#39;s reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.&#34; Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I just wanted to let you know what happened and the intensity of what it was because normally I would expect a headache. But this was a &#39;go dated&#39;. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I guess the only question that I have is so do my work has this question and I was going to call my doctor tomorrow may be might know it better. I know that I have to take the second dose. But I understand the second round can be worse than the first. Is there anything that they are recommending that I can do may be prior to ease the reaction?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported clinical manifestations including swelling face and head swelled, which was suspected as encephalopathy by the reporting nurse, was probably related to the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), due to temporal relationship.  The subject&#39;s underlying Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune were likely the risk factors to the onset of the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The pain in my arm woke me up. I never felt like I fell asleep. I woke up at 530am and took my Thyroid medicine and went back to bed until 6:30am. Felt fine until about 830am. I noticed I was starting to feel lightheaded and had this pressure on my head. I went back to bed and tried to fall asleep but really never did. I noticed that I would lose track of my train of thought often. Got up at 11am and  took a shower and still just didn&#39;t feel like I had any motivation to do anything, so rested again. I then noticed my face, ear lopes and cheeks felt a little numb. I would pinch them and I noticed they were numb. Also, there was still pressure on the back of my head and on the bridge of my nose. Still light headed. I layed in bed until about 3pm when I did notice the numbness going away and the pressure on the back of my head and on the bridge of my nose getting a little better. Also, no appetite.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears.

Last time she went to work after receiving the first one and today (on 12Jan2021), there was no way she could go to work. She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away. She got to sleep after she took the TYLENOL. Her back and jaw was bothering her. It felt like the flu. She had upper jaw pain and pain in her back. She didn&#39;t have a good back and just aches.

A 60-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the upper left arm on 12Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient reported that she took it yesterday and an hour into it she started having a burning sensation in her chest. What happen next, around 8pm, she started having allergy like symptoms that lasted throughout the night. She was experiencing nose running, congested and blockage in her nose, and shortness of breath. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. For treatment, she took Mucinex tablets for allergy. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. This was the first dose, her second dose is due on 02Feb2020 and she wants to know if she can skip it.   Before she got it she contacted her primary care due to having allergies before the vaccine and asked if she should take; she was told to hold on but then she went ahead and took it. Within the first 30 minutes she was ok but in an hour is when she had the burning sensation in her chest. The burning sensation lasted about an hour. The dose was administered around 4pm on 12Jan2021.The caller reports that the Mucinex and she has breathing treatment, nebulizer treatments for her lungs, that she did and these things helped. Early this morning she felt she can now close her mouth and breathe normally. It was administered in the upper left arm. She did not require a visit to the doctor or ER. The patient has had no reactions to vaccines in the past nor were any administered on the day of or within the prior 4 weeks. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of allergy like symptoms, congested and blockage in her nose and shortness of breath which included Mucinex. The patient recovered from burning sensation in her chest on 12Jan2021, from allergy like symptoms/allergy and shortness of breath on 13Jan2021 while the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

This 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686), via intramuscular, on 06Jan2021 (at 14:30) at single dose at left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Age at vaccination is 61-year-old.  Historical vaccine included Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine (intramuscular, at single dose) on 15Dec2020 for immunization; and Shingles vaccine (intramuscular, at single dose) on 15Dec2020 for varicella immunization. Relevant medical history included usual tenderness. No relevant concomitant medications were provided.  On 07Jan2021, she woke up at 2:00 in the morning, she had a high temperature, she was chilled, she had a severe headache, nausea, fatigue, and body aches. She got up and took ibuprofen (ADVIL). She was basically in bed, she had to cancel all her appointments in the morning, she just laid in bed and the following afternoon her fever broke at about 4:30 in the afternoon then she just had a low grade temperature and a dull headache, nausea through the next day, Friday the 08Jan2021. She still has a very dull headache and just not right, kind of like a flu bug. She had no fever; she had not had any fever after Friday afternoon or Saturday. Fever started at 2 in the morning 07Jan2021 and she experienced the chills until after fever broke. Fever went above 102 degrees. She still had a little of the nausea, she just didn&#39;t feel like eating. She still had the dull headache. The nausea and headache have improved when compared to how it was on the 07Jan2021. She was back to work now she just has a dull frontal headache. The reporting nurse assessed all the events, except of &#39;Doesn&#39;t feel like eating&#39;, serious for disability. She stated she may have had usual tenderness but nothing like this. The patient had recovered from the event fever on 08Jan2021 and from the event &#39;chills/chilled&#39; on 07Jan2021; the patient was recovering from &#39;nausea&#39; and &#39;severe Headache/Dull headache/Frontal headache&#39;, while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  It is worth noting that patient had other vaccines not far ago, including Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine and Shingles vaccine on 15Dec2020 for immunization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had an immediate reaction to the covid vaccine within 30 seconds after the injection.  I felt a warm sensation after the vaccine in my deltoid muscle then felt it go up both my ears, around my head.  I then felt the same warm sensation in my abdomen, followed by buzzing of my entire body with light headedness.  I could breath, I could talk, but I had an urgency for others around me to know that I wasn?t feeling well and something was not right.  I asked my colleagues if someone could take me to the ER for monitoring.  They immediately put me in a recliner and elevated my legs.  This did not relieve my symptoms and asked to go to the ER.  I got to the ER and laid on the stretcher with continued increased buzzing sensation especially in my finger tips and arms.  My vital signs were 148/88 and HR 88 (elevated from my normal of 100-120/60-70, HR 60s).  The buzzing turned into a sensation in my arms that rumbled erratically.  I thought something bad was about to happen and that my blood cells would burst. Then I also felt icy cold in my arms and my gut.  Next what happened were teeth chattering shivers.  All these symptoms occurred in a matter of minutes.  They started an IV, drew blood, gave me Benadryl and ran IV fluids.  My vitals did not reflect what I felt inside, but as symptoms let up, my VS returned to normal.  As quickly as the symptoms started, they eventually calmed down and I was able to leave the ER in 1.5 hours to go home. I was very scared.  The ER doctor thought I had a hyperimmune response to the vaccine.

                                                Slightly sore left deltoid, cleared up in a few days.  16 hours after shot, experienced the dramatic sensation of tilting while sitting on a couch.  Had I been driving, this would likely have caused an accident.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this feeling.  There were 2 or 3 other episodes of feeling like I was falling.  2 of this happened while lying down.  They were sudden sensations that made me gasp.  Spent most of 1 week in bed with fatigue, vertigo, and 2 times vomiting.  Vomiting occurred day 2 post vaccine.  Fatigue was continuous for about a week.  At day 16 now, certain movements still illicit vertigo.  All vertigo symptoms have lasted under 1 minute. However, some have been back to back, such as after repositioning multiple times in bed.  Ears have felt very full for almost 2 weeks.  Certain head positions or movements, still illicit sensations of the room moving.  There was no specific headache, but my head did not feel good for about 2 weeks.  There was no fever, but there was chilling one night, a couple of days after the vaccine.  I don&#39;t know if getting 2nd vaccine is wise.

A 61-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and also reported as Pfizer Covid vaccine; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she had the first dose of the Covid vaccine on 04Jan2021. She stated that the first day it was okay but on the second day, she slept the whole day and even when standing up cooking, she was falling asleep and on the third day, she was completely okay. After that day, she was okay until now. She was now feeling unwell, headache (she never gets a headache like this before, a really, really headache) and dizzy (all starting yesterday). She takes Tylenol and will be okay for 8 hours. She further reported that she did not have a fever. She added that on Sunday, she was dizzy and has an on and off headache but not all the time and also for today too. She is not sure if this is a side effect or if it is covid. She inquired if these are side effects or does she need a Covid testing. The outcome of the events was unknown.  The following information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

I left the center after 15 minutes and came back to Pediatric office where I work.  I did take a Zyrtec and felt completely better after approx. an hour.  After the 2nd dose I did mention I had felt odd after 1st dose and decided to sit for 30 min.  I felt about the same as I did after the 1st dose so I left.  when  I got to my car my face was flushed.  I was not tachycardia just a very odd felling in my head and then my tongue did start to itch (or feel funny)  .  I took a Zyrtec and went home.  I never had any swelling of lips or tongue, no trouble breathing.  Pulse stayed constant around 80.  This time the symptoms lasted approx. 4 hours.  I I did continue to take Zyrtec for 3 days after injection.

A 61-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 18Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been otherwise well prior to receiving the bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020. Within 72 hours, she experienced fatigue, body aches, chills and sweats since 21Dec2020, though she was able to work Xmas week. On 31Dec2020, she contacted her PCP to report neck and leg muscle stiffness and pain, difficulty ambulating, fatigue, chills and sweats. She had a negative COVID test on 02Jan2021 and essentially negative blood work, other than an ESR of 124 mm/hr and CRP of 4 mg/dl. I had a negative PET scan on 12Jan2021. Currently, she had pain/stiffness in her neck and legs, and progressive difficulty w/ ambulation (both of which are worst in the early hours of the AM), and difficulty with ADLs since 31Dec2020. She had been unable to work since 03Jan2021. Her physician had not indicated or endorsed any relationship between her symptoms and the vax. She forewent dose 2 out of an abundance of caution. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events muscle stiffness , neck pain and gait disturbance appeared 13 days after administration of single dose BNT162B2. The Company considers that the events are less likely related to suspect BNT162B2 injection given the weak time association. The detailed clinical course and cause of the events would be helpful for further assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (, Solution for injection, Batch/lot no: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 15:00 in the left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously did get a flu shot in Nov or Dec2020. The patient developed a bad rash, hives, all over her body and itching on 10Feb2021. She reports, her feet were incredibly hot over the next 3 days on 07Feb2021. What started off as a few bumps kept increasing up to 3 days later. She was unable to sleep from being so itchy. Her doctor said it was an allergic reaction and prescribed an antihistamine after which it left in Feb2021. She was due for the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021. The patient did not had any investigation assessment. The patient states that there was little information out there to compare the experience she had. Wanted to call to make Pfizer aware of that and maybe get some more information out there. Has printed out the fact sheet and assumes she should not get the second vaccine because of what happened the first time. Wants to clarify what happened and share with Pfizer this information since she can&#39;t find much information for people who have had a delayed reaction. Went to get the vaccine on 04Feb and doesn&#39;t consider herself an allergic type person. Has no allergy to foods, medicines, only gets poison ivy and bug bites like most people. By Monday, the 4th day (08Feb2021) after getting the vaccine, noticed a couple of bumps on the wrist and does not know where else and didn&#39;t think of it as anything else. Thought it was a bite or she touched a plant and then it went away. It was not much. In the evening of Tuesday she had a bad reaction and on the 10th (10Feb2021) she had rash, hives, and itching that just moved to different places over the body. Her feet were so hot on the 3rd day and had to plunged them into cold water and used Epsom salt off and on and it helped some. This happened only for 2 nights and the reason she didn&#39;t go to the doctor, it went away. Again, mentions the first night she had a couple bumps and didn&#39;t think much about it. The second night, it was all over her body, the rash, and she took Epsom baths that helped, but she didn&#39;t get much more than an hour of sleep. She tried to take pictures of her thighs and backside, but unable to take good pictures, not a selfie person. The next morning she had her husband take pictures in case it went away and she went to the doctor they would have pictures to show. Her husband thought it may be shingles. Called the doctor on Thursday and had pictures to show her since the rash went away. Again, mentions the reaction was so bad on Wednesday. The doctor didn&#39;t believe areas on pictures of her back were shingles since shingles does not come and go away like that and that she must have had an allergic reaction to something. Provider didn&#39;t believe it was from the vaccine. Was given a prescription for Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg and was informed if areas didn&#39;t improve or returned she may need to see an allergist or immunologist. After the appointment she didn&#39;t get much sleep and woke up at 4pm in the afternoon and felt a little off, it could have been in her head or maybe she was paranoid, but she wasn&#39;t going to wait for the reaction to be full blown over her body and took one Hydroxyzine HCL and went to bed at 7:30pm and didn&#39;t do anything since. Got up and the reaction/rash, hives, itching was all gone after taking only one. It&#39;s like an antihistamine or Zyrtec. No further details provided. Later mentions after getting the first vaccine on the 4th, the next day she had arm soreness up until that Monday when the rash started. No further details provided. Says as far as recommendations were concerned for the paper she printed, the fact sheet. It says pretty much listed, she shouldn&#39;t have the second dose if difficulty breathing, swelling in the face and throat. The only thing she had was the rash on the neck, not the face. Paperwork also lists heart beating fast, or severe allergic reaction. The patient had no emergency room visit. The patient visited the physician office. The outcome of the event hot feeling in feet was recovered on feb2021 and rest of the events was recovering.

A 61-year-old female patient received their first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 20Jan2021 18:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and high BP from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine, losartan potassium and sodium fluoride (CREST CAVITY PROTECTION). The patient previously took septra and experienced allergies. The patient reported that on 21Jan2021, they woke up and brushed their teeth then at 6:40am blood with large clots gushed from their right (rt) nostril. The patient went to ER and stopped bleeding after 2 hrs. On 22Jan2021, the patient woke up with bad headache, winded, vomited, diaherra (as reported), coughing. On 23Jan2021, they went to get covid test but due to blood in their nose, they received antibody test which was negative. On 24Jan2021, the patient was still feeling bad with all the above symptoms. Then on 25Jan2021, they went to ENT doctor who cauterized their nose and stated that since antibody was negative to take the maderna vaccine since they have no antibody in their system, the Pfizer vaccine did not work. From 26Jan2021 to 13Feb2021, the patient felt same started feeling better 14Feb2021 but still have sore muscles in their shoulders and cough. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 antibody test: negative on 23Jan2021.  The action taken in response to the event(s) for bnt162b2 was not applicable. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of epistaxis and clot blood which include the doctor cauterized their nose. The patient recovered with sequel from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the epistaxis and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including CBC and coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On day 2, I developed confusion and could not focus making it impossible for me to complete my work at my job. The confusion made driving dangerous. By Friday, I went to my PCP and they noticed that my blood pressure was only 90/58 and they were concerned so she told me that she was calling my cardiologist who said to reduce the dose of my Diltiazem from 180 mg daily to 120 mg daily. She also said to take a few days off of taking the Diltiazem. I have also had a serious increase in Tachycardia. That evening I went to the ED because I was so weak and couldn&#39;t breath well. I am also retaining a lot of fluid. The lab work indicated an elevated Pro-B-Natriuretic Peptide level of 227. I am still not well and each doctor I have spoken to said they believe it is due to the vaccine. I do not know if I should take the second dose.

Medical history included environmental allergies, she has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume, blood pressure (abnormal) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included ongoing lisinopril for blood pressure, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took novocaine but was allergic.  She got all this information when she got the vaccine on Monday at (place name) in (state name). It tells all the side effects from the first injection. She wanted to report that it is the same arm that she got the vaccine in. She has swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm.  It says you can have joint pain, but nothing about swelling. She thought she better report it. This was her first shot. She is supposed to get the second one on 18Jan2021. She wanted to make sure she can take it. She received the vaccine on 28Dec2020. She laid around that day. Today is the first day she doesn&#39;t have arm pain and swelling at the injection site.  It was the first time she has had arm pain. She has never had that with flu shot. The arm pain started within the 15 minutes she was observed. It hurt like hell until that day. She got a bruise at the injection site. It bled a little bit when she put it in. Swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm: she doesn&#39;t know if it was later that day. She can&#39;t remember. She really noticed it yesterday. She has never had joint pain or swelling. She doesn&#39;t have any problems with arthritis. Now her little finger is bigger than the rest of her fingers. It hurts because of the swelling. She doesn&#39;t want to take anything. It might be fluid. She has a high pain tolerance. She keeps bending it thinking it will get better. It isn&#39;t as bad, but its still swelled up. At first she thought it was better, but it is still pretty swollen. To her this is a reaction. She was thinking if she took paracetamol before, it wouldn&#39;t hurt as bad, but she can&#39;t remember if she took it that morning. She takes 500mg before bed for the heck of it at night. It helps her sleep better. She has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume. They think she was allergic to the preservative in the flu shot, but she has never had any trouble with the flu shot since. She has environmental allergies. They thought she was allergic to Novocaine once at the dentist office. Who knows, it only happened once. She&#39;s been to the dentist many times and who knows what they injected and why she reacted that way. She felt like she was going to pass out. They don&#39;t give it to her anymore. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it. She is worried since this vaccine is emergency authorization. She doesn&#39;t want to get the next one and have a worse reaction. She is not sure if she should be worried. The events of swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm were assessed as medically significant. Outcome of the event of &#39;swelling of fingers&#39; was not recovered, the other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event joint pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the event swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

                                                10:23pm felt a slight headache and nausea.  Left work at 10:43pm since didn&#39;t feel good.  While on road, my tongue started to tingle and then my lips started to tingle and both sides of face felt numb. This started around 10:50pm?  Went to bed and woke up Sat with same tongue, lip tingleling and face numbness.  Lips felt very swollen. Felt that way throughout the weekend.  On Monday, went back to work place injection area and requested someone talk to me.  Nurse practioner came out and spoke to me, asked about balance of facial features, no problem breathing or swallowing and gave me 25mg benadryl to take 3 times a day.  Did nothing but make me sleepy.  She calls me Tue am and told me to make an appt with PCP.  Made phone appt  for Wed.  Dr calls me Wed am and gives me presciption for 60mg Prednisone to take for a week (at this time symptoms are the same).  the first 3 days taking Prednisone the intensity of tingleling seems to lessen day by day.  But on 4th day, the symptoms stopped lessening.  Finished the meds anyway. Last 3 days, i&#39;ve also had that mild headache back in addition to the numbness from face traveling up to my ears. Past few days the tingling in tongue isn&#39;t confined to just the edges of the tongue.  It started with the first 1/4 of whole  tongue and is today tingleling in the front half of whole tongue.  One good thing so far is the past few days, my lips feel way less swollen and tingleling is lessening. So, riding this out, hoping it will  end sometime this year.  Will not be getting the second shot.  Just so you know.

Finally on Thursday night I realized maybe it is the shot that is giving me all the itching. My whole body was flushed I kept scratching my arms and legs, especially  around my ankle, knee, under arm and goin area.  I took an allergy pill  and called Kaiser and spoke with an advice nurse. she   mentioned that taking an allergy pill will relief some of the itching.   I fell asleep around after midnight normally I go to bed around 9:30.  I also called pfizer and explained and the person took all my information and symptoms.

                                                approximately  2 hours after my vaccination, I started with a very severe headache and felt extremely tired. I had difficulty staying awake. I slept about 2 hours. When I woke up my headache was gone and I was no longer tired. I went to bed and slept well until a headache woke me up the next morning however it was not as severe as the previous night. I was a bit lethargic but not too bad.   My headache continued until the evening of 1.11.21 however I was not lethargic and was able to work. Today is 11.12.21 and I feel fine.  I had no injection site discomfort to speak of.

                                                A little over 12 hours after receiving my 2nd dose at 8:42 am, I woke up at approximately 11:15 pm to find that my tongue and throat were swelling. I immediately took 1 25mg benadryl and went to the Emergency Room (ER). After many questions and examination of my mouth. I was given another benadryl, prednisone, and famotidine. I waited and was observed for approximately 2.5 hours in the ER. At that time it was obvious that the medication was effective and I was comfortable leaving the ER to return home. I had prescriptions for more prednisone and famotidine to take for 5 days. On Wednesday, I felt well enough to go to work at my school, though I did light duty. On Thursday, I was also at school and also attended a physical therapy session and exercise class. I talked at length with my PT about my experience and she could tell that I was feeling good (presumably from the prednisone) and cautioned me about not overdoing things during exercise. I felt like my tongue was beginning to swell and the PT mentioned that my words sounded a bit funny (she was the only one to comment on this). I then went to dinner at my daughters house and began to feel tired from the benadryl. Upon arriving home and getting ready for bed, my husband and I both noticed how flushed my chest and face had become during the day. My throat and tongue were still somewhat swollen and my throat was beginning to hurt. During the day on Thursday, I had registered with the local  Covid information website and had received an email stating that I should feel free to call the triage phone number if I needed. At approximately 9:45 pm I called and talked with a nurse who urged me to return to the ER because of the flushing and continued swelling. In the ER I was seen by a different doctor who was concerned not so much about the swelling, but about the white streaks in my throat and had me swabbed for strep throat. That test was negative. He said he had read my chart from Tuesday night and felt that the medication that had been prescribed was appropriate and that he didn&#39;t feel anything needed to be changed. He asked about how bad my throat felt and wrote a prescription for Magic Mouthwash and I asked for an EpiPen, which he also prescribed. We arrived home at approximately 12:00 am, but it was still difficult to lie down and sleep. I had already decided that I would not go to school on Friday and stay home and rest. I needed to pick up my prescriptions when the pharmacy opened and I ran a few other errands while I was out, but returned home and slept most of the afternoon. I have not been very energetic this evening, but decided that I wanted to get this form filled out. At approximately 10:00 PM on Friday evening, I hope that I am able to sleep better than I have the last several nights.

Upon waking I felt ok but after walk; weakness; felt very poorly; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health care professional. A 63-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 04Jan2021 11:45 at single dose at left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism, psoriasis. Concomitant medications included etanercept (ENBREL), and levothyroxine. The patient felt okay right after the injection but about 2 hours later, on 04Jan2021 14:30, she started experiencing a pressure headache, gradually felt very poorly and took a nap for a few hours. Upon waking the patient felt okay but after walking around the house for about 20 minutes, the headache started up again and the same awful feeling of weakness so she laid down and took another 2 hours nap. When the patient woke up the second time she felt as though nothing had happened, was feeling fine. So the patient would say the side effects lasted for about 5 hours. The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Jan2021 17:00.

                                                within 24 hours vaccination shots, I had intermittent low grade fever, constant chills, and mild VERTIGO (that was the worst).  Re the Vertigo, I didn&#39;t fall but experienced it whenever moving.  I was bumping into walls and was dizzy whenever I moved position (e.g. sitting to standing &amp; vice versus).  These symptoms lasted 5-7 days after they began (both shots).

                                                2.5 hours after receiving vaccine, I started getting dizzy and vomiting. I vomited 6 or 7 times. I was so dizzy I couldn&#39;t open my eyes without getting sick. We called ER and explained that we thought I was having a reaction to the vaccine, and their response was they had never heard of that type of reaction. I was sick all night, called my primary Dr in the am and they told me to go to ER. We had to call ambulance to take me there because I was so sick and couldn&#39;t open my eyes without having to vomit. Room spun in circles. My arrival at ER, they did MRI, EKG, blood work. My blood pressure was very high, so they connected me to a heart monitor. I had low Magnesium due to vomiting so much.  I was treated with Valium and anti-vert medication and fluids. I stayed overnight in hospital- had PT Jan 13th  for DX of Vertigo. Then referred to Outpatient PT for Vertigo.  Dr&#39;s felt it was a &#34;coincident&#34; that I got Vertigo shortly after vaccine, and strongly felt it was not related.  . Today is Jan 17th, and I am still dizzy, but feeling better. I have an appointment with my primary Jan 18th and not sure if I should take the 2nd dose. That is the question.

Chills on Friday morning in the middle of night; woke up and my temp was 101.3 and I was feeling bad all day; had headache and went back to bed. Still have pain in hip/knee and joints and those pains got really bad after the vaccine - increased. Doctor  vist told me to use Ibuprofen to 3 times a day for that pain.  Shortness of breath continues from Covid symptoms and so does the hip/joint pain - it has decreased.

                                                About 5:30 or so and I was going to go to lunch at work - I felt like a heartburn and I was looking for a tums. I didn&#39;t have any. I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

Pt did not have wheezing or stridor.  Medics on scene and student medics under the direction of Medics, placed the patient on the monitor.  Her HR was stable in the 70s and her sats were 99-100% on room air, with a strong pulse and RR of 16.  The pt became more anxious and demanded that someone assist her with her Epi pen administration. RN explained sxs of anxiety and sxs of anaphylaxis.  Pt became agitated and again remained adamant that medics give her Epi.  At 1132 hours a student medic under the direction of Medics administered the pts own epi pen to her.  Vitals signs after epi were HR of 88, BP of 170/97, RR 22, sats 100% .  A transport unit was called as precaution and to potentially transport.

Pt was transported to the ER via Medics for continued care and follow up.

                                                I got the vaccine at 9am. At 4pm that same day I experienced terrible pain to left arm. No redness or swelling at the site. I couldnt lie on my left arm at all that night.  By 11pm I also experienced headache, sinus drainage, sore throat, body aches, taste and smell were off, upset stomach, queezy stomach but no nausea or vomiting, very weak , dry mouth, fever at 99.2 then 98.6, chills, lots of chills. The covid hotline at my work told me I had a moderate reaction to the vaccine. Treatment was rest and tylenol which didn&#39;t alleviate any symptoms whatsoever. I had all these symptoms til Jan 6th at 4am.   At 4am all the symptoms left and have not returned.

                                                Five minutes after receiving the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, the pt. informed the RN that she was feeling &#34;itchy&#34; on her right arm, her right scapula and across her abdomen. She was given the vaccine in her left arm. The pt did not have any rash or hives noted.  The PA spoke with the pt and 50 mgs Benadryl was given p.o.(@ 1450).  The pt stayed to be observed and after an additional 40 minutes  (@ 1531) she said she was feeling better and was going to her unit to work (eve shift). The pt. spoke to her Nurse Manager upon arrival back to her unit and was sent home instead of working. Her unit was called at 4pm and we were informed that the pt went home, as she was concerned of being too tired to work.

Early in the morning on 29Dec2020, around 3:30 a.m., she woke up and had a racing/pounding feeling in her chest. She took her blood pressure and it was 158/86, heart rate (HR) was 83. She felt really funny. She hadn&#39;t been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, so this was high for her. She took her blood pressure again about an hour later and it was 165/95, HR 73. She took it again about an hour later and her blood pressure read 180/98, HR 77. Her heart rate stayed in the normal range, but the force felt really strong. She did go to the emergency room around 5:00 am on 29Dec2020. She told them what she was experiencing and that she had received the COVID-19 vaccine. About the time she got to the hospital, her blood pressure was starting to come down. An EKG was done and they drew bloodwork. Her potassium came back a little low-they didn&#39;t tell her how low or what her level was. She was given 2 potassium tablets which did help. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the potassium she was given. It was given to her at the hospital. She was also given a sheet to monitor her salt intake, which she already does that. She confirmed she was not admitted into the hospital, she was discharged from the Emergency Room. She felt pretty good. She didn&#39;t go to work that Wednesday, 30Dec2020, but she went to work on Thursday, 31Dec2020. On 01Jan2021, the same thing happened to her again. She had elevated blood pressure, forceful beat. She went back to the ER early in the morning, around 5:00 am, on 01Jan2021. Her pulse stayed within normal range, but she had such a forceful beat. She informed them that she was really uncomfortable in her chest, the force was the most uncomfortable at this point. They wanted to make sure she wasn&#39;t have a stroke or heart attack, so they did their normal procedures to rule this out. They did 2 EKG&#39;s, 2 sets of labs, Chest X-ray, CAT scan and everything came back normal. She had a discussion with the physician that saw her about what she was experiencing and the physician was asking her about having anxiety. Caller explains she has never really had problems with anxiety before, but she can&#39;t say she hasn&#39;t had it. Being around COVID patients and getting the shot, sometimes anxiety can be there. The physician wanted her to try a low dose of Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg. She was to only to take a half dose by mouth, if her top number (systolic blood pressure) was between 140-160. Caller clarifies when she means half of a dose, the dose equals 12.5mg. She was instructed to take this 12.5mg dose until she saw her PCP. So, she did this and called her PCP and wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment to speak with a provider until the following Wednesday, 06Jan2021. She did a tele visit with her provider and let her know what had happened and that the half of the pill will only bring her top number (systolic blood pressure) to 130&#39;s-140&#39;s. Caller states she was used to her top number (systolic) being maybe in the 120&#39;s, low 130&#39;s. Her doctor increased her dose to 25mg. She was prescribed to take 25mg, tablet, by mouth, once a day. She confirmed she still checks her blood pressure before she takes the medicine. Caller verifies she has 2 bottles, one being the 12.5mg dose and the second being the 25mg dose. With the 12.5mg bottle, she sees refills and the date 05Jan2022. Caller clarifies both bottles are dispensed in pharmacy vials with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date. About a month prior to all of this and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, clarified as Nov2020, she was treated for a UTI. During that time, her blood pressure went up a little and kind of bounced around a little bit, but came back down. Then, she got the COVID-19 shot. She initially felt fine but later on by the time she got a chance to do the tele visit with her PCP, she was telling her about her previous UTI, and the provider put her on Cipro because it seemed like her UTI symptoms were coming back. Caller verifies she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration for the Cipro. She already took of all of that. She went to the ER for the third time on 08Jan2021 because she again felt the forceful beat feeling in her chest. She explained she felt really wiped out and worn down and she was tired. An EKG was done and they did labs. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any results with her at this time. She was taken off of work for a couple of weeks. She is currently getting in contact with a Cardiologist to make sure everything is alright. The cardiologist wants her to have a stress test. The caller states so this is where she is now. She is taking blood pressure medicine and getting set up to do a stress test. Sore arm outcome: Caller confirms she recovered from the arm soreness within that same day. Her arm didn&#39;t stay sore long at all. Racing/pounding in chest: This had improved. It&#39;s not like it was. She still has it a little bit of it now, but she is going to see her cardiologist and do a stress test. The blood pressure medicine has helped some. Elevated blood pressure: Today her blood pressure top number got to 161 and she had to take medication but her blood pressure has improved. Outcome of elevated blood pressure, racing/ pounding in chest was resolving; outcome of forceful beat feeling in her chest, UTI, potassium was a little low, felt really wiped out and worn down/tired, anxiety was unknown; outcome of arm a little bit sore, 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit fever was resolved on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

A 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 07Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital, not a Military Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient got the Flu Vaccine last part of Sep2020 or Beginning of Oct2020. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EK57530), via an unspecified route of administration at left Upper arm on 17Dec2020 9:10AM for covid-19 immunization. She only had a sore arm. It started the same day, a couple of hours after getting the vaccine. It went away a day to a day and a half after it started. After that she was fine. She got the second dose on 07Jan2021. After the second dose, immediately, like within five minutes her arm became very sore, this event was assessed as non-serious by HCP. Also, that Thursday (07Jan2021) night after getting the second dose of the Vaccine around 9PM-10PM she started to get chills, myalgia, severe headache, and nausea. She also mentioned she was so sick during the night she was not able to get up and around. She felt like she had a temperature and by the time it was checked her temperature was 101.9. She was febrile all through 08Jan2021. She started to become afebrile 09Jan2021 with improvement and by 10Jan2021 all her symptoms had gone away and completely resolved. Seriousness Criteria: Stated she felt these are serious. She was unable to go to work on Friday. She could not return back to work until Monday. The HCP assessed all events were related to the vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021. She stated, even though she got so sick with getting the vaccine she was just continuously telling her self this is better than having COVID. She stated she even told people even if she knew after getting the shot she would have this reaction she would still take it. She has seen death occur from COVID and does not want that to happen.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, clinical course and known safety profile of the product, the reported events chills, myalgia, severe headache, nausea and fever were likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs.

Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

                                                As the needle was being inserted and while the vaccine was being injected, I immediately felt intense pain like none I&#39;ve had during any prior vaccine administration . The needle was inserted very high on the arm about 1/2 inch below the shoulder.  About 4:00 pm that afternoon, new pain developed in the same shoulder, along with very limited range of motion, gradually worsening during next few hours. By 9:00pm the pain was excruciating, like there were multiple knives in all directions in my shoulder. By then I could not lift or move my arm any amount in any direction without excruciating pain.  I suspected a severe inflammatory response. This pain level continued for the next 2 days.  On the 3rd day the pain was a little less severe and I had slightly more range of motion, but was still unable to lift my arm without pain. On the 4th day (Feb. 18) the pain was a little better but I still had severe sharp pain if I lifted my arm in certain directions. I began to suspect a torn muscle or tendon. Today (March 5, almost 3 weeks after the vaccine), the pain and limited range of motion are the same as Feb. 18.  It is relieved only by complete rest of the arm, and easily aggravated by any basic activity (grocery shopping, dressing, etc.)  I believe my shoulder was injured by improper administration.

                                                When I signed up for the vaccine, the website said that i was at high risk for the vaccine and would need to wait 15-30 minutes after the injection.  I checked with doctor re: this warning and she felt the vaccine was still beneficial but to do my research and make a decision. I received the vaccine at the Center.  I sat down as instructed. 5 minutes later, something felt off and I removed my protective visor.  A paramedic came over about a minute later and asked if i was ok.  I said that i didn&#39;t feel well.  He said that he was going to get a chair with wheels for me and at that time i must have passed out.  The next thing that i remember was waking up laying on the floor. My husband said that there were 4 paramedics in attendance.  The primary paramedic was telling me that my BP was 72/60.  An ekg was being run, an iv inserted and run full force.  they checked my blood sugar which was fine. The primary paramedic kept talking to me to check my level of consciousness.   I was there for quite a while. Not sure who the paramedics checked with, but they decided that i needed to go via ambulance to the hospital. The paramedics were very concerned that the ambulance go to the back door to pick me up so others getting the vaccine would not be frightened. I was transported to Medical Center for further evaluation. I was there for a few hours and my labwork was normal. EKG and chest xray were completed as well as cardiac monitoring.  I called doctor&#39;s office the next morning to notify her of the event. It was very scary!!!

                                                Second COVID vaccine on 1/14/21 - The patient is  received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine at Hospital.   Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                I had injection site discomfort, about 4-6 hours after vaccination. I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: L9261) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 27Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Sjogren&#39;s syndrome from 2015 (sees her Rheumatologist/ do blood work once a year to make sure her inflammation levels are okay), ongoing rosacea; dry eye syndrome (related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome); spasming, burning and twitching (last 2 medications she was on in November and January she had similar type reactions in her muscles); arthritis flareup from Oct2019 (in her left leg, she saw her neurologist who did tests and they came back normal) and sinus infection in 2020. Ongoing concomitant medication included ciclosporin (RESTASIS) for Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) for blood test: deficient and ascorbic acid, betacarotene, cupric oxide, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION) for dry eye syndrome related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient previously took prednisone from Nov2020 and experienced weirdness in her legs got strong enough to keep her up at night and bad flare up for her leg symptoms; metronidazole for flare up or Rosacea (0.75% as needed, which she has used daily for last few weeks), meloxicam in Nov2020 and pantoprazole in Jan2021 and had bad flare up for her leg symptoms (symptoms subsided as soon as she stopped taking the medication after about 5 days); ibuprofen, acetaminophen and pepcid for her stomach. She had the vaccine, her first dose, on 27Jan2021, about a week ago. The first two days she didn&#39;t notice anything and then she had weird sensations in her legs on 28Jan2021. The second night she had a weird sensation in her legs which was similar to what she had experienced with the two medications she took in November and January. On 30Jan2021 the sensations spread through her body, she describes these sensations as twitching, burning, cramping, and tingling. She clarifies the sensations moved to her arms which did not happen with the other medications that she tried in November and January. Monday night, 01Feb2021, she was up all night and couldn&#39;t sleep and says she called the family doctor yesterday and he called in a prescription for Gabapentin 100 mg. She said she took the medication last night and she did sleep last night, but she was unsure if it was from exhaustion from the last few nights from not sleeping or the medicine, but she did sleep better and her symptoms were a lot less last night. Patient said she wanted to report this and that her concern is with the second dose; will she have a worse reaction, is there anything she can do or take and should she be concerned about it. She said the events gradually increased, they started mildly and then became significant. She felt the sensations a little bit in the day time but they start big time in the night when laying down. These sensations experienced in her legs started the second night, 28Jan2021, and then spread to her arms in the last couple of days which had not happened with her other incidences (with the medications mentioned above back in November and January). Clarified that the sensations spread to her arms on 29Jan2021, but the worst nights were 31Jan2021 and 01Feb2021. She said they were bad nights. She said in regard to her sleeping, starting on 29Jan2021, she was restless, she had trouble getting sleep and trouble getting in a comfortable position. She woke up frequently. Saturday the sleeping was a little worse, but she did sleep. She said on Sunday, 31Jan2021, and Monday, 01Feb2021, she hardly got any sleep. The sensations spread to her arms and it probably started a little on Saturday night, but Sunday and Monday it was very noticeable. She started Gabapentin; it was one a day before bed. The leg symptoms were still there last night. The sensations in her arms were not much at all. She did get up once with the leg cramp and was feeling tightness in her left leg but it never went into a cramp. The cramp was in her right leg, which was unusual because it was usually in her left leg. She stated she was unsure if her symptoms were starting to subside or if the Gabapentin had an immediate effect. The events did not require a visit to physician or ER. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose (1.8 cc but unsure ((heard that but could be wrong) recommended dose)) as works with COVID positive patients. Medical history was none. No concomitant medications. Caller just wanted to know if she could take Tylenol for mild symptoms after having the COVID 19 vaccine. She received the vaccine yesterday. She was wondering if it would make the symptoms a little less. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. The side effects started last night. On 11Jan2021, she was expecting arm soreness, but this was worse. She developed it about 6 hours after the shot. This was the sorest her arm has ever been from any injection, and she had had a lot of them. Her arm was almost too sore to move. This morning, it was much better. It was really bad last night. She was also very achy, and experienced drowsiness, also has a very bad headache on 11Jan2021. The CDC website stated before the vaccine patients should not take Tylenol because it can tamper with the immune system response. It said it was alright to take after, but she just wanted to call to make sure. Investigation Assessment was no. The outcome of the event very achy was not recovered, of the events was recovering.

Patient stated that major headache went in on a &#34;Wednesday&#34;. Her husband and her did, and went through vaccination portal, to get an appointment, appointments were very trying, as they were to do all healthcare providers first, which is understandable, and then the vaccine. They were trying to make it available for teachers, as they are going back to school, in school learning in March, so all teachers were the next step and then also anyone over 65 was able to go on the portal with the state to get an appointment to go and get a vaccination. She and husband  have a daughter who was a teacher, and she said to go on the portal to get the shot, and they said they didn&#39;t have access to it, so she went on the site, and they got it in on 27Jan2021. The headache occurred after the 27Jan2021. Patient stated that as soon as they got home, her husband works full time, she lost her job in October, and she was home and he said &#34;how are you feeling&#34;, he went back to work, patient came home and said she felt alright except for her arm then she got a really bad headache. The husband came home and said he felt like crap, really bad, patient said she did too, she was the type of person she never ever gets sick and if he was sick she does not say she was sick. Patient had such a bad headache, she thought her brain was ready to jump out of her head. Headache subsided after two days. She has recovered completely from the headache. Cough started almost immediately (27Jan2021), but patient did not cough today, but did last night, it was usually a deep cough. Today she has not coughed at all. Chills started probably that evening (27Jan2021), when she came home, the shot was around 1PM and chills started in the evening, and went away probably, they had gone back and forth for around two days  but they were gone, she has recovered completely. Patient wished to add that they were both so fatigued, so tired, almost like, both she and her husband were very active, when they were down for the count, really exhausted, after this whole vaccination experience, both of them have been exhausted, to the point of going to bed at 8, and they were not 8:00 going to bed people. she doesn&#39;t want to be a pain, as she knows people have legit concerns, Patient doesn&#39;t want to waste time, her main concern is the second vaccination, if she does not have to, or is suggested to not take it, or her husband, she doesn&#39;t want the second vaccination to cause more severe side effects. The patient further reported, that they both experienced major side effects: chills, headaches, sore throat, major cough, fatigue that was &#34;just unbelievable, both of us are exhausted.&#34; Her second dose is scheduled on 17Feb2021 and his husband is scheduled on 20Feb2021. Patient was asking &#34;if this was after the first dose, what&#39;s going to happen after the second dose?&#34;. Outcome of the events headache and chills was recovered in 2021 for cough was recovered on 02Feb2021 while for other events was unknown.

A 67-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at single dose in her left arm for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no investigation assessment. It was reported that it had been 24 hours, she received her first bnt162b2 (reported as Pfizer COVID vaccine), yesterday (on 06Jan2021), and she was wondering, her arm was sore on 07Jan2021, which she thought was normal and fatigue on 06Jan2021, she got right away, she didn&#39;t know if that was normal, but she got a metallic taste in her mouth on 06Jan2021. It felt like a metallic taste when she swallows, a little metallic taste, yesterday (on 06Jan2021) was more than today, it was after the vaccine, about 7 hours after. She thought in her head, like the aluminum chewing gum, when kids chew it, it had a metallic taste, like the (company name withheld) wrapper she used to chew on it. Provides she was shrinking. Provide she was wearing stretch pants when providing weight. She Googled and didn&#39;t see the metallic taste, the only thing she saw with metallic taste is if you have the actual virus, she didn&#39;t have it, she was fine. Maybe it was all in her head. Arm was sore not right away, it built up, like when you stretch like with the flu shot, she lifted and it&#39;s sore, and she felt sleepy. It was like with the flu shot, it took a few days to go away. Last night on 06Jan2021, she was very sleepy, she was kind of sleepy, but it could be watching the Capitol and insanity, but she was yawning a lot more, her eyes felt heavy, she was ok, she had an appetite and is fine, she would drink (company name withheld) now. Thought she was peaking with it, she would go to sleep early today (07Jan2021), her eyes were still heavy, she wanted to close them and took a nap, but couldn&#39;t. It was like her saliva has a metallic taste in her mouth, it may be in her head, she googled to see side effects and when they start, it may be going soon, who knows, she was just wondering. The taste was worse yesterday (06Jan2021), and it wasn&#39;t IV or anything like that, the patient wanted to know how can that be. She had to go back on the 27th for her second dose. She had been tested and retested on an unspecified date, and it was offered for those 65 and over, and she was lucky to get an appointment. The outcome of the event metallic taste was recovering; the events fatigue and eyes heavy was not recovered; the outcome of the rest events was unknown.

                                                Vertigo started after lying down the same night of getting the vaccine.  Vertigo continued every night and was accompanied by nystamus upon waking each morning.  Symptoms continued for the first several hours after awakening then would gradually get better and was much lighter during the day.  Would return every night and next morning and this continued for the next 7 days.   My head felt like it was in a fog and it seemed harder to think.  It was also very sinus like.  No nasal congestion, no post nasal drip, no cough, but my head felt thick and full.  I had headaches which I never get.  I took my blood pressure to be sure and it was normal.  I took Claritin (without the D), Flonase alone and then also Dymista, did the Neti pot, and took Ibuprofen.  Headache got better but still had the head fog.  Today is post vaccine day 8 and I finally woke up this morning feeling better.  Hope it lasts but I answered &#34;Unknown&#34; to Item 20 below because it&#39;s too soon to tell.

But at 4:30 am  2/22/2021 I was awakened by intense  itching on my left arm and hand.  Over the next 2 hours the itching increased in intensity and progressed to my right arm and hand, over my upper back and shoulders, and along the back of my thighs and buttocks.        I took 2 Benadryl allergy tablets (25mg) and used Benadryl GEL extra strength on the affected areas.  This resulted in my sleepiness for the remainder of the day. Contacted my physicians office for an appointment to resolve the issue.

A 67-year-old female patient received her first dose bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9262; expiration date: unknown) at vaccination age of 67-year-old via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 09:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure (blood pressure abnormal), cholesterol (blood cholesterol) and several bypass surgeries. She mentioned that she was pretty healthy for her age. Family history included father died of heart disease and her sister has heart disease. Concomitant medication included unspecified blood pressure and cholesterol medication. The patient has no previous vaccination within 4 weeks and did have other vaccines given on the same day. The patient reported that she did not feel bad on the first day, but she started getting a cough on Saturday night (30Jan2021) and on Sunday (31Jan2021), she started getting a really bad headache with aches all over. This morning (02Feb2021), she is running a low-grade fever (99.4F). She added that now she was sick, she has a low-grade fever, chills, is hurting all over, all the things on the list. She inquired if these are common side effects of the vaccine and was asking if she should get tested to see if she&#39;s diagnosed with COVID-19. She inquired will her getting the shot effect the results of the COVID test, would she test positive for COVID now that she&#39;s had the shot. It is confirmed she has not tested positive for COVID. She did have 2 tests previously in Dec2020 before and after traveling. She further explained that she didn&#39;t feel bad until Saturday night and that is when she started with nagging cough. The aching all over started on Sunday (31Jan2021), feeling like she had been run over by a truck. She hadn&#39;t had a fever until this morning (02Feb2021), she woke up with a low-grade temperature of 99.4. She has been taking acetaminophen (TYLENOL) that helps. The call also notes later in the call that her head has been hurting really bad and this started yesterday (01Feb2021 [also reported as 31Jan2021]). It is remarked that she will probably be tested if the vaccine doesn&#39;t affect the results. The adverse events did not require emergency room or physician office. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

She had the same symptoms for both first and second dose (unspecified symptoms), but the second dose has really messed up her mind. Patient probably won&#39;t have a mind.

Clarified when caller states it messed up her mind, he is referring to the patient being mean. Stated patient did have a headache, but wasn&#39;t hateful. Stated patient&#39;s mind is so bad, she is just mean. If patient doesn&#39;t get help soon she is going to tell herself good night. Patient stated in background &#34;If I don&#39;t get my mind back I&#39;m going to end up killing myself because he made me.&#34; At 11PM last Wednesday (24Feb2021), patient starting losing her mind. Confirmed with caller that patient is currently having suicidal thoughts. Patient used to be a real nice lady and blames this on the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient is afraid she is not going to get her mind back. Advised caller to seek emergent medical attention for the patient. Patient is against everybody now because of the crazy COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient heard in the background stating the COVID-19 Vaccine screwed up her mind. Caller stated patient is quite upset with everybody. Patient is not acting normal.

That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

A 68-year-old female patient received first single dose BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 29Jan2021 15:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated, &#34;I got the vaccine yesterday about 3 pm and I came home and I had dinner and sat down to watch TV at 9 O&#39; clock, I turn the program on and I was out like a &#39;light&#39; and this stuff knock me out (onset date: 29Jan2021). My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                That evening, 2/17/21, I got home ate some soup in bed  soon after, slept 10 hours! The next morning went to work and then around 9:30 the chills started, checked my temp 99.8  decided to take myself home, at took temp again, 101.7  then an hour later 102.7  where it remained for the rest of 2/18/21.  By the next morning no more chills and temp 97.6.  I do have a lingering headache on both sides of my head which meanders down my neck. The site of the injection is still sore and seems to have moved 3 inches down my arm. And there is also a lingering phlegm problem building up at the back of my throat.

                                                Patient is a 68 y/o female who enrolled in program on 9/19/2018 who began monotherapy treatment with Pioglitazone 15mg PO on 10/5/2018. Patient called study team stating that she received her second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on 02/19/21.  Afterwards, she had a sore arm and slept most of the next day.  On 02/21/21, she experienced severe right-sided leg weakness and fell while attempting to go to the bathroom.  She was unable to ambulate and her son took her to the emergency room. She was hospitalized overnight for a serious adverse reaction to the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.  Multiple sclerosis exacerbation was ruled out after extensive testing. Then, she was transferred a Rehab facility on 02/22/21 for physical therapy and occupational therapy.  She continues study medication without any missed doses.  She will most likely be in Rehab for another week.  She was able to walk 80 feet on 2/25/2021 with a walker and gait belt and ambulatory assistance. This is unrelated to study drug. We consider this to be a Non-UP SAE.  As of 3/4/2021 the patient is still in rehab.

                                                she is having confusion and dementia,; went into this kind of like dementia-like state where she talked incessantly/ she is having confusion and dementia,; She had days of vomiting and nausea; She had days of vomiting and nausea; She complained of brain fog and couldn&#39;t focus on the tv or her programs; kidney functions were not good enough; she has mood swings; she could not remember or know everything from the present; she had a UTI; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s sister). A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular injection on 20Jan2021 (at the age of 68-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing breast cancer stage IV, patient was in treatment for breast cancer stage IV, she had cancer 13 years prior the report in 2008, and then was found again and diagnosed 3 years prior the report, in Jun2018; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a long time, a lot of her adult life. The patient was on oxygen; she had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer; patient tested positive for COVID in 2020 (Feb2020 or Mar2020, as reported). She and her roommate tested positive and had a cough. They had no fever or other symptoms. Both in the nursing home got over the cough and 21 days later tested negative. Patient tested negative for COVID ever since. The nursing home tested the residents and staff every week. They had tested the patient so much to the point her nose was bloody which the reporter got upset about; hallucinations and paranoid thoughts. Concomitant medications included ongoing perphenazine (TRILAFON) taken for hallucinations and paranoid thoughts; treatment for breast cancer stage IV and oxygen. The patient lived in nursing facility and had received both Pfizer vaccine doses. The patient received the first vaccine for COVID-19 immunisation in Dec2020. She was fine. She got the second one on 20Jan2021. Since patient received the 2nd vaccine dose, in Jan2021, she was having confusion and dementia, which was not an issue before the vaccine doses. The patient was having trouble putting words together. Patient initially had vomiting, nausea and brain fog where she could not concentrate on her TV, in Jan2021. She was hospitalized from 17Feb2021 to 20Feb2021 to have all kinds of tests run and see if her cancer had spread to her brain. Patient had 3 years with stage 4 breast cancer and had fought so hard and was aware of her confusion and it was very upsetting to her. She had days of vomiting and nausea. She complained of brain fog and could not focus on the tv or her programs. Within days, she went into this kind of like dementia-like state where she talked incessantly and could not get a thought completed. Patient would go from one thought to the next. It was very bizarre. She had never had this kind of issues. This went on for so long, they finally put her in the hospital. Patient had stage 4 breast cancer, and the doctors thought maybe her cancer had gone to her brain. The doctor did not think it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was checked for a urinary tract infection (UTI), for brain cancer, for a stoke, for everything. She saw so many doctors. She still had not come out of this a month later. She was currently on psych meds because she had mood swings, since Jan2021. It had been one thing after another. The patient could not tell the time. On some level, patient knew something was wrong. She was in a very confused state. She did not know how to tell anyone what she wanted to tell. It was very distressing to say the least. She had made a little bit of progress. She could tell time with some struggling but she got upset and cried. Patient could only tell that the time was 3, but not 3:15. But, then she cried and got upset. She had been able to tell time a couple of times, but if you asked her what day was it, she had no clue. She had no clue what day it was and would ask &#34;what day is it?&#34; Her moods all over the place. The patient was still very confused. The reporter explained the patient could be 5&#39;3&#39;&#39;, she was unsure. The reporter really did not know the patient weight, she was guessing around 270lbs. She had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer, and reporter had not seen her since COVID started. Patient told that her weight was up around 300lbs. The reporter declined to include a healthcare professional for the report, stating she had not spoken to her sister&#39;s primary care doctor. She was waiting for her to call back. The patient was sent to the ER and admitted into the hospital on 17Feb2021. She came back from the hospital on 20Feb2021 at 6:30pm. She had a CAT scan, MRI, bloodwork done, in Feb2021. She saw a psychiatrist, neurologist, her oncologist. There was so many doctors seeing her and talking to the reporter. The last doctor the patient saw in the hospital said that she thought the patient was dehydrated from her vomiting episodes, but did not know for sure. In Feb2021, the nursing home did blood tests and a urinalysis to see if she had a UTI. The blood work would have shown if patient was dehydrated and she was not. The head nurse thought it was the vaccine, but she was not sure. Everybody was not sure. No one could tell her anything concrete about patient. She was not normally like this. Patient had recovered completely from the nausea and vomiting. They tried for a while to give her an anti-nausea medicine, but she could not keep anything down. It was given to her orally, she did not know why an injection was not given. This lasted for a few days, clarified as maybe 3 days. The reporter had no name, NDC, lot number or expiry date for the anti-nausea medicine the patient took. She knew it was given to her once and when they tried to give it to her again, patient refused. Reporter had no product information to provide for the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, did not have the patient vaccine record card. This would be with the nursing facility. She mentioned patient went into the nursing home on Jan2018 and then was diagnosed with breast cancer Jun2018. She did not know if there were any interactions there with the patient having the breast cancer and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The reporter had no product information for the first dose. When probed for the date in which the first dose was given, she explained she was sent constant emails which could have provided a date, but she did not know this information offhand. It was approximately a month before the second dose, or it could have been on 27Dec2020, which was a little closer than a month apart. No additional vaccines were administered on the same date of the Pfizer vaccine. The events required a visit to emergency room. Patient had constant testing while in the hospital. In the hospital, in Feb2021, they did MRI and CAT scan to see if the breast cancer had gone to the brain and both were negative. They tested for UTI. They did the first UTI test at nursing home in 2021 and they said she had a UTI and patient was put on an antibiotic. They tested her again for a UTI when she was admitted into the hospital in Feb2021 and they said she did not have a UTI. She did have a buildup of urine in her bladder because her kidney functions were not good enough for the MRI at first, in Feb2021. Her bladder was relieved of the urine build up and her kidney functions improved and she was able to get the MRI. The MRI did not show any cancer in the brain. None of it relieved her symptoms. This was just bizarre. It happened within a week of receiving the vaccine. She could not talk with patient and patient had never been like that. The patient had always been lucid and open and you could talk about anything: the past, the present, she had no problems. She could remember everything crystal clear from the past but she could not remember or know everything from the present. The reporter would ask her what day was it and the patient did not know. The patient would absorb the information she was told but there was like this strange disconnect, almost like a dementia of some form. About concomitant medications, the reporter explained the patient had not started anything new. She had been on the same stuff for many years. She had psych meds that she had been on, but she had been on those for many years. She clarified further that patient had been stable on her psych meds for many years, and the nursing facility had the patient stable for 3 years at the nursing home. At the time of the report, her mood swings were all over the place, she had never had that before. She had hallucinations and paranoid thoughts in the past, but she had never had mood swings like this and never had dementia. She had been on the same medications for a long time, but they were currently trying to play with them and trying to adjust her psych meds. It was apparent it was not working and this was something more organic, something going on in her body. The psych med was perphenazine all of her life. The psych nurse was a new nurse and was not familiar with the patient. The psych nurse informed the reporter she raised the perphenazine to the highest dose she could possible go on and told she could have to try the patient on a mood stabilizer and could have to put her in a psych unit. The reporter would not have any NDC, lot numbers or expiration dates, or anything like that. The reporter had been told an UTI could have caused the patient symptoms. It could have been brain cancer, or this or that. She did not know what was going on. Reporter asked if there had been any reports or had other people called in with these types of reactions or adverse events. The patient had recovered from vomiting and nausea on an unknown date in 2021, had recovered from kidney functions were not good enough and UTI in Feb2021, the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 68-year-old female patient the second dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN5318) on 04Feb2021 at 1:00 on Left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was ongoing Arachnoiditis (this is a spinal cord disease). Concomitant drugs were not reported. Historical Vaccine was 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL1283) on 15Jan2021 administered in left arm for covid-19 immunization. She was calling to report a severe reaction that occurred after the second injection. On 05Feb2021 she started to have extreme chills with teeth chattering at 3 AM. She knew this could be part of the symptoms. At 6 AM on 05Feb2021 she got up and with her husband&#39;s assessment who is also is a doctor it was determined by her husband she was in a cytokine storm that attacked her spinal cord disease. The extreme chills ended within a couple of hours on 05Feb2021. The cytokine storm has pretty much resolved. It is still there, but better. She still has fatigue. However, the extreme pain, mental fog, and disconnect that came with it has all subsided. Caller stated she knows from research and talking to other people most people might have the chills after the COVID Vaccine. The chills is not the severe side effect she is referencing as severe. The Cytokine storm reaction for her wit her spinal cord disease is unexpected and not normal. This was the severe event. No Emergency Room visited. Physician&#39;s Office visited for Cytokine Storm. She should have gone to the hospital, but she did not want to go. Seven days after event started, she went to her physician. This was as soon as she was able to get up and get out of the house. Treatment was mainly self-treating. Her husband is a doctor and they did what they needed to do at home. These side effects were pretty horrific. Outcome of the event cytokine storm was recovering, for fatigue was not recovered, for other events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information expected.

                                                She had the vaccine at the facility where she lives.  She fainted less than 24 hours after the vaccine, got up from that and had dry heaves, lost her speech and had loose stools.  The aide caught her as she was fainting as she would have fallen on the floor.  She said it was weird, she looked at people and it looked like they were 2 dimensional and knew something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t figure out what as they attended to her.  They asked her questions, but she was not able to speak to them.   They apparently spent 2 hours with her, but she doesn&#39;t believe it was that long, and then they knew she wanted to go to one Hospital and not the other.  She had been loosing words before this happened, but not as bad as this one.  This was about the same reaction that she had when she got the COVID virus in January.  She was then taken to the hospital where she was given fluids and hydrated her and checked her heart, saw a cardiologist and a neurologist to see if those things caused the fainting and had blood work done.  They also did a CAT Scan of her head and neck.  They told her that she was fine and was discharged back home after 5 days, which was 3/11/21.  Since then she has been very tired, she does have GERD and her stomach has been hurting a lot as well.

I knew there was potential for side effects before taking the vaccine...I was totally unprepared for so many symptoms and how intense they were and what little I could do to relieve any of them. Never had fever that I am aware of. Today I?m weak and sweating is unreal.  ?? Should I prepare/expect my second dose around Feb. 14 to have the same effect on me.? Not looking forward to that. I was almost ready to go to the ER I was getting so dehydrated and weak.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 14Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included left hip replaced on 16Nov2020 and had her right hip replaced on 29Dec2020. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported that she got the shot at 1:30 pm and on the way home she started getting tired and exhausted on 14Jan2021. She got home and went right to bed. She felt like she couldn&#39;t stay awake, fell asleep and woke up about 6 pm then with a temperature of 105.5 and stated it would fluctuate between 104-105. She was just feeling horrible. At 7:30 pm, patient had a temperature of 103.5 and at 7:45 pm, her temperature was 104. On 14Jan2021, patient stated that she couldn&#39;t see straight, had blurred vision, having trouble walking, her balance was off and falling into walls. Her body was jerking and the arm that she got the injection in was dropping. Patient called her cardiology office, and was advised to take Tylenol 3-4 times per day and alternate it with Motrin. She was also taking coated 325 mg aspirin. She can hold her head up and was not jerking as much as she was. She was doing noticeably better. Patient had put ice bags on her groin, stomach and throat to try to cool down through the night. This brought temperature down to 103. She woke up at 12 am she was 102. Her temperature at the time of report was around 101-102. She took her blood pressure it was going crazy, first it was up around 163/71 and then over time it was really low 118/58 and heart rate was 130 for a while and went to 103. The back of her neck still felt so weak and she still feels extremely weak and exhausted. She went on to report that her HR was high and B/P was up but since then it has come down. The night of 14Jan2021, her b/p was low.On 14Jan2021, patient was also real thirsty and her urine was darker and was probably dehydrated and thought that she was real jerky muscle-wise, like she is not in control of anything last night. That she has not taken BP or heart rate on 15Jan2021, but it was not pounding today though. She was doing better today at the time of report. Patient was recovering from the events of fever, blurred vision, and balance was off; not recovered from tired, jerking, and dehydration. Outcome of remaining events was unknown.

                                                I give the girl in front of me the Covid vaccine way high on her arm. I told MA do not give my shot that high up. She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times. I still have ongoing pain 24 seven and I want to report a complaint against the girl who gave my shot I thought she was an LPN but she is a MA.  We both work at healthcare clinic. I am a 26 year RN and she did not listen to me and she stuck me anyway against my will.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in the left shoulder area on 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included COPD (has it for lots of years) and nickel sensitivity. She does not have any reactions to her previous unspecified vaccines but had a normal reaction like sore arm. Concomitant medication included bimatoprost (LUMIGAN).  The patient previously received flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, both for immunization in 2020 around the end of Sep or beginning of Oct. The patient reported side effects regarding the COVID vaccine and said she was a little confused and unsure if she was having a problem or if she should see a doctor. On 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM, she had the first dose of the COVID vaccine and afterward she had a lot of effects which were mostly muscle and body aches in Jan2021. She also experienced some ongoing congestion in one nostril but saw this as just more congestion and that she was having to blow her nose more in Jan2021. She did the (app name) report but didn&#39;t report the stuffiness. She did report that in the first few days she felt like she was having the onset of pneumonia and felt tired and run down (Jan2021). Two days ago, she started feeling itchy (Jan2021) and she didn&#39;t know what it was, she didn&#39;t know if she ate something or what. Now she has developed a rash (Jan2021) which is ongoing until now. Her paperwork said the rash would happen right away if it was caused by the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if this is something she should be concerned about and if the rash could appear or started this long after she had the vaccine. Her second dose is due on 06Feb2021. The patient wanted to know if the vaccine contains nickel or any metal substances in it since she had compared her rash to her nickel sensitivity. The patient wanted to know if rash is a side effect from the vaccine and how long it will last. She didn&#39;t put rash down for the safety check either as she didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine. Today her rash, she is so itchy. She does have it on her neck and certain areas but not everywhere. It looks like what would happen after a bad fever. It is not raised but is like a fever type rash.  She did note that she had an increase dose of a medication eye drops (Lumigan; Lot: T and a 0 or O followed by 544, and NDC: 0023320503. Expiry: Jan2022) around the time the rash started but after getting the vaccine. Her head, neck and back are very itchy. She mentioned that she waited 2 days and did not put this event in the (app name). She would have reported it yesterday, but she didn&#39;t get one yesterday. She also noted that it was very dry there and cold and a person is going to get dry skin.  She does have an allergic to metal and wondered if that was in the product. In her neck area, it looks just like when she would wear a cheap necklace. No treatments received. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit.  The patient has no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient had not yet recovered from events rash/like a fever type rash and congestion in one nostril/stuffiness; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis, ongoing high cholesterol,  ongoing high blood pressure, celiac disease from 2005 (this has been tested too many times to count and it has been negative since after initial diagnosis 2005), arthritis (all her life) ongoing, hip replacement surgeries first done in 2005; repair of same hip in 2015; other hip in 2017. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.

It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 26Feb2021 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) and vitamin. The patient previously took BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunisation (first dose on the left arm at 01:30 PM, lot number: EL 1283); and SHINGRIX vaccine in 2019, codeine and cipro and experienced allergies. On 27Feb2021 03:30 PM, the patient experienced chills, fatigue &amp; then sudden nausea &amp; lightheadedness that resulted in passing out. Unfortunately, the patient fell on a tile floor &amp; hit her head resulting in a 1.5 inch gash in the back of her head.

The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the events which included CT scan, ekg, chest X-ray, bloodwk (unknown results) and Epley maneuver. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient is not pregnant. Outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL8982, unknown expiration), via injection in right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 prevention.  Medical history included ongoing vertigo (in car accident a little over 5 years ago, that affected a big nerve in left temple, and so every once in a while she will get vertigo so bad that she falls over), ongoing GERD (from a hiatal hernia; diagnosed many years ago), ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed about 15 years ago, ongoing bad cholesterol diagnosed 10 to 15 years ago, ongoing heart burn, ongoing hiatus hernia, and car accident a little over 5 years ago. Concomitant medications included ongoing omeprazole sodium (OMEPRAZOLE) for GERD, heart burn, and hiatal hernia (started this product at least 10 years ago; takes the product as needed if she is having heart burn or is going to eat spicy food); ongoing vitamin D3 for vitamin supplementation (started product about 8 months ago, because her doctor told her too, she guesses her vitamin was low); ongoing metoprolol for high blood pressure and to prevent stroke (started product at least 15 years ago; her BP could be regular but it could shoot up when she is upset, so she takes this to prevent stroke); ongoing hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure (started product at least 5 years ago); pravastatin for bad cholesterol  (started the product at least 4 or 5 or more years ago); and ongoing acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) to prevent stroke (has been taking this product forever, at least for 10 years).  The patient reported that she received the first COVID shot on 13Jan2021. She was okay on the 13th, 14th, and 15th. However, on the 16th (16Jan2021), she woke up and threw up once and was very dizzy for three days. She mentioned that she had like vertigo, she couldn&#39;t even walk, she had to crawl and her husband had to walk her around, she couldn&#39;t do anything. She had vertigo (16Jan2021). She was that way on Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, the patient&#39;s son took her to acupuncturist for her dizziness and was able to get up fine and walked away. After the acupuncture, she felt fine, like she was all better. On 19Jan2021 (reported as yesterday), she was fine. She woke up at midnight and had terrible acid reflux for 3 hours even though she had hardly eaten. She does take omeprazole for heart burn, and she had taken omeprazole earlier in the day, but it was just coming up, that acid and burning. She drank milk to coat the stomach and it went away at 03:00 AM. She had very bad chills/terrible chills (20Jan2021) and her teeth were chattering, she couldn&#39;t even talk, and couldn&#39;t control the chills. She is fine now. She clarified that she got vertigo from a car crash years ago and haven&#39;t had it in almost a year. Chills are not ongoing at this time, she has not had any for about 4 hours now, and she is hoping she is recovered completely, but it may be too soon to tell. She did not receive other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient is wondering if all this could be from the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if it is safe to take the second shot. She was scheduled to receive the second dose on 03Feb2021. The patient recovered from the events threw up on 16Jan2021; unable to walk and vertigo on 18Jan2021; dizziness on 19Jan2021; and terrible acid reflux on 20Jan2021. While unknown outcome for chills.

Patient received the first vaccination on the 15Jan2021 and she did not have any symptoms until Tuesday (19Jan2021), she started feeling kind of bad, she was very prone to allergies, she just thought it was back, this was her season to get sick if she had to get allergies, this was when it happened like January early February, so she went to Urgent care and she wanted a cortisone shot and she didn&#39;t think she should get a cortisone shot because it would effect the effectiveness of vaccine, so they said no and they would like to swab her nose to rule out that she didn&#39;t have COVID, and he did and it came out positive, so she wanted to get our opinion that if we thought it was a true positive or false positive. She thought she couldn&#39;t get COVID after she got the part of vaccine, and the second question she had was her second dose would be on 05Feb2021 by that she would be out of quarantine so should she plan and take the second one.

A 70-years-old female patient started to received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dystonia and migraines from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 antibody test positive from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medication for dystonia and migraines. The patient experienced a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; to her first dose of BNT162B2 in Feb2021. She had all-over body rash that was &#34;very red, like a tomato&#34; and showed up 35-40hours after her dose.  She states her doctor does not recommend she get the second dose. The patient meant by allergic reaction, she had a number of things, she experienced tiredness, injection site pain, joint muscle pain, she felt unwell, this all happened on the Saturday, the same day she got the vaccine on 13Feb2021. Then on Sunday 14Feb2021, all the symptoms she spoke about were still there and so she rested all day. On 15Feb2021, she looked at her elbows, clarifying the inside of elbow, her elbow creases, and on both elbow creases the skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen down to her thigh, it was working it&#39;s way down to the knee, the color was like a beet red, tomato color,  it was under the arms, started with elbow, was at her neck. The more down the redness spread, the more it red in color it also got. When she noticed this she called the doctor. When she called the doctor, the doctor said get over to the Emergency Room right away. Her husband and her were both on the phone and were telling the doctor that she doesn&#39;t want to go to hospital,  she asked if she can just come into the doctors office. The doctor said No. He told her that needs to get special lab work done, and he needs to send her information over to the ER. He said this could do possible damage to the kidneys. The doctor said lets not forget the last time she did a blood test, which was in Nov2020, at that time she came up positive with COVID antibodies. It could have been possible that she had COVID and was asymptomatic, or she had it. The doctor said that they need to do another COVID test or it could be she had a COVID cold or a cold with antibodies, her doctor doesn&#39;t know. The fact that she had that test that came back with COVID antibodies  test but not have COVID in Nov2020 was something to consider. He was concerned may be there is more to this, or just a rash. The doctor said that he is not equipped say what it should be. The doctor said he will speak with them at the hospital. Tiredness subsided yesterday afternoon on 15Feb2021, it subsided before she went to the ER visit. Right now, it&#39;s kind of like a lasting effect because she is not feeling normal. The injection site pain was still there but not as bad. The joint muscle pain subsided this afternoon around 1 o clock. It first began a half hour after leaving the stadium and she was experiencing it while driving back home, the pain continued and got worse. When she got up on Sunday morning her whole body was in pain, she was not getting better on Sunday and that&#39;s when she sat on couch rest of the day. For red skin, with the temperature of the skin, she didn&#39;t feel it to see if it was hot or anything, it was more this feeling that its just not going away getting worse, it didn&#39;t feel hot, there was no texture on the skin either. She just noticed she was flushed red. She called the doctor first, and he said that he was sending information to the emergency room. Then she went to (name of place withheld) ER.

She does not have her COVID CDC Card at the moment, her husband has that information but he is on a conference call with a client and she cant disturb him. The patient was scheduled for a second dose on 06Mar2021. That&#39;s where she has a question, the doctor is saying that he is not sure about getting second shot. They took lab work at the hospital and said everything was fine except for white blood cell count, it was on the lower side in Feb2021. She has had no vaccines on the same day or in the 4 weeks prior. She hasn&#39;t had any vaccines. She did have to visit the emergency room.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

On my way home at 25 minutes post injection I had an over-all body wave-type feeling (somewhat similar to a sustained hot-flash) and over-all disconcertingly odd feeling. This lasted about 4 minutes and was followed by shakiness that lasted about 5 minutes (total time a bit less than 10 minutes). Took my bp, pulse, O2 as soon as I got home (approximately 5 minutes post symptoms) and the readings were fine.

                                                Very tired after vaccination.  Went to sleep about 8 PM Sat 1/16 and slept most of the next 4 days.  Stomach  was queasy.  Unable to drink coffee.  Tried to push fluids and tried to just eat bland foods.  Would wake up sporadically but was unable to awaken enough to watch an entire TV show. Pretty lethargic and brain fog.  Was able to wake up a little more on Wed 1/20 but still had the queasy stomach.  Started getting Headache and Eye pain and severe upper leg  and lower back burning &amp; cramping, I tried taking tylenol which helped a little.  By Thursday  the pain was worse.  I was still tired  only walking helped the pain. It got worse if I sat down and extremely bad if I laid down to try to sleep. It&#39;s Friday morning &amp; I am planning to go to med check this AM.  Symptoms still ongoing

A 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9269), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at 10:40 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization, ibuprofen (manufactured by other company, strength: 200 mg, lot number: 7AE1784B, expiry date: Nov2018), oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 400 mg, as needed for an unspecified indication, hydrochlorothiazide (strength: 25 mg), oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 25 mg, once a day (about 8am) for high blood pressure, and valsartan (strength: 160 mg, expiration date: 11Nov2021), oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 160 mg, once a day (about 8am) for high blood pressure.

She is still having the swallowing and is continuing to drink water even at home. She also congested head, head felt congested, but not like pressure.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

A 72-year-old female received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose on 28Jan2021, 11:00 AM (lot number:EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient medical condition included right Bundle Branch Block, cardiac from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no known allergies. The patient concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and Upgraid. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in the left arm on 06Jan2021, 02:00PM (lot number: EL3249) at the age of 72 years for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested after the vaccination for covid-19. Twenty-four hours after vaccine received, on 29Jan2021 at 03:00 PM, the patient suddenly lost ability to speak intelligibly. The patient stated &#34;I was completely aware though a little &#34;foggy&#34;. Blood pressure 170/84. Friend present thought I was having a TIA and called 911. Ambulance came.  Within 25 minutes, my ability to speak returned slowly. By the time I got to the ER, (45 minutes after onset), my ability to speak had mostly returned.&#34; Many blood labs were drawn, CT of head done, MRI of head done. EKG done. No cause of incident or evidence of TIA seen. After 5 hours, the patient was discharged with orders to come back if symptoms reoccurred. The patient had a headache, scratchy throat, fatigue and body aches in 2021. Since then the patient had a variety of tests, labs and Dr. visits. Blood pressure has been higher than her normal of 120/80, at intervals during the day in 2021. Since no evidence of TIA has been found, the patient was wondering if there have been any other reports of this loss of speaking ability (aphasia) occurring with any other vaccine recipients. The patient received treatment for the events. The consumer considered the events as non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                vertigo;   This is a report from an interventional study sponsored by BioNTech, managed and reported by Pfizer on the sponsor&#39;s behalf. The subject was in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred. A 72-year-old female subject received first and second dose of blinded therapy vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO) on 31Aug2020 and 21Sep2020 respectively. She then received third dose of study vaccine (BNT162B2) on 13Jan2021 at 15:48 and fourth dose of study vaccine (BNT162B2) on 02Feb2021 at 11:50, both intramuscularly on left deltoid as single doses, all for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia from 2010 and ongoing, sleep apnea from 2010 and ongoing, left knee osteoarthritis from 2014 to 2017 (with left total knee arthroplasty), osteoporosis from 2016 and ongoing and basal cell carcinoma on nose in 2018. No concomitant vaccines or prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were received. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event (AE) was unknown. Ongoing concomitant medications included estradiol (ESTROGEL) as hormone replacement from 2019, denosumab (PROLIA) for osteoporosis from 2017, zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) for insomnia from 2010; and ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), zinc, vitamin B6, quercetin and glucosamine, all as health supplement from Mar2020.  On 03Feb2021, the subject experienced vertigo with serious criteria of medically significant and hospitalization. The event required a visit to emergency room. The clinical course was as follows: Around midnight on 03Feb2021, the subject did not feel well with severe chills. She got up out of bed and went to the bathroom. She experienced vertigo, fell and hit her head. She was found bleeding by her husband who called the ambulance. She was taken to the hospital and had 7 stitches placed. She was still in the hospital at the time of the report. The action taken in response to the event for study vaccine BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of event was not recovered.  The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event vertigo was related to the study vaccine but not related to concomitant drugs or clinical trial procedure.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event &#34;Vertigo&#34; is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  The information provided is very limited and mainly anecdotal. Results of the diagnostic workup during hospitalization are not available. The company considers there is not a reasonable possibility that the event, vertigo, is related to vaccine administration based on the latency, the circumstances and a possible role of concomitant medication zolpidem.  Pfizer&#39;s safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 15-JAN-2021 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Vertigo. Review of the database for the PT Vertigo had the following results: 2 serious clinical trial cases (0 of which were attributed to therapy) and 109 non clinical trial cases.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committee and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On 2/2/21 I developed chest pressure and irregular heart beat at 4:00 pm.  Went to ER and it spontaneously resolved while staff was telling me how they would treat it.  Gave me Metoprolol 5 mg IV with 500 IV fluids and discharged.  Then on 2/6/21 I slept poorly and felt very jittery and had more chest pressure but pulse was regular.  then on 2/8/21 at 6:00 am I awoke and felt terrible with chest pressure.  Took my blood pressure at home and it was  193/103, and I was very shaky.  Went to  ER where they did blood work, X-ray, and monitored my heart and blood pressure for 4 hrs.  Gradually my blood pressure came down, and my blood work and X-ray probed to be WNL.  I was discharged without medication change but had echocardiogram scheduled and follow-up  appt. with Cardiologist, on  zoom.  He started me on Flecainide 100 mg bid, and stress test on  2/24/21 and follow-up appt. with him on 3/3/21.  I also had a follow-up appt. with my GP the day after the first ER visit and she ordered more labs, and the echocardiogram.  I have continued to have feelings of fluttering and pressure in my chest off and on and they continued after my second vaccine.  But my heart has remained regular since starting the Flecainide.  But my blood pressure went up to 150/85 on 2/9/21 and again to 142/81 on 2/10/21 both times with feelings of jitteriness and pressure in my chest.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of 2 reports.  A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at the right upper arm close to the shoulder on 02Feb2021 07:30 at single dose as she doesn&#39;t want to get COVID again or give COVID to anyone else. Medical history included metabolic syndrome from 1994 and ongoing, it all started when she was 46 and it runs in her family and it was a genetic thing; ongoing diabetes mellitus, was diagnosed when she was 65, so 7 years ago; she had COVID in Nov2020 but it was just a very mild case and she just had a cough; and cardio artery problems. She takes a lot of medications and she has metabolic syndrome which includes cardio artery problems and diabetes, but she has taken all of those medications for a long time. The patient says she was calling to report a couple little concerns she has. She received her shot on Tuesday, 02Feb2021 at about 7:30 in morning and her arm started at about 2 to 3 in the afternoon and she noticed it was getting sore, but it was no big deal, she did not think anything of it, and on the second day she thought that was it and she was over it on 03Feb2021. She states her husband also mentioned that he had soreness in his arm after his vaccination. She says at three in the afternoon on 03Feb2021, she started feeling weak and shaky, but she didn&#39;t think much of that. She says this began around 3 to 4 when yesterday afternoon, 03Feb2021, she had a fever. She says she took her temperature and it was 100.4 and that all kind of was gone by the evening but when she woke up this morning, she was weak and shaky again. Today she got up and was weak and shaky and it never left, she was still weak and shaky. The patient mentions that she was diabetic so she can get weak and shaky when she needs to eat something, but she had just eaten, and she ate yesterday so she doesn&#39;t think it was caused by that. The patient says she thinks we should know that she was diabetic. She says then she could tell that she had a fever, so she took her temperature and it was 100.4 which for her was high. She states she didn&#39;t even have a fever when she had COVID. The fever began yesterday afternoon (03Feb2021). She says her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever and they felt that way so that&#39;s why she took her temperature. This was the highest it has been in years. She says last night she took her temperature again and the fever had gone away in 30 to 40 minutes, so she thought it was over. She took her temperature again before she called this morning, 04Feb2021 and it was 99.2, which was still a little hot for her. She says for her that&#39;s a fever. She was 96 and 97 usually. The patient says she still feels like she has a little fever. She was not someone who usually has a fever and it can be just a little bit of a fever for instance like this morning when she was 99.2. Her eyes were still feeling funny and burning this morning and that was why she took her temperature this morning. The outcome of the event arm was a little sore was recovered on 03Feb2021; feeling weak and shaky was not recovered; fever and her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021162089 Same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

A 73-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: SL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 12Jan2021 at 10:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took varicella zoster vaccine (SHINGLES VACCINE) for immunization and had a little reaction but just the normal things. On Tuesday morning, the patient got the COVID-19 shot and was fine. This morning (15Jan2021), the patient was not feeling great, has a slight headache, her breathing is heavier, and below her breast line is a tightness she can&#39;t really describe. The patient asked if these were a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine and wondering if this is normal. As a treatment for the events, the patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient asked if she can or should get a test, a COVID-19 test. It has been so many days since having the vaccine, 4 days later, she is wondering if she might have COVID-19. The patient isn&#39;t sure and is just asking a question. It is confirmed that she has not had a test or tested positive for COVID-19. The outcome of &#34;Not feeling great&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

A 73-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 10Jan2021 and didn&#39;t have a reaction, but had a slight pain in her arm on 10Jan2021. Her sore arm started on 11Jan2021. There was a sore spot and when she would pick up her arm it was sore and achy. No pain, but sore and achy. It lasted for a day or two. She didn&#39;t have any symptoms until Saturday the 16Jan2021, this past Saturday she thought she was dying. She had chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and had a headache. She thought she was losing her mind. The headache just stopped today. She had the chills that would not stop and she thinks she broke the sweat on Sunday (17Jan2021). She had a little nausea and couldn&#39;t eat anything on 16Jan2021. She had a terrible headache, which just stopped about 2 hours ago. She stated she must have to take 10 Tylenol over the course of time, every 4 hours. On Saturday 16Jan2021 she was just laying on the floor in pain. She was not even eating, just drinking water. All of her symptoms stopped this morning around 5 AM (18Jan2021). She had a big sweat. She is unsure if she had a fever because she does not have a thermometer. She is unsure if she has recovered completely from these symptoms. She feels weak, and is still weak (on Jan2021). She cannot go out or get dressed or shower. She is not strong enough. She is just sitting up now, no longer laying in bed. She couldn&#39;t walk (on Jan2021) and was afraid she was going to faint on 16Jan2021. She can walk a little bit now and feels a little bit better. She has been out of it for three days, She hasn&#39;t felt good. She asked if side effects can appear 6 days later? Is this normal to have a reaction 1 week after getting it? She asked are the side effects worse after the second dose? She asked is this Covid or side effects, what are the COVID symptoms? She asked should she take the second one if she had these side effects? Caller clarifies this is the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Whoever vaccinated her did not give her the paper about it afterwards. Her neighbor brought it to her cause they went together. She did not realize she could experience these things. She did not expect them a week after getting the vaccine. She thought she had COVID. She asks, &#34;do you think I have COVID?&#34; She is just now getting better and it has been 3 days of experiencing these symptoms. Should she get the second vaccine? She is trying to do the right thing. Event outcome of chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and headache was recovered on 18Jan2021, for was going to faint and couldn&#39;t walk was recovering, for weak was not recovered, while for others was unknown.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fever, being ill (deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks) and bug bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient is the type of person that takes a lot for her to take medications. She is allergic to a lot of things; she always has crazy reactions. She can&#39;t take morphine. It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn&#39;t think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn&#39;t breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can&#39;t describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn&#39;t drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn&#39;t take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn&#39;t like it. It wasn&#39;t like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, &#34;what is this Parkinson&#39;s?&#34;. She doesn&#39;t even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn&#39;t debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it&#39;s like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can&#39;t even think of what that area is, but it&#39;s the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don&#39;t atrophy or won&#39;t pull. She hasn&#39;t told anybody about it. She doesn&#39;t like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn&#39;t figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her &#34;brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep.&#34; On Monday she experienced, &#34;horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band.&#34; Stated that it wasn&#39;t a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of gas (flatulence), muscles became tight/contort, minor nausea, horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band and shingles. The outcome of the event &#39;the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot&#39; was not recovered while of the rest of the events was unknown.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer COVID vaccine), lot no. EL347, via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a health department because she was at high risk and she was 73. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient had an injection done 2 weeks, not this last Friday, the Friday before that. They had to make her wait for half an hour before she left and she was okay. Then Saturday (23Jan2021), she started feeling achy but to she was okay. Then Sunday (24Jan2021), she had a very bad experience, she went and start watching TV and she fell asleep. When she woke up, she didn&#39;t know what time, what date, nothing. And she looked at the time on her TV and it said 6:45, she didn&#39;t know if it was am or pm. And it was dark outside and she didn&#39;t know if it was Monday or Sunday. She was all confused, she called someone to make sure what day and time and all and still she was still confused. And then she had to call her aunt and then she told her no it&#39;s Sunday and it&#39;s night time and so on. Then she got better. Then during the week she didn&#39;t have that much body ache, she expected that because that was in that papers. Then today is Sunday, Friday morning (29Jan2021) she got up and she coughed, when she coughed it was blood in that cough couple of times. Then her daughter came over and took her to the hospital (hospitalization details were not clarified). She had lab work the day they took her in the emergency room. At the hospital, they did all kind of tests, on top of that her leg, her left leg swelled up from her feet to all the way up, all the way up. They thought that it could have been some blood clot. And they took test and all and nothing, everything was okay. They couldn&#39;t find out why her whole leg was swollen. On top of that, they did chest x-ray and they did something else she can&#39;t remember, another test. And they took all kind of blood work and all. And they did to see if she had the virus, the COVID. And yesterday they called her from the hospital and they said that she didn&#39;t have the virus. And she asked them about the blood work and they told her if there was anything more than they would call her. So, she thinks all this came from that injection. She called because this was not guaranteed if this was from injection. When confirmed that COVID test was negative and blood work report was not out, she stated they haven&#39;t called her that meant her blood work was okay. The swollen leg has been gone down and blood once in a while she sees a little bit. They gave her 2 prescriptions, one was antibiotic and one is steroid. Due date for the next shot is 12Feb2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 74-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 20Jan2021 at 9:30-9:45 am at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included exposure to radiation from 2017 to an unknown date and did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017). There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included two doses of shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) for Immunization and experienced shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain after the vaccine. The patient experienced bad headache (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, Severe shaking chills (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, muscles and joints ached (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, couldn&#39;t hold a cup to drink on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, painful bilateral lower back pain on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, cough/dry cough on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of not recovered (reported as worsened), strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, taste started to diminish on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, pharangitis on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, couldn&#39;t get warm on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the patient received the COVIED in the morning of 20Jan2021. By 5pm she had developed a headache, severe shaking, chills, muscle and joints pain, severe lower back pain, and a dry cough; she was miserable. A few years ago after her double dosing of the shingles vaccine she had a similar reaction of shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain. She has no product details for that product, no NDC, Lot, or expiry to provide. The patient confirmed that the shingles shot was 2 doses, not a double dose given at one time. When asked a seriousness criteria it was explained that the symptoms that started on the 20th, she felt they were disabling. She couldn&#39;t get warm, stop shaking, couldn&#39;t hold a cup and the pain was severe and she has high tolerance for pain. By around 3pm that day on the 21Jan2021 everything but the dry cough had resolved, and that had gotten worse. She also developed new symptoms. She had strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic and her sense of taste started to diminish. She did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017, She has no product information, NDC, Lot or Expiry for that radiation but after that she did have taste, some of it did come back. On the 21Jan2021, it was less, the sense of taste and now today she has no taste at all. For the muscle and joint pain she took Aleve. She was told if she was feeling worse over the weekend to go to the ER or urgent care. The patient was wondering and thinking this was her normal response to the vaccine just like she had a normal response that shingles vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

                                                Dizziness; history included compromised immune status; history included compromised immune status; getting really tired/fatigue; Gets real sweaty; chills; almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office; Nausea; Felt cold; Blood in urine; Feeling unwell; Feeling bad; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 75-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1686), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 15:45 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Leighten Plantar Alopecia (hair follicle is an enemy), skin infection (infection in body most of the time, at least on skin), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, obesity, autoimmune disorder (diagnosed 8 months ago). She has lost some height, prior to taking the vaccine and she said it was related to age. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced feeling unwell on 10Jan2021; blood in urine on 10Jan2021 at 17:00; nausea at 10:00, chills at 11:00, almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office at 10:00, felt cold - all on 11Jan2021; getting really tired/fatigue on 14Jan2021 at 09:30; gets really sweaty on 13Jan2021 at 10:00; and dizziness on unknown date. The patient had the first shot on Friday (08Jan2021). On Sunday (10Jan2021), she started feeling bad. She was feeling good about getting it and had no reaction. She has an autoimmune disorder that made her a little afraid to take, but with all the indications, they said it would be much better for her to take it than to get the COVID virus. Sunday (10Jan2021), she does not feel good. So, she started having blood in urine. She thought she had a UTI and had not had one in 20 years. It felt like that is what she had and with the blood in urine. She just took Tylenol and waited until Monday morning because she does not like sitting in doctor&#39;s office. They gave her a cup to give sample and said she didn&#39;t need to see provider. They will have it checked and in the meantime call in a prescription. It kept getting worse and worse. She was about to passed out in the doctor&#39;s office on 11Jan2021, she got nauseous and almost threw up. She got in the car with her husband and he was trying to get her home. She got chills and got so cold and could not warm her body up. Her husband gave her Phenergan and it kind of knocked her out for a while to ease her nausea. She was thinking of going later today (14Jan2021), when she gets enough energy, to get a COVID test. She does not know if it will give false positive or not. She had chills and now she gets sweaty since 13Jan2021. She took her temperature and she did not have one. She just now got up. It is 10:00. She got up this morning (14Jan2021) and was really tired. She was not sweating this morning. Tiredness is kind of new, and when she talked to the nurse, she sort of felt like maybe it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine, but then she talked to her daughter and she said the symptoms she was having are usually symptoms that occur with second dose of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for people to have symptoms she was having. She wanted to know if she should have a COVID test. If she has had just one shot, would the test give a false positive coming from the COVID. They were asking if patient should take the second dose, and should she continue her UTI medication. Doctor&#39;s visit to give urine sample on 11Jan2021 (results: negative for UTI). She did not see a doctor though. They sent sample and prescribed a sulfa based medication for a UTI. She did start feeling a little better and stopped having blood in her urine. She plans to continue it because she does not like to stop taking an antibiotic. She did not have any clue that it was not a UTI until the nurse from her provider&#39;s office called to tell her results of urine sample was negative. Outcome of event getting really tired/fatigue was not recovered; events almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office, blood in urine, chills, and gets really sweaty was recovering; and unknown for other events.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

They did a very thorough work up to check on her heart and Aorta. They managed her severe pain with two doses of morphine followed by two days of Dilaudid. The imaging and symptoms left her with a newly discovered diagnosis of Pericarditis. The medical professions were sure this was a result of the COVID vaccine. They continued to treat her for a few days and sent her home with anti inflammatories to help. She continues to have muscle pain, weakness and shortness of breath when she walks. She is scheduled to take her 2nd dose on February 5th but we are very concerned and hesitant as we don&#39;t want to cause any more damage to her heart.
