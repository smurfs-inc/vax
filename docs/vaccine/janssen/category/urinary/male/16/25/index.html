                                                The patient had a needle phobia and was very anxious prior to the vaccine. Once the patient received the vaccine, he waited in the waiting area for 15 minutes post-vaccine. About 5 minutes after the vaccine, he notified the pharmacy staff that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and he was feeling faint. The pharmacy staff provided him with a glass of water and was monitoring him. He said he  felt like he fainted and wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he felt warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided him with an ice pack. He then notified the pharmacy staff that he urinated in his chair while waiting post-vaccine. He wanted to be checked out and wanted us to call 911 . The patient began to feel better after about 20 minutes. The EMT arrived and checked the patient. Even though, the patient was feeling better, the EMT recommended the patient be checked further anyways. He was brought to the Triage center and was there for about 1 hour, according to the patient, and was feeling better. He said he felt slightly fatigued that day and the following day, but other than that he was feeling back to normal and no issues. He stated he has severe needle phobia and has experienced these fainting spells and anxiousness in the past. We followed up with the patient and he provided this information to us. He stated he was feeling good and back to normal. He had no further questions or concerns. We told him to follow up with us if questions or concerns came up.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

He had his eyes open but was unconscious for about 1 minute. Then he released his bladder and peed on himself. The pharmacist noticed and came over then he responded and was consious again. Then he began to sweat excessively all over his body. His face turned pale and the pharmacist began taking his blood pressure which dropped very low. He then began to feel nauseated. Then he started to get body chills. We monitored my husband there for another 30min and he slowly was coming back to his normal self. He had a small headache but was fine enough to leave.

I also noticed my heart rate was extremely high (on average 140 bpm, the highest was 225 bpm); this was also accompanied by chest pains which seemed like they were on the right side of my heart; I also had difficulty controlling my bladder and would randomly start to urinate. I had taken two Advil then slept.  The next day (~9 am) my fever went down but 3 hours later it had gone back up to ~101, I eventually kept cooling myself (removing shirt, fan on high, etc.) and took one Advil and my temperature started to get normal.  For about two days after that, I had pain in my left shoulder - but this was where the injection took place so I wasn&#39;t too worried. Currently I am feeling fine, but the initial day getting the vaccine was quite harrowing - I was quite worried I was going to have a heart attack.

                                                I ended up with a Kidney stone two weeks after taking the vaccine. I had intense pain in my right kidney and it was very painful overnight and the following day the nursing line advised that I go to the Doctor&#39;s office (stayed home and went to the Doctor&#39;s office for testing the next day). My Doctor advised that I passed the stone and to change my diet so it doesn&#39;t happen again).
