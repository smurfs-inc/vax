                                                Experienced moderate debilitating flu symptoms day after vaccination and recovered the following day.  Over one week later (3/25) developed skin sensitivity on the neck which later spread to back, torso, and legs.  Skin sensitivity persists still one week after onset, is a severe chafing feeling when skin comes into contact with clothing.  No rash or any visual signs.  Along with the skin sensitivity, mild to moderate chills from day to day as well as muscle fatigue and upper/lower back pain.  Symptoms varied in severity day to day; used ibuprofen and it seemed to offer limited, temporary relief.  Concurrent with second onset of symptoms, noticed gradual abdominal inflammation and developed sensation similar to UTI but urine dip and lab test results were all normal.  Doctor concluded immune reaction to vaccine as no other allergies or changes in routine as well as no prior medical history of any of these symptoms. Prescribed daily prednisone for three days to calm immune response; after one day symptoms were greatly improved.  Abdominal inflammation has improved and UTI sensation improved.  Still experiencing slight chills and skin sensitivity unchanged.

                                                Patient was vaccinated at a pharmacy around 9AM in the morning.  An hour later, he was driving on a highway, had a syncopal event and was involved in a single-vehicle MVC where his vehicle struck a guardrail and rolled twice.  Patient was brought to the ED at Hospital where he was evaluated by me in the ED.  Patient had a normal mental status (GCS 15) and was alert and oriented on exam.  He did have some bruising to his forehead from the airbag.  Patient denies feeling ill or lightheaded after receiving the vaccine and reports the syncopal event came on very suddenly.

There were scattered faint ground-glass opacities along the right upper lobe as well as left upper lobe.  COVID-19 testing was added on after results.  At this time I do not have a great explanation for the patient&#39;s hematuria.  I did instructed to follow up with Urology for further evaluation of this.

At that point, started getting chills, which progressed into mix of chills and hot spells, fever, headache, and frequent urination throughout the night (though was also hydrating a lot).  Had fever the next morning still and Diarrhea.  Still feel modest headache and chills the next evening (before bed where I had felt the worst overnight the first night of the vaccine) but feeling better than the first night.  Per the form I received, I was told to include Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA in this section of the form.  I am reporting this on the day after the vaccination, so don&#39;t yet know final outcome, but again, improving and don&#39;t feel like I need medical attention.

I still feel a little queasy every now and then. She wanted a stool sample, but I was too dehydrated for that.

It was more severe on the left side of my body which is the side I received the vaccine. I did not notice it on my head, face, and upper torso.  I had full muscle control but I did have problems with my bladder and bowels.  I&#39;m not sure if I could not control them or did not feel them because the sensitivity was high in my hip area but I could not control them fully.  No treatment was administered except to wait and see.  Three days later and I am improving but not fully recovered yet.

He was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a flesh eating bacteria in the right leg where the pain was at and Sepsis.  He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

                                                We were vaccinated on April 2 in the morning. On April 12, 2021 we came home from work in the morning and he complained of numbness in his left. We thought it was related to the weather getting warm and we work the night shift, so he rested and increased his water intake. He was able to go to work on Monday night and return home and continued to rest on Tuesday. On Tuesday, there was no numbness, but there was weakness in both his legs. On Wednesday, he felt weakness throughout his body, especially in his legs. On Thursday, he collapsed. He did not lose consciences but his legs gave out under him and he was not able to get up up. He was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a stroke, increased sugars (diabetes he has never had before), acute kidney injury, and uncontrolled increased blood pressure. He was hospitalized and discharged April 19, 2021. He was readmitted 04/24/2021 for another stroke.

                                                I tested positive for Covid after my J&amp;J vaccine.  I had blood in my urine before testing positive to Covid. I had a virtual telemedicine and was told it also probably a bacterial infection in the blood. On 03-14-2021 I was to have knee surgery but had to postponed it due to I having Covid. I tested positive for Covid on 04-01-2021. I was prescribed Doxycycline for ten days. Today I still have blood in my urine ad I have messaged my doctor for a call back.

                                                Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID Vaccine EUA J&amp;J Dose 4/9/21 NOT COVID POSITIVE  5/25/21: The patient is a 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department via EMS today after calling 911 with acute shortness of breath and being found unresponsive and pulseless at home, subsequently requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation on route to the ED.  the patient has a past medical history significant for gout, which he takes indomethacin as needed, and recently went to another state in March.  His significant other reports that COVID-19 infection went throughout the house in December, although he did test negative, they believe he had it due to his symptoms.  He did have that Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccination at the beginning of April of this year. Apparently the patient was speaking with the 1st responder right up until for minutes prior to EMS arrival and when fire department arrived on the scene the patient was found unresponsive, pulseless, and apneic, and subsequently they performed 1 round of CPR administering epinephrine and Narcan, when the patient regained a pulse.  The patient lost a pulse again, requiring subsequent CPR and airway tube was placed.   The patient arrived in the ED at 10:02 a.m., epinephrine was administered x7 rounds, patient was intubated with a 7.5 ET tube, Lucas device on patient, at 1053 the patient was awake, opening his eyes, squeezing nursing staff hand. At 10:59 a.m., nursing staff reported patient trying to pull his ET tube out.  The patient received at least 1 hour 15 minutes CPR including time on scene, on route to ED, and in ED.  At 11:10 a.m. patient&#39;s O2 saturation decreased to 79%, patient became diaphoretic with decreased responsiveness.  At 11:13 a.m., cardiology was at the bedside.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were significant for platelets 44, INR 1.2, CO2 16, AGAP 24, glucose 475, BUN 17, CR 1.55, ALT 248, AST 274, ALP 123, mg 2.9, lactate 15, troponin negative, 1st ABG:  PH 7.11, pCO2 39.4, base excess -17, PO2 46, HC03 12.6, O2 saturation 100%.  EKG showed right bundle-branch block with ST elevation in lead 3, V1, V2, V3, and V4 leads with ST depression in 1, aVL, and lead II.  Limited stat bedside echo showed akinetic septum and hypokinetic right ventricle.  The patient was taken to the cath lab.  Dr.  completed a pulmonary arteriogram and found bilateral massive emboli subsequently undergoing thrombectomy.  Patient was on epinephrine, norepinephrine, IV fluids, heparin, and propofol.   The patient was seen postprocedure in the intensive care unit while mechanically ventilated and sedated.  The patient&#39;s sedation was stopped and the patient woke up, moved all extremities, and followed some commands.  The patient&#39;s significant other was at the bedside.  He is currently on norepinephrine at 20mcg/min, epinephrine 20mcg/min, heparin per PE protocol after receiving bolus in CCL, propofol 25mcg/kg/min, and IV NS fluids.  The patient&#39;s wife reports that he has a history of chewing tobacco, but quit over 20 years ago.  She believes that he has a family history of blood clots in his sister&#39;s and maybe his dad, but she is not completely sure about that.  6/8/21: 56-year-old man who called EMS with complaints of acute onset shortness breath, was found unresponsive, apneic and without a pulse on arrival of EMS. ACLS protocol was initiated, he was brought to the emergency department where CPR was continued with Lucas device. He was intubated, required administration of 7 rounds of epinephrine, a total of 1 arm 15 minutes of resuscitation was required prior to return of spontaneous CT circulation. Cardiology was emergently consulted, he was taken to the cath had last cath lab with only mild nonobstructive CAD noted. He then underwent pulmonary angiography with the finding of saddle pulmonary embolism as well as bilateral main pulmonary artery thrombosis. He underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the right and left main pulmonary trunk, right upper middle old and lower lobe pulmonary artery, left lower lobe pulmonary artery.  Therapeutic anticoagulation was initiated with IV heparin then transition to oral Eliquis.    He was treated with empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed secondary to legal Rhea and acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy was initiated with CRRT. Clinical response was favorable, he was subsequently extubated and transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis. He was assessed by Physical and Occupational therapy and recommended for acute rehabilitation placement. His been discharged today in stable medical condition to continue hemodialysis as scheduled per Nephrology at the acute rehabilitation unit.

                                                Fevers started on Wednesday evening, April 14th. Over the next three to four days, the fevers and chills continuously got worse. Patient experienced fatigue, congestion, headaches, sore throat, body aches, neck pain. Conducted a televisit on Sunday, April 18th, and then went into the doctor on Monday, April 19th. The day of the doctor appointment, the patient could not get out of bed and could not stand for longer than 15 minutes at a time before extreme fatigue set in. Blood tests were taken at the doctor, a Z-pack was prescribed. The evening of the 19th, the doctor called after hour to send patient to emergency room to be admitted to hospital. Patient went immediately to Medical Center at which point, the patient was admitted for the next 19 days. The patient was released from the hospital on Saturday, May 8th. While in the hospital, the patient saw almost every &#34;category&#34; of doctor possible. Patient experienced fevers every night for 15 days straight, and after release from the hospital and &#34;fever free for 4-5 days, experienced fevers again for the next week. Doctors were unable for the first two and a half weeks of hospitalization to draw a conclusion about what was the cause of the sepsis (systemic). Patient received daily blood tests, MRIs, CAT scans, spinal tap, bone marrow biopsy, echocardiogram, etc. Patient spent the first two and a half weeks on an antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral.  The &#34;final&#34; diagnosis, which is still not confirmed, as histoplasmosis, which per the doctor would not have placed the patient in the hospital. Determined the fevers were officially &#34;fevers of unknown origin&#34; with a diagnosis of MIS-A and a vaccine contributing factor. Medication put patient in kidney failure and did not address the fevers (patient had fevers of 103&#43; for 25&#43; days in a row).  On May 27th, doctors are conducing new fungal tests and patient is discontinuing antifungal medication because of severe liver damage.  Patient was not and is not in a situation where histoplasmosis is a logical conclusion based on the patient&#39;s daily activities.
