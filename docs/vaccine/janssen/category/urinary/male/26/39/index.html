He then developed confusion and intrusive thoughts, as well as urinary retention. He was direct admitted to our hospital. Neuro exam was notable for diffuse myalgias and 1&#43; patellar reflexes bilaterally. Patient was treated with gabapentin for neuropathic pain control, urinary hesitancy improved, no strength deficits.  Lumbar MRI showed cauda equina enhancement consistent with ascending infectious or inflammatory process like GBM.

                                                36 Y male patient from another country with a past medical history significant for mild HTN (on 2.5 mg amlodipine) who was in his usual state of health until approximately 4/17/21 when he developed acute onset left volar forearm tingling sensation. He had received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on 4/2/21 in his left arm and states that he did not experience any noticeable reactions after vaccination. He also recalls having had sustained a minor superficial scrape on his left volar forearm by a trash can lid when he had taken out garbage, which occurred very shortly before the onset of this tingling sensation. The tingling sensation then progressively worsened and became more diffuse across most of his body. He then developed fevers up to 102 at home, chills, neck pain, headache, and pain in all extremities (primarily arms but also in his legs).   He initially went to the Health Care ED on 4/28/21. He was afebrile at the time and his vital signs at that time were unremarkable with the exception of elevated diastolic blood pressures (90-104 mm Hg). WBC 10.1 with normal differential, electrolytes and liver enzymes within normal limits. Influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR were negative. Urinalysis showed few bacteria but no WBCs. Chest x-ray was clear. Blood cultures were drawn and patient was then discharged.   Patient returned to the ED on 4/29/21 and reported fever to 102-103 d F, chills, nausea, weakness, body aches, and bilateral foot paraesthesias. He was afebrile (98.8) and his vital signs were within normal limits. His WBC was slightly elevated to 12.2 with a normal differential. His ESR was 11, CRP 1.5, CMP within normal limits. He was noted to have urinary retention and a foley was placed and he was given tamsulosin.    Patient then returned to the ED again the following day, on 4/30/21, with worsening generalized pain and weakness and difficulty walking.   ED course: temperature 101, heart rate 100s-110s, BP 140s-160s/70s-90s, RR low 20s, SaO2 high 90s. Labs remarkable for WBC 13.1 with 82.4% N, ESR 7, CRP 5.9, lactic acid 2.6, RF 10, urinalysis unremarkable, HIV antigen/antibody negative. Several imaging studies were performed. MRI T spine showed &#34;Extensive cord signal abnormality in the cervical and thoracic cord as detailed above, with associated expansion of the cord (most pronounced in the cervical cord). Differential includes acute transverse myelitis, demyelination, infection (HIV, syphilis, other viruses)/parainfectious phenomenon, subacute combined degeneration, and inflammatory etiologies. An underlying mass or masses are not excluded but less likely given extensive multifocal patchy involvement. Recommend postcontrast imaging at this time for further workup. Consider brain MR as well to assess for systemic white matter disease.&#34;   A lumbar puncture was attempted in the ED but was unable to be performed.   Patient was given empiric IV ceftriaxone 1 g q24h and admitted to the hospitalist service. He was evaluated by neurology and was started on Solumedrol 1000 mg for acute transverse myelitis.   5/1/21 MRI brain showed &#34;Multifocal patchy white matter signal changes, predominantly in the subcortical white matter, also present in the bilateral thalami and bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle, and redemonstration of extensive cervical cord signal abnormality and expansion. No associated restricted diffusion or enhancement. Broad differential, but given pattern of involvement findings are most concerning for ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), other considerations include other demyelinating processes, toxic-metabolic pathology, or potentially atypical viral infection.&#34; Patient was given methylprednisolone for ADEM with transverse myelitis and clinically improved. He was hospitalized from 4/30/21 until being discharged to home in a wheelchair on 5/6/21.

The patient didn&#39;t feel right and lied down and woke up with severe back pain. The left side of patient body was in excruciating pain and he was unable to walk. On 05-APR-2021, the patient experienced kidney infection and pancreatic pain. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced lungs filled with fluid and kidney inflammation (renal disorder). He addressed that his lungs were filled with fluid and he lost his voice which was later improved in few days. The patient required urgent/emergency care visit, for events back pain, kidney pain, leg pain, can&#39;t move, loss of voice, kidney failure, and kidney infection. The patient was experiencing as if he was dying and failure in kidney and not be able to understand to compensate the situation. The patient family was concerned about him and due to vaccine he was not able to work or to do anything. Considering severity he was asking for the compensation for the vaccine effect on him. The patient asked for a call back as he was not able to talk and he was on bus so could have got disconnected. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of voice on 24-MAR-2021, had not recovered from back pain, kidney pain, leg pain, can&#39;t move, kidney failure, and pancreatic pain, and the outcome of lungs filled with fluid and kidney inflammation (renal disorder) and kidney infection was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 This spontaneous report involves a 37-year-old male patient who experienced kidney failure, can&#39;t move, severe back pain, kidney pain, loss of voice, leg pain the same day the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2 had administered.

Pharmacy staff provided water and pharmacist went over to check on the patient. Patient expressed feeling &#34;hot&#34; and wanted an ice-pack, which was given. Patient expressed feeling &#34;faint,&#34; after which he briefly lost consciousness. Pharmacist immediately started checking for pulse and obtained Emergency Kit. Patient regained consciousness quickly without need of CPR or administration of Emergency Kit medications. At some point patient also released his bladder,  most likely during the syncope episode. Patient expressing feeling &#34;nauseous&#34; and asked for something to throw up in. Pharmacist quickly got a trash can and gave to patient, shortly after which patient started vomiting. Pharmacist was attending to patient and asked patient if he wanted 911 to be called, to which he replied &#34;No&#34; and that he just needed some time to sit. Patient also stated he did not eat much that day. Pharmacist offered Pedialyte, to which patient agreed, in order to replenish fluids/electrolytes lost due to vomiting. Patient also asked for some crackers since he did not eat much earlier. After taking sips of Pedialyte and taking bites of crackers, patient could not hold anything down and continued to vomit. At that time patient&#39;s wife asked pharmacy staff to proceed with calling 911. 911 was called and paramedics took patient&#39;s vitals upon arrival at the scene. Vitals were all stated to be normal. Patient agreed to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. A couple hours later patient&#39;s wife informed pharmacy staff that patient was doing much better and was expected to be released from hospital soon. Before receiving vaccination, patient did share that in the past he had &#34;felt faint&#34; when giving blood but it was not made clear that patient had felt faint or fainted during vaccinations prior. After the incident patient&#39;s wife confirmed that patient had fainted in the past both after giving blood and after receiving vaccinations. Pharmacist called patient at 9:12 AM the following day (4/3/21) to see how patient was doing but was only able to leave a voicemail message.
