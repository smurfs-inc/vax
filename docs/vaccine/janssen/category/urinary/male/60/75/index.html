                                                Client left message on immunization nurses line 04/13/2021 stating he received J&amp;J vaccine on Friday, and is having a severe reaction, can&#39;t eat, drink, breathing problems, hasn&#39;t been able to pee for 4-5 days, throwing up and severe diarrhea, and he can&#39;t stand.  I returned his call and he verbalized all issues above and also said his legs, arms and hands were cramping up and having ringing in the ears.  I recommended him to go to the ER now, he said he had called his PCP and was told the same thing.  He stated he is single and lives alone and does not drive.  I told him to call 911 and he verbalized he is too embarrassed to do that and states he will wait for his daughter to call him.  I offered to call his daughter for him and he declined.   Addendum: Created by RN. 04/16/2021 02:01 PM 04/16/2021 Client called reporting the same symptoms as in 4/13 message -- I told him to go to the ER immediately. He stated he could not drive due to muscle spasms and feet and leg pain. Asked if he would please call 911 and stated that was not necessary. He verbalized he understood my directions and stated he would go to urgent Care. Called Sheriff office to make a well person check.

Treated with dexamethasone, remdesivir and empiric antibiotics.   Following admission, O2 requirement increased, received tocilizumab then required transfer to the ICU on 3/29.   On 3/31 developed right leg ischemia, underwent thrombectomy and heparin infusion then on 4/1 patient intubated due to increased need for respiratory support and had bilateral chest tubes placed, post-intubation course complicated by shock with AKI requiring pressor support, prolonged encephalolpathy.    On 4/24 with worsening shock, hypoxemic resp failure, AKI requiring pressors and CRRT with broad spectrum antibiotics and resumption of stress dose steroids, the family was transitioned to comfort measures and passed away on 4/29.

                                                13th of April. I had a blood clot in my hand. My index finger on  my left hand was numb and black and blue all around the knuckle area and into my hand area. I went to my primary care - I went to the acute center there. She said the hand was cold and could see the black and blue. They put me on Plavix for 30 days and I haven&#39;t had any reoccurrence of that. I think it was the 21st, I couldn&#39;t sleep all night, I had a kidney stone - the pain was so bad I got nauseous - around my back and side and in my front. I didn&#39;t have a fever. I went to the doctor office and they checked urine - and said there was blood in the urine. I was prescribed - Tamsulosin HCL. They thought I had passed most of it by the time I got there.
