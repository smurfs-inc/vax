I returned his call and he verbalized all issues above and also said his legs, arms and hands were cramping up and having ringing in the ears.  I recommended him to go to the ER now, he said he had called his PCP and was told the same thing.  He stated he is single and lives alone and does not drive.  I told him to call 911 and he verbalized he is too embarrassed to do that and states he will wait for his daughter to call him.  I offered to call his daughter for him and he declined.   Addendum: Created by RN. 04/16/2021 02:01 PM 04/16/2021 Client called reporting the same symptoms as in 4/13 message -- I told him to go to the ER immediately. He stated he could not drive due to muscle spasms and feet and leg pain. Asked if he would please call 911 and stated that was not necessary. He verbalized he understood my directions and stated he would go to urgent Care. Called Sheriff office to make a well person check.

Treated with dexamethasone, remdesivir and empiric antibiotics.   Following admission, O2 requirement increased, received tocilizumab then required transfer to the ICU on 3/29.   On 3/31 developed right leg ischemia, underwent thrombectomy and heparin infusion then on 4/1 patient intubated due to increased need for respiratory support and had bilateral chest tubes placed, post-intubation course complicated by shock with AKI requiring pressor support, prolonged encephalolpathy.    On 4/24 with worsening shock, hypoxemic resp failure, AKI requiring pressors and CRRT with broad spectrum antibiotics and resumption of stress dose steroids, the family was transitioned to comfort measures and passed away on 4/29.

This pain and weakness progressed to complete bilateral  lower extremity paralysis with loss of bowel and bladder function  on 6/09/2021.  Patient was seen emergently and found to have critical, bilateral lower extremity ischemia. imaging showed RIGHT RUNOFF: 1)There is abrupt vessel cut off suggestive of acute thrombotic occlusion of the proximal common femoral artery with propagation into the superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery. On the delayed imaging, small amount of contrast is seen within the severely stenotic popliteal artery and very small amount of contrast is seen in the peroneal artery extending to the ankle suggesting proximal stenosis and extremely slow flow.   LEFT IMPRESSION: 2)Abrupt cut off suggestive of acute thrombotic or embolic occlusion identified at the origin of the LEFT common iliac arteries with propagation throughout the LEFT lower extremity down to the popliteal artery. 3)On the delayed phase imaging, tiny wisp of contrast within the severely stenotic popliteal artery identified suggestive of very slow flow. The peroneal artery is also faintly patent on the delayed phase imaging with flow contrast extending to mid calf level. Due to severity of the ischemic limb, patient was offered bilateral above the knee amputations. He declined and will discharge to  hospice on 6/12/2021. He is going to die.

                                                13th of April. I had a blood clot in my hand. My index finger on  my left hand was numb and black and blue all around the knuckle area and into my hand area. I went to my primary care - I went to the acute center there. She said the hand was cold and could see the black and blue. They put me on Plavix for 30 days and I haven&#39;t had any reoccurrence of that. I think it was the 21st, I couldn&#39;t sleep all night, I had a kidney stone - the pain was so bad I got nauseous - around my back and side and in my front. I didn&#39;t have a fever. I went to the doctor office and they checked urine - and said there was blood in the urine. I was prescribed - Tamsulosin HCL. They thought I had passed most of it by the time I got there.
