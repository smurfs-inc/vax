He also reported extreme acid reflux symptoms whenever he attempted to drink any fluids at that time as well as nausea.  This progressed to difficulty breathing at which time the caregiver was alerted and checked his blood pressure.  This reading was 88/55 according to the caregiver and the pulse was very high as well but the actual number could not be remembered.  The difficulty breathing prompted them to alert emergency medical services where he was picked up and transported to the emergency room via ambulance shortly after for evaluation.
