                                                At first once I received the vaccine I felt completely fine. Later that evening I started to lose my breath and had a fever. By 9:00pm I was unable to move the left side of my body, had sharp pains throughout my body, and involuntarily urinated and vomited. This continues until 12:00pm Friday, the vomiting and urinating involuntarily stopped but the high fever, body pains, and numbness continued until Sunday evening. Now I still am experiencing random sharp pains and numbness on the left side of my body to the point where I cannot move it at all. I am throwing up occasionally (which has never happened before), and I have had a headache and insomnia since I got the vaccine. Pains behind my eye, loss of appetite and weight loss have occurred since.

I threw up 4 times and then continued to dry heave for another hour. My temperature hit 102. I then started experiencing extreme pain in my right kidney area. I ended up trying to take Benadryl and then  threw that right up. I  then ended up going to the ER and receiving  Zofran, Fluids, Tylenol, Torodol and Morphine.   I got discharged with &#34;an adverse reaction to the covid-19 vaccine and unknown pain&#34; When I was discharged I had a fever of 100 and on the drive home I was in intense pain. It subsided but I am still not feeling well, I feel very groggy and light headed in addition to the pain.

                                                Sunday night, my heart started pounding really hard. I went to ER - Medical Center. They did an EKG and took my vitals. I had a fever (slight) and chills and was nauseous. Put  ONDANSETRON -4 mg. The nausea didn&#39;t go away and I couldn&#39;t eat or drink without vomiting until today. I couldn&#39;t eat or drink or was very tired and groggy and miserable. Today I  had another trip to the ER Medical, I got on an antibiotic and anti-nausea medication (GETHALEXIN - 500 mg for the GI) (METOCLOPRAMIGE HCL - 5 mg-  for nausea) from the hospital and I had a shot that went into my immune system. They also found a UTI today.
