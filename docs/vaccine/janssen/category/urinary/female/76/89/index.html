                                                I was walking in the airport and I just fell for no reason. I went down slow. I was able to get up on my own, but I have no idea what made me fall. I went to my daughter&#39;s house and I was trying to climb the stairs to get to her place, but I couldn&#39;t even bring my leg up to step on the first step. I had to physically pull myself up the stairs by my arms. I felt like I lost my strength. I lost control of my bladder. I went to the doctor to have a urinalysis done and there was not an infection. I also lost my balance and would often have chills. Anytime I would start walking it would feel like I was drunk with how I couldn&#39;t walk straight. I felt fatigued during this time as well. During time that I would try to speak, I would say something in a sentence that had nothing to do with the topic of conversation. I was thinking I may have had a stroke, but when I went to the doctor and had a CT scan, a brain MRI and blood work done, everything came back normal. All of this lasted three weeks and then just all went away. My doctor diagnosed me with post COVID viral illness, but I never had COVID. She said it&#39;s similar to a viral meningitis.

On 3/7/21, stroke alert was called because of new right arm dis-coordination, and on 3/8/21, MR brain showed an acute right cerebellar artery infarct (which did not leave deficits). Prior to the vaccine, pt had absolutely no symptoms of heart failure or cardiac diagnoses. She was hospitalized from 3/4/21-3/13/21, 3/18/21-3/23/21 for afib RVR, congestive heart failure, and acute kidney injury which required dilt and diuretics.
