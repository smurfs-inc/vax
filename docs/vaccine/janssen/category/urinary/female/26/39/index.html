I?m bleeding in my urine, stool, and vaginally. Period came early (unrelated to previous vaginal bleeding) and is not clotting. Just significant amounts of red blood, soaking through one ultra absorbency tampon an hour. I have a headache. Went to the ER and my platelets were (345) and my blood sugar low. My bp was 145/90 which is high for me, from the bleeding.  They said I have a ?higher chance of being bitten by a shark? than having a side effect. They diagnosed me with a single contusion and sent me home. Have been feeling worse since leaving the hospital.

On April 9th 2021 during a scheduled doctor visit at 3pm both baby and mother were in good health.  On the same evening after the appointment she went for vaccination at Pharmacy and received the J&amp;J vaccine. After receiving the vaccine in about 15 mins she felt like urinating and noticed blood in the urine and felt vaginal dilation. Within the next 15 to 20 mins she started experiencing mild labor pains and contractions. In the next 30 mins she started bleeding and was immediately taken to the ER. In the ER it was confirmed that she was having a miscarriage and the fetus was delivered. She also had to undergo emergency surgery to remove any remaining placenta in the uterus.

I was nauseous and I had diarrhea.  My fever was 102. I started to feel better after three days. I also got aa headache that was similar to the Migraines I used to have. I hadn&#39;t had a Migraine for 18 months and I had  a Migraine daily for five weeks. I went to the care facility eight days after the vaccine because I thought I had a UTI. The UTI was positive and I was told I had some Streptococcus B at the time. I was also experiencing confusion, and tiredness.  One month after the vaccine I went back to the care facility because I was have having cramps in my lower abdomen and circulating to my lower back as well as my legs. All tests were negative but I was given multiple antibiotics. After eight weeks I still have lower abdominal cramping, vaginal discharge and headaches. Some of the symptoms were relieved by the antibiotics but they have returned.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

I gave the vaccine and pt said she was okay. a couple minutes later she said she was feeling very warm and asked for something to fan herself with. I asked another pharmacist is get her a cold compress. When she came back with it and went to give it to the patient she fainted and slumped in her chair; she did not fall out of the chair. she was unconscious for less than 30 seconds and lost bladder control. I continued to rub her wrists and neck with the cold paper towel and she regained consciousness and said she was okay. we observed her for at least 20 minutes more and then she left. she said she did not require any further medical attention.

                                                During my menstrual cycle I usually have no symptoms other than tender breasts. So these symptoms were very unusual. Leg pains, pain and pressure in pelvis, clitoral pain, pain around vaginal opening, stinging like acid during urination that sent a shock through my entire body, uncontrollable bladder, nausea, large blood clots, lower stomach pain, flank pain, hot/cold chills, if I touch my belly button the pain radiated to my vagina, ovaries hurt, cervix pain, dryness, unable to get comfortable, crawling out of my skin, and constant urge to urinate, depression.  I landed myself in the ER where they told me to take Tylenol and Motrin and sent me on my way. These medications were not able to control the amount of pain I was in. I have now reached out to a couple specialists.

Monday around 8PM: fever &amp; chills gone, body aches still there all over my body, headache,  fatigue 3. Tuesday: Body aches still bad all over and headache 4. Wednesday: Body ache a little better and headache, tingling/nubmness starts in both legs (faintly) 5. Thursday: body ache barely there, soreness in arm at injection site, tingling/numbness in legs (sharp pain) 6. Friday: tingling/numbness in legs - mainly back of my thighs - sometimes also feeling this tingling  in my arms and upper back area 7. Saturday: same, tingling/numbness in legs/sometimes in arms/upper back, body still sore to the touch 8. Sunday: same, tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back, body still sore to the touch 9. Monday: same, same, tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back ? Called DR to speak with nurse about this as didn&#39;t feel normal to have this reaction, went into dr for appt on Tuesday, April 20. 10. Tuesday: Saw Dr.  at 7:30am about tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back. Possible reaction to vaccine or more? Took labs/blood work: Vitamin B-12 (82607), Folic Acid Serum (82746), CBC / Platelets &amp; Aut Diff (85025), TSH (Tyroid Timulating hormone) (84443), Metabolic Panel (80053), Quest blood draw (36415), Sed rate erythrocyte (85651) - ALL came back normal. 11. Wednesday: same, tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back, but the tingling this day got a little less intense. Not as painful today. 12. Had follow-up appt on Thursday, April 22 - took more tests. Tingling/numbness in legs but felt like Wednesday as a little less painful - didnt feel it as much in arms/back. Felt more like when your hand falls asleep and blood comes rushing back into it, thats how my legs felt this day, so more soreness than pain. 11. Friday: Symptoms same as the past 1 days, feel like tingling is getting a tad better.

                                                Patient had a reaction immediately after the JJ vaccine. Patient passed out for 10-15seconds, her body stiffened up, she felt hot and then cold and started sweating excessively. Patients eyes closed briefly and then opened. Patient then became conscious and was unware what had happened.  Patient is not on any medication and had not eaten all morning. After administering the vaccine a small amount of blood came out. I gave her a cotton ball to apply on the area and to hold. After 20-30 seconds she said she felt faint and hot all of a sudden. Her body then went limp and her eyes began to close. Her body then stiffened up for a few seconds. After shouting her name a few times she regained consciousness and was able to talk. she didn&#39;t realize what had happened. Her body was fine again but she had urinated during the episode.  Upon speaking to the patient I learnt that she was nervous about the vaccination and she had felt dizzy in the past when giving blood. I observed the patient over the next 45 minutes. Her speech was fine, she was still a little light headed. She was in her seat for 40 minutes, then I asked her to stand and to move a little to see how she was. She was able to walk a bit but then sat down as she still felt light headed. She than sipped on water and continued talking and seemed to get some energy back.

As I was about to check her blood pressure, she seemed to lose consciousness. Her eyes rolled back in her head, and she seemed to be out of it for a few seconds. She came back to about 10 seconds later. She was pale, sweating, and had urinated on herself. I gave her a cold rag to wipe her face off. We called 911. Kept reminding the patient to take slow, deep breaths. Ambulance came and checked patient out, but she refused to be transported to hospital. I called to check on the patient later that night. She stated she had taken a nap when she got home, but was overall feeling better

Was prescribed decreasing dose of prednisone. This was the morning of the 15th. As the day went on my thighs (both, very high up near groin) started aching. Uncomfortable to walk or sit for long periods. Getting worse as today, the 16th, has gone on. My hips are very achy and sore today. Hives have finally subsided.

The main thing is that I slept a lot and was unable to work which lasted 9 days. The thing that I went to urgent care for pelvic pain, body aches and pain, developed an UTI and my symptoms cleared at home with medications.  At the urgent care lab work and urine culture was performed. When I went to the urgent care they said I also had tachycardia.  My symptoms have resolved.
