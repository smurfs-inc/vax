                                                About 9 pm I felt fatigue, I went to bed. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol as a pain medication. I drank a bunch of water and took an Emergen-C. I fell asleep by 10:00. I slept and I woke up - shocked awake around 04:30 am - I was super thirsty. My whole body was really sore and stiff and I had a headache.  It was uncomfortable but not unmanageable. I decided to take more Tylenol and Ibuprofen and drink more water again. I got back in bed and was feeling a lot of symptoms - I was really sore in my thigh muscles, lower back, knees and forearms. I had slight chills; I was pretty uncomfortable. I couldn&#39;t get back to sleep - I couldn&#39;t sleep on my arm with the injection site. This was about 5 pm. I never actually had a fever. But just a lot of fatigue and body aches. For the next day or two - I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol every 6 hours. Within 48 hours, the body aches started to subside. I still felt a bit fatigued and I still do feel fatigued to this day. Into the next week, I started feeling like (towards the middle of the week - about the 7th) I was having an urinary urgency feeling. It was a sensation in my lower back like a UTI was coming on. I haven&#39;t gotten one in a long time ( I use to). On Friday or Saturday, when I wiped, I was seeing a slight pinkish hue  - a trace of blood - in my urine. Decided to take probiotics and Vit C. and I started to feel better. But Sunday morning, I was back to feeling pretty bad. I visited the Urgent Care on Sunday, the 11th. In the visit, they took a urine specimen. Dr. saw blood in my urine from the test. And an absence of nitrates in the urine and she said it wasn&#39;t  a typical UTI. They decided to culture the urine specimen. Macrobid - 2 times a day for 7 days - antibiotics was prescribed. I felt a little better the second day of taking it, I thought, but it was up and down. Culture showed there was no UTI.  Friday, the 16th, I had my annual visit with my PCP, I was feeling okay by this time. But I still had a sensation in my lower back - not a pain but a sensation and I still feel this sensation now (on my left side). She asked me to come back after the antibiotics to take another urine sample. Lab test. I feel some fatigue but I&#39;m doing normal daily life.

Blood work came back normal, UTI normal, still blood in urine.  5/20 X-ray to check for pneumonia (none found) and ultrasound on kidneys and bladder to check for infection, kidneys stones (none found).

I sat on the floor and started vomiting. I kept gagging nonstop for several minutes.

I do not remember how long everything lasted. I woke up the next day with a slightly upset stomach and headache.

I was sweating and vomiting.  My husband carried me to the car and brought me to the ER. At the Er I was given a patch for my back pain, medicine for the dizziness and nausea. The dizziness didn&#39;t subside. I couldn&#39;t walk. I told them I had gotten the vaccine two weeks before and they said it wasn&#39;t related. I was diagnosed with a bladder infection, high blood sugar, and vertigo. I was discharged in the evening but with no improvement.  I was not able to focus or walk for days. I saw my OBGYN, he was the only doctor I could see right away and he referred me to an ENT. The ENT can&#39;t see me until the end of June.  I wasn&#39;t able to drive for weeks. I am slowly regaining my balance but still feel waves of dizziness and my eyes can&#39;t focus well when I am reading. The back pain is gone. My OBGYN also doesn&#39;t feel the dizziness is related.

                                                3/13 vaccination. 3-4 hours later, I started having symptoms to include tickle in throat, post nasal drip. By 11:40 I had a HA, I was very tired, quite a bit of secretion. I continued taking Benadryl every 3 hours. At 2 :30 PM, heart palpitations and angina. My BP was 98/69. I took more Benadryl, drank some fluids. By 4:15, I was getting drowsy and tired, having pain in multiple joints through my body; 8/10 scale, especially in my hands in feet. I took something for pain. My arm was very sore. I had mild to moderate slight cough. By 7:40 PM I took my regular medication.  I was having a sudden intense HA and pain in joints was 9/10. I was having stiffness, chest congestion, feeling &#39;flu like&#39; symptoms, brain fog, and weird pains / electro shock pains on extremities. By 830, my symptoms increased to almost a really bad allergic reaction. I couldn&#39;t think well, dizzy, cough, chest congestion and my lungs started to hurt. By 10:30pm, I started to have a low grade fever, pain 9/10, I took Ibuprofen and Benadryl every 3 hours.  3/14 Ibuprofen, slight fever, slight HA, joints were swollen and stiff; 8/10 on pain and stiffness. I had muscle pain and brain fog, could not say words. Dull pain back of head. My kidney area, I felt like it hurt, severe anaphylactic reaction it felt like. I still had photophobia. It continued into the evening. I continued taking the Benadryl and ibuprofen. Around 6pm, I had 101.5 temperature, nauseated, crying, chest congestion. By 10:45, my temp was going up again.  Monday I had low grade fever, continued medication. Symptoms continued for a few more days with palpitations, brain fog, pain in lungs and kidneys. I couldn&#39;t do anything. By the end of the week, I started to recover.  *My PCM knew before I got the vaccine they were on board and knew what was going to happen in regards to my reaction, EKG, I had epi pen, didn&#39;t pass out, I decided I was going to stay home.  *It took me a good couple weeks to recover to my baseline. But it was pretty tough.

                                                I received the vaccine on March 27, 2021. Seconds after the injection was completed my vision went blurry, but it only lasted a few seconds. On March 28, 2021 I felt like my body was going to explode. My blood in the back of my head was thumping. I tried to take a nap to calm my body down but my body felt comp!eye unrest and thumping. My urine made the whole inside of the toilet water look like a white thick cloud.  I have never seen my urine look like that in my life. I used my husbands blood pressure monitor and my blood pressure was 152/104!  I arrived at urgent care about 5:30 PM. They gave me a blood pressure pill. I have never had a blood pressure pill my entire life. They also took a urine sample since I told them about the my very strange looking urine. They found protein and blood in my urine. The culture days later showed no infection. I am still having issues with the high blood pressure.

                                                When I woke up, I was shaking really bad. I was freezing. I had the chills. It was 101. I kept going to the bathroom that night - 7 times. My hands went completely numb - both of them. I felt like I was going to throw up but didn&#39;t at that time. I couldn&#39;t breathe. My chest was heavy and hurting. I had tons of blankets on but couldn&#39;t get warm and was up all night sick. I felt like I couldn&#39;t walk - I had  no strength to do anything. I had to hold on to things to get to the bathroom. I did throw up the next couple of days and I couldn&#39;t eat the next couple of days. I tried to call my doctor - and they told me take Advil/Tylenol for pain. They told to me to keep drinking even though I was throwing. I was throwing up for four days. My arm was sore for a week at least. My hands are still numb. This hasn&#39;t gone away since I&#39;ve gotten the shot. My bladder - I&#39;m in more pain from it - it&#39;s worse pain than my normal - it exacerbated it. I think something from the shot did something to make my immune system not work. I had a migraine for a month - really bad headaches for a month after. I had to keep taking migraine medicine and lay down. It knocked me off my feet. I am still having the bladder issues and the numbness in my hands.  I had called the doctor a second time but they didn&#39;t know what to do and only advised ER which I didn&#39;t do.

As I was driving my left leg was getting stiff, got a spasm. No side effects on my left arm. I also had a bad headache at night. I drank plenty of fluids, I do massages to relieve the pain. I also did peppermint oil and my back upper back was hurting bad on Sunday morning and by the afternoon my right arm was swollen, my joints in my hands hurt and could feel and was having pain opening and closing my hand. The rest of the week, I had constant headaches. My headaches are more intense behind my right eyeball. As the days went by I started to feel tingling sensation to my right side of my face and jaw which lasts about 6 seconds. I&#39;ve had it also on my left side of my face. My legs feel very heavy and weak and I feel my les feel like they will give out. I also feel my joints hurt, on my right foot, where my joints start fusing together, my doctor prescribed a cream for my joint pain to my feet. The pain I feel on my arms, back and legs is still present. On my left shoulder I feel pain to my collar bone. I also get this pain on my back on my shoulder blade, right side as well, like a pricking, poking sensation, this pain comes and goes. I also started to have bladder issues, where I&#39;ve lost muscle control and will be seen by an urologist on 06-04-2021.  These are pain that I did not experience before.

Just watched them and kept an eye on them and used  Benadryl and anti-itch cream, postponed allergy shots from Friday 4-16 until Monday 4/19.  Hives went away in the next day or two.  2nd event-Lower right back pain achy off and on and eventually wrapping around to the right side.  Went to urgent care on 4/29.  They did a CT with contrast and found a large kidney stone that I would not be able to pass without surgery, referred to neurologist. Saw neurologist on 5/3,  kidney X-ray confirmed an 18 mm kidney stone in my right renal  pelvis. Scheduled lithotripsy with stent placement on 5/10. Had  that done on 5/10. Had follow up kidney X-ray and stent removed on 5/17.  Then on 5/24 another follow up kidney X-ray. Results weren?t easy to see due to gaseous distention but he thought I had passed most of the larger particles. Will see him in 6 months. May see him sooner because I?m still experiencing achy  pain in the same areas off and  on  that same side.

                                                I experienced a week later after receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, inflammation to my legs and hands, I have water retention, feel very sick, have kidney pain which I did not have before getting the J&amp;J vaccine. When I was getting my vaccine, I told the nurse that was putting the injection, that I have history of high blood pressure but I do not take any medicine, the nurse said it was fine that I should be okay. I also experienced swollenness to my face. I went to the ER on 05-27-2021 due to how I was feeling. AT the ER they performed lab work and did an echocardiogram. I recently got a type of medical insurance.  I am also not working at this time due to my symptoms of retaining water in my body, where I get so inflamed to my legs and hands and face. At the ER I was told I needed to see a PCP but I do not have one at the moment since I did not have insurance when I received my J&amp;J vaccine.  I feel my quality of life has decreased since receiving the J&amp;J vaccine.  I do not have my lot# to provide at this time..

I woke up at 3am Friday morning with body aches and still had the headache. I took more Tylenol. By 9am Friday morning I had severe adverse reactions. I still had a severe headache and body aches with muscle soreness and extreme fatigue. I also experienced chills, light sensitivity and brain fog. Around 4:30 pm I developed chest pains that lasted about one hour. My headache, body aches and fatigue have not subsided as of today. I have had a televisit with my physicians office on may 10 where bloodwork. Some of my headaches rk was requested. The results showed elevated kidney function due to the amount of Advil I had taken to control the headache and muscle soreness. The recommended Tylenol did not alleviate my headache or muscle soreness so I have not taken either medicine.  Some of my headaches have been accompanied with nausea and light sensitivity. I went for a physical exam on 5/18/21 and more bloodwork was requested. It has been 6 weeks and these adverse effects have not subsided.

                                                Within 5 minutes from receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I went to sit down and I started feeling very hot in my body. My heart started to race, had chest discomfort and had trouble breathing, my trachea closed up, had blurry vision and pain in my chest. I felt like I could not breathe and when the nurse came over to ask me I could not speak to her, I went into a shock and I was placed on the floor and I could not hear anything nor could open my eyes, from my hips down to my feet I could not feel anything, my legs went completely numb and I had a syncope. What I was told from the nurse that I was given an Epi-pen to help with my reaction. When I came back my body was having convulsions, felt my head spinning, had pain in my chest that so very intense and the nurse got me up and took me to a nearby ambulance and the EMT staff placed like a heart monitor because my heart was racing super fast. I also felt heaviness in my chest and inside the ambulance I was given two injections on my left arm and when I slowly started coming back, I was already at the hospital. I was at the hospital from 2pm to 4:30pm more less being monitored.  At the hospital x-ray of the chest was performed as well as lab work and I was discharged home. When I got home, I still did not feel good, I felt heaviness to my chest, still have trouble breathing and get chills during the night. I also could not stand up and have a nerve sensation to my body and the chest pain to my left side is still very present. I have blurry vision, dizziness, headaches, and my heart-beat continues to race very fast.  I get headaches, have abdominal pain and I peed blood few times then that&#39;s when I was able to pee, my abdominal pain was painful like having a baby. On Friday 04-08-2021, I again went to the hospital because I had fallen to the floor on my kitchen floor and my daughter took me to the hospital. I let the nurse staff know that I still have continued chest pain and pressure, difficulty breathing and headaches, dizziness and they monitored and gave me three pills as medication. I was discharged home about 5pm with a referral to see a neurologist due to my chest pain, blurry vision, dizziness and fever which I had these past three weeks. I do not know why I felt all these symptoms after my J&amp;J vaccine.

Pain and tingling in my arms. In addition a few weeks into it pain in my inner thighs and strange bruising patterns down my thighs, and tingling legs. severe  bladder pain, and constant feeling  that I need to go to bathroom (bladder infection was ruled out). Pain is usually much worse at night. Sleep has become very difficult. Throat issues to a degree that I constantly have to clear my throat before I&#39;m able to talk  Massages, acupuncture helps, also tried PT for jaw area. IV immunity drips (does not help) Saw 2 general practitioners, one osteopath, one gynecologist, and dentist.  There are days which are better and then days where I can&#39;t work and need to cancel my patients.

                                                I woke up at approximately 9:30 AM the morning of Sunday May 2nd 2021 the day after getting my covid vaccine and had to rush to the bathroom. I proceeded to have blood and blood clots come out my urethra very urgently. I had abdominal pain and pressure. I proceeded to need to urinate blood and blood clots for approximately 4 hours urgently. I could not go far from the bathroom without having to return quickly to the toilet. I wet myself several times. The clots stopped coming around 1:30 PM. I proceeded to have to have no control over urination urge and could not leave the bathroom. Around approximately 2:00 PM I could leave the bathroom without fear of wetting myself. I continued to have a small amount of a mix of blood and normal urine passing for another hour or so. I have a picture of the blood and clots that came out of my urethra. I continue to have dull pain and pressure in my abdomen.

Patient thinks this is related to the vaccine, she thought it was progressive pain and worsening of weakness which has become unsteady.  Admitted to the hospital to rule out Gilliam Barré and other progressive post viral infection myelopathies.  We will also worried about multiple sclerosis.  She did have a spinal tap which is completely normal with no evidence of encephalitis, meningitis or evidence of Gilliam Barre, she did also have MRI of the brain, cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines which is also completely negative.  Seen by neurology and think this is likely fibromyalgia because of the weakness and pain together not clinically fitting with any post viral infection neuropathy.  Patient was put on Cymbalta but this will take at least about 1-2 weeks to get the effect of improvement.  She was seen by PT and OT and has some improvement to her weakness and was able to walk with assistance and recommend that she&#39;ll go home with home health to continue therapy and she&#39;ll follow-up with neurology.  She may also benefit from Tizanidine if Cymbalta is not making a lot of difference.?

                                                I am reporting per recommendation of the V-safe system/conversation. I am reporting as the patient. I received the Jansen vaccine through a special monitored vaccine clinic due to a past severe reaction to a Shingrix vaccine. I did not have any immediate symptoms after the Jansen vaccine. The following day I developed aches/pains and fever to 103, but this resolved within 48 hours. I then noticed itching, swelling and pain at the site of the injection and developed a mild headache, called my primary doctor on 4/13/21 and was seen on 4/14/21 at which time a CBC was done.  CBC including platelets-normal.  However, within the next few days a more severe headache then developed, which was severe enough to limit my activities by 4/16/21. Because of the rare problem of thrombocytopenia associated with clotting, it was advised I not take aspirin or ibuprofen. I also was having some mild abdominal pain, low grade fever (to 100.7), malaise, dysuria and arthralgias. My headache continued to be limiting my daily activities and on 4/17/21, I went to a Urgent Care. However, they were unable to check and get results back on a CBC within that day, I had a normal neurological exam, my UA had some abnormal findings but not clearly indicative of a UTI and a culture is pending.  A rapid Covid test was negative.  It was recommended that if I was concerned I could proceed to a local ED for further testing. I  decided to continue to try conservative treatment and monitoring at home. As of today 4/18/21, the headache has mostly resolved and I no longer have a fever. I am still having some dysuria and joint pains.

                                                No immediate reaction day of vaccination. By evening had an increase in mast cell symptoms including, dizziness, nausea, severe headache, stomach pain, mild chest pain, fluish feeling, very fatigued.  Also severe left leg pain in calf (not a normal mast cell symptom for me). Symptoms still very prevalent by April 13, leg pain was worse, now in both legs. Saw primary physician Dr. He saw no swelling in legs and no treatment done at this time. April 18th headaches and leg pain was so severe went to ER. They ran a D Dimer test to test for blood clots and it was normal. Spoke with my mast cell specialist, Dr. by phone on April 19th and he prescribed 40 mg Prednisone daily for 5 days. Started prednisone on April 24th. When treatment course was finished my mast cell symptoms came back even worse than before, Had throat swelling, in addition to above symptoms. Went to Urgent Care on May 2nd, and they prescribed 60 mg Prednisone for 5 days. After this course of treatment, same thing happened,symptoms returned. Dr. suggested I follow up with my primary physician to make sure there wasn&#39;t something else going on besides mast cell symptoms. Dr. ran blood tests on May 14th,  including another D Dimer which was negative. Since tests were normal Dr. prescribed a long term taper of Prednisone which I am currently on as of June 9, 2021. Saw Dr on June 1st for follow up. Continuing prednisone taper for an additional 3 weeks. Symptoms as of June 9, 2021-still very sick. I still can&#39;t eat foods I was eating prior to vaccination, worsening of mast cell symptoms and leg pain is now mild and intermittent which is better. Still have headaches but they are not as severe as they were.

                                                The next day after vaccine, about 4:00pm - pain hit me and it was so severe I started to throw up from the pain. Short term memory/brain fog has been an issue. I&#39;ve had massive migraines. Complete body aches - even my bones hurt. The worse one was on  both of my arms  - above the wrist - and it was horrible (mostly on the right). One big blur of pain - I&#39;m in a lot of pain all the time. I have a constant headache. I keep losing consciousness and that started after the vaccine. It use to hit every three hours. Now it&#39;s more than that.  I have been two ERs in the couple of weeks. I&#39;ve been to the doctor, too. I am referred to a neurologist - can&#39;t get me in until middle of July. I pass out and when I wake up from it I am in excruciating pain - my whole body hurts. I can only take Tylenol because I&#39;m on Warfarin. I use Tylenol as needed and ice pack and heating pad for the pain. I started to almost lose consciousness when I have been completing this but I&#39;m okay - it is like a blanking out of the moment.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included ethyl alcohol abuse, and concurrent conditions included hypertension. The patient had no known drug allergies. The patient had no known other illness at the time of vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had not taken any prescriptions, over the counter medications, dietary supplements or herbal remedies at the time of vaccination. The patient had no adverse event following any previous vaccine. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, and batch number: 206A21A expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total  administered on 21-APR-2021 on left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 08-MAY-2021, the patient&#39;s laboratory data included CT (computed tomography) angiography of chest showed severe burden of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with severe right heart strain, small early infarct posteromedial left lower lobe (LLL), hepatic steatosis and interventional radiology (IR) thrombectomy procedure showed large bilateral pulmonary emboli. On 09-MAY-2021 (approximately 3 weeks after vaccination), the patient was presented to the emergency room due to progressively worsening shortness of breath. The patient also had pain and swelling in the left calf and leg. On the same day, the patient experienced brain injury, brain oedema, acute kidney injury, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, mental impairment, pain in extremity, peripheral swelling and had lung assist device therapy. The patient was hospitalized on an unspecified date. On 10-MAY-2021, the patient&#39;s ultrasound venous Doppler showed complete thrombosis left femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal and anterior tibial veins, partial thrombosis of left common femoral vein. The patient underwent urgent thrombectomy, however, on 11-MAY-2021 (the next morning), she became more hypoxic and hypotensive and was intubated and was urgently placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The patient developed multi-organ failure and was started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for oliguric renal failure. On 13-MAY-2021, CT computerised tomogram (CT) scan of the patient&#39;s head showed diffuse cerebral edema, which was most likely a result of hypoxic encephalopathy. With no improvement in her mental status over the course of the next few days, the patient was taken off life support and died on 15-MAY-2021 due to unknown cause. The patient was in hospital for 7 days. It was unknown if autopsy was performed. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient died of death, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, brain injury, brain oedema, acute kidney injury, mental impairment, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, hypoxia, dyspnoea, pain in extremity, peripheral swelling, hepatic steatosis, hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, continuous haemodiafiltration, endotracheal intubation, thrombectomy, lung assist device therapy, withdrawal of life support, angiogram pulmonary abnormal, computerised tomogram head abnormal and ultrasound doppler abnormal on 15-MAY-2021. This report was serious (Death, and Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged). This case, involving the same patient is linked to 20210542597.  Additional information was received from patient on 01-JUN-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated in to the case narrative: Patient demographics (race, ethnic origin), added patient history, added ethyl alcohol abuse in disease tab, added batch number, added facility type and other identification numbers updated.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V1: This spontaneous report received from a health care professional via Regulatory Authority VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System), concerns a 55 year old female patient, who was noted to experience acute pulmonary embolism (PE), with severe right heart strain, 18 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. The patient sought consult at the emergency room due to worsening of the shortness of breath. The patient also had pain and swelling in the left calf and leg. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of chest showed acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with severe right heart strain, small early infarct posteromedial left lower lobe (LLL), hepatic steatosis. Venous doppler showed complete thrombosis left femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal and anterior tibial veins, partial thrombosis of left common femoral vein. The patient underwent urgent thrombectomy. However, she became more hypoxic and hypotensive, was intubated and was urgently placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Later, she developed multi-organ failure and was started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for renal failure. Nineteen (19) days after receiving the vaccine, Computerised tomogram (CT) scan of the patient&#39;s head showed diffuse cerebral edema, which was most likely a result of hypoxic encephalopathy. With no improvement in her mental status, life support was said to be taken off which resulted to death. It was unknown if autopsy was performed. Patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included ethyl alcohol abuse and concurrent conditions included hypertension. The patient had no known drug allergies.  The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Information is limited in this case. However, a relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine cannot be ruled out and the relationship is considered indeterminate. Additional information has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: UNKNOWN CAUSE OF DEATH

Given her use of Coumadin with described severe headache, head CT was obtained.  This did not reveal any acute pathology.  Patient was treated with a combination of IV fluids, IV Reglan, IV Benadryl, oral Valium, scopolamine patch, IV Haldol, IV magnesium, IV Decadron for combined dizziness and headache.  She reported complete resolution of headache thereafter.  She was able to ambulate midway through her emergency department visit but later reported intractable dizziness for which she felt uncomfortable being discharged.  As such, general medicine was contacted for observation admission to obtain MRI to rule out posterior infarct and continue treatment for her intractable dizziness.  MRI obtained 4/18 with and without contrast showed no evidence of acute infarct and no evidence of active demyelinating lesions.  Findings compatible with known history of multiple sclerosis with supratentorial demyelination.  There was no of opacified right maxillary sinus for which she will continue Flonase.  Patient was seen by physical therapy who felt she was safe for discharge as she was able to ambulate independently without persistent dizziness.  PT and Care Management arranged for in-home physical therapy 3-5 times per week.  Prescriptions for Antivert and Zofran provided for presumed peripheral vertigo.  Did discuss the possibility of current symptoms being related to Janssen COVID 19 vaccination on March 25th, although I did convey this seemed unlikely to patient and her brother.  Patient is to follow up with her primary care doctor and was provided strict return precautions.  in 4/20/21 phone call f/u with RN Care Manager pt reports ongoing dizziness, headaches including new onset diarrhea.

                                                A few hours after the vaccine, began having a headache.  The next day had severe body aches and chills, which continued for another 4 days.  I missed 4 days of work.  I began feeling better a week after the vaccine.  24 days after the vaccine, I was awaken with excruciating pain in my left abdomen, and had severe diarrhea.  The diarrhea lasted most of that day, the pain continued.  I went to an Emergency Room on 4/1/21, and a CT scan revealed what appeared to be a stomach ulcer, a kidney stone and a post-menopausal ovarian cyst, all of which were causing the pain.  I have been through many tests and seeing a variety of doctors, and currently am awaiting results and treatment plans for the stomach problem and the ovarian cyst.  The cyst has grown and is causing continued pain.  The stomach issue is being treated with Sucralfate 1 g 4 times per day and Pepcid 20 mg.

                                                About a month later I started having odd symptoms.  I notice changes in my urinary and bowel functions.  Having to void often and more wet bowels on a weekly basis.  Shortly after I started to feel weakness in my thighs and periodically in my upper arms.  Overall weakness and stamina are not normal.  Also considerably fatigued.  Not happening every day but multiple times within a week.  Often 2 to three days feeling like above and 3 to 4 days of somewhat normal but stamina is slowly getting less than before.  Typically I can walk 3 to 4 miles 5 times a week, lift bags for yard work, not get winded on stair.

That evening she was taken to the Cath Lab and had an IVC filter placed. The next day patient began to have paresthesias and discoloration of the right lower extremity.  Ultrasound showed high-grade occlusion of the right proximal superficial femoral artery.  Patient was pre-treated with platelets and  taken back to Cath Lab emergently.  In addition to the right SFA there is also thrombotic occlusion of bilateral iliacs.  Patient had bilateral thrombectomy and bilateral common iliac stent placement. The following day developed gross hematuria.

I called my urologist and was seen on 04-14-2021. My blood platelets were extremely low. I was then referred to see a hematologist who sent me to the hospital. I was admitted at Hospital where they performed lab work, MRI&#39;s and CT scans. I stayed two days at the hospital. The hematologist who saw me said I have thrombocytopenia. Other tests were also performed and they checked me for stroke and I did not have a stroke. I am concerned due to my thrombocytopenia, if I get cut, I will bleed a lot and this is interfering with my job and to carry out my daily functions.   I am still not recovered and my platelets are low. I still have to follow-up with my PCP and my hematologist has to check my bone marrow as the next step of treatment.

                                                Severe UTI - Was tired and nauseous starting May 18th.  Saw a doctor on May 21 when I had blood in the urine.  Gave me Levofloxacin and it seemed to clear it up.  June  24 I got a high fever of 101.5.  Went to Immediate Care and another UTI.  Due to the fact I started itching at the end of the last treatment, decided to try Myobic.  Had a fever for 4 more days and it finally it cleared up.
