Patient was noted to be in severe metabolic acidosis, renal failure and shock.  Chest x-ray showed interstitial infiltrates and she tested positive for SARS-CoV2.  She required intubation and mechanical ventilation. CT brain showed encephalomalacia and atrophy, no new changes. She was transferred on April 8. She was given IV bicarb for persistent metabolic acidosis. Initially she was only treated with steroids, then antibiotics were added for fever and persistent hypotension.   She started to spike fevers up to 40.  Abdominal CXR ordered prior to MRI,  showed possible pneumatosis.  A follow up CT April 13 abdomen/pelvis was done which shows colonic pneumatosis, with air in the SMV, portal vein, air in the liver. No thrombocytopenia; platelets on April 13 were 310k, as low as 260 on April 8.

She continued to feel nauseous, congested, fatigue and rigors. Labs were ordered when she was seen in clinic on 3/25/21. Her creatinine reported on 3/26/21 was 7.19. She was admitted to local hospital for acute kidney injury, &#34;probably&#34; due to acute tubular necrosis from ischemic ATN per nephrologist. She was treated with IVF and bicarb drip.

Had to crawl to the bathroom; then realized I had lost bladder control when trying to stand up while I was still in the bedroom.  No previous history of urinary incontinence. I also experienced significant chills prior to going to bed; about 10 pm but I don&#39;t consider it an adverse reaction.

                                                67 yo female with PMH of HTN, DM who has two days of left sided numbness that has progressed to left hemiparesis and dysarthria in the setting of having received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine on Wednesday(48hours prior). Patient was found to have a right parietal multifocal parenchymal hemorrhage measuring 19x36x37mm and small right temporal lobe SAH. Subsequent CTA showed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and the right frontoparietal cortical veins as well has nonocclusive thrombus of right transverse and sigmoid sinus. The patient was also noted to have focal seizure of mouth and tongue and was loaded with phosphenytoin. After discussing case with neurology, nuero IR, NSGY and family it was decided to transfer the patient to sunrise for close monitoring and consideration of cerebral venous sinus thrombectomy if she worsens. I had a long discussion with multiple sisters about the risks of anticoagulation with argatroban given the IPH but the necessity given the cerebral venous thrombosis. I also discussed that argatroban is not readily reversible and that heparin is contraindicated if there is concern about vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia due to possible PF4 ab related to HIT. The patients VITT modified 4T score is 4 and she is intermediate risk for this being VITT. #Right parietal IPH, right temporal SAH and Superior saggital sinus thrombosis with nonocclusive thrombus of right transverse and sigmoid sinus -concern for vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia given johnson and johnson vaccine 2 days prior -modified VITT 4T score of 4- intermediate -send fibrinogen, d dimer, consider IVIG 1gm/kg per day for two days if high dimer, low fibrinogen and falling platelets -will start argatroban, avoid heparin until HIT ab (PF4) is resulted, if HIT positive avoid heparin -neuro IR consulted for possible IR intervention if worsens -transfer accepted by sunrise ICU, appreciate transfer for IR evaluation -continue phosphenytoin -SBP goal &lt;150 with nicardipine and esmolol gtts -monitor daily fibrinogen, dimer, coags #AKI- monitoring uop and cr, consider renal US if worsens #DM- ISS #HTN- nicardipine and esmolol gtts for SBP &lt;150, target 140 Patient seen, examined, labs and imaging reviewed, agree with resident note

                                                I noticed when I urinated about 09:15 am on 17th, the toilet paper looked pink after I wiped myself. I went again an hour later and I was experiencing irritation and issue with not urinating. This time there was a trickle of blood down the toilet. This is very unusual for me -  have not experienced it before. The pink color on the toilet paper continued for about 4 hours. I was having to go to the bathroom frequently. I upped my fluid intake knowing that it may be a bladder infection. I made an appt with doctor - on the 17th -  by the time I got to see her in the afternoon I saw a physician in the same office as my normal doctor - I saw Dr. - the pink on the toilet paper wasn&#39;t happening anymore. Was prescribed Cephalexin -500 mg - twice a day for 5 days. It took until yesterday before I didn&#39;t have urgency and irritation and an issue with urinating - at this point - it feels like it may be almost back to normal. We are watching now to make sure if I have any more blood or pink staining, I will get an appt with an urologist.

                                                Starting on the 8th, I saw signs of blood in urine. It started being extensive and frequent. By Wednesday at 11:30 I had extremely red bloody urine with small clots. I went to ( on Wednesday) Hospital  ER - they performed a handheld exam  - Flomax - to see if I could expel clotting. Late afternoon the next morning, I started expelling clots in very large quantities in very large clots.  It got so bad that I had my wife take me to ER but we were in the parking lot and we called the Urologist - and he said that was what it was aiming for so that it would stretch the Urethra  to pass the clots. So I didn&#39;t go to the ER. That night my urine began clearing. It stayed clear until early morning. I had a little blood and then it went away again. Since Friday, after I saw my Primary care doctor, I haven&#39;t had any blood in my urine. but I did see the doctor the next morning.  I will see the Urologist tomorrow.

                                                Patient was seen in our ER on 3/8. She stated that she had received her Johnson/Johnson COVID Vaccine on Thursday (3/4/21) and since then, had been experiencing body aches, chills, fever, fatigue, headache, n/v/d. She was admitted for treatment with IV fluids and supportive meds for the n/v/d. On 3/9, she was still feeling very ill. Fever and chills had improved but she was still not tolerating PO. BP was also elevated ranging from 142/82 to 206/80. She was also diagnosed with AKI. BUN was 51, Cr 3.26. By 3/11, she was feeling a little better but kidney function continued to deteriorate. BUN was 53, Cr 4.39. The physician decided she should be transferred to a higher level facility for her AKI on CKD. However, there were no beds available. So she remained at our facility awaiting transfer. Around 1900 that night, she experienced a bout of hypotension and decreased urine output. Chest xray was normal. EKG was NSR. She was eventually transferred to another hospital on 3/12 at 1300.
