She hit her left eye and left temple resulting in a bump and a bruise.  Patient opened her eyes when I called her name and she was not aware of were she was. Her blood pressure was 95/64 65 bpm laying down and 70/54 114 bpm when sitting. We laid her back down because she was feeling dizzy and the Ambulance arrives 45 mins after called. Because of her bump and her low BP she was taken to the hospital.

Jumped in a hot shower for 15 minutes and that went away.  I thought maybe my blood pressure had dropped too low; had same reaction when first put on too much blood pressure lowering medication.  Or sometimes allergy makes the blood pressure drop. For 24 hours after that I was on the couch or in bed lying down;  brain hurt(BAD headache), stiff neck, a big effort to lift my head off the pillow so I didn&#39;t unless I had to go to the bathroom.  I laid back down asap due to slight nausea.  No appetite. Whites of eyes were uniformly pink, eyes glassy.  3/23  Sore spot  to the touch on left temple just above the eyebrow.

The next morning when she woke up she could not walk, had to hold onto something to walk, and has a lot of pain, and has not improved even with taking pain medications.  There has been no improvement from the pain.  There are times that she feels just a little better, but then returns back to where it was.  She went to the ER on 3/17/21, they said that she had arthritis which she had but she has not had this type of pain until the vaccination.  They gave her some pain medicine which did not help at all.  She again is taking some pain medication now but the pain is still there.  She can stand on her leg and it doesn&#39;t hurt, but when she moves her leg is when it hurts.  She is now using a walker which she did not have to use before the vaccine.
