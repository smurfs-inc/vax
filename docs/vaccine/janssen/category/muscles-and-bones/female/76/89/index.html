Got up at 8:00 AM feeling exhausted.  Came home from afternoon dentist appointment (cleaning) exhausted with aching joints, bones and a slight temperature.  Went to bed at 6:00 PM and slept til 8:00 AM.  It felt like the same reaction from the flu shots which is why I didn&#39;t want to get vaccinated.  I started taking 1000 mags at 6 :00PM about every hour 7-9000 mg total and felt fine the next morning instead of in bed for 3 days with the flu shot and no Vit. C.  Also,  shortly after the shot, I got a tingling at the indent  in the back of my neck near the hairline which doesn&#39;t quite hurt but I feel the need to press on it.  I can&#39;t tell when it&#39;s going to come or what I&#39;ve done to make it happen.  It&#39;s still happening several times a day.

                                                She got the vaccine, no symptoms until about 10 days later on Tuesday 4/6/21 in the early morning she woke up around 3:00 AM and felt like she had been in a bar fight, had painful arm around vaccine site.  She could not go back to sleep that night.  The next night she went to sleep and everything was fine, no reactions.  She slept on both sides of the arm up until the 10th day, and had no problems.   The following night again got up to go to the bathroom and felt a pain in the left arm, but still had painful arm during the next day, ache going up through the top part of the arm where injection was, going across her shoulder area and into her back.  The pain comes and goes as a dull ache during the day.  The pain mainly occurs at night on the shoulder that she got the injection.  Last night the same thing happened again and she slept a couple of hours, still having sensations there.  When she got up had the big pain again, and filled a hot water bottle which seemed to help.  Right  now, 4/12/21 she still has an ache in the arm, but during the night it feels like somebody is punching the arm, which has been going on for 5-6 days.   Deep breathing also radiates the pain to the shoulder area as well.   Did not take anything for the symptoms other than the hot water bottle.

Jumped in a hot shower for 15 minutes and that went away.  I thought maybe my blood pressure had dropped too low; had same reaction when first put on too much blood pressure lowering medication.  Or sometimes allergy makes the blood pressure drop. For 24 hours after that I was on the couch or in bed lying down;  brain hurt(BAD headache), stiff neck, a big effort to lift my head off the pillow so I didn&#39;t unless I had to go to the bathroom.  I laid back down asap due to slight nausea.  No appetite. Whites of eyes were uniformly pink, eyes glassy.  3/23  Sore spot  to the touch on left temple just above the eyebrow.

                                                She received the vaccine, no problems initially, no real arm soreness.  The next morning when she woke up she could not walk, had to hold onto something to walk, and has a lot of pain, and has not improved even with taking pain medications.  There has been no improvement from the pain.  There are times that she feels just a little better, but then returns back to where it was.  She went to the ER on 3/17/21, they said that she had arthritis which she had but she has not had this type of pain until the vaccination.  They gave her some pain medicine which did not help at all.  She again is taking some pain medication now but the pain is still there.  She can stand on her leg and it doesn&#39;t hurt, but when she moves her leg is when it hurts.  She is now using a walker which she did not have to use before the vaccine.

                                                Patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, and osteoarthritis who presented from home complaining of 4 days left shoulder pain that radiates into her left pectoral area.  She states she was vaccinated with the Janssen Covid vaccine on 4/8/21 in her left shoulder and her pain started 4/23/21.  She is not sure if these were related.  It was initially intermittent, sharp, stabbing, however became fairly persistent.  She has noted her blood pressure being elevated.  On my evaluation her blood pressure is 185/64.  Patient states she was recently started on lisinopril for hypertension.  She has not taken her lisinopril yet today. Chest x-ray showed no obvious infiltrates.  Clear lung fields.  Normal cardiac dimensions. EKG shows sinus mechanism with normal axis, intervals, ST segments.  Otherwise normal EKG. D dimer was elevated, and VQ scan was negative for PE. Patient was evaluated by Cardiology who recommended outpatient stress test. Echo showed LVEF 60-65%. Trace aortic valve regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild mitral leaflet calcification is visualized. Trace tricuspid regurgitation. The right ventricular systolic pressure is calculated at 28mmHg. Patient was found to have hyperlipidemia and was started on statin. Her pain resolved on the day of discharge. Her blood pressure was controlled with lisinopril and coreg. She is to follow up with Cardiology and her PCP.
