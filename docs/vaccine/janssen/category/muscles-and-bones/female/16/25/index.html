Woke up @12:30am with chills, a headache, soreness in the injection site, and body aches in the neck, back and legs.  Got up and tried stretching and drinking water. Stoped drinking water when I felt nauseas. Did not throw up. Took Ibuprofen and melatonin before falling asleep about 30 minutes after taking the medication. Woke up @3:00am and chills were gone, only left with pain in the knees and injection site. Wasn?t able to sleep until around 4:45am. When I woke up @7:45 am, I still had slight pain in the knees, I took Tylenol @10:45 am. Pain was on and off throughout the day. I took a hot bath, that helped the pain tremendously. Fatigue throughout the day. After sleeping the day after the shot, all symptoms are gone, only soreness in the injection site.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection, I woke up after sleeping for an hour with excruciating pain in all of my limbs, especially the injection site. I could not move any of my limbs. Not because of pain, I simply could not move them. I had a fever (temp not recorded, I could only tell because I was burning up.) I was very nauseous, but never vomited. I was shaking very hard and had the chills despite being covered by a blanket and simultaneously burning up. Both of my ankles that I had suffered a running injury to several weeks ago (I have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appointment to get them checked out) were pulsing with pain. I developed a minor headache. Eventually I either drifted back to sleep or stayed awake, because I don&#39;t remember anything up until around 5am when I was able to get up and take Tylenol and water. All symptoms were gone except for the minor headache.

                                                I felt completely normal after getting the vaccine. Then at 8 pm (5 hours after getting it) I felt heat rushing to my head and face. I became very weak in my legs and I had to lay down. I took ibuprofen at 9 pm because my body aching was very intense. I woke up at 11:30 pm with such terrible body aches I could not sleep and I was crying from the pain. I had freezing chills and a throbbing headache. When I tried to stand up, I almost fell over because I felt so light-headed. I thought I was going to faint. I was so concerned about the amount of pain I was in that I called my doctor and public safety came and checked on me. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed for 3 hours. I drank Gatorade and took more ibuprofen. I was able to check my temperature. I had a 101-103 degree fever.  The entire next day (Tuesday) I took ibuprofen every six hours. My body was still very weak and aching everywhere as well as a headache. I stayed in bed the entire day. Today (Wednesday) I feel much better??both of my arms still ache a lot and my body feels exhausted.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Symptoms started yesterday, March 9th, with muscle aches in my lower back a couple hours after receiving the shot. The muscle aches spread throughout my body as time went on, and joint pain and headaches came as the muscle aches worsened. I took two ibuprofens, though they had no effect. A bit later in the day, I developed a fever and felt very nauseous. When I went to sleep, I had a hard time staying asleep and ended up vomiting when I woke up at around 1:00AM. Today, March 10th, I continue to have muscle aches, joint pain, a headache, and slight nausea.

I never fell fully asleep and began feeling worse at 11:00 PM. I had a fever of 101.5 F, chills, muscle spasms, anxiety, shortness of breath, and could not stop crying. This lasted until approx. 4 AM when I finally fell asleep. The next morning I woke up feeling much better. But, for the next 5 days, I have had on-and-off low-grade fevers between 99F and 100F.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, my left arm was shooting pain and cramped up. That faded after a couple minutes and I felt fine afterwards. Starting at 7:00PM (April 6/same day), I suddenly felt extremely dizzy, nauseous, and my entire body is aching to the point of tears. My lower abdomen and spine/hips are also in terrible pain. I?m in too much pain to sleep even though I?m exhausted and for a little while, I was struggling to catch my breath. I also have chills and feel that a fever is not far off.

I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

I took ibuprofen at 8:00pm. That night at about 9:00 my fever was 100.8 and I felt extreme fatigue.  I woke up at 3:30am feeling both extremely hot and cold with a bad headache and my temperature was 101.5. I took ibuprofen again at 3:30am. I then woke up at 5:15 am with a horrible headache and was very hot and sweating. I put cold compresses on my forehead and back of my neck which helped. The entire night, my arm with the injection site was very painful and stiff to move.

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine, a cold, tingling, transient sensation was experienced radiating from the site of the injection up into the neck. Roughly 6 hours after injection (1 a.m., 3/9/2021) severe chills were experienced for approximately two and a half hours, preventing sleep. Patient experienced dizziness. spO2 was within normal limits. Temperature was measured w/ oral thermometer to be 101.3 degrees farenheit at 4:55 a.m. in the morning on 3/9/2021.  Treatment was a single dose of ibuprofen at roughly 8 a.m. (3/9/21). Pt. continued to experience fatigue and sporadic chills, with gradual abatement of symptoms over the course of the day. Pt. had no symptoms the following Wednesday (3/10/21). Pt. experienced symptoms the following Thursday (3/11/21), with a sudden onset of intense stomach pain (8/10 on NRS) starting at approximately noon. Stomach pain was more similar to muscle cramps (with aching quality) than nausea. Other symptoms included fatigue and some feverish experiences (such as chills). Treatment was conservative (ginger tea, peppermint candies, rest). Temperature taken that evening via oral thermometer (roughly 7pm, 3/11/21) was 101.4 degrees farenheit.  Symptoms were significantly reduced the following morning, Friday 3/12/21. Temperature taken approximately 10 a.m. was within normal limits.

It was so bad that it caused me to stay in bed all day the day following the vaccine and I had to stay home from school and work. Today I am still extremely fatigued and have a bad headache and dizziness. This was not relieved by the maximum dose of Tylenol.

                                                It started with my teeth chattering and chills, but no fever yet. All of the muscles in my body had a severe tremor, and I had trouble with simple tasks like filling my nasal rinse bottle, because the tremor was so bad. My jaw was smacking the entire time, so hard that the headboard smacked against the blinds. Then I checked my temperature and it had gone from 97.5 to about 99.5. The symptoms got worse, and added in excessive thirst, pain at the base of my head where it meets my neck, pressure under and behind the eyes, severe lower back pain, muscle pain escalating on the right side of my body only, nausea, pain across the top of my forehead, and a weird heat sensation under my fingernails? Maybe and hour or so passed, and my fever rose to above 101, and I tried to go back to sleep. By this point the tremors were over, but slight chills and every other symptoms remained. I took my temp later and it was 102.7, and I again had all symptoms except the initial tremors. I also had tachycardia (super rapid heartbeat) and got dizzy for a second and have a little trouble focusing my vision when I sat up in bed.

They appear as small bug bites and are very itchy. They are hot to the touch and only slightly risen.   Additionally, at around 10 hours following the vaccine, I experienced severe muscle aches and chills (but this was listed as a typical side effect).

                                                I have chronic tension headaches and yesterday my headache wouldn&#39;t go away even with over the counter medication. I felt overall achy but still able to get up and do what I needed to do. Once I went to bed though, I woke up around 2:00a sweating, achy, and with a fever. I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep very easily and once I woke up around 7:00a I confirmed I had a fever. I am currently still bedridden with a fever, complete body aches, and slight feelings of nausea. As of right now it is 8:56a 04/06/21 and the symptoms haven&#39;t gotten any better. I haven&#39;t taken any medication since 04/05/21 at 6:15p ish, which was to treat my headache from yesterday.

                                                Around 10PM I was on the phone and felt the body aches start. About an hour or so later it started to get pretty painful, my joints. I was trying to go to sleep and I started with chills. I had a heating pad and 2 blankets and was still shivering, I took my temp and it was 102.4F. I took some Tylenol and was able to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night sweating. Next morning I was again with 102.7F fever. I slept most o the day, and when awake I noticed the body aches were still present. Kept taking Tylenol. Next day my left ear started feeling to hurt and it felt like fluid. I decided to go get checked and that is when they told me I had an inner and outer ear infection. After meds were prescribed (oral antibiotics and ear drops) the swelling has been going down a lot and it is not as near as painful.

                                                9 hours after the vaccine I had a sudden onset of flu-like symptoms. I had a fairly severe pounding headache, muscle aches, and felt very hot and cold. I was warmer than normal but did not have a full fever. I was extremely fatigued. Most of these symptoms subsided in about 24 hours with acetaminophen. I am still having occasional (every other day) mild headaches and shortness of breath, heaviness in the chest, and a couch that have persisted 5 days so far.

I instructed her to get medical care if her symptoms began again.

The chills lasted for around 4 hours, and eventually my fever went away with it. I shook so hard my back, and my joints started to ache. I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was having hallucinations from the fever and the pain would wake me up every hour, I also had a headache. The next day my back still hurts, my head still hurts despite medication, the shaking has subsided. Yet I&#39;m sweating, I&#39;m still very weak, I can&#39;t stand up without getting super dizzy or experiencing extreme fatigue. If I think of food I feel as if I&#39;m going to vomit just drinking too much water can make me ill.

                                                I had chills and a fever starting at 5 pm the day of the injection and those broke sometime in the middle of the night. I experienced some stomach discomfort but was not nauseous. However, in the middle of the night, I went to drink water and after the smallest sip I threw up everything in me. When I would use the restroom to poop I would feel a large pressure in my head, but only then and I also experienced muscular pain in my back. I was able to relieve symptoms with Advil. The fever and stomach discomfort was over by 3 am on 3/28. The chills came and went until mid-day on 3/28 and I believe that was with help of the Advil. The occasional pressure in my head only lasted until mid-day 3/28 and the back pain did not go away until the morning of 3/29. Following the vaccine I felt very dehydrated and while I drink lots of water, I had to increase my intake to even more than normal and this feeling was over by the evening of 3/28.  As of today, 3/29 I feel back to 100%.

Other than that my first major symptom was mucsle aches and body soreness which started about eight hours after the shot. A couple of hours later I started having chills which felt like I might have a fever, but thermometer said my temperature was normal. The muscle soreness remained moderate throughout the night. About 3am I took my temperature again and found that I had a fever of 99.6. The next morning the fever, aches, headache, and chills remained. The aches continued but lessened in severety by 04/03/2021 later afternoon and the fever had disappeared. Arm of the injection sight remained sore the entire time.

                                                I first noticed that I was extremely cold and could not get warm at about 11 pm on the evening of my vaccine. I then realized it was getting worse, and I was shivering uncontrollably despite sitting in front of a space heater in warm clothing and wrapped in a blanket. I checked for a fever, but my temp was only 99. I fell asleep around 1 am, and woke up at 5 am (3/8/21) to a splitting headache, extreme thirst, slight nasal congestion, muscle soreness, fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms feel almost identical to the symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID-19 in September 2020 at my university.

                                                Began with chills and muscle aches. Got worse over the course of an hour until I was unable to get out of bed. Pain in my muscles all over from hours of full body chills. The chills stopped after two hours at which point an uncontrolled fever set in. Highest temp recorded was 103. Severe full body muscle pain prevented me from getting up or drinking water on my own. Small movements like sitting up or rolling over to relieve muscle pain resulted in sudden and severe nausea. Considered going to a hospital to bring down the fever and hydrate. After two more hours of applying cold compresses, the fever decreased to 100 at which point I slept it off for six hours.  Prolonged bouts of dizziness, dehydration and nausea over the following two days.

                                                Originally, I started with random muscle aches in my left shoulder then it went down my back (a few hours after receiving vaccine). Then slightly fogginess and at night the muscle pain became worse making it difficult to sleep and started getting cold flashes. Once asleep around 12:30 I started getting muscle aches that felt like they were burning and in random spots on body along with a headache and would get random cold and heat flashes. Kept yelling out in pain all night and increased tremors in hands. Boyfriend noticed I had a fever as well and gave me ibuprofen around 3am since pain was unbearable and was difficult to sleep. Almost took me to the hospital due to the intense pain.. In morning slightly better but still frontal lobe pain and aches throughout body with raised heart rate. Cannot do much or else aches get worse including headache.

It progressed to the point where I needed assistance walking.  I had extreme chills with uncontrollable shivering and muscle spasms.  I felt very cold though I was burning up and sweating profusely.  I went to sleep and woke up a few hours later with no fever but very sore muscles.  When I woke up in the morning, I felt like nothing had happened, I was just a bit groggy.

Also I got inflammation in the injection area which is red, inflamed and causes a lot of pain as much as the movement of the arm as the touch of the area. It&#39;s like a &#34;bump&#34;. This effect originated since the same day that vaccine was applied to me and even 6 days later I still have this symptom or adverse event in my left arm which is where I received the &#34;shot.&#34;

                                                Severe headache (to the point where it was affecting my vision), dehydration, sweats and chills as though I had a fever, muscle aches, and difficulty sleeping. All of these symptoms lasted for approximately 9 hours. They started 10 hours after the vaccine itself.

I had also drank some ginger and lemon tea before bed due to stomach upset (however I believe that may be linked to my history of digestion issues that are currently going under diagnosis linked to lactose intolerance and food sensitivity). 12:00 AM 3/12/2021: I started to experience a headache, muscular aches, and chills continuing. I made myself a cup of mint tea for the warmth and the addition of the stomach settling aspect of mint.  12:15 AM 3/12/2021: I had a bowel movement and the nausea and stomach upset and gas has begun to pass (making me think that portion is linked to non-related issues of the vaccine, but wanted to note in case your professional opinion thought otherwise!). Chills, aches, and headache still continuing with little shift in extremity. 12:30 AM 3/12/2021

I was extremely tired and stayed in bed almost all day. 2 days after the vaccine, all of these symptoms were gone except the injection sight is still slightly tender 4 days later.

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

Over the course of the day these symptoms started increasing and I developed chills and a fever around 100F at about 7 hours. Took an ibuprofen when symptoms persisted and fever kept rising.  Fever rose to over 101F while sleeping and woke me up once the ibuprofen ran its course. Did some wet towel compresses but did not help. Took another ibuprofen.   Muscle aches and chills persisted into the next day. Developed another mild fever in the second day. Symptoms resolved on day 3. Soreness in arm where the vaccine was administered persists.

Also, I had pain at the site of the injection. I felt very nauseous. These symptoms persisted from hour 8 to 44 hours after receiving the shot.

                                                I passed out in my bathroom the morning after the vaccine shot around 5:30am. I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                At around 9:15 PM I started to feel nauseous and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I felt a very strong chill come over my whole body and started shivering and got directly back into bed and wrapped myself up in a thick blanket. For 45 minutes I laid wrapped up and was shivering constantly. At 10 pm I was brought extra blankets and a heating pad but moving to get situated caused dizziness. It was about 10:30 when the shivering stopped. I was able to sleep but got up to go got the bathroom around midnight and my entire body was drained of energy and I felt that I could barely stand and walk on my own. I was dizzy and my head hurt as well. I could barely hold my arms up to look at my phone briefly. Between 11 PM and 2 AM I had 5 or 6 high heart rate alerts (over 120) according to my Apple Watch but I did not wake up to them. In the morning (Sunday 4/4/21) around 9-10 am my head still hurt and my body was very achy and I felt very hungover. All day I continued to feel achy almost with a bad cold or a minor flu. Today has been better but I have still felt pretty drained. I?ve had continuous arm soreness in the arm I got the injection - but nothing too severe.   15 minutes after my vaccine on Saturday 4/3/21 I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and around midnight of that night I took 2 of pain relief PM acetaminophen (1000 mg of acetaminophen total snd 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCI total)

The only thing that made it better was walking but lying down or sitting felt like the worst thing in the world. Nausea much later in the night and my heart rate was higher than normal for the most part. My resting rate is usually 57-62 bpm but this time it was ranging between 100-108bpm. Arm soreness  Back pain was mostly felt on the left side and accompanied by leg pain. I?ve had back pain in the past but this was x100 worse to the point where I considered going to the ER. My final symptoms were nausea but waking up this morning I feel fine

About 2:30am I woke up from my headache and realized I was freezing cold, dispute it being 74 degrees in my house. I did not have a fever but I had extreme chills, my entire body shivering and shaking at some points. This made it hard to stand or even get some water. These lasted about 2 hours or so. Once I was able to get warm again, under several blankets and a heated blanket they did go away and  I did not experience them again.

                                                I woke up noticing a slight headache, but I figured it was from poor sleep the night prior. I noticed after breakfast that I felt really cold and felt an internal shiver, especially in my chest. My fingers and toes were ice cold even with a sweater, blanket, and a warm tea. I noticed my skin starting to feel tender and I felt very fatigued. I wanted knew I needed to eat so that I could take ibuprofen, but I experienced a loss of appetite. I had a mild cough, but I felt too tired to even cough. I rocked in a chair in the sunlight outside for about 15 minutes and still felt cold. When I took my oral temperature after coming inside, I was reading 99.9. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen by 1130 and layed down to rest. Bundled in 3 layers, I felt the shivering couldn&#39;t stop. My headache got worse and my skin was tender to the touch. I was able to sleep for approximately 3 hours and I woke up drenched in sweat. I took my oral temperature again and was at 101.1. I drank some more water and tried to sleep some more. When I woke up around 4:30 pm, I felt a lot better. My temperature went down to 97.8 and I had a boost in energy and appetite. I no longer had a headache and I had only mild muscle aches. By the next morning, I felt completely normal again.

I started getting really cold, took my temperature and it was at 100.1. Got a headache, slightly nauseous, body aches got a lot worse (particularly my lower back). I was also feeling a little dizzy and having a hard time comprehending information; this was probably the fever. Around 8pm,  I took my temperature again and it had risen to 102. I took some extra strength Tylenol which started helping about 30 minutes later. I woke up 3/12/2021 still with some body aches, slight headache, and slight stomachache.

                                                Approximately 7 hours after receiving the single dose of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine,  symptoms such as muscle aches, fatigue, and fever set in. Symptoms rapidly worsened over the next few hours, with the fever reaching a max temp of 103 degrees Fahrenheit. This required monitoring and the use of ice packs to keep the fever under control. Muscle aches were severe, and were particularly prominent in the lower back region and the injection site. Fever remained in the 100-103 degree range for the duration of the night and by the next day, temperature returned to around 98 degrees.

                                                The injection itself was quite painful (and I&#39;ve had many vaccine shots in my life). Felt completely fine until around 4pm when I felt a dull headache. Around 5pm, my head was throbbing so much that I couldn&#39;t leave my bed. Around 6pm, I felt muscle pains starting around my neck, slowly moving to my shoulders, chest, and upper back. Without taking any medication, I slept and woke up around 8pm. I was sweating, felt so cold but hot at the same time. The muscle pains were intense, and my head hurt so much that I took a single capsule of 200mg Advil. The pain became more manageable around 30 minutes later. Was still sweating, and muscle aches continued. I slept again at around 2am (May 26, 2021) and woke up at 10am. Head was no longer hurting, but muscle aches were still lingering.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

She received  the J&amp;J vaccine at 3:41pm. Reported immediate arm soreness. While in the 15-min observation area at 3:45pm, patient fell out of chair onto the floor 2/2 LOC. I attended immediately to the patient (EMS was called at 3:47 due to LOC) When I arrived, patient was laying on her stomach and was awaking up. We turned her onto back and placed her feet in the air. Patient was immediately able to tell me her name and date of birth. She was given cold towels and she was cooled down. Initial vitals taken at 3:47p were 146/98, HR 66. EMS arrived at 4:02 and took vitals (BP=146/94, SPO2=99%). EMS stood the patient up and patient refused to go with EMS. Patient instructed to wait an additional 15 mins after EMS left.

When I attempted to take a shower, I fainted for a few seconds and it was a struggle to move. Only felt comfortable when I was laying down. My muscles all felt painful and sore, had a painful headache, felt very disoriented and woozy. It was a struggle to walk or move, and couldn&#39;t talk loud or for a long time at once. Had to go home from work and spent the rest of the day sleeping. Around 4pm, 24 hours after the injection, my muscles felt less sore and was feeling better. The next morning, I was back to being completely normal.

I felt foggy and &#34;off&#34; at this time, like my head isn&#39;t clear. There has also been constant aching at the site of injection in my left arm.

                                                I walked up the stairs to go to bed at 10:45pm and started feeling very dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.
