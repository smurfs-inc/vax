                                                began with body aches in the knees, took Tylenol and went to bed @9:30pm. Woke up @12:30am with chills, a headache, soreness in the injection site, and body aches in the neck, back and legs.  Got up and tried stretching and drinking water. Stoped drinking water when I felt nauseas. Did not throw up. Took Ibuprofen and melatonin before falling asleep about 30 minutes after taking the medication. Woke up @3:00am and chills were gone, only left with pain in the knees and injection site. Wasn?t able to sleep until around 4:45am. When I woke up @7:45 am, I still had slight pain in the knees, I took Tylenol @10:45 am. Pain was on and off throughout the day. I took a hot bath, that helped the pain tremendously. Fatigue throughout the day. After sleeping the day after the shot, all symptoms are gone, only soreness in the injection site.

                                                I felt completely normal after getting the vaccine. Then at 8 pm (5 hours after getting it) I felt heat rushing to my head and face. I became very weak in my legs and I had to lay down. I took ibuprofen at 9 pm because my body aching was very intense. I woke up at 11:30 pm with such terrible body aches I could not sleep and I was crying from the pain. I had freezing chills and a throbbing headache. When I tried to stand up, I almost fell over because I felt so light-headed. I thought I was going to faint. I was so concerned about the amount of pain I was in that I called my doctor and public safety came and checked on me. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed for 3 hours. I drank Gatorade and took more ibuprofen. I was able to check my temperature. I had a 101-103 degree fever.  The entire next day (Tuesday) I took ibuprofen every six hours. My body was still very weak and aching everywhere as well as a headache. I stayed in bed the entire day. Today (Wednesday) I feel much better??both of my arms still ache a lot and my body feels exhausted.

                                                After about 4 hours of having the shot, I got extremely light headed and nauseous. About the same time I got really bad chills and was shaking aggressively from the cold and got very bad pain in my joints, back, neck and injection site. My skin felt very sensitive and hurt to touch.  I took medication and felt a little better but was unable to eat due to the nausea. A few hours later I still had very sensitive skin and nausea but I was very hot and couldn?t cool off. The following morning at about 8am on April 9 I woke up with hives on my ears, back of my neck up to the top of my head and the center of my chest. I still had severe body pains and my hives spread throughout the day to my face, inflating my forehead, nose and lips. I was still unable to eat because of the nausea and I was still taking ibuprofen which usually eliminates my hives. My body pain, nausea and hives stayed consistent the entire day despite taking the proper medication precautions. At about 12:30am on April 10 I checked my temperature at 100.3 degrees. At 2:30am it dropped to 98.9 degrees. The first meal I was able to eat was at about 7:30am on April 10 while take over the counter anti-nausea medication. It?s currently about 5:15pm on April 10 and most of my hives have reduced to redness, my body pain and injection site pain is still consistent and my nausea has barely reduced.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine  Chills, muscle aches, mild headache, a sudden reduced ability to hear and see, cold sweat, lightheadedness, disorientation  Starting at approximately 1:00 am on 4/08/21 I woke up with a throbbing left arm, muscle aches, a very mild headache, and chills accompanied by bouts of uncontrollable shivering.  I experienced these cold like symptoms throughout the night.  At around 6:00 am, I woke up with a very mild headache and muscle aches.   I took my temperature, and had a 101 degree Fahrenheit fever. I rested, and took my temperature multiple times that morning-- which had been gradually decreasing. At around 11:30/12:00 I experienced a sudden onset of extreme fatigue followed closely by a greatly reduced ability to hear and see, along with extreme lightheadedness and the feeling like I was going to pass out. I suddenly became cold, and my body was drenched in sweat in a matter of seconds.  I think the whole experience lasted around 10 minutes, before it eventually began to pass. I could see clearly again  and began to regain my hearing, however I still experienced some lingering auditory complications for an additional three- five minutes ( it sounded like a throbbing white noise). After that, I felt a little disoriented and tired. My aunt had taken me to Urgent Care, but they turned me away, saying I needed to go to the ER. However, by that time my symptoms had passed and I was feeling ok. So I went home and rested. By the next morning, I felt I had completely recovered

                                                I got the vaccine at 3:45 arm was sore but I wasn?t worried Later that night around 6 I started feeling disgusting from vaccine so I took an Advil.  Around 8-10pm my body started getting chills, I started shaking, I had a headache my muscles were sore, and I started getting a fever. Around 12am all of the previous symptoms got worse my fever was at about 101 and rising and I was extremely tired. At 1am I felt the worst I have ever felt in my entire life. I could barely walk because my muscles and joints hurt and my fever was over 102.5 and I felt like my veins were on fire. At 2 am I moved to my bathroom because the floor was cold and I didn?t want my roommate seeing me cry from how much pain I was in. I have a high pain tolerance but this was the worst pain I?ve ever been in. In the bathroom I was at the peak of the pain of the vaccine. My fever was over 103 all of my previous side effects were worse than ever I felt weak and a little dizzy. I also was having a hard time breathing, my breathing was weak and I felt like I wasn?t getting enough air. I tried looking up on my phone if I should go to the hospital but I could barely pick up my phone to type or look. I dropped my phone and fell asleep in the floor for 20 minutes before I woke up. I walked slowly over to my bed and took a Tylenol and then had a sip of water and felt like I was going to puke. I tried to use my inhaler and I couldn?t hold my breath to use it. I crawled into bed and slept until 11 the next day and was too sore to walk to class all of my joints still hurt and I had a fever of 101 and a headache . I took a Tylenol and around 6pm my fever broke and I was feeling better. The next day I was still too sore to walk to class and had a headache. Today I am still sore but better my lungs still feel a little tight, I feel unfocused , and I still feel dizzy occasionally. I have no appetite and I feel nauseous when I eat so I?ve been eating in smaller portions . Every single day since the shot I?ve felt very tired. I hope these symptoms get better and Looking back on the night of vaccine I should have gone to the hospital.

Felt these symptoms from about 4:00 PM until about 11:00 PM when I went to sleep. The next morning, 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, my head still ached/throbbed, and my back still felt incredibly awful. My left shoulder was also still very sore. As of now, almost 60 hours after the vaccine, the only symptom still remaining is the very sore shoulder. I cannot extend it fully without immense pain, but it still hurts otherwise.

                                                Around 5:00 PM the day I got the shot I started to get a slight headache. Shortly after the headache appeared I started to get the chills, I was wrapped up in multiple blankets and started shaking uncontrollably. I then checked my temperature and at this time it was 100.3. I then ate dinner and decided to try and fall asleep. When I lied down my heart began to beat very fast. I tracked my heart rate via a watch and my resting heart rate was around 140 bpm. My fever had also increased to 102. My head ache continued to get worse and I began to have bad neck and lower back pains. I was also having muscle spasm in my calfs. The entire night I could barely sleep because of my high heart rate, body aches, shakes, and the constant change from freezing cold to hot and sweating.

                                                She felt totally fine after the shot and many hours after.  She felt fine to go to a horseback ride lesson at 4.  Half way through the lesson she acutely felt like she was going to faint/nauseous (she had a ton to eat that day, had a bottle of water just before lesson, etc. so she knew it wasnt those kinds of things) and then had a crushing headache with a lot of &#34;pressure behind her eyes&#34;, dizziness, and a really &#34;strange&#34; feeling like out of body, bawling crying, and started FREEZING.  I got there 15 minutes later and she was under lots of blankets, white as a sheet, freezing, said her spine was sore from the top to bottom... just tons of symptoms.  When I got her, she moved to my car and had seat heater on high and I had to put all the clothes from a suitcase I had in my car on top of her bc she was so cold and her skin was burning up.  I gave her 3 200 advil and a bottle of water.  ½ hour later i had a thermometer and even after that she still had 102.3 fever.  She was rambling some nonsense and seemed very disoriented for a while. She went straight to shower and laid on the floor of the shower for ½ hour, took cold medicine, and evnetually went to sleep.  In the night she was freezing again and the fever had spiked and she took more advil.  The next day she felt much better in the morning and fine by lunchtime.  She was VERY sick/uncomfortable with basically every symptom under the sun.

                                                Around 10:00pm, I developed a fever and chills. The chills lasted for about two hours until I was just left with the fever until I fell asleep around 2:00am. The next day, I woke up with neck and head pain which disappeared after a couple more hours of rest until 11:00am. Afterward, that day, I had a slight headache which eventually disappeared sometime late in the evening around 9pm. The following day after the shot (second day later), I felt completely normal.

Went to two urgent care that would not see her.  Went to Med center. She had severe back pain and ringing in her ears at this point. They left her in a room for 30 minutes to go consult with a doctor after she told them she had the J&amp;J vaccine. They came back and told her she had fluid in ear from pollen and back pain was caused from the chills and shaking. She still has a sharp pain in her ear and ringing in ears is still present.

                                                Chills, shortly followed by shivering and chattering. The shivering is so intense it essentially renders the patient in a state of involuntary writhing; muscles across the body, even if not in movement, may be tensed to the point of pain. Muscles affected lie in the legs, arms, and torso. An observer might mistake the event for a seizure, though the patient is fully conscious for the duration. The episode lasts only a few minutes; such an episode has only occurred once.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Symptoms started yesterday, March 9th, with muscle aches in my lower back a couple hours after receiving the shot. The muscle aches spread throughout my body as time went on, and joint pain and headaches came as the muscle aches worsened. I took two ibuprofens, though they had no effect. A bit later in the day, I developed a fever and felt very nauseous. When I went to sleep, I had a hard time staying asleep and ended up vomiting when I woke up at around 1:00AM. Today, March 10th, I continue to have muscle aches, joint pain, a headache, and slight nausea.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA About 8 hours after the vaccine, I developed a fever and chills. Then when I went to bed at 9:30 pm I had extreme thirst. I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Immediately after getting the vaccine, I experienced severe nausea for 10-20 minutes. I experienced no symptoms for 3-4 hours afterward, but then began to develop a low-grade fever,  muscle aches, a headache, and became nauseous again.  Around 12 hours after getting the vaccine, I developed a fever of 102 F, I began to experience severe muscle aches and cramps in my calves and abdomen. I also began to develop a much worse headache and lost partial vision in my right eye for a few hours. This is when I became violently nauseous, but I was unable to throw up, or defecate.  I was unable to sleep during this time, and at 2 am, my nausea peaked, and I threw up incredibly violently and incredibly suddenly. It was so violent, it caused me to pop a blood vessel in my eye, and gave me a sore throat. However, after throwing up, most of nausea subsided.  At this point, the vision began to return to my eye. 20-40 minutes after throwing up, I began to experience chills that lasted for up to an hour. Eventually, I slept at 4 am, but slept fitfully, and woke every 40 minutes to 2 hours.  At 7 am on the 9th, the nausea was completely gone the day after my vaccination, but the muscle aches and headaches were back. My fever was down to 101, and I took some Tylenol and slept fitfully until 2 pm when I woke up feeling significantly better.

Head pain progressed and got worse and worse. A fever was present by 3am (99.0) and went up every hour reaching the highest of 102.7. I experienced violent chills and shaking, extreme nausea, extreme muscle aches and pains, extreme light sensitivity, dizziness, lethargy, and extreme weakness. I took extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours to control fever and other symptoms. All symptoms subsided within 24 hours, except for headache, tiredness and aches and pains. All symptoms went away by 8pm on 4/13/2021.

                                                A few hours after I got home from getting the shot, my lower body started to ache super bad. My skin started to hurt like I had rug burn, but I wasn&#39;t surprised because that happens to me when I get the flu. My legs and groin region started to hurt more and more and I got the chills. It was extremely bad and I was sort of writhing but I told myself I was overreacting. At around 8 or 9, I decided I would sleep it off and went to bed. At 1:00 am, I got up to use the bathroom and I began feeling lightheaded. I thought I had just stood up to fast so I continued. As I walked, i got more and more dizzy and I couldn&#39;t hear well. When I sat on the toilet, I realized I wasn&#39;t going to be able to get back up, so I sat and waited. I started to get super hot so I took my shirt off. I finally was able to get up and walked towards the sink but I collapsed before I got there. I started drinking the sink water and ran my shirt under the water and put it on my head to cool off.  This really helped so I went back to my room to call my mom. I have never fainted before or come this close to fainting. For the rest of the night I had the worst migrane of my life that gave me aura in my left eye and made my left arm and left side of my face go numb, as well as pulsing in my head. The pain on my skin, and in my legs and head was still there for two days after but it was manageable enough for me to go about my day. I tried to exercize to ease the muscle pain but this did not work.

                                                First symptoms were fever of 103.5 at midnight on the 28th. I called the RA on call in my university department and they called PD - to come and make sure I was okay. For 36 hours, I felt terrible - couldn&#39;t do anything. About 1 1/2 to 2 weeks later, I started getting really severe back pain that made it hard for me to do things - even sitting in a chair caused so much pain or walking or standing for long periods of time made me light headed because it was intense pain. There was one instance, when I nearly passed out from the pain but I didn&#39;t as I called for help for someone to catch me. It kind of moves around - the pain - sometimes it&#39;s a along my spine and sometimes it&#39;s low below my shoulder blades. I&#39;m still having this pain. It&#39;s not on the same pain scale as it was a couple of weeks ago. It&#39;s more manageable right now. I do stretches and some medications and there are a couple of patches  - Salontas - that my dad uses that he recommended I try to use for backaches. I am calling my doctor today to make an appointment.

They appear as small bug bites and are very itchy. They are hot to the touch and only slightly risen.   Additionally, at around 10 hours following the vaccine, I experienced severe muscle aches and chills (but this was listed as a typical side effect).

Sore joints, and entire skull hurt. Inner ears also hurt. Slept or 12 hours Headache was also present most of the day before the fever set in.  My period started the day before and usually I have heavy days first. I had a light day after my injection and today it&#39;s extremely heavy. So it messed with the flow.

                                                I began feeling a migraine at 3pm. I took a nap and woke up at 6pm feeling extremely ill. My temperature was 101.5F and my entire body was in pain. I took two Tylenol as suggested. Over the course of the entire evening, I was vomiting profusely; I vomited approximately 10 times. By around 10pm my extremities became numb and I could not walk without assistance. I could not think or speak straight. I nearly fainted every time I tried to sit up. I tried to take ondansetron for vomiting but proceeded to vomit the medication as well. I wanted to go in to the ER because I felt like I was dying, but I do not feel financially comfortable doing so. All symptoms remained consistent until about 3am when I was able to sleep until 7am. I woke up with several bouts of diarrhea, intense nausea, and head to toe muscle and joint pains, as well as numbness and tingling in my arms and legs still. It is now 5pm the next day and I still can&#39;t eat or stand for too long without feeling faint. I still have diarrhea and strong migraine.

At 7:00, three hours after receiving the vaccine, I developed a fever and slight nausea, as well as fatigue. I went to sleep at 9:00 and woke up several times during the night with a fever. At 3:00am, I woke up with severe nausea which lasted for an hour. At 6:30am, I woke up with a fever, headache, and muscle pain in my left arm and legs. I took two Advil at 6:40. At around 10:40 my symptoms were relieved.

                                                About 3 hours after vaccination, intense headache began. My head felt like it was being pounded with a hammer, and the pain was so intense it traveled down from my forehead to my jaw bone. At around 3:00 pm on April 8, I began to develop a fever which first started at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. By around 5:00 pm, the fever had progressed to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, and the 700mg of Tylenol I had taken was not breaking the fever. I started to get body chills, muscle pain, joint soreness, and cold sweats. Again, Tylenol was not helping. I had no appetite and was having trouble keeping fluids down. Around 11:00 pm on April 8, I took more Tylenol and the fever began to break but did not fully break until 36 hours after the vaccination. It is now April 10 and I am starting to feel like myself again, but for a full 36 hours the pain was so intense that even a light sheet covering my body was painful.

                                                My arm swelled up about 30 minutes after the injection near my shoulder. I started feeling pain in my forearm and the facility nurse gave me an ice pack. I stayed an hour after the shot and the nurse said I should be fine, so I went home. Around 10 pm I started having a really bad reaction, worse than normal flu symptoms. A fever of 102 and body chills that lasted for about an hour. Heart rate also consistently stayed above 130 bpm. I drank a lot of water and took an Advil. I then was advised to take a warm shower, and this helped bring my fever to a 99. After the shower, I became really nauseous and started throwing up. I was debating going to the ER. I also drank chicken broth and a lot of water and did not go to sleep until 4 am.  The next two days I had a low fever and bad muscle aches throughout my body, the flu symptoms ended in 4 days.

I was also going back and forth between being very cold and very hot. I have not gotten a fever so far. The pain was so bad that I wasn?t able to sleep at all. The following morning, today, I am still experiencing pain in my hips, thighs, and knees, as well as a faint headache every so often.

Patient states that she got the J&amp;J vaccine yesterday and then over night she had onset of severe lower back pain that is localized to her back, but can occasionally be felt in her buttocks area. She first noticed body aches prior to bed. She woke around 3am to use bathroom and had terrible headache and back pain. Headache had subsided, but the back pain has persisted. The pain is located along her lower back, bilaterally. Sometimes the pain is felt in her buttocks. Pain otherwise is localized. Pain is dull, but intense. She rates the pain as a 8 or 9/10. Pain can not be alleviated. She tried a hot pack, with no relief. Laying down increases the pain, and the pain is so severe that she is unable to move. She feels afraid to move the pain is so intense. She has noticed no other symptoms. All other symptoms from the shot have subsided. Patient also became nauseated while in the exam room. Patient had negative pregnancy test yesterday. &#34;

                                                Per patient email on April 14, 2021: &#34;I experienced pretty serious abdominal pain that I felt in my reproductive area as well. I did have muscle pain in my hips and legs. But I did not really have a headache besides just fogginess. I received my vaccine at 9:00am and they started around 6:00pm. I left work early and went home where I slept and woke up the next day feeling back to normal.&#34;

                                                Johnson and johnson covid-19 vaccine eau  March 20th - allergic reaction to covid vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson. Allergic reaction started approximately 2 minutes after receiving shot. It started with itching and redness on my arms and upper chest. After approximately 10 minutes, I knew something was wrong and I signaled an attendant. They immediately brought me over to the EMTs on site, where they looks me over and started drawing up IV Benadryl. In the time it took for them to draw up IV Benadryl and insert the IV, the hives on my chest started to turn into burning and ice sensations intermittently. As soon as they administered the IV Benadryl, the itching redness and hives on my arms went away within a couple minutes, and I was left with only redness on my upper chest. They felt comfortable with me getting a ride to the ER from my dad and not getting emergency transport. At the ER, they gave me pepcid and prednisone. About an hour and a half later, I started developing chest tightness and hives and redness on the side of my face. They decided to administer more Benadryl and start epinephrine. I was discharged a couple hours later.  March 22nd - I went back to the hospital, with complaints of severe stomach pain. The stomach pain lasted approximately 24 hours.  March 20th to march 26th - I experienced extreme fatigue. I was exhausted to the point where on Wednesday I took a ten minute shower and by the end of it I had to lay down again because I was shaking from exhaustion.  Symptoms improved slightly until April 5th where it started taking a turn for the worse.  April 5th - I started noticing black spots in my vision that wouldn&#39;t go away. They didn&#39;t move and they stayed in one spot for hours until I fell asleep and then they&#39;d be gone the next morning. They usually started around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. Sometimes a couple hours earlier. They came every day until Friday April 9th when they did not come.   April 5th to present - I also started noticing light-headedness, motion sickness when I stood still or sat in a chair, nausea, neck pain, and periods of muscle weakness in the neck. These symptoms have not stopped.  Friday April 9th around 6:45 p.m. I started having a bad migraine, I noticed in the bathroom at work my eyes were dilating over and over and over again rapidly. The pain was very high. I ended up leaving work early and going to the emergency room. While at the emergency room they treated my migraine with a cocktail of Benadryl, toradol, and compazine. It reduced the pain at the time, however it did not take away the migraine.  Friday April 9th to present - My migraine has continued from April 9th and is still happening. I have been having severe light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, and trouble reading. The rapid dilation of my eyes stopped April 10th, however my eyes stayed dilated until April 12th.  In addition to all of my other symptoms, there are others that I am not as positive are relevant. I have asthma and it has been worse over the past couple of weeks, it it is not usually worse this time of year. I&#39;ve been also been having quite a bit more light bruising than normal over the past two weeks and over the past one and a half weeks I have noticed red spots all over my skin. I was not sure if these red spots were normal or not because I do have them on occasion however these are darker than normal.

                                                Around 10PM I was on the phone and felt the body aches start. About an hour or so later it started to get pretty painful, my joints. I was trying to go to sleep and I started with chills. I had a heating pad and 2 blankets and was still shivering, I took my temp and it was 102.4F. I took some Tylenol and was able to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night sweating. Next morning I was again with 102.7F fever. I slept most o the day, and when awake I noticed the body aches were still present. Kept taking Tylenol. Next day my left ear started feeling to hurt and it felt like fluid. I decided to go get checked and that is when they told me I had an inner and outer ear infection. After meds were prescribed (oral antibiotics and ear drops) the swelling has been going down a lot and it is not as near as painful.

                                                9 hours after the vaccine I had a sudden onset of flu-like symptoms. I had a fairly severe pounding headache, muscle aches, and felt very hot and cold. I was warmer than normal but did not have a full fever. I was extremely fatigued. Most of these symptoms subsided in about 24 hours with acetaminophen. I am still having occasional (every other day) mild headaches and shortness of breath, heaviness in the chest, and a couch that have persisted 5 days so far.

(Day 0, 1 and 2).  She reported she had severe muscle aches and difficulty breathing.  She did not seek medical care and her symptoms were resolved when she called me on March 18th.  I instructed her to get medical care if her symptoms began again.

The chills lasted for around 4 hours, and eventually my fever went away with it. I shook so hard my back, and my joints started to ache. I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was having hallucinations from the fever and the pain would wake me up every hour, I also had a headache. The next day my back still hurts, my head still hurts despite medication, the shaking has subsided. Yet I&#39;m sweating, I&#39;m still very weak, I can&#39;t stand up without getting super dizzy or experiencing extreme fatigue. If I think of food I feel as if I&#39;m going to vomit just drinking too much water can make me ill.

                                                I had chills and a fever starting at 5 pm the day of the injection and those broke sometime in the middle of the night. I experienced some stomach discomfort but was not nauseous. However, in the middle of the night, I went to drink water and after the smallest sip I threw up everything in me. When I would use the restroom to poop I would feel a large pressure in my head, but only then and I also experienced muscular pain in my back. I was able to relieve symptoms with Advil. The fever and stomach discomfort was over by 3 am on 3/28. The chills came and went until mid-day on 3/28 and I believe that was with help of the Advil. The occasional pressure in my head only lasted until mid-day 3/28 and the back pain did not go away until the morning of 3/29. Following the vaccine I felt very dehydrated and while I drink lots of water, I had to increase my intake to even more than normal and this feeling was over by the evening of 3/28.  As of today, 3/29 I feel back to 100%.

My arm at the site of the injection was mildly sore for 3-4 days after the vaccine

                                                It was around 5:00-6:00 PM when I started to feel very lightheaded all the time and had bad muscle aches. It got to the point where if I did anything but lay down, I would feel lightheaded and off balance. The worst happened at 3:00 AM on 4/10/2021 (the day after) when I got up to use the bathroom. I was washing my hands afterwards and nearly passed out. I couldn&#39;t hear, I couldn&#39;t see, and it was a bit difficult to breath. Luckily I knew what all of this meant and I sat down and took deep breaths until I felt fine again.

At 8:00 chills started, along with a feeling of all my muscles contracting , lost the ability for fine motor control and  fell asleep at 9.pm. Woke up at 12:45am covered in sweat feeling as if I was burning with a splitting heavy headache, had fever, don?t know temperature new house so no thermometer but it sucked. dunked head in sink. Legs could barely support me so I couldn?t go down the stairs for pain medication, went back to bed. Got cold washcloth at 1:00am pain felt pretty unbearable, couldn?t make it downstairs or move at this point so I spent night in and out of sleep unable to move. Muscles still feel like rocks and my head feels like it?s stuffed with a mixture of Vaseline and nitroglycerin, every time I move it feels like my brains smashing into my skull with little explosions. Recent development within the last 5-6 hours maybe?(3:00-4:00pm) centralized over my breast bone feels incredibly painful, hurts to breath and feels like something heavy is pressing it through my chest into my spine. Not sure what to do or if this is normal but it hurts really really bad. Accurate hours because I was lucidly texting my friends to make sure I wouldn?t pass out, so I have nearly exact hours when each symptom appeared till I could no longer use my fingers.

                                                Several hours after getting the vaccine, my back spasmed out and the pain was continuous and I still have the upper back pain today. That same evening I developed the chills, stomach pain. The next day I began experiencing a fever, headache, nausea, light headedness, dizziness, chills, back pain, lock jaw, some numbness on left side of face, zoning out or spacing out. My period also came two weeks early. I had some throat irritation as well as the feeling of being weak and some neck stiffness. All these symptoms seem to have gone away by Sunday evening, if not Monday morning. Except for the back pain, the nausea, and the throat irritation and some head pain and some numbness in face seem to have persisted.

                                                I first noticed that I was extremely cold and could not get warm at about 11 pm on the evening of my vaccine. I then realized it was getting worse, and I was shivering uncontrollably despite sitting in front of a space heater in warm clothing and wrapped in a blanket. I checked for a fever, but my temp was only 99. I fell asleep around 1 am, and woke up at 5 am (3/8/21) to a splitting headache, extreme thirst, slight nasal congestion, muscle soreness, fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms feel almost identical to the symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID-19 in September 2020 at my university.

                                                Began with chills and muscle aches. Got worse over the course of an hour until I was unable to get out of bed. Pain in my muscles all over from hours of full body chills. The chills stopped after two hours at which point an uncontrolled fever set in. Highest temp recorded was 103. Severe full body muscle pain prevented me from getting up or drinking water on my own. Small movements like sitting up or rolling over to relieve muscle pain resulted in sudden and severe nausea. Considered going to a hospital to bring down the fever and hydrate. After two more hours of applying cold compresses, the fever decreased to 100 at which point I slept it off for six hours.  Prolonged bouts of dizziness, dehydration and nausea over the following two days.

                                                Originally, I started with random muscle aches in my left shoulder then it went down my back (a few hours after receiving vaccine). Then slightly fogginess and at night the muscle pain became worse making it difficult to sleep and started getting cold flashes. Once asleep around 12:30 I started getting muscle aches that felt like they were burning and in random spots on body along with a headache and would get random cold and heat flashes. Kept yelling out in pain all night and increased tremors in hands. Boyfriend noticed I had a fever as well and gave me ibuprofen around 3am since pain was unbearable and was difficult to sleep. Almost took me to the hospital due to the intense pain.. In morning slightly better but still frontal lobe pain and aches throughout body with raised heart rate. Cannot do much or else aches get worse including headache.

It progressed to the point where I needed assistance walking.  I had extreme chills with uncontrollable shivering and muscle spasms.  I felt very cold though I was burning up and sweating profusely.  I went to sleep and woke up a few hours later with no fever but very sore muscles.  When I woke up in the morning, I felt like nothing had happened, I was just a bit groggy.

                                                Muscle pain, fever, and headache the day after the vaccine was administered and this lasted 2 days. Also I got inflammation in the injection area which is red, inflamed and causes a lot of pain as much as the movement of the arm as the touch of the area. It&#39;s like a &#34;bump&#34;. This effect originated since the same day that vaccine was applied to me and even 6 days later I still have this symptom or adverse event in my left arm which is where I received the &#34;shot.&#34;

Then symptom completely gone over 1-2 days.  She also noticed left face/hip with raised red areas that looked like she had been bitten by ants on 4/2 (day after receiving vaccine).  This rash was gone in one hour and no symptoms since.

                                                My daughter got the shot at 1 pm on the 8th of April, 2021. (My daughter &amp; I both got the shot at the same shot at the same time). By 11:00 pm my daughter started complaining with feeling dizzy. She kept saying she felt like she was going to throw up, meaning she was nauseated. She was complaining with her bones hurting. We both got these symptoms at the same time. We both stayed in and out of the shower letting the shower water just run on us. I had to give her ibuprofen because she complained of a mild headache &amp; the pain all over her body. She couldn?t sleep at all. She cried. It had her scared. I fully believe she?s having an allergic reaction to the Janssen shot. I have fully read the Janssen ?fact sheet?. My daughter was having hot flashes &amp; cold sweats. She has ongoing symptoms &amp; it?s been 2 days since receiving shot including fever. She was having what I thought heart palpitations. We both swelled up causing our bodies to feel tight. We both were healthy before receiving the shot. We?ve never had covid nor tested positive. We are currently going to receive a check up by a doctor. The side effects of this medication is dangerous &amp; doesn?t compare to flu like symptoms.

                                                The night I got my shot, my entire body was freezing and I couldn?t sleep at all because my entire body was in so much discomfort and pain, especially near my rib cage area in the front and back. The following day was the exact same, except my front rib cage didn?t hurt anymore (only the back). I was extremely fatigued and I couldn?t sit down because my body hurt so much. The worst symptoms were the sharp ear and neck pain (by the ears). It was a sharp, sporadic pain, but it still hurts a lot.  It?s now been 2 days since the shot and the neck and ear pain is now more frequent, though my fever and some of my muscle sores are now getting better. I also feel extremely nauseous, like I?m going to puke anytime soon.

When I stand up my vision goes black, and I develop joint pain, muscle aches, and very bad nausea.  9:00pm - I take 500mg of aspirin and all of my syptoms persist for ~30 minutes when suddenly my fever breaks and I&#39;m sweating underneath my 3 blankets and I can think again as long as I don&#39;t move my head. Everything still sounds weird and my stomach and joints still hurt but I go to sleep. 4:00am- wake up crying from the headache and with a fever again so I take 500 more mg of aspirin and set an alarm to take more at 10am.  10:00am- I feel exhausted and really weird, I take only 250mg of aspirin and sleep the whole day.  4:00pm - I wake up feeling so much better. Kind of achy and still very nauseous, my ears still ring when I stand up.   4:00pm yesterday - now: I kept movement at a minimum and was still nauseous throughout the day but was able to eat at around 9pm. I think I may have had a low grade fever on and off last night but the headache has thankfully stayed away and other than a little bit of arm soreness and weakness I feel back to normal today.

                                                Around 6pm I started having normal mild reactions to the covid vaccine. Around 10pm I lost feeling in both arms and my lower legs, but otherwise was still able to move without pain. At about 10:30, the loss of feeling turned into partial paralysis and extreme pain where feeling had been previously lost. My hands refused to stay in any position except for a clenched fist or fingers completely extended. Moving my arms and lower legs was only able to be done with great difficulty. I was worried that it would spread to my chest, so I got up from where I&#39;d been sitting at a desk and began forcing myself to walk up and down my apartment hallway. I was able to do this though my gait was stuttery and uneven, and my pain was about an 8 out of 10. I was alone in my apartment at the time and my hands weren&#39;t working well enough to handle my phone. After about 10 or 15 minutes the nerve pain and paralysis subsided and hasn&#39;t come back since, but my leg muscles felt incredibly weak the rest of the night and my partner had to help me to make sure I didn&#39;t fall over a couple of times. I didn&#39;t end up going to the doctor or seeking treatment because it didn&#39;t come back.

                                                Several hours after the vaccine I noticed abdominal pain located in my lower back, primarily on the left side. I also had a pounding headache (not a migraine), and other body aches. Over the next several days (Thursday night through Saturday, 4/1-4/3) these symptoms persisted along with mild dehydration and constipation. The aches I treated with ibuprofen, and I used a mild, natural laxative to try to poop. The constipation was relieved by pooping, but it was much less than my normal amount of stool, and it took a couple days to fully abate. I also noticed that I wasn?t sweating very much/at all until about a week after I received the vaccine, which was very worrying. I attempted to drink plenty of water during all of this, though I can?t be sure I succeeded. I think my menstrual period may have happened during this week, maybe starting on the Tuesday falling the vaccine, but cannot remember for sure. Constipation and dehydration are unusual for my period, though the pain is not. There was soreness in my arm muscles around the vaccine site, but it was consistent with what I feel from any other vaccine, and only lasted a day.  All discomfort ceased about a week after the vaccine.

                                                Mother gave me lot # which is Moderna lot#201A21A, but the vaccination card says Janssen which does not match up with this lot#.  Mother reports that she had the vaccine, had no symptoms, and then started with a fever that evening of 103.  She was having cold extremities, numbness, tingling of the arms, face, legs.  The fever dropped and went away and was having fatigue and getting winded doing regular activities.  By Monday she continued with the shortness of breath and go increasingly worse as the days went on and also the.  By Wednesday she was having chest pain, numbness and tingling of her extremities and shortness of breath.  She went to the hospital, gave her IVs, says her BP was elevated and sent her home.  Mother told her to sleep and see how she felt.  By Thursday night 4/15/21 she screamed out because she was having chest pains and having chest and pains and not able to straighten out her hand and could not catch her breath.  She was then taken back to the hospital and said that she her BP was high and said that she had the Janssen vaccine, and said that she was hyperventilation due to anxiety.  Once they got her stable and released her again.  Mother asked the doctor if he felt that this was normal, and could see her throat contracting and that she was stable and to go home, and he said yes and that it was anxiety and that sometimes we get ourselves worked up about things and that was causing it.    The daughter has no history of anxiety, no breathing issues.   They did labs and everything was okay, her counts were somewhat off but nothing felt to be abnormal.      She then went to another Hospital as she was still not feeling well, and checked the other reports from the other hospital and they conferred with that information, gave her Valium and sent her home.    As the evening progressed on Friday 4/16/21 she started having chest pains and her girlfriends mother is a nurse and came and saw her and called the mother and told her that she did not like how she was looking, and that her SOB and weakness in her extremities and the tightness in her chest was not right and that she felt that she had a PE.    They took her to another location, she had extremely high calcium levels, and high blood pressure and her heart rate was high and she was admitted.  She has been on flushes to reduce calcium, and her blood levels are improving.  She is on Warfarin to prevent clotting.  She has had a CAT scan and other studies and all were negative.  She felt better yesterday, but she states today that she is not feeling as well, she is nauseous and gave her Zofran,  has a headache, and they gave her something a little stronger than Tylenol.  She is extremely fatigued and weak.    Mother said that she saw her on Sunday 4/18/21 and that she was not able to walk, they had to put her in a wheelchair, and her grandfather walks faster than she can.    They are presently getting her up to get her to walk and see how her strength is, 4/20/21.  They are now waiting to get her levels under control and to see if she is strong enough to go home.  Neurology released her from their standpoint as they did not see anything, but she is to FU with them afterwards and want to do EMG&#39;s as an out patient.

I had also drank some ginger and lemon tea before bed due to stomach upset (however I believe that may be linked to my history of digestion issues that are currently going under diagnosis linked to lactose intolerance and food sensitivity). 12:00 AM 3/12/2021: I started to experience a headache, muscular aches, and chills continuing. I made myself a cup of mint tea for the warmth and the addition of the stomach settling aspect of mint.  12:15 AM 3/12/2021: I had a bowel movement and the nausea and stomach upset and gas has begun to pass (making me think that portion is linked to non-related issues of the vaccine, but wanted to note in case your professional opinion thought otherwise!). Chills, aches, and headache still continuing with little shift in extremity. 12:30 AM 3/12/2021

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

As the night continued, if I moved my head at all it would cause severe pain and a pounding headache. Additionally, I experienced shooting pains through my neck and back, I became extremely hot to the touch, yet I felt freezing cold and could not stop shivering. Then I developed severe aching and tingling from the top of my head to the tips of my toes, with excruciating lower back pain and I could feel my heart beating very fast. My entire body was tense and sore. These symptoms did not alleviate for 12 hours and I could not fall asleep due to the discomfort I was in. I finally was able to fall asleep at 6 a.m. after the aching/tingling/pain/hotness subsided (about 12 hours after side effects started).

                                                I am 7 months pregnant (DD:). I received the vaccine yesterday evening around 5:30 pm. By 2:30 am I had spiked a 101 fever with chills. I was advised by my doctor to take Tylenol to break the fever. By 5 am the fever had broken but all day now I have been experiencing severe muscle/body aches, feel lightheaded, nauseous, and extremely fatigued.

Started feeling muscle fatigue around 4pm, with upper body aches, stinging eyes, and nausea by 6pm. Fever of 102, and progression to full body aches and headache by 8pm in addition to the aforementioned symptoms that continued throughout the night. Fever lowered to 99 and only minor body aches by mid morning on the 12th. Headache continued throughout the day with low grade fever. I predict that I will feel 100% better within 48 hours.

My body ached the day after the shot and then the evening after is when my symptoms became more severe. I was extremely tired and my entire body hurt. It hurt to even touch my hair, lay in bed, stand, and be covered up by blankets. The following day I just felt tired and my arm was sore. Three days after my vaccine I woke up with a sore throat and neck, but just on the left side. I slept the majority of the day and my body felt achy all day. Four days after my vaccine I woke up again shivering uncontrollably and my body felt sore all over.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the injection, I started developing a fever, within an hour it had reached 103.3 F. At this point I took 400 mg of over the counter ibuprofen which helped drop my temperature slightly to approximately 102.2 F.  This fever continued into the night. I took another dose of ibuprofen before sleeping, about 6 hours after the first dose. Along with fever I experienced strong shaking/chills, muscle and joint soreness, headache, dizziness, confusion, and chest pain/feeling of pressure on the chest. The day after vaccination I continued to have a low-grade fever of approximately 100 F which subsided by evening. All other symptoms subsided as well except for the chest pain. On the second day post-vaccination my only remaining symptom is the chest pain.

                                                I received the shot at 14:30, in which medical staff in the jail&#39;s medical center watched me for 20 minutes to ensure there were no immediate reactions. I went about my day afterward with no symptoms. At 21:30 when I went to sleep, I got some aches in my joints and took 1 dose of liquid capsule NyQuil to help with the pain and went to sleep. At 00:30, the 7th, I woke up groaning in my sleep to the extreme pain in my joints and feeling hot internally. I decided to get up and take a warm bath to ease the aches. I went and ran the bath and all of a sudden while it was running, I had a severe need to throw up, but could not naturally. Since this was concerning, I got up and walked out of the bathroom and all of a sudden in the hall I got a feeling of impending doom and that something was not right and I fainted. I laid on the floor for what I would approximate to be 5 minutes going in and out of consciousness waiting for the blood to fully return to the brain. After this, I instantly felt like I needed to survive and that I felt like I could be dying so I slowly crawled down the stairs to get to my military ID so I could call the military&#39;s nurse advice line. I had to take a break and lay on the concrete in my garage because I felt so dizzy and so hot and began to feel my vision disappear like I was going to faint again. I waited a few minutes before getting back up the stairs crawling to my phone to call. When I called them 00:58, they told me to call 911 because they believed I would be having a severe reaction, though I noted to them I did not have a rash or hives. I then called 911 at 01:08. They sent EMT&#39;s to my home which took my vitals. I had normal blood pressure, SPo2, and temp, but an elevated heart rate of just under 100 and a high respiration rate. EMT&#39;s made the decision for me to stay home since the hospital did not seem immediate in their opinion. After this I stayed on the couch for a few minutes and then felt very tired so I walked slowly to my room and fell asleep. I woke up at 06:00 for work, and arrived at 07:00. In the hour after waking up I was achy, sweating, and felt light headed. I got to work and my Sergeant told me to go home and sleep. I slept another 5 hours at 08:00 and when I woke up most of my symptoms went away other than aches and getting flush very easily for 5 days.  At this current time all I notice is some random light headedness that quickly resolves and comes a few times a day at random and without cause.

Over the course of the day these symptoms started increasing and I developed chills and a fever around 100F at about 7 hours. Took an ibuprofen when symptoms persisted and fever kept rising.  Fever rose to over 101F while sleeping and woke me up once the ibuprofen ran its course. Did some wet towel compresses but did not help. Took another ibuprofen.   Muscle aches and chills persisted into the next day. Developed another mild fever in the second day. Symptoms resolved on day 3. Soreness in arm where the vaccine was administered persists.

I started getting the sweats. After sitting for a few minutes, I tried to stand up and was very dizzy again. I immediately sat back down as I thought I was going to pass out. 30 minutes later, I had a nasty headache, the chills, pain in my knees and lower back, and neck pain. Also, I had pain at the site of the injection. I felt very nauseous. These symptoms persisted from hour 8 to 44 hours after receiving the shot.

I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                Started with headache, fever, chills all at once. Two hours later my entire lower back hurt like crazy. The only thing that made it better was walking but lying down or sitting felt like the worst thing in the world. Nausea much later in the night and my heart rate was higher than normal for the most part. My resting rate is usually 57-62 bpm but this time it was ranging between 100-108bpm. Arm soreness  Back pain was mostly felt on the left side and accompanied by leg pain. I?ve had back pain in the past but this was x100 worse to the point where I considered going to the ER. My final symptoms were nausea but waking up this morning I feel fine

                                                About 6 hours after vaccine injection I began to have weakness, numbness, tingling, and burning from my hips down. From the top of my legs all the way to my feet. Also numbness in my hands. Went to the ER approximately 15 hours after receiving my vaccination. Was discharged, awaiting on leptospirosis bloodwork and if conditions do not improve I will return to the ER to get a lumbar puncture to check for Guillain Barre Syndrome.

                                                Got the shot at 9:20am on Saturday (April 10th). By the time I sat down to do the 15min waiting period before I could leave. My arm from the back of my shoulder all the way down to around my thumb joint in my hand ached so bad. By around 3pm on the same day, I started to feel really tired and had a pounding migraine. By 4:30p I started to get really cold and everything started to ache. By 6p I was feeling hot but at the same time cold and shivering. My head was pounding. Every muscle ached all over my body, and by every muscle I mean even my eye muscles and pelvic floor muscles. My face had so much sinus pressure that it felt like it could explode. My skin, all over my body, was so sensitive that it hurt to the touch. On top of my skin being sensitive to the touch, off and on my skin would tingle, including the inside of my mouth and tongue. My lymph nodes were swollen enough in my neck that my throat ached.  I was mentally confused and shaking. Everything got bad enough I started crying and hyperventilating. I felt sick to my stomach and felt digestive pain. My entire body felt so heavy. By the time it got to around 8p, my mom finally took my temperature, which at that point I had already been taking Tylenol all day and was no longer shivering, and I had a temperature of 101 degrees F. I finally went to bed around 9p. I was thirsty but my stomach felt sick. I still ached and woke up around 10 times throughout the night either feeling too hot or cold or hurting so bad. At 4am I took a Tylenol because it everything hurt bad enough to able to fall asleep. The next day. I mostly better. I was still tired and a little achy and my lymph nodes under my arm pits were swollen. At this point my lungs felt strange. Harder to breathe than normal.  I was starting to cough. The day after that (today) I have felt fairly normal except I?m coughing and my lungs still feel a little strained. No more aches or fever or anything like that though.

Sometimes in knees, mostly in calves... continued until midway through the night) - fatigue (felt just a little more tired than normal, really tired by bed time: 9pm) - heightened heart rate (excitement from vaccine / apprehension for potential illness?) Second day - Thursday:  - fatigue (tired all day, almost fell asleep through a couple meetings) - leg pain (reappeared in the morning, ached and throbbed. Made it difficult to relax. Was gone around 3/4pm) - headache (probably from dehydration, I was warm, but not completely a fever. Attempted to drink a lot of water, but too much made me nauseous)  - chills (sporadic, barely noticeable except it agitated the headache) - nausea (I barely ate more than a granola bar and attempted to drink water and tea, but too much made me sick, especially if it had sugar - mainly drank water. Had some soup later in the day (6pm) and most of the nausea went away)

Passed out, unconscious within 5 minutes of receiving the shot. Could not sit up/dizzy for 30 minutes. Nausea, weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity/memory. Later that night, and through the night for 10 hours, severe back pain. Nausea, severe weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity and memory, sweats and chills.  The next day (day immediately after receiving vaccine) symptoms continued but lessened by 5 pm. Each day since then, the symptoms have ALL remained in a more mild form. Today is day 6 and I still have moderate back pain and occasional sweats, weakness and fatigue.

                                                I woke up noticing a slight headache, but I figured it was from poor sleep the night prior. I noticed after breakfast that I felt really cold and felt an internal shiver, especially in my chest. My fingers and toes were ice cold even with a sweater, blanket, and a warm tea. I noticed my skin starting to feel tender and I felt very fatigued. I wanted knew I needed to eat so that I could take ibuprofen, but I experienced a loss of appetite. I had a mild cough, but I felt too tired to even cough. I rocked in a chair in the sunlight outside for about 15 minutes and still felt cold. When I took my oral temperature after coming inside, I was reading 99.9. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen by 1130 and layed down to rest. Bundled in 3 layers, I felt the shivering couldn&#39;t stop. My headache got worse and my skin was tender to the touch. I was able to sleep for approximately 3 hours and I woke up drenched in sweat. I took my oral temperature again and was at 101.1. I drank some more water and tried to sleep some more. When I woke up around 4:30 pm, I felt a lot better. My temperature went down to 97.8 and I had a boost in energy and appetite. I no longer had a headache and I had only mild muscle aches. By the next morning, I felt completely normal again.

I started getting really cold, took my temperature and it was at 100.1. Got a headache, slightly nauseous, body aches got a lot worse (particularly my lower back). I was also feeling a little dizzy and having a hard time comprehending information; this was probably the fever. Around 8pm,  I took my temperature again and it had risen to 102. I took some extra strength Tylenol which started helping about 30 minutes later. I woke up 3/12/2021 still with some body aches, slight headache, and slight stomachache.

                                                Approximately 7 hours after receiving the single dose of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine,  symptoms such as muscle aches, fatigue, and fever set in. Symptoms rapidly worsened over the next few hours, with the fever reaching a max temp of 103 degrees Fahrenheit. This required monitoring and the use of ice packs to keep the fever under control. Muscle aches were severe, and were particularly prominent in the lower back region and the injection site. Fever remained in the 100-103 degree range for the duration of the night and by the next day, temperature returned to around 98 degrees.

                                                The injection itself was quite painful (and I&#39;ve had many vaccine shots in my life). Felt completely fine until around 4pm when I felt a dull headache. Around 5pm, my head was throbbing so much that I couldn&#39;t leave my bed. Around 6pm, I felt muscle pains starting around my neck, slowly moving to my shoulders, chest, and upper back. Without taking any medication, I slept and woke up around 8pm. I was sweating, felt so cold but hot at the same time. The muscle pains were intense, and my head hurt so much that I took a single capsule of 200mg Advil. The pain became more manageable around 30 minutes later. Was still sweating, and muscle aches continued. I slept again at around 2am (May 26, 2021) and woke up at 10am. Head was no longer hurting, but muscle aches were still lingering. Currently, 1:04pm on March 26, 2021, I feel weak and tired with muscles pains around my upper body, but overall feeling much better than yesterday.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

When I attempted to take a shower, I fainted for a few seconds and it was a struggle to move. Only felt comfortable when I was laying down. My muscles all felt painful and sore, had a painful headache, felt very disoriented and woozy. It was a struggle to walk or move, and couldn&#39;t talk loud or for a long time at once. Had to go home from work and spent the rest of the day sleeping. Around 4pm, 24 hours after the injection, my muscles felt less sore and was feeling better. The next morning, I was back to being completely normal.

I felt foggy and &#34;off&#34; at this time, like my head isn&#39;t clear. There has also been constant aching at the site of injection in my left arm.

At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.

                                                About 8 hours after administration, I got severe muscle aches and chills, such that I was shivering uncontrollably for a few hours, not sure how long. Hurt like nothing I?ve ever experienced before. Considered going to a hospital but couldn?t think of how bc I wasn?t thinking straight. It got a little better around midnight and I could get up enough to take some Advil (I had before when I first felt it coming on), had an intense migraine for the rest of the night but migraines I can deal with. Now I?m just a little dizzy and sore. But that was the worst.

                                                Arm was sore in injection site immediately after injection and has remained sore. Started getting a headache around 6/7pm. Headache got worse and started getting muscle aches all over body around 8/9pm. Skin was very sensitive and tender to the touch (eg touching my arm or brushing up against something). Fever started around 9pm, went up to 101.4°F. Had chills. Trouble sleeping. Now 7:30am the next day and still have body aches and severe headache, but don?t feel as feverish.  Finally took 2 extra strength Tylenol tablets around 7:30am so hopefully that will help.

                                                Vaccine was done at 2:50. Around 6pm I started getting a headache, neck pain and my lymph nodes were enlarged. Took 1000mg of Tylenol. At 1030 pm, I started getting all over muscle spasms, headache returned, onset of dizziness, nausea and uncontrollable shaking. At 1145pm, I started vomiting, the muscle spasms got increasing  worse, the shaking only decreased while in the bath tub in very hot water. No fever was noted with thermometer, but after a second dose of 1000mg of Tylenol at 1am, I broke out profusely sweating 30 minutes later.  The uncontrollable shaking stoped at about 4am, along with the nausea and vomiting.  Upon waking up the next day, muscle spasms were still there as well as the headache and dizziness. By end of day 4-10-21 (today) all symptoms have resolved but the headache.

                                                At approximately 10:00 p.m. on April 10, 2021 (about 10 hours after receiving the vaccine) I experienced chills, a fever of 101.4, severe dizziness, blurred vision, headache, body aches, and fatigue. My fever broke and my dizziness and blurred vision subsided on April 11, 2020 around 12:30 p.m. My headache continued along with severe pain in my neck and down my spinal cord. I also continue to experience extreme fatigue and all I want to do is sleep. These symptoms are still present as of today 04/12/2020.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started getting full body chills which quickly turned into full body shakes. The shaking felt like tremors and made it hard to breathe.  The uncontrollable shaking and chills lasted approx. 3 hours and then I fell asleep. The next morning (approx. 12 hours after the vaccine) I no longer had body shakes but experienced flu-like symptoms (headache, tired, week) for the rest of the day. I also experienced severe pain in my lower back. By the next day (approx. 36 hours after the vaccine) I was back to normal and have felt fine since.

Fever and chills went away after 24 hours. Joint pain and stabbing headache remained for about 48. Currently still bleeding on day 5 and getting occasional sharp headache pains that last around 5 minutes and go away for hours. Joints still feel a lingering ?soreness? almost. Last night, day 4 the cramps that accompanied the bleeding intensified greatly and were very painful. Today I have much more ?period like? cramping still. Previously cramps were there but minimal and occasional.

Strong pain even from brushing hair when applied to top of left side of scalp. Feeling of pressure being applied to the top of left side of head. During the first day, I felt fatigued and had difficulty focusing.  The pain continued for about 2 days, until I took Tylenol I did feel the pain subside.

                                                Night of vaccine had severe body aches, back pain, leg pain severe until legs went numb, then arm pain severe until also numb, chest pains/ trouble breathing.  Following days had pains in arms and legs as if a tourniquet was left on and I cycled through severe pain and being numb. 5 days in I lost my vision (super blurry and seeing double) and lost complete control of arms and legs on top of headache and chest pains. Vision came back a couple hours later but the leg pains/ numbness continued even now. It feels as if my circulation has been cut off.

                                                I was ok after receiving the vaccine. Just a bit nausea and then everything was ok. I received the vaccine on 5th of may and i had a severe headache and fatigue on 11th may (evening) i couldnt figure out the reason. I had a Tylenol and rested for sometime. At night the headache started again severely on the right side of my head and right leg also had muscle aches and i had zero energy. On the 12th it was the sane and blood pressure was on a lower side. On the 13th it was ok in the morning but after noon i had no energy and pain in both legs. I had a blood pressure of 90/48 which was quite low, i never had such an episode of low or a high blood pressure. I had a few boiled eggs with salt and 4-6 dates and i was able to get rid of aches in my body but not fully. At night of 13th may i was able to maintain a blood pressure of 104/55.
