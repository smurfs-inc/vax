Muscles began tensing up, tunnel vision started, extreme dizziness, vomiting, severe weakness in muscles, and fainting. These lasted for about 2 hours before decreasing in severity but continued to be present until about 10:30pm, 13 and a half hours after receiving the shot. Nothing was done to treat the symptoms. As of 12:30pm on 3/10, some minor symptoms are still present, such as muscle weakness and pain, severe migraine, and dizziness.

Took 600mg of ibuprofen every 4 hours to control pain. After second round of ibuprofen pain was tolerable. Day 2: when going off of ibuprofen severe pain returns with limited mobility again. Will continue ibuprofen for day 2.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Six hours after I received the vaccine I began to feel full body muscle aches and shivers. I took 2 Advil. I went to bed at 9:30 p.m. and woke up at 11:30 p.m. feeling as though I had slept 8 hours because I had a 102 fever. My face was burning from the heat and I was shaking. I took two more Advil. About 30 minutes later I threw up. I waited 30 more minutes and threw up again. As a result, of having Addison&#39;s disease, I have an emergency steroid injection that I use during crises such as this. I took my shot and immediately began feeling slightly better. I was able to go back to bed and at some point the fever went down overnight. I am currently feeling weak and with no fever. I also have a slight headache.

About 5 pm, I started to feel really cold and my whole body was shivering and vibrating. My whole body also started to ache and my bones felt heavy. At about 10 pm I started to get really high fever and felt so cold. I could not sleep even with a winter jacket on, I had a really bad headache in the center of my forehead, lower back pain and felt extremely sore and weak. I found it difficult to stand or walk. I woke up at 2:30 am from bed, to get a snack and took 2 ibuprofen to ease the symptoms. Woke up at about 10 am next day, felt slightly better. Fever has gone down slightly but not completely. Still feeling really cold and shivering.

Also starting three hours after the vaccine I had extremely painful muscle aches and pains. Bruise at injection site and swollen arm. Excruciating pain in both arms and both knees. When the leg pain started, it started behind my knees. I was in tears for about 14 hours in excruciating pain due to the muscle aches and I am still having random hurts of sharp muscle and joint pain.

                                                Had no side effects whatsoever for many hours. Felt completely fine until about 7:30 pm, while I was making my plate of dinner. Felt lightheaded, dizzy, and hot. I began to black out, so I sat down, which helped for a few moments to subside lightheadedness. I was still feeling hot, so I walked a few feet to my back door and sat down on the steps outside to cool off. Within minutes, my vision blurred completely, I saw stars, and completely blacked out. My mother, who was nearby, heard me fall on the steps. She said my eyes rolled back, my body was completely limp, I was not breathing but rather making gurgling noises from my throat. She propped my head up, which allowed me to breathe properly, and I came to.   If my mother had not been nearby, I am convinced I would be dead right now. I saw the light, saw the other side, saw my relatives. I have had a near death experience once before, and this was exactly like that.

I am young still, used to walk a lot and also did hiking. I never had troubles with my leg joint until recently.

I was extremely tired and the aches had significantly increased so I went to bed at about 8:00pm. When I couldn?t sleep around 9:30pm I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I woke up at around 11:00pm and felt extremely feverish (shivering, entire body extremely soar. My joints hurt so badly that I couldn?t get comfortable) and nauseous. I then had 4 or 5 episodes of violent vomiting throughout the night every 2 or so hours.  After, I would be drenched in sweat.  When I got up *crawled to trash can next to my bed* at around 2:30/3:00AM I took 200mg ibprofin. Felt fatigued and no appetite the next day then was fine

                                                Had typical post vaccine symptoms right after - nausea, muscle aches, chills, fatigue. 5 days after vaccine those appeared to have dissipated. Went for a light walk in the morning. Completely lost vision in both eyes extremely blurry. Stumbled my way home running into trees, cars. Vision came back, thought it was migraine (had them before but nowhere NEAR as bad, never had vision completely blocked)  Excurtating headache behind eyes and nausea, feels like pressure in head. Worst headache of my life, went to ER. Gave morphine (did not help pain at all which was horrifying) got a head CT scan which came out clear and discharged because clotting ruled out. It is now day 6 and my headache is persistent and still excruciatingly painful. I?m also extremely nauseous. I?m terrified because I know something is very wrong. ER doc said might be lingering side effect from vaccine but those effects felt very different.

Tylenol was unhelpful but I had also taken my anxiety medication and 25mg of Benedryl, so the fact that it lasted roughly 4 hours is an estimation because i did eventually fall asleep.   Chest pain on 04/10/2021, ongoing but only sometimes excruciatingly painful. Had costochondritis about a year ago, it eventually went away. This pain is the same as that. I was told that people who get costochondritis are likely to get it again, so may be unrelated to the vaccine, but thought i would list it anyways.   General unwell feeling lasted until 04/13/2021  Unrelenting nausea lasted until 04/13/2021  Diarrhea started today 04/14/2021

                                                Received shot around 10:00am April 12th, by 12:00pm (beginning of work shift)I experienced a headache and took Advil, figured it was menstrual related since it started the same day. By 5:00 my body started to feel aches and chills but was very mild. By 5:30-5:45 I took a midal for the pain I was experiencing, more severe muscle/ back aches and chills. By 6:30 I went home early from work because symptoms were getting worse and it was hard to continue my shift. Once arriving home around 8 pain continue to progress but I figured I just needed to lay down and rest. By 9 I had soup but could barley finish due to pain. I continued to monitor my temperature because I was experiencing chills even though I had my heater on etc. by 10:00-10:30 my temperature went all the way up to 101.2 and I was concerned so I called 911. They sent an ambulance to come take me to the hospital. On the way there I believe my temperature went down. The paramedics took my temp and it was 99.5 before they took me to the hospital. And when the nurses took my temperature it was 97.8. This happened in the course of about 30-40 minutes of my phone call and arriving to the hospital. Either way I was concerned about the pain because I know there would be symptoms following the shot but I didn?t think it would be so severe. After waiting to be checked in and evaluated they proscribed me Tylenol and ibuprofen. But at a location that was closed for the day. I asked if I could just take more pain killers for the pain (midal and Advil) and I was told i could. Once arriving home by 11:30 I took two midal pills and the pain reduced within an hour. So I was able to sleep. The next day I still experienced pain but took pain killers to help with it.

                                                The side effects began the night following my vaccine and lasted the entire next day. It began with fatigue/brain fog, then chills and soreness at the injection site. Once the chills began I was very ill with a fever (100-101), severe aches and pains in my body from head to toe, and experienced  occasional shooting pains. Once the fever went away about 30 hours after my vaccine, I still felt pain and heaviness in my body and had a bad headache. The next day (day 3) was much better- I had no fever but still felt some brain fog, drowsiness, and slight muscle soreness (but no pain).   Two weeks after my vaccine (4/20/21)  I had a very similar experience but am not certain it was related to the vaccine. I developed chills, fatigue, and a headache for the majority of the day. In the evening, it progressed to muscle/joint pain, a severe headache, extreme fatigue, and a 100 degree fever. The next day (today 4/21), the fever has subsided and I feel slightly fatigued. Though I am not sure this was related to the vaccine, it mirrored my initial reaction to the vaccine two weeks prior. It is very unusual for me to get a fever in the 100 degree range and typically only happens every two years or so.

                                                I woke up at 3 am Friday with cold sweats and body aches. Took 1000 mg Tylenol. Woke up again at 10:30 am to a fever still and this odd extremity feeling. Felt like I had a compression body suit on and weight of 50 pounds around my arms and legs, Mild shortness of breath. I felt like I was swollen but did not see any. I called my PCP and vaccine line and both nurses said go to the ER. I went to the ER they ran tests. The time of the ER I started getting leg cramping and spasming. Those symptoms continued to the weekend. On Sunday the weight and swelling feeling went away. I still had bad muscle cramping and swelling. I did telehealth on Tuesday with PCP and was given muscle relaxer which helped some throughout the rest of the week. Thursday night I have a temp pf 99.6 and went up to 100.6 on Friday morning. On Friday I became shortness of breath and fatigued. It became difficult to go up and down stairs or walking about 20 ft without difficulty breathing. I now have a lower right leg muscle twitch/spasm that comes and goes. I switched to a different PCP, he ran more blood work on Wednesday 4/21. And discussed the next steps for treatment and monitoring.

Then a week later, I got a horrible rash all of my body, worse at my hands and feet. The rash included many blisters. Loss of appetite and cannot sleep. I still have the rash now, and it is even getting worse in some parts, while other parts are better due to a steroid cream prescribed by my dermatologist.  On April 26, I felt very dizzy and weak and went to urgent care. I have since recovered from those symptoms.

The pharmacist/doctors at CVS gave me some water and told me to elevate ny legs. After 10 minutes they checked my termperature and blood pressure. I stabized somewhat and when home. I was sure it it was my nerves but something did feel right. I had a slight burning in my chest and felt queezy on/off throughout the day. Chills and hot flashes followed. I was anxious and paranoid about the possibility something serious coukd be wrong with me. I felt shooting pains in my lower left abdomen that nught and the next day. The following day I still felt very weak. My arm hurt. My muscles felt like jello and I?m unhappy. I wish I never got the shot and I?m worried about my body?s reaction to it.

I got out of bed and fainted on the floor. Laid there for a few moments. Got water. Laid back into bed and my body completely locked up. It felt like there were pins and needles coursing through my entire body. I couldn?t bend or move my legs. My wrists were bent down and my fingers all locked together. I could not move them at all. I was screaming out in pain. It was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. My roommate called 911. Paramedics arrived and took my temperature and blood pressure. They tried calming me down. eventually I did. And my fingers and legs unlocked but I continued having a severe headache, back pain, muscle aches and nausea. I woke up every hour of the night and threw up several times.  It?s been 24 hours after the shot and I am still having headaches fatigue and muscle spasms.

                                                The right side of my body felt completely heavy as we walked out of the pharmacy.  My right side continued to be right side continued to be tingly heavy for multiple hours. My headache was only on the right side as well. I was instructed to go to the emergency room who didn?t even examine the leg that was numb and tingly. Told me to take some baby aspirin, Benadryl and come back if it became hard to breath.  I came home and have had the worse sharp pains in my legs,  there have been some things I expected like headache and body aches, sore site. It?s weird because my site isn?t even that sore it?s mostly my legs, and now back , and ahead.

                                                Received shot on 4/7. Felt fine three days after on 4/10 and went for a standard run. Morning of 4/11, woke up with three massive bruises on my knees. On left knee, bruises were located on the inside and outside of my knee. On the right knee, bruises were located on the inside of my knee. These bruises were at least 3-4 inches in diameter. News of blood clotting from J&amp;J vaccine was released on 4/13. Days after 4/11, knees and ankles started to swell. By 4/14, the swelling in my knees and ankles continued and I became fearful of blood clots that would become life-threatening. Evening of 4/14, admitted myself to the ER.

                                                During injection, felt pins and needles from injection site to fingertips which faded to tingling and stopped entirely after about 7 minutes.   Intense nausea and sweating beginning 1-2 minutes post injection; unable to sit up. Lasted approximately 7-10 minutes before clearing up  2 hours later (7:10 pm), arm at and above injection site felt hot to the touch and had mild dull pain at every movement. Slightly dizzy and nauseous. Arm periodically ached without movement.  By 7:26 pm, arm pain from movement was a sharp pain, though still pretty mild.  Around 9:30 pm, gently pressed at site of injection and a jolt of pain went all the way down to my fingers  Nausea increased at 10:13, still mild. Decided to go to sleep. Woke up at least 5 times before 12:30 am in various states of pain and discomfort, including nausea when attempting to sit up; dry throat/mouth; pins and needles throughout my glutes and thighs accompanied by pain in my left hip, knee, ankle, and jaw; and mild to moderate arm pain at the injection site. Took about 15 minutes to be able to get up due to nausea and got some water.  Was cold so wrapped myself in a blanket. Nausea and arm pain with movement remained but I was able to go back to sleep around 1:15 am.  Woke up at 2:53 am - arm pain minimal and nausea gone, blanket felt nice but unnecessary, went back to sleep  Woke up at 5:34 am with pins and needles  in glutes and thighs and pain in my right jaw, knee, hip, and ankle (all sites of previous moderate injuries) along with a low grade headache. Went back to sleep.  Woke up after an hour or so feeling relatively normal, arm pain and headache returned after sitting up. Got out of bed but ended up taking another nap.  Woke up after another hour with just a headache and brain feeling fuzzy, but strong tingles began returning to my glutes and thighs  like they had fallen asleep (referred after this point as tingles). Arm hurt. Drank some more water and took another nap.  Woke up around 9:15 am with a low grade headache and slight tingles; fuzzy brain feeling was gone. Legs wobbly when I walked. Realized that tingling got worse anytime I was sitting down or lying on my back.  Around 10:20 am started crying - no known cause. Couldn&#39;t stop for a few minutes. This is not normal for me.  Around 1 pm realized I had a pretty high fever; unsure how high it was or how long I&#39;d had it. Took another nap at 1:30 pm and woke up at 2:20 pm feeling much less hot so I thought it had broken, but I was told by my friend who dropped by that I was still feverish just much lower.  Slept from about 2:45-3:55 pm; headache was much better when I awoke; tingles and sore arm remained.  Realized at 4:13 pm that I&#39;d had no appetite the whole day. I&#39;d also barely been able to force myself to drink water; too cold and it hurt, room temperature didn&#39;t feel right.  No times, but felt periodic stabbing pain in my left ear until about 6:30 pm.  Much else also recovered by 6:30 pm: felt well enough to drink cold stuff, tingles were low grade, fever was present but low. Arm was still sore.  7:08 pm headache was gone.  8:49 pm felt much better and able to do things and take care of myself with minimal discomfort, but felt a little lousy overall - low grade headache, head felt like there was some pressure in it, periodic tingles, achy arm.  9:29 pm felt exhausted and slightly achy but otherwise mostly normal. Felt some hunger twinges for the first time that day but nothing felt appealing (realized I had only eaten about 5 spoonfuls of soup the whole day). Fell asleep getting ready for bed; woke up at 10:49 pm and finished getting ready for bed then went back to sleep.  Summary: Friday: Symptoms: mild to moderate nausea, mild dizziness, mild to moderate injection site pain, pins and needles in glutes and thighs, joint pain  Treatment: drinking water  Saturday:  Symptoms: mild to moderate pain at injection site, headache, fever, nausea, tiredness, glute and thigh tingles, lack of appetite, periodic stabbing pain in left ear  Treatments: ice/cold pack on arm (helped with arm pain while on), drinking water, sleeping

                                                I woke up at three AM feeling like I had a fever. I had body aches. The next morning when I woke up I felt like I had a tourniquet on my arms and legs. I was also short of breath. I went to the ER and they checked for blood clots. I started to get lower extremity cramps and muscle spasms. Two days after I started to have some shortness of breath and I was out of breath if I walked any length. One week after the vaccine I ended up wit an ear infection in my right ear. The muscle spasms continued especially in my right lower legs with twitching which lasted for five weeks. Two weeks after the shot my Asthma, which is normally controlled  got very severe. My inhalers didn&#39;t seem to work. Three weeks after the vaccine my Asthma got worse and I was having trouble breathing. I went to the ER again and there were more tests done. I was prescribed Prednisone, and I took one week off work. After multiple treatments I was prescribed antibiotics and switched my inhaler which helped. I have been trying to do some Cardio activity this weeks and I feel better after six weeks. I don&#39;t have to use my Nebulizer as much as I had been.

The chills woke me up, so I took Tylenol 1000 mg and my fever broke about an hour later. I had to keep taking Tylenol 1000 mg at 10:30 am and 4:30 pm to control my fever. Each dose worked well for the first 3 hours or so on the fever, but then it would come back. I also had muscle and headaches and fatigue, which made it very difficult to move around. The Tylenol also helped with that somewhat, but I spent most of the day in bed and on the couch (and I am normally very active). By around 5:30-6pm, the symptoms were fading slowly. I felt a lot less achy and my body temperature felt closer to regular by the time I went to bed at 9pm.

My muscles were very achey, and my heart was racing. I was slightly nauseous but still able to eat a little. By 24 hours after the shot my fever was down to 99f.  I started to get diarrhea beginning the second day and has lasted until now the third day after vaccination day.

                                                Injection technique seemed poor as it was the most painful vaccination I&#39;ve ever received, and upper arm became tight and achy immediately. Soreness lingered but the sharper pain went away shortly after. About 8-10 hours later I began feeling nauseous and lightheaded. 12 hours after vaccine I had trouble falling asleep, overcome with nausea and chills.  This turns into sweating and insomnia the rest of the night. The following day I felt better, but the next night (and following one) I continued feeling a bit sick. Currently (3 days later) my upper arm is still very sore and I have lots of muscle/joint aches throughout my whole body.

Throughout the night my body became extremely sensitive and sore especially in my lower back and neck. My temperature also continued to rise to 103.0.  Throughout the day of 4/9/21 I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen on a rotating schedule. My temperature went up and down throughout the day spiking at 105.7 and dropping down to 101.2. Around 10:00 PM it was around 102.9 and my body was becoming even weaker. This morning, now 36 hours after my symptoms started, I can barely lift my arm, my headache has worsened, my total soreness and weakness is no better and my temperature is 102.3.  I have also had trouble with staying hydrated because my skin hurts if it is not covered from the air and I get heavy chills,  but when I cover up I am profusely sweating constantly. The sweat is so bad, I constantly have to lay on a towel and change my clothes.

My legs hurt so bad. My knees mostly. My ankles. My inner thigh muscles. My lower back couldn?t handle any pressure. It hurt to lay. My left shoulder blade and upper arm hurt bad. Then my head hurt. My hips couldn?t move. My elbow felt weak and painful, like they would break.   12:40 headache got worse. I was shaking. I was nauseous. Chills were awful. Ears were ringing.   No appetite for days.   Sore joints, muscle pain and fatigue still 4/13

Could easily be a pulled muscle but I?m also concerned about blood clots so I?m watching my symptoms and if anything worsens, I will get seen by patient first.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                I began to feel shortness of breath when walking, tightness in my chest, for the same reason any physical effort made me feel like I was short of breath. (The day before I had presented the common symptoms such as fever, chills, arm pain, muscle pain) however this symptom was off the list, at 11:30 in the morning I had to go to an emergency clinic, they checked me with blood test, urine tests, medical exam, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. The doctor told me that everything was fine that I could leave. I had to pay a high bill at the hospital. The following 7 days the sensation was disappearing very slowly. However from day 8 it started again, until now on day 13, I still having sensation of shortness of breath when doing physical exercise, it is something that lasts and does not disappear.

Was seen at emergency room on January 27, 2021 stating that she felt that all her symptoms of Covid had resolved except for some chest pain which awoke her on January 27.  She presented to the emergency room.  Had sinus tachycardia at 113 but otherwise unremarkable physical exam, laboratory studies with white blood count elevated 16,004-20, hemoglobin 13.7 g hematocrit 41.8%, MCV 87.1, RDW 12.7%, platelet count 329,000, segs 72.8%, lymphs 20.6%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 1%, basophil 0.6%.  BUN 10.1, creatinine 0.8, AST 24, ALT elevated 56, alkaline phosphatase 68, total protein 7.6, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.6, globulin by subtraction 4.0, troponin less than 0.02, D-dimer quantitative 0.22, urine pregnancy test normal.  Chest x-ray normal.  Chest pain appears to be musculoskeletal and was reproduced by palpation of her chest wall.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  D-dimer was normal.  Heart rate returned to normal after some intravenous fluids.  Patient discharged on Zithromax 500 mg day 1 and then to 50 mg days 2 through 5.  Also continued on ibuprofen.   Received Johnson and Johnson vaccine April 5, 2021.  Over the next week patient started having increasing soreness.  Her joints hurt more than usual and her headache was worse.  She had a sensation that her legs were &#34;numb and tingly&#34; starting at her buttocks and extending down her leg.   Because of reported incidence of cerebral sinus thrombosis or cerebral vein thrombosis patient appropriately presented for screening in the emergency room and was sent for appropriate imaging.   April 16, 2021 CT scan of head with and without contrast no acute intracranial hemorrhage, no mass-effect or midline shift.  On contrast-enhanced images there appears to be a lobular nonocclusive filling defect in the far lateral right transverse sinus.  Lobular occlusive filling defect is also likely present in the mid to central right transverse sinus.  Short segment filling defect in the medial left transverse sinus.  Remainder of sinuses and internal cerebral veins are patent.  Focal lobular filling defect within the confluence of the right and transverse sinus most likely related to arachnoid granulation.  No edema hemorrhage of the cerebellum or cerebrum.  No other significant findings.   April 16, 2021 confirmatory MRI angiogram of head without contrast with no restricted diffusion to suggest acute or subacute infarct.  Contrast void in the middle to central right transverse sinus consistent with occlusive thrombus.  Nonocclusive thrombus in the far lateral right transverse thrombus.  Narrowing of the medial left transverse sinus without complete occlusion.   April 16, 2021 2345 hrs. inital hematology consultation.  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels have been requested stat and are still pending.  If fibrinogen level is low will replace with cryoprecipitate.  If D-dimer is elevated barely confirms diagnosis of possible vaccine related thrombosis.  The fact the patient is not thrombocytopenic at this time is encouraging, however despite the lack of thrombocytopenia she still has clearly documented symptomatic nonocclusive and occlusive thrombus in her cerebral sinus.   From UPtoDate.com Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, also referred to as the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine) ? On April 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended pausing administration of AD26.COV2.S  to further investigate rare cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia [33]. As of that date, six cases had been reported, all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination; during this period, 6.8 million doses were administered (with 1.5 million doses in females of that age range) [121-123]. Since some vaccine recipients have not been followed for longer than the time frame over which these symptoms develop, the incidence may change with additional follow-up. Initial symptoms included headache, backache, chills, and fatigue, and progressed to focal neurologic deficits. Intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboses at other sites were also seen in some patients. All of the five patients who were tested for the anti-PF4 HIT antibody tested positive. Another case, in a young male who was a vaccine recipient in one of the pre-emergency use authorization efficacy trials, had been previously reported. These cases appear similar to those reported following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, another adenovirus-vector vaccine. Although rare, the observed number of events exceeded the expected rate among females &lt;50 years old. Given the extreme rarity of these events, the FDA and CDC acknowledge that they recommended the pause out of an abundance of caution and to ensure awareness of these rare events.    ?Evaluation and management of possible thrombotic complications ? Recipients should be aware of the possible association and seek immediate care for signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombocytopenia (eg, new petechiae or bruising) or thrombotic complications (including shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity edema, persistent severe abdominal pain, unabating severe headache, severe backache, new focal neurologic symptoms, and seizures) [117]. In such cases, some experts suggest evaluation with complete blood count and differential (including the platelet count), quantitative D-dimer, HIT testing, and imaging of any suspected site of thrombosis [113,114,125]. Onset 4 to 20 days after vaccination, platelet count &lt;150,000/microL, elevated D-dimer, and a positive anti-PF4 antibody (HIT antibody) suggest the diagnosis. Treatment with a non-heparin/non-warfarin anticoagulant (eg, argatroban or direct oral anticoagulant) and intravenous immune globulin has been suggested. The CDC recommends not using heparin in individuals with thromboses following receipt of Ad26.COV2.S unless HIT testing is negative [126]. (See &#34;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&#34; and &#34;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Terminology and HIT variants&#39; and &#34;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Role of IVIG&#39;.)   As stated above all the 6 cases were &#34;all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination&#34; this would certainly fit the timeframe that we are seeing in this case.  Recommendations from national guidelines would be to start treatment with dexamethasone immediately while awaiting intravenous gammaglobulin.  To pursue intravenous gammaglobulin treatment at 1 g/kg over 1 to 2 days.  It is recommended to avoid heparin and instead use direct factor X inhibitor such as Eliquis, which this patient is already been started on.     There is unfortunately considerable risk that even though patient&#39;s symptoms appear mild at this time, that she may deteriorate in the very near future and I would recommend treating her aggressively at this time with dexamethasone and intravenous gammaglobulin while we are awaiting further testing.  Patient clearly has had unusual thrombosis, especially in a 27-year-old.     With the fact that she had headache dating back to January, it is impossible to determine the acute versus chronic nature of her venous sinus thrombosis. Covid infection does cause increase in coagulation as well.  However, given the small risk of tragic outcome with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis in the setting of Covid vaccinations, we will proceed aggressively with treatment starting tonight with intravenous gammaglobulin and intravenous dexamethasone.     Will require rapid fasting glucoses to evaluate possible hyperglycemia from high-dose dexamethasone.  Will consider stopping dexamethasone at 48 hours.  Current recommendation for gammaglobulin would be single 1 g/kg or 500 mg/kg over 2 days.  No recommendations for treatment beyond this point.  Current recommendations for gammaglobulin dosing would recommend using an adjusted dose for patients with greater than 125% of their ideal body weight.  This patient at 122 kg on a 5 foot 2 inch frame does qualify for adjusted dose and her orders reflect that.   I appreciate the opportunity see this patient this evening and consultation requested by Dr.  We will follow patient in hospital.  Hopefully she will have gradual improvement and avoid any serious or tragic complications of her cerebral sinus thrombosis.     We will have pharmacy report possible adverse reaction to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to the FDA as required by law.   April 17, 2021 follow up. No new events.  Laboratory studies remained excellent.  White blood count is further elevated, however, this may be secondary to high-dose dexamethasone with a white blood count of 16,060.  Hemoglobin 14.0 g hematocrit 42.8%, MCV 86.8, RDW 12.9%.  Platelet count is actually increased slightly at 374 as of 9:10 AM this morning.  Differential shows left shift as expected with dexamethasone.  Results from yesterday showed fibrinogen normal at 369 (180?415) pro time normal at 10.4 seconds with INR of 0.97, PTT 26.7.  D-dimer 0.23 (0.19?0.50).  With platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer normal I am inclined to believe that this is not an acute post vaccination HIT-like phenomena.  If it were I would still expect to see some degree of thrombocytopenia elevated D-dimer and perhaps low fibrinogen.  The other explanations for her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are either idiopathic spontaneous and merely coincidentally associated at the exact same time as her Covid infection or more likely, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulable state secondary to her Covid infection from December 2020.  Unfortunatly there is no way to accurately date the acuity of the venous thrombosis in her cerebral sinus.  HIT Testing is still pending and most likely will not be available for 3-4 more days despite being ordered stat.  Have called the laboratory and asked them to check with our outside reference lab what the expected return time is on this test. (LabCorp says &#34;Tuesday April 20, 2021).  Patient refused intravenous gammaglobulin infusion which has been ordered last night.  Patient has been receiving dexamethasone which was a bridge until intravenous gammaglobulin could be administered.  Current guidance from the expert hematology panel (EHP) on Covid vaccine induced thrombosis dated April 7, 2021 from the  public health would state that a patient who has a reduced platelet count without thrombosis with a D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen or thrombosis with a normal platelet count and D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen are &#34;unlikely cases&#34;.  They recommend for probable cases who have D-dimers that are elevated to send HIT assay and then give immediate intravenous gammaglobulin while awaiting results.  They recommend fibrinogen supplementation, if needed.  They recommend a direct acting antithrombin agents such as the Eliquis this patient is receiving.  They recommend steroids particularly if there is a delay in getting intravenous gammaglobulin delivered.  With the fact that we now have 24 hours in the hospital with no evidence of thrombocytopenia, no evidence of increased fibrinolytic activity or active thrombosis, and no evidence of hypofibrinogenemia, I would argue that her presentation is subacute.  In this setting, I do not feel intravenous gammaglobulin would be necessary and does involve a small risk as well as considerable cost.  Dexamethasone also involves small risk and negligible cost. I have discontinued both of these medications.  My overall impression would be that this was not related to her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination which was recent, but rather her more distant Covid infection.  It is impossible to definitively answer the question however.  The next question is duration of anticoagulation.  Risk of recurrent cerebral sinus venous thrombosis is relatively small but the morbidity can be high.  Studies have been performed showing medications in the same class as Eliquis have been associated with a decrease in incidence of the recurrence.  Most hematologist recommend 3 months of anticoagulation for provoked venous thrombosis including cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.  I feel this patient&#39;s thrombosis is &#34;provoked&#34;, with her association at the same time of her Covid infection (and possibly vaccination).  I would recommend Eliquis (apixaban) 5 mg twice daily or Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 20 mg daily with food. I would feel comfortable in discharging patient for outpatient follow up IF Dr and other speciality services agree. Plan 3 months of full dose anticoagulation with direct factor X inhibitor.   Circulation 2010 Jun 29;121(25):2740-6 &#34;Long-term evaluation of the risk of recurrence after cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis&#34;, Background: The clinical course of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis (CSVT) is largely unknown because prospective studies with a long follow-up and with the goal to assess thrombosis recurrence rate and predisposing factors for recurrence are lacking. Methods and results: One hundred forty-five patients with a first CSVT were followed up for a median of 6 years after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. End points were recurrent CSVT or other clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism. CSVT recurred in 5 patients (3%) and other manifestations of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism) were seen in 10 additional patients (7%), for a recurrence rate of 2.03 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.14) for all manifestations of venous thromboembolism and 0.53 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 1.10) for CSVT. Nearly half of the recurrences occurred within the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis were male sex (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.86 to 32.7) and, for thromboses other than CSVT, severe thrombophilia resulting from antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency, anti-phospholipid antibodies, or combined abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 16.5). Conclusions: The risk of recurrent CSVT is low and is higher in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment and among men. Mild thrombophilia abnormalities are not associated with recurrent CSVT, but severe thrombophilia entails an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism.   April 19, 2021 Follow up, no change in condition. Discussed case with Dr, will order Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, anti phospholipid and anti cardiolipin antibodies, if she will allow draw. Expect Heparin Induced Thrombosis testing result tomorrow, but with no thrombocytopenia after given heparin, expect will be normal. Will await result. If discharged, would recommend 3 months direct thrombin inhibitor (Eliquis/Xarelto/Pradaxa) at full anticoagulation dose. Then stop, no taper. Overall still feel &#34;provoked&#34; thrombosis due to December Covid, unrelated to J&amp;J Covid vaccine, but can not definitively prove that..

                                                On the 13th, I had a low grade fever and it never actually broke past 100. I spent most of the day in bed. Fatigued - and general was exhausted and tired .After that day, everything was pretty good. I had minor discomfort in my arm (that first day.) On the Friday, the 16th- my left arm - a third of my upper arm was bright red, swollen and hot to the touch and it was very painful. I reached out to a doctor for a chat with a doctor. The dr had me take 600 mg of Motrin and a Claritin and I took those based on the dosages allowed on the box, consistently for about 24 hours and after that it started getting a lot better.  I&#39;d say by Sunday the 18th, I was pretty much back to normal and everything resolved.  Doctor chat but not a regular doctor visit.

Thursday evening, 8th, I got hives - all over my body and that started on my left arm and then it didn&#39;t go in my mouth but otherwise all over. I went to my doctor  - the ER at my doctor&#39;s site - on Saturday, 10th. He prescribed me some medicine - don&#39;t remember what plus I took Benadryl . I had to take a week and a half off of work because the medication was so strong.  My hives lasted another week. It stopped growing after that week and then it started healing.

I am In perfect health otherwise and have never had any health issues prior to getting the vaccine. It is getting so painful I can not workout, go up or down stairs and feel like my leg is going to give out when I walk

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, my left arm and left side of my neck and back became very sore and I felt very light headed and dizzy. 7 hours later, the back pain worsened and I started sweating a lot. Soon after my skin all over my body began to tingle as if I had bugs crawling all over my body and it was very uncomfortable. During the night I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was sweating so much, the back pain was getting worse and worse, and the tingly skin feeling turned into very intense skin sensitivity and hurt any time my body touched something or rubbed against my clothing. At some points I would be extremely hot and sweating a lot and then some points I was freezing cold and shaking uncontrollably. These signs all lasted 24 hours and slowly started going away after 48 hours. After 48 hours, I felt much better and back to &#34;normal&#34; but couldn&#39;t help but notice some strange reactions that I still have today, 3 weeks later... I have had acne which is uncommon for me. I have had period cramps and mood swings but am not on my period. I also have had crazy bloating in my stomach and all over my body... swollen legs, feet, hands, etc. I also have been experiencing brain fog where I loose my train of thought in conversation, I can&#39;t remember where I put things, I can&#39;t remember if I took my eye contacts out or not, or fed the dog... very strange and uncharacteristic of me to be so aloof and forgetful but to the point where I have zero recollection of doing such activities.

                                                It started about a week after getting the vaccine. I had tingling in my feet and my hands, more prominent on my left side. Like pins and needles. Really hard to remain laying on my back. I cannot breathe. A couple of days back I got really dizzy, I have been really bad nauseous. A couple of days ago my middle finger in my left hand was like a little numb. Yesterday with the doctor they tested my sensitivity and I definitely have less sensitivity in my left side. I have more migraines now. They referred me to a neurologist but I have not seen him yet. The day before yesterday I had really bad pain on my left shoulder, I could not move it so I went to urgent care at 9 am yesterday.

Approx 7 hours after receiving vaccine I experienced a sudden onset of overall body aches and joint pain specifically in my knees. It was kind of severe- even my skin was hurting when I got goosebumps. A fever came on after that and I was shivering, cold, sweaty. Approx 11 hours after injection I began to experience a severe headache and sleepiness. Symptoms continued overnight and disturbed my sleep, but were relieved somewhat by taking ibuprofen. By the next morning (after sleeping 14 hours) I was only feeling tired, arm soreness, and headache (no more fever, chills, body aches). All symptoms except arm soreness cleared up rather suddenly, approx 24 hours after they came on (which was approx 31 hours after injection).

Started experiencing additional side effects 9-10 hours after vaccine administration:  at night I developed a severe migraine, nausea and chills.   When I woke up the next morning, I still had a migraine, my nausea was less apparent, but I did begin to experience fatigue/exhaustion and muscle aches.  I&#39;ve experienced chills and hot flashes in waves throughout March 11th.  I took my temperature for the first time at 4PM on March 11th and I have a low grade fever of 99.6. degrees Fahrenheit.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine I had extreme sleepiness and some dizziness. After taking a nap I felt better for a few hours. I did notice my Raynaud?s symptoms became way worse.  At about 5:30pm I started to feel extremely cold. By 6pm I was having horrible pains and spasms in my lower back and hips. My muscles and joints became very stiff. This moved to my neck/shoulders, and down my thighs. I lost feeling in my feet and started struggling to be able to take in a full breath. I felt like my whole body was locked up. I started feeling nauseous, but part of that may have been from the nerves. The next morning I felt a bit more mobile but still nauseous and stiff. I have slowly gotten better throughout the day, but am still stiff and exhausted

I had a bad headache, fever, chills, muscle aches, and nausea. I couldn&#39;t hold down water of food. At 10am the following day (3/21) I was able to take aTylenol and the fever came down. So far, I have taken Tylenol throughout the day and kept the fever down, however I still get bad night sweats and muscle aches. Today (3/23) I feel a little off, but much better.

                                                Yesterday (3/31/21) after the shot (4:00pm) my arm at the injection site was sore.  This has continued into today.  No swelling or redness but my arm hurts to touch or move. Beginning this morning (4/1/21) around 7:30 am I started having a headache.  I took an ibuprofen which slightly lessened the pain but it has not gone away all day.  It worsens with activity. Starting around 8:30-9:00 am I started to feel nauseous and lightheaded.  I didn&#39;t take any medication for these symptoms.  They&#39;ve stuck with me all day. Starting around 11:30am I started to feel cold chills and body/muscle aches.  This has continued throughout the day. Starting around 2:45 pm I&#39;ve felt feverish, with severe cold chills.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Received the shot at 11 am and started feeling tired with some muscle aches at 2:45 pm. I slept from 3:45 to 4:30 pm but was still tired and felt weak. I did feel hungry and made dinner over 30 minutes. However, this wore me out. I was even more tired and started getting dizzy. I almost fainted as I made my way to a chair to sit down. I couldn&#39;t eat because of slight nausea and cold chills. I was shaking for about 20 minutes. Eventually, I made it to my bed to lay down, but my legs were shaking as I walked up the stairs. At 6:00 pm, my temperature was 98.8 F. I was freezing a shivering for the next hour in bed under 3 blankets. My hands and feet felt like ice. At 8:00 pm, I had a fever of 100.2  F that lasted all night. My body ached all over, especially at the hips. I couldn&#39;t sit still and couldn&#39;t sleep until 4:00 am. I woke at 8:30 am with some milder aches and fatigue with a temperature of 97.6 F.

                                                I received the vaccine on 4/8/2021 around 8:35am. I felt fine all day, only soreness at injection site. Later that day (around 6:00pm) I started feeling lightheaded, chills and a headache. My hands, feet, nose and hands were freezing but other areas of my body were warm. I also felt body aches- my lower back started with the aches and it spread up to my upper neck. Around 9:00pm I started feeling very hot and this hot/cold changes continued throughout the night. This morning of 4/9/2021 I have less of a headache however, my body is still very sore and I continue to experience the hot/cold changes.

                                                I had the Janssen covid shot yesterday. The shot stung a little and made my arm sore. Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

                                                I experienced a low-grade fever (100), muscle and joint pain, pain at the injection site, and fatigue during the first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine. A little less than 24 hours after the vaccine, my fever broke, and I began to develop a rash on my legs, which consisted of small, itchy, bug-bite like red bumps. I consulted my primary care physician, who recommended I take Benadryl. The rash worsened and spread to my torso - stomach, chest, underarms, and forearms - but was never present at the injection site. The rash on my chest was significantly different than the rest of my body, and when I saw an urgent care provider (5 days after being vaccinated), she diagnosed the chest rash as a separate issue (Folliculitis) and prescribed oral antibiotics. I saw no improvement in any symptoms. A week after being vaccinated and symptoms not improving, I saw my Allergist, who prescribed a 10-day course of oral steroids (Prednisone). My symptoms gradually improved, but the rash did not fully disappear for approximately 3 weeks after the first symptoms appeared.

                                                About 6 hours after the shot, I started to have very bad chills followed by high fever and joints pain. All of these made it hard to sleep. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to measure but it&#39;s probably the highest fever I ever had. There was a lower fever, headache,  joint pain, and fatigue the next day.  I didn&#39;t take any medicine just drank a lot of water and my body is back to normal the third day.

                                                I had the usual fever that began in evening around 8pm, but before that I started developing leg cramping like growing pains behind my left knee. The growing pains persisted behind the left knee for two full days (requiring me to take Tylenol to sleep), then it began behind my right knee, as well. That lasted another 24 hours before the growing pains expanded to both calves, as well. The pain persisted for an entire week and would wake me up in the mornings. I began stretching and working out and now the soreness from my work outs mostly masks the growing pains. I believe today is the first day I am not experiencing the growing pains.

The shaking (extremely bad, could not control my own muscles at all and I had to lay on my arms so they wouldn&#39;t flail out) and racing heart lasted about five hours. The headache and all over muscle pain finally eased up last night. Breathing aches and I am still experiencing muscle weakness.

                                                The week prior to delivery (3/22), I started feeling shortness of breath and a headache. I thought it was just normal pregnancy symptoms. That Friday (3/26), I noticed swelling in my ankles. I am a teacher so I asked my school nurse to check my blood pressure; it was high (for me) around 144/88. She said I should call my OB and let them know. I did, and they said to rest for the weekend and they&#39;d see me on Tuesday for my 29 week appointment.   We had a weekend trip planned. We took our son there. The next night, I didn&#39;t feel right. My belly felt hard to me and I wasn&#39;t feeling my daughter move as much, but soon after, I went to sleep. Our two year old son woke us up crying around midnight, and I noticed that I started bleeding when I went to the bathroom. My husband drove me straight to the emergency room. I was diagnosed with sudden and severe preeclampsia. My fibrinogen levels were 100% indicative of a placental abruption. They called the transport team in from hospital so they could transfer my daughter immediately after birth. At 5:57 am on 3/28, my daughter was born via emergency c-section. She is currently fighting everyday at the NICU in the hospital.  On Friday, 4/2 I was readmitted for severe preeclampsia to hospital. My blood pressure was 190/115. I had to receive another round of magnesium sulfate. I was released from the hospital on Sunday, 4/4.

                                                On Sunday an Monday after the shot I had muscle weakness. I felt fine by the end of Monday night, but then on Tuesday morning I started to feel weird brain surges and getting shaky like I was on drugs or something. I went to the ER and they said it&#39;s vaccine related and that I just wait it out.

                                                On Sunday, 4/11  my eyelids were tingling, it then went to my forehead, entire face and both of my arms. My muscles stiffened and my hands/thumbs were cramping inward. My hands were also red and blotchy during this time. My face was tight and hard to move or talk. This entire incident lasted in total around 20 minutes or so. I seem to be okay since that incident, I have had a headache off and on. Not sure if it?s related to the vaccine but I haven?t experienced anything like this before.

                                                The day I received the shot, I started to feel severe fatigue, headache, light-headed, and started running a fever about 6 hours after the shot was administered.  The next day (4/6) was worse. Severe fatigue, muscle aches, headache, loss of appetite, fever (101.5 was the highest I notice but seemed to be around 101.1-101.3 all day), and general flu like symptoms. However, I also started experiencing abnormal menstrual bleeding. I am on the Depo shot and have been for some time. Due to this, I do not usually experience any menstrual bleeding so I found this to be a little odd. It was not heavy but it was noticeable and contained quite a few clots.   Day 3 (4/7) was about the same except my fever came down and ranged from 99.8-101.1. Abnormal menstrual bleeding continued. New side effect this day included diarrhea.   Day 4 (4/8) I started to see improvement. No fever (that I could tell). Remaining side effects included mild headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and abnormal menstrual bleeding.   Day 5 (4/9), I had one of the worst nose bleeds I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I apologize for the graphic description but it lasted about 20 minutes and my bathroom looked like a crime scene after. Blood was pouring out of my left nostril and I threw two large clots that were about the size of slug (or slightly larger than a fun size snickers... I wish I had a better way to describe it). I&#39;ve had some bad nose bleeds, particularly when I was on Accutane, and this was worse! The rest of the day I felt like I was improving. Energy levels were better. No fever. Menstrual bleeding stopped. Only lingering side effect was mild headache and mild diarrhea.   Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel better and the diarrhea seems like it&#39;s improving.  Mild headache persists. Only new  item is an annoying twitch in my left eye that started on Monday (4/12).

Headache symptoms included head pressure, ear pain, and generalized full body weakness. Went to urgent care at 6:00pm.  Due to ongoing health issues it was hard for the doctor to tell if it was a reaction to the vaccine or not at the time of exam. The doctor discharged me and recommend I go to ER if symptoms progress/get worse.

I was wearing a fitbit and then noticed my heart Rate went up to the 90s and fluctuated between 90-110 bpm all night into the next morning.  I woke up every 2 hours  to a new symptom on top of what I was feeling already. It started with chills, then sweating, nausea and  a headache. I had a fever of 99.5 at the highest. And then the last time I woke up at 5 my heart hurt so bad, my whole chest muscle hurt with a sharp pain and It hurt to breath.  The next day I had a little headache and my body hurt, and I had cramping in my legs for a few days, but I also started my menstrual cycle on the 13th.  The leg cramping continued for a few days but only when I sat on my legs for too long.

My legs still feel weak and I have occasional pins and needles and muscle cramps all through my legs, but especially my left.

                                                I was tired the night of the shot and my arm was painful near the injection site, hard to move arm and touch caused great pain. My neck also started to lock up from my shoulder across to my spine and up my neck. This lasted about three days with occasional tension in the neck area coming back. Next morning I was very achy and my entire body felt like my muscles had a buildup of lactic acid. I did not have a fever but felt feverish that night. I felt the fever broke Saturday night/early Sunday morning (4/4) while I was asleep. I developed a slight cough for a few days and the muscle aches decreased by half each day. I felt mostly better after a week but occasionally felt tired and the cough lasted about a week. My arm developed a bolus at the injection site in the muscle that took about two weeks to go away, with occasional ice. The arm pain only lasted about 4 days before full range of motion was restored.

I had a really bad headache all night and into the morning, so bad I could feel throbbing in my teeth. I still have some soreness in my left hip joint and shoulder/neck. I have also had diarrhea once around 12:30 PM today. I did have COVID-19 at the end of December 2020 into January 2020. Not sure if that makes a difference.

So I went to the ER and I got blood work done and I was told something about my CK levels were extremely high and that&#39;s when I was admitted. The day that I got the vaccine I got really dizzy during that 15mins that they make us wait and I felt very sick While I was admitted my CK levels kept going up the doctors told me that I had something rhapdomysosis , the pain got worse and the doctor increased my level of fluids and they did and ultra sound on my legs to check for blood clots and they kept increasing my levels of fluids and once I was let go from the doctor I did have to keep going back to keep getting my blood check. I did continue to feel muscle weakness in my legs while I was home. I did go back to the doctor 05/14 for muscle weakness I was given as bag of fluid.. After that any time I stand too long or I am working out I can no longer work out for as long as I can. I can no longer work out for longer then 15mins because of the pain in my legs. I suffer at night time now with muscles spams now they happen all throughout the night. I had very low potassium

My vaccine symptoms started at 9pm with severe chills, body muscle aches, severe headache, pain everywhere. Then by midnight I was crying in severe pain, everything worsened plus I had severe nausea and diarrhea. My neck and back and every limb was throbbing, I was sweating profusely and had the chills, my headache has still persisted even now. I had to call out of work today. I stayed in bed until 11am and finally was able to shower. I?ve been lethargic, and in pain all day. Today more in my hands and head.

                                                I had side effects starting one hour after the vaccine - headache and nausea. Muscle pain started 12 hours after and it spread to my other arm - my entire upper body ached. I was nauseous and peeing a lot for 2 days. I did have a few hives, 2 on my arm and 1 on my face and I had not eaten anything high in histamine. The weather that week was stormy and lousy. On Friday-Saturday, I had an intense bought of allergies (plugged dripping nose) and that is very rare for me, regardless of the weather. By Sunday, I had shortness of breath, nausea, and shaking. I tried eating and playing a game to get my mind off it and that didn&#39;t help. Usually with my anxiety, I can just tell myself I&#39;ll be okay. I told myself I would be okay and if I got a blood clot I would be perfectly fine. It did not work at all. This kind of anxiety was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever experienced. Nothing I did helped and it felt like everything was going a mile a minute.   I decided to take a benadryl, telling myself that this was just the &#34;impending sense of doom&#34; that happens with food allergies. I slept for 12 hours and felt exhausted when I woke up, like I had just been through something tough. I tried to just move past it, but the anxiety got worse and worse. I saw a doctor 06/23/2021 and have started taking Prozac.

On 7/13 symptoms of heart palpitations, muscle weakness, vision distortion, and elevated blood pressure began suddenly during work. I have history of stroke caused by thyroid storms. Immediately took atenolol, a beta blocker, and called my endocrinologist to prescribe it for the next 30 days. Switched from armour thyroid back to levothyroxine. Atenolol has caused other side effects, heart palpitations are mild and not gone, menstrual cycle is highly irregular. Waiting 6 weeks from the change to levothyroxine for next thyroid panel, continuing atenolol until thyroid levels are in range.

                                                At the time of injection, it was pretty painful and thus sent my body into a shock less than 5 mins after receiving my dose. My vision went white and I was very light-headed and hot/sweaty.  A nurse came with me outside to monitor and I was feeling back to normal in 15 minutes. This is something that happens when I experience a high amount of pain, so just reporting for others who maybe have low blood pressure issues.  At about 8pm, other side effects started to set in. I first experienced a headache, then experienced soreness/ache-y-ness  in my back. Around 8:30, I started to feel light headed again and soon my whole body felt ache-y. I quickly developed chills where I felt so cold that I was uncontrollably shaking and felt very sore/stiff. I have been laying under a heated blanket for the last hour and a half and am finally feeling better with no more shaking  or chills. I still have soreness throughout my body and a headache, but I took ibuprofen around 8:30pm.

                                                Around 3:15 in the afternoon, I began experiencing severe aches and muscle pains, combined with a growing migraine. Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

Fever is continuing today (3/11/2021), but is lower at 100.4F. Tingling fingers on hand from vaccination arm (left), swelling from vaccination injection site, headache, and neck pain all developed on 3/10/2021.  Headache and neck pain could be due to head trauma from vasovagal syncope. Tingling fingers were not observed on 3/11/2021.    *I have had vasovagal syncope in the past, but never with vaccines. It always occurs when I see my own blood.

                                                I started feeling subtle flu-like symptoms about 6 hours after receiving shot. At first I thought it was in my head but by the early evening I felt like I had a full blown fever even though I never actually had a fever at any point.  I had chills, muscles aches, head aches, and extreme fatigue. My back hurt especially and overall I felt very weak. I also had pain at the injection site that got worse the following day. I had trouble even lifting my arm to reach a drink just a few feet away from me.  The arm soreness lasted through the Monday following my vaccination (I received it on a Friday). All my symptoms were at their worst on Saturday. I felt much better on Sunday but still had the arm pain through Monday. Motrin did help relieve the worst my symptoms. I thought that was the end of my symptoms but that last week I have noticed what I believe to be a lingering fatigue from the vaccination. While it&#39;s not usual for me to feel tired at points throughout the day, I have been feeling a heavier and more full body fatigue than I usually experience. I have had to take naps more often, sometimes multiple times in a day.  During these bouts of fatigue, my whole body feels heavy and somewhat weak. It&#39;s similar to the exhausted feeling someone might have after they&#39;ve been crying for a while but I haven&#39;t been crying or emotionally taxed in anyway.  Normally when I wake up in the morning, I might feel tired for the first 30 minutes to an hour but once I get moving, I feel better and more alter. I have been having a harder time feeling rested or awake in the mornings and even if I get more sleep than normal, I still feel exhausted. I did not change my routine or diet which I why I think this is related to the vaccine.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

I already imagined that the fever was starting. 3 hours later I got home and took my temperature, it was 101 F.   the fever lasted more than 15 hours. I didn?t  take any medication. I put cold cloths on my head, bathed and rested. the headache was very intense. So far I have discomfort from that but the fever has already stopped. The most striking thing was the allergic reaction that I began to have around midnight and it continued until today. they were hives all over the body. swelling and itching and redness. Finally after 24hs after vaccine I took an anti allergy called levocetirizine  cause itching won?t stop.

Drowsiness continued and then fever of 102 throughout the night. Headache at temples, in between eyes and eyes continued to get worse along with pressure in those areas. Full body aches also developed. Nausea also occurred along with grassiness. Around 9 AM the next day the fever broke but headache continued. Aches subsided but persisted in neck, shoulders and most notably middle to lower back along with stomach aches. Weakness in the arms and hands still noticeable.  Dull headache still exists, aches, and weakness as of 9:00 PM.

It&#39;s particularly bad in my legs, knees, and elbows. There&#39;s also a fever but the pain is much worse.  I have a high pain tolerance but I&#39;m not kidding when I say this is unbearable. Breaking a bone hurts less. Actual COVID hurt less. This is agony.

Noticed a red welt at injection site (bright red, hot to the touch, swollen) 4/7 - red welt inflamed, still hot, sore, became incredibly itchy, whole arm uncomfortable and hurting. All other symptoms gone 4/8 - Inflammation of welt partially faded but red irritation spread out like it was dispersing. Later became darker red, still itching, began to hurt so much that even light fabric brushing across the skin caused pain. Still very warm to the touch. Doctor diagnosed the welt as Cellulitis and immediately issued an antibiotic.

I then had severe flu like symptoms overnight, including chills, and feeling hot and cold at the same time.  I woke up with a headache. I had muscle pains through the entire ordeal.  At 7am the next day, I took 600mg of ibuprofen and took a walk. I then felt fine.

                                                I had immediate soreness after the vaccine does. Then at 7pm of the evening after getting my vaccine, I began to feel weak, get chills, and run a low grade fever. At midnight, my fever had increased to 101 and I began taking Tylenol (recommended by Pharmacy). I had sever body aches, muscle fatigue, joint paint, chills and nausea through the night and the next day. In the morning, I had excruciating pain in my abdomen and began vomitting. Later that  day, my fever increased to 102.7 (with Tylenol) and I called my regular doctor. She told me to continue to monitor and if my fever did not decrease by 7pm to go the hospital. Finally, my fever decreased to 101, muscle aches, chills and joint pain continued. I began vomitting uncontrollably for a short period of time. I was very dizzy and weak the remainder of the day. Saturday, my fever finally broke (I sweated all day) but my body was still weak and sore. I also had dizzy spells on and off. Sunday, I felt much better but was still very tired compared to my normal self. I had abdomen pain and burning on and off. I also got hive on my hands Sunday afternoon. After Benadryl, the hives went away but I still felt itchy all over.  Today (Monday), I still don&#39;t feel like myself, but it is the best I have felt since receiving the vaccine. I have never experienced anything like this and was miserable Thursday night, Friday and some of Saturday. It truly was a terrible experience.

Once I was done freezing and with the fever it felt like my skin was on fire. I was in so much pain that night that I couldn&#39;t move without crying. After I slept that night and about 7 hours the next day I finally started to feel better.

My back began to hurt and that then moved into my neck and muscles as a whole with a little headache. The next morning I took Tylenol which I then started to feel a little better but  then at approx 3PM, my muscles began to hurt again, I took another tylenol which did not seem to help and felt nauseated. I then took a shower hoping it would help, but instead thew up after getting out. For the remainder of the night - my overall body felt week and standing up for long periods, I felt dizzy.

(In addition, my body felt a little stiff and my hamstrings got really sore, but I think it was directly related to a squat workout I did the previous day.) My temperature was 99F.  I woke up every 2 hours from my sleep. The chills lasted about 10 hours after their onset.  I took Tylenol at the 10 hour mark, and then the chills stopped. Hamstring soreness also subsided.

In the early morning I also got stomachache cramps and felt hungry, but food didn?t help. It actually made me feel nauseous. By 6am the next day I had a serious migraine too - sensitivity to light. My eyes hurt. It actually was so bad I caved and took 2 liquid Advil?s to help with the pain. From there I slowly got better over the day but still had the above mentioned symptoms, just less intense. Around 8pm the fever came back and I called it a night.  Next morning I felt better, but still tired. Still had a headache but not a migraine. And occasional stomach aches. It?s now 2 days later and the head aches, arm soreness and occasional stomach aches have not gone away.

                                                My first side effects were fatigue and feeling ?out of it?, which started about 2 hours after the injection. At 7 hours after my left leg became numb and a little sore. I started to notice a feverish, tingly feeling on my skin and this would last at least 24 hours. These symptoms quickly spread through my whole lower body. The chills and intense body aches started at 11 pm. I woke up at 2 am that night and had a low grade fever 99.9 F. I took 2 pills of Tylenol. The fever broke around 3:30 or 4 am and I slept through the rest of the night. The next morning 3/09, I felt fatigue, slow, and woozy. I still had chills and muscle aches, although the intensity was less. Halfway through the day the chills intensified, the muscle aches became more severe, and my eyeballs felt like they were burning in the back of my head. By that evening, the fever was back and I couldn?t think straight. My legs ached with a pain that I?ve never felt before. I did not have a severe headache, but I felt that if I exerted myself too much I would get one. My partner said I could barely form coherent sentences, and I was so weak I couldn?t sit up straight. I took 2 more Tylenol that night, went to bed and slept through the whole night. The morning of 3/10 I woke up feeling tired but my skin did not have that feverish feeling. I was no longer sick. On 3/11 I woke up and did my normal morning routine. I ate an egg, some of a Nutella stuffed scone, and drank coffee and water. I took my 3 pills, loratadine, omeprazole, and a probiotic, and I had a severe allergic reaction within 5 minutes of taking the pills. For the next 10 minutes my breathing became labored and wheezy. I experienced severe eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms. For the next week, my EoE symptoms were heightened. I had a reaction after drinking a seltzer water, which does not usually affect me. Within 2 weeks I was back to normal and to my knowledge have not experienced any other related side effects.

I have gotten many shots in my adult life and have never done this. About a week after the vaccine, the normal shot soreness began to turn into extreme stiffness. I experienced weakness and loss of range of motion as well as pain in my left arm.

                                                After receiving the COVID19 vaccine on Friday, March 19th at 12:30pm, I started feeling the normal side effects around 5pm. I had a low grade fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea and low energy through Saturday night around 7pm. When I woke up on Sunday morning, those side effects I no longer felt but instead I had pain in my vagina. All day, I assumed it was a yeast infection and would go to the store Monday to pick up Monistat. Monday morning, the pain had gotten worse.  My labia was very swollen and irritated and hurt when I urinated. At that point, I decided to look and found 10-15 lesions on my labia (both right and left side). I immediately called my primary care physican&#39;s office to make a same day appointment. My primary doctor was unavailable so I saw another doctor instead. She swabbed several of the lesions as she seemed to think that it was a herpes outbreak (which would have been my first). She wrote me a prescpription for Valacyclovir (10 days) and submitted my vaginal swab for HSV 1 and HSV 2 testing. Two days later I received negative test results for HSV 1 and HSV 2. I asked her for further testing as I was still in pain. I went back in for blood work: Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, CBC with Differential, Epstein Barr Virus AB Panel, Herpes Simplex Birus Antibody IGM, Herpes Simplex I/II IGG. All came back normal. I didn&#39;t have any old or new Herpes antibodies. This lead both her and my gynocologist to question whether or not this was a side effect of the vaccine.

My muscles hurt and a body felt very fatigued. Also, a little bit nauseous. I think my fever got to 100 degrees. By noon, I broke my fever. By three pm I was fine again.  The following days, I had soreness at injection site. I had a couple of headaches. There was one  episode where two weeks later, I did get a panic attack and went to urgent care. I went because it lasted longer than normal. This panic attack lasted for 30 minutes that is why I went to Urgent Care. Usually my panic attacks last for 3 minutes - but I also had personal things going on that could have caused it. No treatment, they just said to relax.

Pain: 2/10. Still slight pain behind left elbow. If overused, however, more pain and numbness. Right arm is constantly in pain but it is not as severe as previous month. Pain is 6/10 and runs from shoulder to fingertips but more prevalent around shoulders to behind left elbow and wrist. Shoulder pain feels like burning pain instead of usual tingly/prickly pain like the rest of the arm. Left knee gives out randomly and I feel pain from behind knee to calf whenever standing for long periods of time or walking for more than 20-30 minutes. Pain 2-3/10. 6/1: Telehealth appointment with PCP to go over test results. Referred for neuro consult. Was prescribed medication for neuropathy but currently meds are with mother in a city. Unable to drive from city to city to pick it up. 6/8: Telehealth appointment with neuro consult. Waiting on referral for nerve conduction study. Pain has not changed for right arm or behind left knee. Decreased walking due to more frequent moments of knee giving out.  Overall, due to constant arm pain in dominant arm (right arm),  I am unable to do most activities without assistance such as cooking, cleaning or driving. Right arm/shoulder get exhausted fairly quickly or nerves become inflamed when attempting to use it more. Shoulder feels like it&#39;s burning slightly. Sometimes hand/arm will shake and feel a spike of pain when overused. Must do things more with left arm and can not walk far without falling down randomly due to left knee giving out.

Within 5 minutes of receiving the shot I began to feel light-headed, lost consciousness and fell onto the floor and hit my head (according to a witness). I came to and there were staff members/medical personnel present and talking to me. I spoke with them and was immediately brought  to the emergency room for further examination. An EKG was administered and a urine sample was taken. Results were normal. I was given acetaminophen and ibuprofen and discharged.   Since being vaccinated on 06/28/2021 to today, 07/01/2021 I have experienced the following symptoms: muscle aches/soreness, headache, joint pain, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.   Please note the chronic knee injury previously reported. A day after my shot, I experienced 48 hours of joint pain in my chronically injured knee. I ruled out outlying factors like excessive exercise, overuse, or weather events, and could only conclude the shot was affecting me.   Today, around 5 pm until writing this report at 12:30 am, my knee has been experiencing joint pain again, and again, I&#39;ve ruled out all other reasons other than this potentially being  an adverse symptom of the shot.   The joint pain is mostly felt in the front of my knee, underneath my patella, and does not move to other areas. The knee is warm to the touch and not swollen like it usually would be when I experience overuse.

                                                So around the 27th of April, that week, I started having some symptoms. It started out with a posterior headache that became bad and debilitating. I also described the next as a sore throat but it was pain at the front of the neck. I had fever and chills, kind of flu like symptoms. I went to the ER on May 8, 2021. Once the results came back on May 12, 2021 and they said I had group c strep so I got antibiotics - Amoxicillin. I was still feeling terrible so I went to my PCD and she switched me to a z-pac. So around the 18th of May I went in to see her again and she told me to finish the Z-pac and they ran blood tests. A couple days later it showed I was in hyperthyroidism and I lost about ten pounds and that is significant for me. On June 16, 2021 I saw my endocrinologist. I got another blood test on June 29, 2021. Now I am clearly in Hypothyroidism, I feel a little bit better. My HR was 124 resting so I was also put on 25MG of Metoprolol, but now my heart rate is under control. I mainly talked to my Endo about this, but he said it may have better caused by the Janssen vaccine.

                                                Immediately after the injection and for the next 36 hours, I had soreness in my right arm where the injection was.  Around 8:15pm, I started to develop chills. From there, I developed a fever, headache, neck soreness and body aches in my joints (particularly wrists, knees, elbows). I contained the fever with extra strength Tylenol taken according to the box instructions. The fever broke overnight.  I had a 99 degree temperature the next day (3:00 pm) after the vaccine, and experienced fatigue and body aches. Those symptoms largely subsided by the morning of 3/21.   I still (as of the PM on 3/22) have no appetite and a persistent feeling of &#34;fullness&#34; in my stomach.

I pulled down my visor and used the mirror to look at my face and chest area and noticed red splotches all over. The rash quickly moved to cover my whole body within minutes of receiving the vaccine. Ochsner had me pull over by the EMT tent and I waited 45 additional minutes to see if I had any other effects. The rash didn&#39;t go away but I didn&#39;t itch and I wasn&#39;t uncomfortable. It was just a surface rash. The rash was completely gone by 10PM that same night. I woke up at 2AM that same night/early the next morning and the whole left side of my body was numb and felt very heavy. I also had a very mild fever and cold like symptoms. These symptoms included chills, dizziness, fatigue, and headaches. All of my symptoms, including the pain and heaviness on my left side, were gone the following morning which was about 36 hours after first receiving the vaccine.

This occurred at the same time as fever (highest 99.4 degrees F) and muscular aches in back and legs. After consulting with doctor, I took a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen and  half a dose of  metoprolol to lower fever and heart rate.  Experienced a slight headache and had trouble sleeping due to tachycardia.  Tachycardia dissipated 6 hours after onset. All symptoms resolved by 12 PM the next day (approximately 24 hours after injection).

                                                Approximately 8 hours after shot, I experienced sudden onset of extreme fatigue, extreme muscle aches and joint pain, slight headache, and 103 degree fever. The muscle pain and joint pain were so intense that it was difficult to be still and caused me to constantly try to shift positions. After 4 hours of running a fever (12 hours subsequent to shot) the fever fell to 100.1. The extreme muscular pain also diminished around the same time that the fever reduced. The fever stayed between 99.9 and 100.6 for the next 12 hours and achiness, joint pain, and fatigue remained but were comparatively milder. All symptoms were gone 28 hours after the shot. I did NOT take any pain relievers or medications during the time that I experienced symptoms.

                                                Two days after Johnson &amp; Johnson, my body launched into an involuntary fit of twisting and flailing movement at bedtime that I now think to be dystonia(?). I sweated terribly. It lasted an hour and a half of screaming and crying. Ehlers Danlos makes my joints and muscles very sensitive to being popped and torn, so it was very painful and remains painful, and now I&#39;m noticing unusual pockets of abnormal memory loss and confusion. Today I ran a red light. I have records of phone calls I don&#39;t remember making, evidence of chores around the house that I did not do. Very odd.

Roughly 9 hours after shot developed joint pain/tickling/shaking chills in my legs (mostly in the thighs) and nausea. Temperature rose to 102 degrees over the next 3 hours (I usually run around 97.5) along with the above pain. Around midnight/1 am I was able to get the fever down using Tylenol and a cold bath and the sensation in my legs lessened.  The following day I was still a bit nauseous with a headache and low grade fever. The same leg sensation (but to a much lower degree) persisted for 2 days.

                                                When I got the shot, moderately severe pain immediately radiated down my arm and into my last two fingers on my left arm as well as up into my shoulder blade area. It was a lot more painful than I expected based on previous shots. I went to bed with only arm pain and a small headache. Around 11pm that night I woke up in severe pain that was much worse than my chronic pain. I have prescription narcotic pain medication and that did not help. I was unable to leave bed and called my doctor at his home around 7am. I had a very bad headache (and I am used to headaches) and all of the areas of my body that normally hurt hurt much worse. My fingertips started tingling. I was miserable and in bed for about 3 days before starting to feel better, at which point I noticed that my arms and hands were off. The last two fingers on my left hand lost grip strength for about a week. The muscles In my arms kept getting weak. My fingers and the palms of my hands continue to tingling uncomfortably but the weakness is improving.

I began to shake very hard and had significant chest pain in my left side by my heart. The shaking and fever subsided by that Sunday night. However, it is now 6/1/21, and I had to go to the doctor today for my chest pain. While the ECG came back clear, the doctor determined that I have Costochondritis. As this is nothing I ever encountered before, I know that is was caused from the COVID vaccine inflammation response during my fever. This is when it was first noticed. It also causes back pain since it is between the breast bone and rib cage.

                                                After receiving my vaccine, I began to feel fatigue and significant brain fog. I could not drive. My husband drove home. I had a headache. By 1:00PM in the afternoon, I had aching joints and a low fever, by 3:00PM, my fever was 100 degrees and my movement was impaired with global joint pain. I managed with some ibuprofen and had to still take care of my family. By 9:00PM, my fever was 102 degrees and I could not move. Every joint in my body was burning, inflamed and aching. I could feel ever vertebrae in my spine. The headache was significant and if I moved the pain would increase. I called the hotline to try and reach my GP, it was the weekend. The nurse that answered did not know what to do with my position. My neurologist called me around 10:30PM and he didn&#39;t think I was in any danger, but seemed a bit helpless to know what to do for me. He encouraged me to continue using ibuprofen and wait it out. I was trying to go to the ER, and the only ER that can handle my health condition is very far away. Plus I didn&#39;t have child care. I ended up not going to the ER, but I&#39;ve learned that I should have gone. I managed with Tylenol, as much as I could, and it took about 16 days for the joint pain and aching to subside. I had a series of tests already scheduled that showed on a deeper lever the reaction that I had. I had to see my neurologist and my rheumatologist. My arthritis had returned after being in remission for at least 6 months. Prior to the vaccine, I had energy, no brain fog, no joint pain and no mast cell reaction. I used to be able to walk 2 miles per day and since the vaccine, I have not been able to do that nor have I been getting better. I had not had headaches before, but now I have them every day, in spite of medication. I cannot exercise or even do basic chores anymore. I am constantly thirsty. My blood work showed dehydration, regardless the amount of fluid intake. POTS went crazy. My blood work with rheumatology came back with a positive ANA and BSNA (double stranded DNA). I had to start taking hydroxychloroquine and get regular IVF infusions. I think that in the grand scheme of things, I have been getting back to stability, in just this last week. I have more tests coming up to see if the inflammation has come down. I won&#39;t know until my blood work comes back if I&#39;ve gone into remission or if I&#39;ve developed a new condition.

                                                Around 8:30p.m. Saturday  March 6, 2021 I began to feel chills. I laid down around 9:30p.m to go to sleep. I woke up at 12:25a.m (Sunday March 7th, 2021) with a fever of 104.3 and was experiencing extreme neck and head pain. My hands hurt as if I had arthritis and couldn&#39;t make them feel better. I was very short of breath and dry coughing. I took Tylenol and tried to lay back down and was able to go back to sleep around 3:00a.m. I got up at 6:10am and my temp was 101.6. I took Ibuprofen at this point and by 9:30am my temp was 99.8. I was still experiencing a very bad headache and my neck and back were achy. I felt a lot better by about 11:00am, took a hot shower and laid down for a nap around 2:00pm Sunday. When I woke up around 3:15p.m I had spiked yet another fever of 102.0 and was having bad body aches again in my neck and head area and it continued to get worse though my back over the next hour. I was experiencing a dry cough again also but this time it was more constant. It took over 3 hours for my fever to go below 100.0 with alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen. It finally broke around 7:00p.m. I had a lot of pain in my neck and head the rest of the night. I woke up Monday March 8th, 2021 with a moderate headache but it went away throughout the day. No fever returned Monday. The only time I experienced coughing and shortness of breath was while I had the fever.

Then later around 10:00am a feeling of tiredness came over my whole body.  Around 12:00pm I felt even more tired, lightheaded  and my eyeballs felt as if with high pressure in them and are feel sensitive to the sunlight.  Also, at 12pm, I had lunch, which was my first meal of this day and felt the necessity to lay in bed and take a nap for 20 minutes before returning to work.  While taking the nap I felt tingling on my feet, arms, hands and neck along with certain sudden muscle contractions on the same parts.

                                                I am currently pregnant. This is my first pregnancy.  My due date is August 29, 2021.  My pregnancy has thus far been really easy with no complications.  I had a low grade fever that I took Tylenol to treat.  I had pretty bad muscle and joint pain, chills, and could not stop shaking.  I just felt freezing.  Once my fever broke I felt extremely hot all night.  The next morning I was exhausted and had a lot of the muscle and joint pain still.  I marked on my report that it would&#39;ve stopped me from going about my normal daily activities, as I could not have gone to work and spent most of the day resting.  For the next few days I was tired and my eyes ached.  On Monday and Tuesday I had a headache in the afternoon.  Yesterday afternoon my eyes finally stopped aching and everything seems to be back to normal.

The pain was also accompanied by chills.  I took Tylenol for the symptoms but the pain did not subside. This morning, at 8:30am the joint pain is still very strong.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

                                                The following day after my vaccination, I had a severe headache all over the top of my head and eventually only the left side of my head and face felt intense pain. It felt kind of like a stabbing or shooting pain down into my head. Then I started feeling a lot if pressure and pain in my left eye, eye brow, and the sinus area. I could hardly open my eyes. My left side of my face also tingled with tiny sharp pains or numbness. This pain intensified for about 5 days so I started taking aspirin. It would feel slightly better but then would feel even worse.  I decided to use a netti pot to remove pressure. After about 5 days of using that I started to feel better. I would say I started to feel back to normal two weeks after the shot.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, while I was in the 15 minute observation period, I began to feel hot and cold at the same time, began sweating heavily, my limbs started becoming very weak and I started seeing spots. I called over a doctor and explained what was happening. He got a wheelchair and brought me to a room to lie down. During this time, my vision continued to get worse (seeing more spots and less peripheral vision).  Upon laying down, the doctor put my feet up and a nurse took my blood pressure. If I remember correctly, it was 90/58. My normal blood pressure is around 112/68. A nurse also put ice under my neck. Immediately upon laying down, I started feeling better. I was observed for a while more and then a nurse took my blood pressure again (both laying down and sitting up). My limbs still felt weak when seated and my blood pressure was better but not normal yet, so I was told to lay down a bit longer. Then, a nurse checked my blood pressure again (laying down, sitting up and standing up). It was back to normal and I was feeling better. I was cleared to leave the vaccine clinic. Since leaving the clinic, I haven&#39;t had any abnormal side effects or reactions.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I began by feeling stiffness and soreness in my joints and muscles, particularly my back and lower body.  The pain and stiffness worsened, and I began to feel ill similar to a common cold. Approximately 12-18 hours after receiving the vaccine, my symptoms worsened so much that I could hardly stand or move around, and began throwing up. This continued and worsened as my entire body felt pain and stiffness, I felt very weak and fatigued, and I was throwing up violently with frequency. I threw up so much and with enough force that I started to see bright red blood in my spittle and vomit. I had a severe headache accompanying these other symptoms.  I also had problems with homeostatic temperature regulation  and was simultaneously sweating profusely and very warm to the touch while feeling like I was cold.  I was shaky and experienced tremors and twitches in my hands, arms, legs, and feet. I kept throwing up and experiencing these symptoms for approximately 72 hours after recieving my vaccine.  I was virtually incapacitated for those three days of severe illness-like symptoms.

Shortness of breath started the next day on Sunday , extreme, far beyond normal asthma or any asthma attack. Went to urgent care on Tuesday- they said it was likely a side effect of j &amp;J and tested me for COVID, kidney disease other things, all came back negtative. Apparently I wasn?t the first person they had seen with shortness of breath. Blood in cough and spit on Wednesday after 2.5 days of  shortness of breath. Dizziness (extreme) throughout and chest pain, sternum hurt, chest tightness. Went to Er. They ran a lot of tests and they too said they had seen others with shortness of breath from j and j. They ruled out many things like pneumonia, a birth control blood clot, any lung diseases with X-rays and blood tests. I was given torkeril to ease the chest pain and tightness which it did. Blood stopped coming up in tissues. Doctor said likely inflammatory reaction to the vaccine in lungs, (I have a piece of paper proving that) and cartilage and sternum., which hurt extremely when he touched it. Blood was likely from burst capillaries from overcompensation from trying to breathe. Recommended I return if more blood came up, which it hasn?t.  Shortness of breath has not subsided. I can?t even hold a phone app without being winded. So email back, don?t call.

Note: I didn&#39;t exercise since I got the vaccine and maintained pretty good routines for ensuring enough sleep. Today is the 3rd day since that symptom appeared, while I do feel better, the pain hasn&#39;t disappeared.

I was shaking uncontrollably with a very high  fever and chills for two hours.  I couldn&#39;t eat.  I fell asleep for an hour and woke up feeling terrible- headache, fever, muscle aches, and sweating.  The next four days I had a headache and shortness of breath.   I am on day  8 now  and still  feel extremely tired.

                                                On March 6, 2021, I received the Johnson and Johnson Vaccination at about 8:15 am.  Around 7:00 pm that evening I started to experience the normal symptoms that they had advertised. Yes, I felt like I COVID again for about 48 hours, but nothing alarming.   On March 12, 2021, I went to an appointment with doctor due to extreme abdominal cramping and very heavy period.  This is not totally out of the norm due to my infertility, but I felt like something was off. I had random abdominal bruising and ruptured cyst pain; which I am still experiencing. She ordered an ultrasound to rule out a mass in my uterus due to the extreme pain and bruising.   On March 22, 2021, I woke up at 3:00 am with extreme stomach pain and extreme diarrhea.  As the morning went on I began to feel worse and worse. Other symptoms I experienced were; severe headache, shortness of breath, heartburn (I felt like I was having a heart attack), nausea, back pain, and extremely tired.  At 6:30 am  took me to the ER due to my worsening symptoms. Everything checked out fine and they thought I could have an ulcer, but I wanted to make you aware of these symptoms that I experienced.   I still have days that I experience some of these symptoms, but they have been under control and monitored closely.

Fatigue increased dramatically, though it was present prior. Dizziness, sharp pains in left ear in skull, nerve issues. The following is a log from when the symptoms became most intense, so significant I have not been able to drive myself and been working from home due to balance issues, no feeling in feet, and neurological symptoms. After different a week and a half,, i sought medical care and began logging daily as follows:   Fri 4/9: fatigue was high, neuropathy present. Balance was off.

Noted increase in joint pain and popping in wrists elbows hips and knees. Needed white noise to cover ear ringing to sleep.   Sun 4/11: feeling a bit better. Able to eat. Gastric issues after eating. Slightly more energy but neuropathy and balance was frustrating like superglue on my fingers and areas of my feet with no feeling at all surrounded by pins and needles.

One instance of ice pick ear pain   Wednesday: same as Tuesday, but no ear pains. Had to take a nap in the middle of the day due to worn out feeling. Laying in bed felt something in my back snap, then a stabbing pain into my lower right side of my back. Aching like the skin was hurting for hours.    Thursday: other symptoms same as Tuesday. Ears ringing crazy loud, stiff in the hips more noticeably. Neuropathy present with dizzy waves/vertigo. Low back skin pain right side continue. Also right hip. Gate while walking is starting to feel like it did before after a few days of improvement.   Friday: back still hurting. Neuropathy increased. More numbness than previous few days. Very stiff throughout lower back hips and legs. Low back pain. Gate while walking feels awkward and robotic. Ears ringing. Joints throughout cracking/popping. This is not historically common for me. While washing dishes got shooting pain down my left wrist back of hand almost shooting down the veins to in between my pointer finger and thumb. Painful to touch. Immediate strong increase in the pins and needles in my hand concentrated in finger tips but now radiating up forearm too. .numbness in feet and part of my face. Whole body aching. When trying to sleep kept getting head rush static attributed to Benadryl to sleep and staying up too late.   Saturday: very tired. Back hurting in morning. Felt better after getting up. Kept feeling head rush like static in forehead continuing on and off throughout the day into the night with dizziness almost like I might pass out. Nausea and low appetite Fatigue higher than normal.

PREDNISONE STARTED WEDNESDAY  Wed April 21: feeling about the same. Ringing in ears, neuropathy same, fatigue high. Appetite improved. Ice pick ear pain a couple times. Neuropathy seemed to improve towards the end of the day, when it usually is worsening. Felt nauseas and sick to stomach before bed with digestive issues. Dizzy spells all evening with static feeling.

                                                I was tired when I got home after the shot, so I took a nap. When I woke up my teeth were chattering from a fever of 100, I was throwing up and had spasms, back pain, body pain, and I was shaking. It lasted all night, at least 5-6 hours. The next day was similar. I called my doctor a week later because I was hoping the symptoms would go away. My tongue was swollen which made it hard to talk. The doctor advised me to take Tylenol. I feel like I have had the flu everyday since April 10.

In the middle of the night I had a fever of 103 and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, it was so painful. That was the weirdest thing I ever experienced in my life. I had three blankets and a robe on and couldn&#39;t stop trembling. There was pain all over my body, I had to wear a dress to the hospital because I couldn&#39;t put on pants because of the pain. At the ER, I was given an injection of Toradol and the pain was gone within 20 minutes.

                                                The day after I experienced extreme muscle and joint pain that lasted about a week. And it started to get better but the following Saturday I got a very terrible headache. And over the course of that week I started bruising very easily and all the veins all over my body were very prominent. The headache wouldn&#39;t go away and I started to have chest pain by that monday. And at that point all the muscle and joint pain came back and it was very very painful. At that point I called my primary care provider and they scheduled me with someone else in the clinic because i was having the chest pain. And they did a test for covid and urged me to go to the emergency room, which i did. After that I went to the emergency room and sat for 5 hours, they did bloodwork to check clotting factor, basic blood panel and also a CT of my head. According to them, everything was normal and they sent me home with a terrible headache. My biggest complaint was the bruising all over my body but no one ever looked at that.

                                                Immediate soreness in arm - headache after a couple hours. By 9:00pm, I was freezing cold but body warm. Chills lasted for hours and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, so took Tylenol at 12:15am. Around 1:00am the chills subsided. Around 2:00am fever burnt off, sweating and hot. Couldn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night. Slept from 8am-10am and woke with just headache. Took Tylenol around 10:30am to help with headache and it did start to subside. Was mostly fatigued and muscle aches the rest of the day until 6pm when I started to get cold again. Feels like the fever and chills are coming back and it&#39;s currently 7:30pm, so assuming it&#39;ll be another night of this.

If I get worse he advised me to go to the ER and if im not feeling better to call him in three days.

                                                Currently pregnant due May 31. I got the vaccine at 4 pm on Wednesday. At around 6pm I started to get a headache, I took 2 tylenol but it continued to get progressively worse. By 7 I was starting to get really fatigued and fell asleep. I woke up around 8 or 9 still fatigued with body aches and a headache. The body aches and headache continued to worsen, but due to pregnancy I could not take any more tylenol. Around midnight I got out of bed to use the bathroom and immediately started violently shivering. It continued for a few minutes after I got back into bed, it did cause a lot of pain in my joints and muscles. A few hours later I woke up very hot and sweaty. The next day (Thursday) I continued to feel very fatigued with body aches and a headache to the point where I had to stop working even though I work from home. The following day (Friday) I was still mildly fatigued and had some body aches, and my brain felt very foggy so I took off work again. I regularly checked my temperature during this time and did not have a fever.

                                                Most websites said 1-2 days for side effects to kick in but I was rocked pretty hard within the first 12 hours. The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

The strength in the right arm has also decreased. I have not injured or worked out my arm since I received the vaccine. I have tried to ice, heat, and move the arm gently, but nothing seems to lessen the pain and soreness. I have no injury history on my right arm or the right side of my upper body.

                                                10 hours after receiving vaccine, my muscles and joints started hurting, heart was racing, pounding headache, chills, I felt super hot but never ran a fever. Sweating profusely, I developed a cough.  About 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt like my heart rhythm was off, I could feel it skipping beats, then start beating really fast.

Symptoms started about 7.5 hrs after injection, mild at first but quickly became severe. When I felt well enough the next morning to try to take another pain/fever reducer, I did with no vomiting and was able to eat a small breakfast, and now it is about 27 hrs after injection and I feel almost 100% again. :)

Took 2 Tylenol at 4:45 am, ate a snack, and wrapped up in blankets. Significant relief from symptoms at 5:20 am. Went back to sleep. The following day, I had a mild headache, mild arm soreness, mild sinus congestion, and moderate tiredness.

                                                Roughly 10 hours after injection, moderate muscular pain at injection site, and severe pain in old lower back injury - chronic bulging disc. Back pain onset was severe enough to wake me up from sleep and persisted despite use of OTC pain management. Used 2x extra-strength 500mg acetaminophen, only dulled pain, then 600mg ibuprofen approximately 8 hours later to same result. As of 27 hours post injection, pain is still moderate and disruptive. Lack of sleep and pain make it hard to determine if the fatigue is a unique symptom or purely the result of the pain symptoms. In a non-measurable manner, having had this back injury for over 10 years with multiple reoccurrences, it feels like the joint/disk swelled enough for it to press on the spinal nerves despite attempts to mitigate with ice, elevating feet and head to open intervertebral space.

                                                Immediately after injection at 10:20am, I felt hot and light headed. I have passed out from shots and IVs before so I brought my own smelling salts to my appointment, and I used them as soon as I felt faint, which kept me from passing out.  I felt ok after waiting 30 minutes. Later that day around 5pm, I started getting chills and felt a little achy. At 6pm I checked my temperature and it was 99.9, at 7pm it was 101.9, at 7:30pm it was 104 so I took ibuprofen 400 since I had severe chills, headache fatigue and muscle and joint aches. At 8pm it was 102.7 so I took another 400mg of ibuprofen. At  9pm it was 101.7, and at 10pm it was 100.4 and then I went to sleep.  On 4/12: it was 98.7 when I woke up at 9am, then 99 at 10:30 so I took ibuprofen 400, then 100.1 at 11:30 so I took ibuprofen 400 again. Since noon, the fever has subsided and the fatigue and aches and headaches have become mild so that I could work from home.

As I was laying down trying to sleep my heart rate increase to approximate 151bmp for approximately 9 mins and remained above 110bmp all night. When I woke up the next morning around 7:25am my heart rate was still approximately 110 bmp and I had a severe headache and nausea. After taking an extra strength Tylenol and eating a piece of bread I went back to sleep for 90ish mins and woke up feeling  a little better. At that point my heart rate had dropped below 100 bmp.

Within 6 hours of vaccination extreme fever and chills were experienced along with nausea. The next day I experienced the worst headache of my entire life. I could not think or get out of bed. I also had numbness and tingling in my legs. The headache persisted for 5 days, alone with muscle weakness and nausea.  Numbness and tingling were intermittent.

Symptoms started the afternoon after the vaccine and got worse as the night progressed, becoming very severe around 8pm. I took generic NyQuil tablets and was able to sleep for a few hours, and was woken up after that by joint pain. Joint pain persisted Saturday (moderate, treated by ibuprofen) and Sunday (mild, no ibuprofen needed.)

These lasted for about 36 hours.  48 hours after injection, I started having menstrual cramps and begin bleeding. I bled for about 1 week and then began bleeding again approximately 1-2 weeks later. This second period lasted over a week. So, I had two periods in the span of 1 month. Neither period was expected or coincided with the placebos in my birth control. I do not normally menstruate at all on my birth control pills.

Fever was managed through the night and the following day with Tylenol, but varied between 99 and 102 the following day. I had muscle aches and fatigue  on Monday and Tuesday. Mild Chest tightness began Tuesday.

Since the vaccine, patient has been experiencing episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness. There was an article that came out today as it relates to blood clots being a possible side effect of the vaccine and to report any feeling of headaches or possible symptoms that may be related to that.

                                                On April 23, 2021 I noticed extreme fatigue and sore muscles in my arms and legs when I woke up (5:30 a.m.). This lasted approximately 48 hours. I also noticed soreness in the injection site for around 72 hours. On April 5, 2021 I noticed some upper back pain occurring intermittently throughout the days. This is still occurring. After contacting my healthcare professional, she feels that it is a muscle pain and most likely not related to the vaccine.

                                                I received the vaccine at 3:50 pm and by 9:45 I had the typical side effects --muscle aches, minor pain at the injection site, and chills.  Within an hour from that I also had a terrible headache, nausea, and my skin hurt to touch.  I slept most of the next day, save for 5 or 6 hours.  Starting on 3/30/21 (exactly two weeks from receiving my vaccine) I started having sore skin.  No rash, red marks, itching, just hypersensitive to touch, even with clothing.  This started on my right arm right above the elbow.  The following day the pain had moved to inside both arms right above the elbow.  The day after that, the pain was more intense and was straight across my stomach at belly button height, and across my lower back at that same height.  It was more intense for two days and hurt whether anything was touching my skin or not.  It was very uncomfortable.  In the days following it continued to move to different places on my body.  Legs, bottom of feet, palms of hands, ankles, hips, groin, lower back.    Sometimes it just hurts, sometimes it&#39;s like a prickling, sometimes the skin in that area aches -- especially when on my hands. It&#39;s also very sensitive to anything cold.  Again, if you look at my skin though you can&#39;t see anything.  There&#39;s no visible signs of something being wrong.  It also stopped for a day or so, or just lessened so much that it wasn&#39;t that noticeable, but then returns.  That&#39;s happened twice where I thought this was finally over, only to have it return the next day.

Muscle pain, fatigue, soreness, discomfort with breathing, headache, abdominal pain/swelling are still prominent.

The fever and muscle aches lasted until the following morning. Around 12pm is when I began expecting some stomach discomfort/sharp pains on the upper left hand side of my stomach. It began to increase in intensity around 4pm when I began to get nauseous. 5-6pm is when I began vomitting, and decided to go to the ER after the pain reached a level 8-9 and my face and limbs felt numb. I was admitted to the emergency room at 11:30pm and was given a CT Scan where it was discovered I had appendicitis. Wednesday evening I underwent surgery, and was discharged Thursday 4/15. I am still experiencing a slight fever and soreness at the injection site on my left arm.

                                                The first 24 hours were very difficult for me. I have never been so sick in my life. I got the typical muscle aches, chills, etc. In fact I got every side effect listed plus more. I want to discuss the other side effects. On day 3 I started to develop extreme chest pain and pressure. It is a dull pain as if someone if sitting on my chest that will not go away. I also started to experience sudden bouts of dizziness and vertigo. It will not go away. Today is Day 7 and I spent the night in the emergency room because my chest pains got so strong. However, all the work up came back okay. I also have this strange feeling of electrical shocks running thru my head, those last about .5 seconds and go away, but it is a very weird feeling I have never experienced. I also have a strange desire to constantly burp, when I do my chest pain feels better. If I don&#39;t burp my ears start to feel full and sometimes they ring. Its Day 7 and I still feel SO miserable. Why id no one speaking about these chest pains? I know 5 people who have experienced the same.

On 4/16, woke up with almost no ability to hear out of my left ear and there was a very loud ringing sound in my ear. Happened off and on throughout the day but by evening, I only heard a ringing noise. I went to the urgent care and they said my ear had no sign of ear infection or allergies.   Next morning, I couldn?t hear almost anything out of my ear with a very loud ringing noise. Was consistent through 4:30pm that day.  Went back to the urgent care and a different nurse practicing confirmed my ear looked completely normal.  I?ve never experienced deafness or ringing in my ear before.    Since this morning (4/18) I have had a low ringing sound in my left ear, but no more deafness.

                                                8 hours after receiving the vaccine I was doing maintenance my fish tank and began to feel physically fatigued as if I had just worked an 8 hour shift of manual labor, although I hadn&#39;t. By 6:30 PM I was feeling shaky and weak so I laid down. At 6:45 PM I was feeling feverish (chills even though my body was radiating heat). I woke repeatedly due to muscle soreness and chills. At 10:30 I checked my temperature and got a reading of 103.2 F. I had a mild headache as well. I drank some green fruit/vegetable juice and went back to tossing and turning on the couch. I took an Ibuprofen at 5AM with water and was able to get a couple of hours of sleep. !) AM I checked my temp again and got a reading of about 98 F. I was still feeling a bit sluggish and slightly dizzy at times throughout the day.

A few hours after vaccine, felt weird &#39;brain fog&#39;. This lasted through the following day. Not a typical headache.   6 days later -- experience &#39;brain fog&#39; experience again... again lasted 24-36 hours.  Still able to work as normal , just harder to focus. Also had weird sensations of goosebumps randomly when not cold.   15 days later -- notice that if I rubbed arm near injection site it was sore. Arm not sore at all unless touching it. Then notice a bruise at the site of injection the following day. Also feeling light-headed.

                                                I started with fever, vomiting, bodily pain, bone/joint pain and head pain the early morning after my J&amp;J vaccine which these symptoms lasted two days. There after I started to experience severe, constant headaches that come and go. My headaches are worse when bending down. I went to hospital and they performed lab work and told me it was a reaction to the vaccine. To this day my headaches come and go every day.

                                                On Day give I began having left leg pain, shooting pains starting at my knee going down my leg. As the next few days progressed my leg began to get numb and go cold as ice. I have lost my ability to walk and my leg still has shooting nerve pains, gets numb, and twitches. I have gone to the ER, the doctor twice, and a neurologist. Nobody seems to have any answers for me. It is not a blood clot but that is the only thing that has been ruled out.

She did not report any shortness of breath/dizziness/light headedness, patient color was good, injection site was not inflamed and pulse was normal. Patient sat for 20 additional minutes and reported that tightness may have been elevating. I requested her two friends to take her to the nearest emergency room at Hospital for monitoring.

I went to the Emergency room the night of the shot.  I was diagnosed with a bladder infection. The urge to gag was constant. I was given some nausea medicine in the ER and it helped a little I became dehydrated after a week. I had no appetite and had the gag reflex problems for three weeks.  I was diagnosed with a kidney stone about three weeks after vaccination. My anxiety was also bad during that time. I have been feeling better, less anxious and eating more for the last two weeks.

The day following the injection, more and more symptoms began to arise such as muscle soreness, cold/hot sweats, low-grade fever (99.5%), chest pain/pressure, sweating, dizziness/disorientation and a headache. Monday night I experienced the low-grade fever however after going to bed, woke up around 5AM barely unable to stand, very disoriented and upon taking my temperature, I took note that I had a fever of 100.9%. Today, Tuesday May 11th, I am experiencing chest pain/pressure, low-grade fever, headache and am lethargic.

                                                The morning after my vaccine I woke up feeling very ill, I had a fever of 101 and I was extremely fatigued, dizzy, joint pain and headaches. I stayed home from work. Over the next few days my fever subsided but my headaches, body aches, nausea and dizziness continued. My headaches worsened and on 4/15 my Dr ordered a brain MRI as well as blood work to be sure of no clotting. The MRI came back normal but I later went to the ER due to worsening severe headache and rapid heart rate. I was later discharged and the Dr told me he believes I am having a more severe pro-longed reaction to the vaccine and that he thought my symptoms would subsided around two weeks post vaccine. I am still currently having sharp headaches and joint pain, I have needed to miss work multiple times due to all of this and not feeling well enough to work or do my normal activities.

                                                When I received the J&amp;J shot I had typical side effects (headache, pain at the injection site, and chills) for the first 5-6 days. The side effects subsided and I felt normal. About 3 weeks later I started to have pain at the injection site again which started very mild and then built up to nearly the same pain level I felt after the injection. The pain has since decreased and the pain is in a different part of the muscle. I feel a strong pinch in the muscle, almost like a pinched nerve, when my arm is at certain angles or doing a motion such as lifting, tugging, throwing, etc. The pain has been persistent for over a month. I am able to do most daily activities with manageable pain, but the pain is persistent and frustrating. There is no noticeable swelling or rash, nothing to visually indicate that there&#39;s pain in the muscle. I scheduled a telehealth visit with my PCP who said that delayed reactions had been documented in some cases with Pfizer but there wasn&#39;t data on J&amp;J yet. She recommended that I monitor my arm, take Tylenol as needed, and keep her updated with any developments. I took Tylenol twice and it didn&#39;t do much. I don&#39;t know anyone else who has had this type of reaction and without data on J&amp;J, I don&#39;t know how long to expect the pain to continue.

                                                I had upper respiratory infection few days after the vaccination date that lasted for 2 weeks. The infection was moderate in severity that I had to take a week off from work but I did not go to hospital. Then after 3-4 wks post vaccination (the third week of June) I started abdominal pain and diarrhea that was severe enough to cause me dehydration and hypotension. Till now (July 4-2021) I still have bouts of diarrhea and postprandial pain. I lost 6 pounds in the past 3 wks because I am avoiding food. I did go to hospital and I am being managed symptomatically at home.

                                                The same evening I received my vaccine I started experiencing the normal side effects of the vaccine - sore muscles, chills, nausea, headache, fatigue, and my skin hurt to touch on my thighs.  I had a fever and muscle aches the following two days, but then felt pretty normal.  I had some fatigue still, but was ok.  Two weeks to the day after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine I started having hyper-sensitive skin to the point that it was unbearable to have clothing or anything touching me.  It started on my right arm just above the elbow.  The next day it was on the inside of my arms and elbows.  The next day it was my lower back and across my stomach at that same height, then it affected my hands, bottoms of my feet, and ankles.    The hyper sensitivity gradually spread on my body, but lingering the longest on the trunk - stomach and back.  However, it did affect skin on my entire body.   It would prickle or burn sometimes too.  When it&#39;s on my hands, my hands will ache too.  I saw my primary care physician for that after a month of having the persistent symptoms.  It&#39;s important to know that there was no visible reaction - no rash, redness, etc.  To look at my skin, you wouldn&#39;t have known there was anything amiss.  On April 19 I noticed in addition to the hypersensitivity I also felt like my hands weren&#39;t getting proper circulation.  I could feel it from my elbows down to my finger tips.  My hands felt cold and like a minor burning feeling.   On May 3rd my joints started aching (felt it in butt /hips).  I started taking ibuprofen and tylenol to try to ease symptoms and ibuprofen seemed to help a little bit with joint pain, but also helped a little with the skin hypersensitivity.  It did not eliminate symptoms, but gave a little bit of a relief.  From there I had that hypersensitivity down my legs, feet (also ached), chest, back, knees, stomach.  In the middle of May I was having joint pain in my hands too.  Around May 25th I started feeling a numbness sort of feeling in my knees, fronts of thighs, and feet.  Less so in my hands at this point.  Started feeling tingling, prickles, and like my feet were cold from in the inside.  Felt like they weren&#39;t getting enough circulation either.  On June 7, I noticed some balance issues.  Since then, the balance issues have much worsened, and in addition,  I&#39;ve lost muscle control, experiencing weakness especially in my legs, having a lot of trouble walking, that stiffness is still there - I have trouble even bringing my knees up while standing.  Having issues with going to the bathroom- urinating more often than usual, have had fecal incontinence, and feeling like my feet all the way up to halfway up my stomach are partially numb.   My PCP referred me to a rheumatologist.  I&#39;ve had bloodwork done and the rheumatologist is now referring me to a neurologist.

The pain continued in my legs for about a week or so before I started to feel the same random pains in my arms. Sometimes the pain is worst around my joints and I?ve also felt it in my feet a few times. Although I feel the random sharp pains on all extremities, my left side feels effected greater.

                                                Around 3:00pm on 3/7/21 I began to feel a little tired. But 3:45pm I was experiencing muscle pain through my body at only continued to get worse. At 4:30pm I took 400mg of ibuprofen since sitting, walking, and lying down were all painful. Relief came around 5:30pm and I was able to nap for an hour. At 6:30pm I awoke and attempted to eat, as I was beginning to feel nauseous. At 8:30pm I laid down again, my symptoms returning and worsening. I was now experiencing chills with my muscle pain and a headache. Pain was located throughout my body and my skin was sensitive to the touch. At 10:30pm I began shaking violently and struggled to feel warm, despite my skill feeling hot. My temperature was not taken. Another 400mg of ibuprofen was taken and one 350mg chewable of Tums anti-acid was eaten. It was not until 12:30am that I was able to sleep again.  The morning of 3/8/21 I was still fatigued and sore. Moving was difficult and painful and nausea was still present, and my headache returned. I was unable to eat despite trying. At 10:00am I took two tablets of Excedrin Migrain and napped for almost two hours. Currently, my muscle aches are minimal and my headache has improved. This may however be due to the medication.

                                                At around 4pm I started to feel cold. 30 mins later I started shivering and feeling cold and very sick with muscle aches all over the body with puncture maximum in left flank on a scale from 1-10 probably 9!I wasn&#39;t able to get up from the couch and had shivering until 2-3 hours later. I delayed taking Ibuprofen to not reduce the efficiency of the vaccine but couldn&#39;t endure the chills and shivering as well as the massive pain all over my body. I started with 200 mg Ibuprofen, which helped with all 3 symptoms at least as far as I was able to sit instead of lie all the time.

Third day - head ache  and muscle fatigue   5th day- starting at 4am. I woke up with skin itching. I noticed a rash on my arm where injection was. It then spread to back, other arm, legs, neck , ankles and knees. Took Benadryl and Zyrtec by doctors orders. The rash went away- but then six hours later returned and has grown. I also have to take more Benadryl since the same amount has not helped the rash disappear.

At midnight I woke up extremely hot, as if I had a fever (I didn&#39;t confirm this with a thermometer, I was just extremely hot and sweaty) and I had a very severe, painful headache that lasted at least 30 minutes until I took two acetaminophen pills. I also experienced the usual muscle pains. All symptoms were gone by Saturday morning upon waking.

                                                Pregnant and EDD is 4/18/21. This is my 2nd pregnancy.  By 8pm the night of the vaccine, I had some nausea, headache and muscle aches. I woke at 3am with severe chills and shaking. I had a fever of 101.5. I took Tylenol Extra Stength and that helped.  Had trouble sleeping but managed to fall back asleep for a little bit. Upon waking, I had a head, muscle aches, and a fever. I kept taking the Tylonel every 6 hours throughout the entire day. My fever got as high as 102.1. It broke around 7pm on March 18th. My shoulder where the vaccine was injected was sore through Saturday, March 20th. I had muscle aches and weakness through Saturday, March 20th.

This lasted from about 7pm the night of the vaccine until around 3:30 in the morning, despite alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen.  The chills and muscle soreness alone were debilitating.   I filled vsafe today when I signed up but it did not give me the option to add yesterday?s symptoms so I am reporting them here. Today symptoms have been milder, mostly fatigue and no fever.

By March 9 all side effects had resolved.

Treated with iburprofen and odansetron at approximately 3:30 AM. Fever, nausea, and vomiting subsided due to medication. Muscle/joint pain remained at a lessened level. High levels of fatigue emerged in the early morning hours. Took sumatriptan for migraine at around noon and again later that evening. Fever resurfaced when ibuprofen wore off around noon. Had to leave work early due to fever, muscle/joint pain, and migraine. Took another dose of ibuprofen around that time and again in the evening. Fatigue lasted until approximately 48 hours later. All other symptoms subsided within 24 hours.

It was very stiff and sore and there was a sharp pain while going from standing to sitting and in the sitting position. It was a very sharp pain that was shooting down my leg and it wrapped around my hip. It was a constant pain. I also had a little soreness in my neck and shoulders and it lasted two days. I went to see my chiropractor the next afternoon. It was better after that visit and it is still a little stiff after two weeks. I took Ibuprofen as needed since then.

These symptoms continued throughout the night. The next day I had a low-grade fever that responded to Tylenol, and generally felt fatigued and achy. The next night I had some chills and shaking (though not as bad). The following day I had a headache and fatigue but no fever.

I began feeling tired and warm at approximately 6PM the day I received the vaccine 4/7 (received vaccine at 10:30AM). Sweating fever and chills began that evening. I had muscle aches, joint pain, headache, and swollen lymph node under right arm the following morning. Symptoms lasted through the morning and were mostly gone except for remaining lymph node tenderness on 4/9.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after I received the vaccine, I started to feel extremely fatigued and experienced some muscle aches. I took an Aleve and laid down for an hour long nap. At approximately 7:00pm, I woke up with more extreme muscle pain. By 8:00pm, my muscles were so tight and painful that it hurt to move, lay still, or go to the bathroom. It felt as though all of the muscles in the back of my body (from my back to my butt and legs) were spasming, Over the next few hours, my temperature rose to 102.7 and my heart rate spiked to 140-150 bpm. I also experienced chills and a headache. We sought the advice of a 24-hour nurse, who let us know these symptoms were likely normal side effects. I went to bed around 12:00am, and my temperature had dropped to 99.9 around 3:00am when I woke up to check it.  My heart rate eventually dropped below 100 bpm around 8:00am. I woke up around 10:00am on Saturday feeling much better than the day before. My temperature was around 99.1 when I woke up, and my symptoms included mild muscle aches, a moderate headache, and moderate fatigue. I continued to feel better throughout the day, with the headache gradually subsiding and a minor sore throat toward the end of the day. On Sunday, I felt back to normal, other than experiencing some mild-moderate fatigue.

                                                Tachycardia.  I had the expected side effects of headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and fever (102.6 F) but began to experience symptoms of pounding/racing heart that worsened through the evening. By 10:00 pm my heart rate was bouncing around between 130 bpm and 155 bpm, and I was beginning to have pain in my lower legs/ankles.  Was told by a on call nurse for my clinic to go to the ER. I was in the ER for about 5 hours, roomed the whole time as they worked to get my heart rate down and checked to make sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot. They performed an EKG and CT Scan of my chest, both were fine. I was eventually allowed to leave after 4 am on 4/10/21 after my heart rate got into the high 90&#39;s with only small spikes into the 110&#39;s with slight movement and once my fever had broken.

The morning after receiving the shot, I developed neck and shoulder pain which became more sever on the next 2-3 days. The neck and shoulder pain has been ongoing for 5 weeks since receiving the shot on the injection side. I have seen my primary care physician twice, most recently to rule out a blood clot (yesterday 4/13). I have also received physical therapy. There was no neck injury or pain prior to the vaccine.

Vision slightly obscured, but I could still see. Applied a cold compress throughout the day and monitored for additional concerns. By the end of the day, the swelling subsided. By Monday, both eyes still felt pressure pain, but the swelling was significantly improved. Other side effects included the expected muscle soreness/aches, fatigue, and a mild rash around the vaccination spot. No additional adverse effects observed.

I have experienced sinus pressure headaches as well. My legs and arms feel tingly and numb at times - more often my left side which is where I got injection. I feel weakness and fatigue most afternoons. My body didn&#39;t feel this way before the vaccine and it seems as though my body hasn&#39;t fully recovered from the shot and has flared up these symptoms. I feel all of a sudden that I have arthritis.

                                                Patient initially experienced muscle aches, fever, and headache for 3 days starting 1 day after vaccine -- within 3 days the muscle aches resolved, but then she continued to have severe headaches. The headaches became migraine like in quality with photosensitivity and a one-sided pounding that was debilitating and associated with nausea. The headaches respond to migraine treatment (Sumatriptan) started after the vaccine, but she has never had migraines before. The migraines continue almost every day until today, 4/27/2021. Due to the onset of new migraine-like headaches with no prior history, a workup and neurologic exam was done twice which was normal both times (see below). However, it seems significant that someone has new daily migraine headaches for longer than 3 weeks after the vaccine was given so we are reporting it.

                                                Had all side effects within 24 hours of vaccine- went to bed with a headache and chills, had body aches and slight nausea the next day. Then it all went away aside from some lingering arm pain.  A few days after the shot I had tingling and numbness in all 4 limbs. I also had random sharp pains in my right leg. I woke up Friday morning and my right arm felt like ice cold water was dripping down (but wasn?t). My husband took my blood pressure and it was really high and my chest felt tight. Given that the vaccine was just paused for blood clots we went to the ER. They ran labs and said I didn?t have any clots.  Here is the timeline of what happened after:  Saturday &amp; Sunday &amp; Monday: Felt normal again  Tuesday: Felt short of breath  Tingles started to come back  Wednesday: Leg and arm numbness   Thursday thru the next few days were the worst:  Thursday: Random sharp pains, back, thigh, ab  Right calf felt a bit swollen and more sensitive  Tingling on back of head Tingling in leg and arm  High anxiety pain in chest  No appetite High blood pressure   Friday: Muscle twitching in thigh, sides and random places  Random tightness/sharp pain in thigh  Blood pressure and heart rate went back to normal  High anxiety pain in chest before bed  Didn?t sleep well keep panicking awake (not normal) No appetite   Saturday: Right calf slightly swollen after walking around  Still had muscle twitches and it?s always in the same spot in my thigh   Did a teledoc appt which was totally unhelpful  High anxiety pain in chest- felt like I was going to pass out at one point and we took my blood pressure in that moment and it was high ?happened after dinner No appetite  Note: anxiety is not something I?ve ever had   Sunday: Swelling in leg returned Sharp pains randomly A little heavy to breath at times  Tension in my head ? felt cold After I ate dinner chest heaviness returned Sensory overload- watching tv couldn?t do. Sound of humidifier plus tv  gave me major anxiety. Turned humidifier off and it  instantly got better  No appetite   Next few days Leg feels numb tingly in morning  Slightly tingling in my right hand Light headache  Some random twitches and sharp pains in thigh still  The next month all seemed fine. It wasn?t until I got a small cold that the tingling flared up again. Right leg continues to be a problem-tingling and numbness comes and goes daily. I?ve also had a few episodes of chest tightness out of the blue.  Last night I woke up to find my right arm also tingly and numb.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Experienced strong muscular back pain, mostly lumbar but pain felt across entire back. Normal existing body pains also felt amplified.  Strong fatigue as if I had engaged in arduous physical activity but had not.   Took Advil PM night of vaccine and woke up feeling no pain but slight headache. Took excedrin extra strength in anticipation for headache escalating and felt no further pain until 4:30 pm the day after vaccine. Pain more intense, took 800mg of ibuprofen at 6pm and pain was alleviated by 8pm. Took Advil PM again night 2, and woke up with no pain again. Now 4:45pm of day 3 and not feeling pain but it could return when effects of Excedrin wear off.

                                                The evening of injection day, I started feeling severe muscle and joint pain. It was comparable to a Fibromyalgia flare but worse. Walking and moving was severely painful. This morning I was still in severe pain. As of this afternoon, the pain is finally starting to subside. It felt as if my body was attacking itself as well as building up my immunity to Covid. OTC pain medication helped ease the pain, but only by a little.

My fever peaked at about midnight with a temperature of 101.8. At that point, I took two Tylenol. Had a rough night and didn&#39;t sleep well. Continued taking Tylenol the following day to manage the low grade fever. I seem to back mostly back to normal today (two days after receiving the vaccine), however I do still have soreness in my left arm where I got the shot and some residual aches and pains.

I assumed it was from looking at my phone while I waited for the 15 minute wait to be up, but the pain never stopped, but it did move around my body. Fever every evening starting the day after the shot. Searing muscular pain since shot, worsens when fever happens, and the pain is moving throughout my body. On Monday, It is day 3 after the shot and my arm is swelling more today than any other day. Advil 400mg every 4 hours, rest, and plenty of fluids.

                                                I began having a really bad allergic reaction and I was itching all over my body. That same night I began having a horrible headache, and my muscles and joints began aching and hurting. It felt like I was holding a two ton rock over my head when I would try to walk. I took Benadryl and used Sarna lotion for the itching, and took tylenol for the headache and muscle aches. IF symptoms don&#39;t subside, then I will visit the clinic at my job to be treated and see what they could recommend.

                                                I received the vaccination 4/2/21 at 11am and at about 6pm the same day - I felt a sudden flush and felt like I was going to faint in the middle of Grocery store. Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

The muscle pain and weakness was so bad I would loose balance when walking. I then started to menstruate clots, not my normal cycle timing,  which lasted about 2 days. The clots subsided but I am still bleeding today. I was in bed for 4 days with severe immune response symptoms. After those symptoms subsided the fatigue was so extreme it was hard to function.

                                                I was given the vaccine at 11:10am and by 5:30pm I was beginning to feel tired and unwell. At 6:45 I had a fever, body aches, pain in my arm, headache, and chest pain. These symptoms continued for three days and my fever reached 102.7.  After three days the fever and body aches subsided but the fatigue and chest pain continued. The chest pain has continued with increased heart rate during small bursts of activity. I called the clinic that administered my shot on April 9th and was told chest pain was normal up to 10 days and if it continued to be a problem to go to the ER. After 11 days of chest pain I went to the ER on April 13th and they did an EKG, CT with contrast, and blood work. They concluded I was fine. I was told it could be esophagitis so to take 2 15mg Prevacid a day which I have done with no relief. I was also informed it could be muscle related so I have iced, taken anti-inflammatory medication, and have not exerted myself.  It is now April 19th and I am still experiencing chest pain and racing heart rate with minimal exertion.

                                                patient was treated with the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine on Saturday April 10, 2021 and she relates having had symptomatic problems since that time stating prior to administration of the vaccine she was in her normal state of health.  She relates that on the evening of April 10 she had chills but otherwise no other major symptoms and the next day felt fine as well as during that week.  However she states that starting 1 week later on Saturday, April 17 she began feeling poorly characterized by a recurrence of hives that she has had in the past along with a sore throat.  She states this occurred while she was at work and describes the sore throat as unusual from prior sore throat she has had in the past with a description of a globus-like sensation along with some difficulties swallowing for more pressure than overt pain.  She attempted salt water gargles without benefit.  The rash was the characteristic hives rash that she has had on 2 prior occasions with rapid development of itchy red lesions scattered throughout especially in her proximal extremities and torso region.  She relates the hives worsened on Sunday, April 18 essentially from &#34;head to toe&#34; although not actually involving her face.  She also related new accompanying symptoms including diffuse arthralgias, stiffness and swollen painful muscles and joints.  This was throughout her entire body and somewhat of a migratory nature involving all of her major joints including the hands, wrists, shoulders, feet, ankles, knees and hips.  She states that because of the severity of symptoms she had an urgent care appointment on Sunday, April 18 and felt to have a exacerbation of urticaria for which she was prescribed montelukast, loratadine cimetidine and a Solu-Medrol Dosepak.  She states she was unable to fill the Solu-Medrol Dosepak initially but took the other medications without relief and then presented to the emergency room here at Hospital on Monday, April 19 where she had an evaluation which was largely unremarkable other than laboratory testing with a nonspecific elevation in inflammatory markers including a CRP of 5.7, ESR 34 and white blood count 15.92.  She was notably COVID-19 negative at that time as well as Monospot negative.  She was discharged home and ended up filling the Solu-Medrol Dosepak which she took and noted some improvement in her hives but has been continue to experience this ongoing sore throat, arthralgias, myalgias and diffuse swelling which is quite painful.

                                                April 10 - I only had mild pain at injection site; no impact to activities. At 9:40 PM that evening, I started feeling feverish, pain, itching at the injection site (continued for about 6 days); muscles aches (ongoing) headache, nausea, and uncontrollable chills. And I was not able to do anything the next day and that was the 11th. I l also got my period that day. The 12th, my period became a geyser - I never had a period like that before - I was bleeding a lot for about 5 days (my period didn&#39;t last longer than  a normal  period though) ; and I still had some muscle aches (they continued through the 12th). So I gave my PCP a call and went in, and she told me to watch it (she didn&#39;t know I had been vaccinated. I&#39;ve had an ongoing headache this week: on Wednesday (the 21st) - for 22 hours non-stop and Thursday (the 22nd I had another one on Thursday - it was about 6 or 7 hours).

                                                patient admitted 4/23 for a multitude of symptoms and signs suggestive of a multisystem autoimmune inflammatory disorder of unclear etiology. Her past medical history is relevant for mild intermittent asthma, history of recurrent idiopathic urticaria, history of migraine headaches, hypothyroidism on supplemental levothyroxine, history of bipolar affective disorder on antipsychotropic medications (lamotrigine) and ADHD on stimulant medication (Focalin).  Notably, the patient received a Johnson and Johnson COVID19 vaccine on 4/10. She reports current symptom onset on 4/17. Symptoms include pleuritic type chest pain, myalgias, arthralgias, diffuse interstitial edema, urticaria and objectively evidence of diffuse inflammation manifested by rising leukocytosis 16,000, CRP 9.3 from 5.7 just days ago, ESR 71 from 34 just several days ago, and new acute hepatitis. Pt admitted to the hospital and hospitalist states &#34;Unclear etiology definitively but the clinical features all developed approximately 1 week after administration of the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine which raises suspicion for this vaccine setting off the disease process&#34; and &#34;Strongly recommend consideration for reporting of possible adverse reaction to the Johnson Johnson vaccine&#34;.

                                                During my menstrual cycle I usually have no symptoms other than tender breasts. So these symptoms were very unusual. Leg pains, pain and pressure in pelvis, clitoral pain, pain around vaginal opening, stinging like acid during urination that sent a shock through my entire body, uncontrollable bladder, nausea, large blood clots, lower stomach pain, flank pain, hot/cold chills, if I touch my belly button the pain radiated to my vagina, ovaries hurt, cervix pain, dryness, unable to get comfortable, crawling out of my skin, and constant urge to urinate, depression.  I landed myself in the ER where they told me to take Tylenol and Motrin and sent me on my way. These medications were not able to control the amount of pain I was in. I have now reached out to a couple specialists.

The patient&#39;s weight and height were not reported. The patient medical history included being 4 months post-partum. The patient had no drug, food or other product allergies, and had no chronic or long-standing conditions. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration and batch number not reported), dose was not reported, administered on 23-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. From an unspecified date, the patient had 2 weeks of headaches and blurry vision, 2 to 3 days of neck stiffness and nausea with 1 episode of vomiting and had been transferred to the current hospital from another. On 04-APR-2021 (12 days post-vaccination), the patient was diagnosed with dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST), transverse/sigmoid (cerebral venous) sinus thrombus (CVST) with associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe as well as thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein (thrombus). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) impressions showed there was a re-demonstrated of intraparenchymal hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe measuring approximately 6.2 x 3.6 cm in maximal axial dimensions. There was surrounding edema and associated mass effect with effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm. There was medialization of the right uncus without transtentorial herniation. The basal cisterns were otherwise patent. There was dural thickening and hyperenhancement overlying the hemorrhage. There was prominent cortical veins along the right frontal temporoparietal convexity consistent with venous congestion. There was also a small are of vasogenic edema in the right anterior temporal lobe separate from the hematoma. There was a right mastoid effusion, but normal orbitals and the calvarium and skull base were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) results revealed non-opacification of the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus and upper internal jugular vein compatible with occlusive thrombosis. A small amount of thrombus also extended into the left transverse sinus. The superior sagittal sinus, remainder of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, left upper internal jugular vein, straight sinus, vein of Galen and bilateral internal cerebral veins demonstrated normal contrast opacification. The patient&#39;s platelet count was 126 upon admission (normal range [NR] not provided), with other workup laboratory test results reported as pending. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The outcome of the right internal jugular thrombus, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, DVST, CVST, headache, blurry vision, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting was reported as unknown. This report was serious (caused/prolonged hospitalization and other medically important condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This case concerns a 34-year-old white female who experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), dural venous sinus thrombosis, right internal jugular vein thrombosis, and cerebral hemorrhage 12 days after receiving covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient was noted to be 4 months post-partum. She presented for medical assistance with a 2-week history of headaches, blurry vision, and neck stiffness for 2 to 3 days as well as nausea with 1 episode of vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe with surrounding edema and associated mass effect resulting in effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm and occlusive thrombus within the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus, and upper internal jugular vein.  A small amount of thrombus extended into the medial aspect of the left transverse sinus. The platelet count on admission was 126,000. Although the post-partum status of the patient may have contributed, based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration) and considering the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

                                                6 weeks after receiving vaccine, I was outside with both arms and hands exposed in the sun for a few hours. The next morning, the muscles and joints in both arms and hands were extremely sore and painful. This was not like a sunburn which is painful at the surface level. It is muscle and joint aches similar to the side effects I had within 48 hours of the initial vaccine, but only in the areas that had been exposed to the sun for an extended period of time.

On Tuesday (May 18th), my legs, buttocks, and arms broke out into a severe rash. Large welts, extremely itchy, and spreading quickly. I went to my doctor the same day to receive treatment after trying topical antihistamine cream and witch hazel, which provided little to no relief.

                                                Around 1:30pm on Tuesday April 6th, I was sitting at my desk in my home office, working. I began experiencing moderate chest pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms continued to worsen for the next hour. I had difficulty breathing, and taking a full breath was painful enough to prevent me from doing so. I drove myself to the ER. While waiting in the ER, I began experiencing chills, severe joint pain, and moderate pain generally throughout my body beginning around 4:00pm, which I advised ER staff. While being examined by the ER doctor around 7pm, there was some tenderness noted in my right upper quadrant. My blood pressure was extremely high (205/130) and I developed an intense headache. I was admitted overnight and discharged the afternoon of April 7th. While the chills and pain improved on April 7th, my chest pain and shortness of breath continued for another week or so. The night of April 7th at home, I woke up several times with difficulty breathing and ended up sleeping fitfully while propped up at a 45 degree angle so I could at least breathe mostly normally. The chest pain and difficulty breathing slowly improved over about 10 days until I was no longer experiencing symptoms.

                                                Around 7 pm on the night the vaccine was administered (5/14/21), I noticed my legs felt heavier and weird. When I looked at my legs, they were swollen and slightly red. This did concern me, but given that I can not afford health insurance, I laid in bed with my legs elevated and eventually went to sleep. When I woke up the next day around 9 am, my legs were no longer swollen, but my hands now were. The swelling went away by 5 pm that day(5/15/2021). Thus far, besides a headache that persisted for three days straight from 5/21/21 until 5/24/21, I haven?t experienced any other abnormal swelling and I currently feel fine today.

                                                I was vaccinated at 36.5 weeks pregnant.  The following morning, I was nauseated, had muscle aches, and chills.  I went to the OB/GYN for a scheduled check up and my blood pressure was approximately 160/90.  It had been 118/76 the night before at the pharmacy and had been around 112/72 my entire pregnancy.  I got home and had a fever of 100.2F and took a nap due to pure exhaustion.  My BP remained elevated (130s/80s) for the following 3 days.  I then had to go back to the OB for a BP check 3 days later where it was then 175/95.  I was forced to be induced the following day due to my high blood pressures.  Baby was born 24 hours after the start of induction and weighed 6lbs 9oz (37 weeks, 2 days) and is healthy.  My blood pressure remained elevated (140s/80-90s) for weeks following vaccination.  It took approximately 4 weeks for blood pressure to return to my normal readings post vaccination.

                                                The day I got the vaccine I noticed a lot of muscle stiffness and joint pain especially in the shoulder, my ROM in the shoulder was limited. I had like really tense muscles in my lower back and pretty much most of my extremities. I remember taking Ibuprofen that night to go to sleep because I had a head ache. The next day I still kind of felt like recovering from a cold like still having the achiness and dizziness like your head is kind of heavy. Its been pretty persistent of those symptoms since then. On 03/23/2021 I had a doctor?s appt and they assured me that we lost our baby and they were worried about my blood pressure, it was 149/106 with pulse of 88. They told me that I should be worried about my blood pressure because that is extremely high and to take caution and monitor it. That is when I started doing the weekly reports. We do not know if the blood pressure was related to the pregnancy but it has come down since then. Since then I still have the occasional head ache and dizziness, right now I am actually sick with cough and mucus and I am schedule to take a Covid test. I had high blood pressure during pregnancy before.

                                                My Rheumatologist suggested I report this:: I had no side effects other than a sore arm and some tiredness up until approx 6 hours after the injection. At approx 8:30 PM, I was lying in bed and both of my legs from the hips down started to shake violently. It did not feel like the chills as I was not cold and the rest of my body was unaffected. The shakes felt completely involuntary as if my brain was short circuiting. My legs shook so violently that my hip joints began to really hurt. Shaking lasted less than 30 minutes total. I am not sure what stopped the shaking, but I had tried to put my body weight over my legs  (body folded in half) to try to stop the shaking and took 1 regular strength tylenol.  After the shaking ended, up until I went to sleep (maybe 3-4 hours later) I felt some numbness and tingling in my finger tips and feet.  The next day, I felt fine but emailed my Rheumatologist to report the shaking and she directed me to report it here.

                                                Began feeling tired and developed an intense migraine around 6 hours after, went to bed several hours early (8:30 pm).  Intense started in early evening in upper arms and neck and spread through entire body.  Felt as if bones hurt.  In bed 10 hours but got little rest.  Chills and sweats.  Note that the pain is the exact same I had when I had COVID several months ago, which has flared up on and off since.  Next day symptoms are mostly gone, some tiredness and soreness remains.

                                                At 2PM, I began to feel a little nauseated and extremely tired. I lied down and began to get the chills. By 5pm my temperature was at 99 degrees F and by 7pm, my temperature was 100 degrees F. My muscles on my back, neck and legs were painful. I had no problems drinking liquids. I refrained from Tylenol until about 7pm, I had 1000mg. I slept for 8 hours and woke up with no fever but the muscle aches have reduced by about 50%.

                                                Within 10 hours of getting the Janssen covid vaccine, I had suddent and severe joint pain in multiple joints, severe body chills, fatigue. I was shivering and felt unable to get warm despite truck temperature at 90 degrees along with a blanket and seat warmers on. Took 1000mg of Tylenol and symptoms mostly resolved with some minor joint pain and fatigue but had to continue the tylenol every 8-10 hours for the next 2 days or the symptoms returned in the severe state. Site of injection has also been swore with touch still at day 9. No redness or swelling at injection site. Also had 2xepisodes of random severe fatigue which is not normal and it lasted about 1-2 hours.

Was able to sleep until about 3:00 a.m., at which point I woke up to changing temperatures from hot to cold, headache and muscle aches. Most of the aching is occurring in my legs and arms. The back of my thighs are the worst, then my valga, and lastly my biceps and triceps. The headache is mild.

Hard to sleep that night because I was so achy. By the morning I had a fever of 99 (never went higher than that), headache, sore joints and muscles that lasted through the whole day/felt like a mild flu. Waking up on 3/28/21 (day two after shot) my low grade fever was gone and symptoms are mostly gone. Just a slightly sore arm.

My mother, brother and myself all developed backaches and headaches the next day, but those have passed.   I still have pain at the injection site whenever it is touched.  I called the health department two days after the vaccination and was told that the side effects should only last 24-48 hours, but I still have the redness, lump and soreness.

I am better this morning, just very tired, slight headache and slight achy.

First day after felt slightly better, still tired and slightly light headed. Second day symptoms worsened, feeling like I was going to pass out/faint, hot/cold chills, clammy, no fever, shortness of breath, culminating in numbness and tingling in arms, legs, then chest and then hands freezing up which resulted in a panic attack. Have never had a panic attack before. Emergency services called and after checking gave a sedative and went to the ER.

                                                Flu-like symptoms.  Severe chills, nausea, fever, headache, body aches, fatigue throughout the night and into next day. Felt a little nauseous immediately after shot. Flu symptoms came on around 10pm and lasted until about 5pm on 3/21/2021. Worst period of symptoms was overnight (about 12 hours.) Took 2 Tylenol 2-3 times while I was experiencing side effects which helped some with symptoms.  Had pain with injection and sore arm for about 48 hours after. It was a much more severe, deeper muscle pain than with other vaccines.

At the suggestion of a doctor, I took ibuprofen for the muscle pain and ondansetron for the nausea. My body temperature rose from normal to about 101 F within two hours after the onset of muscle pain. After another hour and a half my fever subsided. I continued experiencing strong muscle pain for another twelve hours.

                                                My shot was around 12 noon. I didn&#39;t eat before so they gave me crackers and juice at the site. Afterwards I ate a real meal and two hours later I got dizzy. It was tolerable.  At 9:30 PM I got a fever. Then I felt pressure all over my body, pressing me down; I felt so heavy I could barely move. That&#39;s when my joints started to ache and I had piercing pain in my right knee and the bones in both hands. Then I got really dehydrated. No matter how much water I drank, it wasn&#39;t enough. Then I got chills, then a headache. It felt like I had sold my soul to Satan and he was sucking it out through my limbs, very slowly. I thought I might be an anomaly that died from a bad reaction. I tried to sleep so I wouldn&#39;t feel the pain anymore. That attempt took 3 hrs. The next day my migraine and joint soreness persisted. I felt so weak I didn&#39;t get up for hours. Thr second night I still felt unquenchingly dehydrated. Third day I only felt soreness in my arm from the actual shot.

                                                I woke up 12 hours after I got the vaccine with dizziness, nausea, chills, and joint pain. The dizziness got progressively worse (so much so I had to call into work) with the worst dizziness peaked about 18 hours post vaccine. All symptoms resolved within 36 hours post vaccine. The dizziness felt different than my chronic migraine dizziness. I was more disoriented and it was difficult to stand or walk long distances. I had to lay flat most of the day until symptoms resolved.

My fiancé experienced extreme muscle cramps to the point that he could not walk, similar symptoms to myself extreme fatigue, metallic taste, floating/fuzzies. Our symptoms began in less than an hour after receiving the vaccine. My fuzziness and neurological symptoms began in the 15 minute observation window. My fiancé is began approximately 40 minutes later. We proceeded to go home eat something small, and sleep for the next 26 hours straight

I took ibuprofen, which didn?t have much effect, followed by Tylenol 3, which relieved the pain enough that I fell asleep. By morning (7am) the fever had dispersed along with the other symptoms apart from soreness around the injection site.

Headache for 3 days (above right eye, caused some vision changes), then sore throat, cough, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, along with body aches continuing.  Currently on day 13 and still have sore throat, coughing, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, muscle aches, congestion.  Also on day 3, eczema has been building on my face/neck.  Eczema has continued to get worse each day.  when I got the shot, I communicated to the nurse, I was maybe pregnant.  it was too soon to test.  That was Friday.  I had a positive pregnancy test the following Tuesday.  I&#39;ve since taken 2 more tests that were positive and have missed my period.  So safe to say i&#39;m pregnant.

                                                I ran fever and my whole arm was sore that night and the next day and after the fever subsided, my shoulder kept hurting. It has been weeks and it is still very sore and a little swollen, which is right above where I received the injection. It is causing my shoulder to lock up, I cannot move it in certain direction or lift items at times. I have taken ibuprofen every day since then. I finally went to the doctor and they has me taking  2400 mg of prescription ibuprofen and on flexeril muscle relaxers for 2 weeks to see if I get any relief.

They prescribed sulfameth/trimethoprim 800/160mg 2x a day which didn&#39;t help anything and I went back 2 days later. The abscess had swollen to golf ball size. I also had swelling at injection site, hot, red, &amp; painful. Doxycycline 100mg. That started helping but the arm was still painful. Hidradenitis suppurativa was the diagnosis. Dermatologist says that it was caused by a autoimmune response. Armpit was injected with a steriod/lidacaine injection. I had to have wound treatment. Clindamycin lotion, 1% to help would site clean. The issue was the injection site area that took 2 weeks to resolve. It was hard, red, raised and hot. They were not sure if it was an allergy or infection. I also felt like I was in a brain fog during this.

                                                I went to the ER on 05/14/2021 because I had swelling in one ankle. I am pregnant so I was concerned. I was tested and a Deep Vein Thrombosis in my right leg. The swelling was in my left leg. There is no redness or swelling in that leg. I am taking subcutaneous injection of Lovenox 0.8 ml twice daily.  I was 27 weeks pregnant at the time.  I am currently experiencing injection site pain and I am seeing a maternal Fetal Medicine Specialist monthly. A birth plan has to made for when I deliver because of the medication.  The diagnosis states Right Popliteal and Proximal  calf DVT.  Due-Date-08-09-2021 Pregnancy-First Pregnancy

                                                The day within 10 minutes I started feeling hot and feverish. Then I started to feel lumping and cramping in my left breast and it persists and it turned in to nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. I also felt body cramping and both of breasts became extremely hard and was not comfortable. I also had muscle aches along with a mild fever for about a week. The pain was persistent. Then on day 2, the headaches started and I couldn&#39;t sleep because every time I moved the headache would cause me to vomit. So, I couldn&#39;t. My vision was blurry and I was not sure if it was due to the headache or the vaccine. I ended up going to the ER on 05/16/2021  for cramping in my left leg which was down by my ankle and was bruised. I&#39;m still experiencing heart palpitations, tiredness, cramps still happen in my breasts,  and there are still moments when my vision goes in and out.

At the time she was doing light cardio exercise including jumping jacks and lunges.    On arrival stroke scale - 3 for facial palsy, left arm drift, and mild dysarthria. CT H  demonstrated hyperdense R MCA which corresponded with a filling defect in the R MCA (M2/M3 segment) c/w thrombosis; her CTa neck was normal and there were no e/o hemorrhage. Furthermore, this same CTa showed extensive bilateral PE. An extended stroke alert was called and she was given IV tenecteplase at 1250pm and underwent thrombectomy.   2 weeks ago (6/2) she was seen in clinic for sudden onset shortness of breath, thought at that time by that clinician to be most likely exercise-induced asthma vs less likely ACS. She was advised to use her already written albuterol and had follow up in 2 days (6/4). At that time it was noted she had more SOB with exercises and increased chest tightness that were both relieved with inhaler use.   She has a family history of strokes: Maternal uncle and maternal aunt strokes in their 40s Recent surgeries/immobility/travel: No surgeries, no more than a 2 hour car ride Smoking history: Dialy cannabis smoking but no tobacco smoking Age appropriate cancer screen: Yes  Family history of cancer: breast cancer in grandmother   Baseline functional status Full IADL&#39;s and A&amp;O x4.   At time of ICU consult, temp 98, BP 140/89, HR 88, RR 18.  Patient received: intraop NS, Versed, fentanyl, tenecteplase for thrombectomy Labs notable for All labs wnl  35 y.o female with no significant PMH on OCP presented with shortness of breath and slurred speech and LUE weakness found to have acute right M1 occlusion. She underwent thrombolysis with successful recanalization. Deficits resolved. She was also found bilateral PE and non occlusive DVT. Repeat imaging stable. TTE with evidence of small PFO. Today, she is feeling well, denies shortness of breath or new neurological complaints/deficits.    1. R MCA infarct s/p TNK and thrombectomy 6/14 with no residual deficits - secondary to paradoxical embolism. Appreciate neurology recommendations. Small PFO found on TTE, appreciate cardiology evaluation for closure.  2. Bilateral PE/non occlusive DVT - mildly elevated homocysteine level. Rest of hypercoagulable workup pending. Continue heparin gtt, transition to Pradaxa with Lovenox bridging.

The hematoma grew to about 3 inches in diameter, pain and swelling associated.  Later that evening stiff neck and sharp in point headache appeared. The headache would last maybe around 10-45 seconds and then would dissipate. Headaches were sharp and frequent but did seem to resolve overnight.

I went to the emergency room and they admitted me to the hospital that night. For the next couple days I stayed in the hospital; the numbness in my face wore off however my left arm and leg  I am still getting tingly feelings and difficulty walking on the left leg.  The hospital has given me an xray, mri (contrast of my neck and brain and one without contrast) and I also took a spinal  tap yesterday. I was sent home yesterday on the evening of 7/19 after being in the hospital since 7/16 and currently awaiting results from my test to follow up with the neurologist.  I need to say this: I am very very healthy, I wake up every morning and run 6-9 miles, go to the gym in the evenings 3-4 times a week, I eat healthy, I have never had any of these symptoms or issues ever in my past until I received the vaccine. We need to get this vaccine off the market because this is not right; I am still currently week and getting tingly feelings still on my left side and have been unable to work.

By 6:30 I felt like my body was burning up on the inside but had no fever. My muscles in my neck became extremely tight and my ears aches. The injection site is extremely tender and hurts to lift my arm. As of 11 am the next day I have also added diarrhea to the list of symptoms.

Roughly 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she started to feel nauseous, develop crampy abdominal pain, and feel lightheaded. She went home and took a shower and lay down in bed. When she got up she again felt nauseous and dizzy. She threw up a total of 6 times, none of which were bloody. She had several episodes of diarrhea throughout the day. Given her ongoing symptoms she presented to the ED.   On arrival, she was febrile to 39.5C, and tachycardic to 145 with BP 98/56 and SpO2 100% on room air. She was given zofran, 1L NS, and tylenol. On repeat, her BP was 75/35 (though no longer tachycardic). She was written for 2 more liters of NS and then endorsed to medicine. Her BP improved w/ SBP in the 90s-110s with continued myalgias, headaches.

                                                The night of 3/9/21  following the vaccination I had fever, chills, sweating, severe body aches and pains (all over) and nightmares Wednesday morning I was unable to go to work and remained in bed sleeping all but approximately 2 hours in the afternoon  because I was still in pain and had headache/fever/chills/muscle and joint pain. I also had no appetite. I was awake long enough to eat one bowl of cereal and a small apple sauce cup so that I could take more meds without upsetting my stomach. Wednesday night 3/10 my temperature was still at 99.3. I was still having body soreness and headaches (sinus). Thursday morning 3/11 I still had the headache and body soreness but no more fever. I was still feeling unwell but could at least get out of bed and function. By late Thursday most of the symptoms subsided and I started feeling better. Friday morning I was no longer having symptoms.  It was the initial symptoms Tuesday night and Wednesday that concerned me the most because it hit me so severely and fast. The pharmacist warned me of possible side effects that would require over the counter medication, but in my case that did not suffice. I was physically unable to do anything but sleep which is highly unusual for me, and my entire body was in more pain than I?ve ever experienced.

But then on Monday I noticed a very tender left armpit, and I also have very itchy eyes, something I never have.  I also developed a small purple patch on my leg, and a little skin sore on my left arm.  It looks like more may be developing.

I got hot and sweaty and horrible tunnel vision, I almost fainted. I laid down on one of their medical beds to recover while the sweet nurse fanned me.  I was observed over 30 min before leaving.  I woke up yesterday and felt weird along with bodyaches, chills, joint pains, random stinging sensations throughout my body (almost like a pen prick), sporadic short headaches and muscle cramps.  I left work yesterday and didn?t even go in today.

                                                Received vaccine at noon. Injection site pain was manageable. Started to feel tired around 4pm and took 500mg Tylenol. Took an Epsom salt bath at 6:30pm. At 8pm got hit with chills, fever of 100F, entire neck and back started to ache and have pain, mild headache, and both hands and fingers felt weak and had a burning sensation. Took another 500mg Tylenol then laid down and fell asleep around 9pm. Woke up at 11pm drenched in sweat with same symptoms. Changed into dry clothes and woke up again around 3am drenched in sweat again, but fever was gone. Woke up on April 9 feeling lethargic, a tire body was achy and sore and had a headache. Fever never came back and the weakness and burnings ends ruin in hands was gone as were the chills. Throughout the day I rested and had physical therapy to loosen my muscles in my neck and back. By the end of the day I still had a headache and sore back and neck. Woke up on Sunday april 10 and back achy ness is tolerable, headache is still present, but manageable. Took 600 mg Advil in morning.

                                                Muscle aches, chills, feeling weak, feeling tired approximately 9 hours after injection. After a night of sleep, the next day I woke still with muscle aches, feeling weak and tired in the morning. I seemed fine the rest of the day and the next. Three days after injection, I felt nauseated, but unsure if this was related to the vaccine.

                                                Once my vaccine was administered I felt tingling on my tongue and bottom lip. I waited the 15 minutes and felt that the tingling was diminishing. I spoke to the tech and felt ok to leave since I was not experiencing loss of breath or swelling. After about 3 hours I noticed the tingling sensation coming back. I immediately called the pharmacist who administered the shot. After explaining the tingling was mostly felt on my lips and tongue but had no swelling and could breath and swallow just fine. I explained that it felt like when you get a shot for Dental work and that every time I touched the area it would tingle more. He told me that was not a normal reaction and would call in a few hours to check in on me. Sometime around 7 we spoke again and I still had no changes with the tingling. Again, he said he would have the pharmacist who was in call again the next day to make sure I was ok. By 11:30pm the aches in my joints started and I had chills. I woke up for work at 3:25am and noticed the tingling sensation wasn&#39;t as strong as the day before. Once I ate the tingling became more noticeable and was mostly on the right side of my tongue and throat. I also started experiencing a headache and sinus pressure. After arriving I work by 6am I felt exhausted. As the day went on the exhaustion  was becoming so strong I felt that I was fighting to keep my eyes open. The aches in my joints were becoming more intense especially in my hips and hands. At times I felt it hard to hold anything in my hand as closing my fingers became so painful it brought tears to my eyes. I also notice I was sweating profusely but had no fever. Once I was home I took a 2 hour nap. I woke up feeling the same the tingling in my mouth, aches still noticeable and headache still there. I could not stand and even tried to eat but had a loss of appetite. I called the pharmacy and reported the tingling was still noticeable. The pharmacist on duty explained the aches were normal but the tingling was not. I was advised to seek medical attention if I had trouble breathing or had swelling. The pharmacist told me to keep up on rest and fluids and I would recieve another call tomorrow to see how I was feeling. It&#39;s now 9:28pm and there are no changes to the tingling sensation in my mouth/throat. I still have aches and pains that are radiating throughout my body. My headache is still there but not as strong as this morning and I now have ringing in my ears. Every once in awhile I get some good stomach pains but they last a minute or two before going away.

A few very strong waves of nausea during fever spell, but that has gone away this morning.

                                                I got the vaccine at 4pm at the pharmacy where I work. I had no symptoms except for very mild local injection discomfort but was able to do my usual normal activities. At 2 am that evening, I woke up with  a lot of pain in my legs, I felt they were so heavy to move around in bed. My lower back was extremely painful too, I tried to stand up to walk a bit, the pain was very severe and I couldn?t stand straight, it was very hard to drag my feet, they felt very heavy and my muscled were painful to the touch even. So went back to bed, and was in agony. I had to go to work in the morning to open the store I work at until they find me coverage. Driving was very hard with my painful legs. J reached the store and I was walking very slowly, I couldn?t have a full control over my legs, they were painful waist down, and felt very heavy, when I sat down my muscles were painful wherever pressure was applied to them (from the chair).  Lightheadedness: I felt lightheaded when I woke up from bed at night to try to walk and ease the pain. So decided to go back to bed to prevent falls. At work, while walking and sitting, I had episodes of very light headidness and sat often on the floor and lifted my legs. Measured my blood pressure on 3 occasions it was 90/50  then 100/50 then 110/60. One time only I fainted where my colleagues put me down and lifted my legs.  At 8am (morning of 3/9/20201) I had a feeling of  heavy breathing. Needed to take deep breath as if my lung muscles were tired and needed to take deep breath to fill them with enough air. At work and because of the increased intensity of muscles pain, I started to breath faster and deeper coz I was in agony   Headache: severe and excruciating headache started from 6am to 12pm on 3/9/21.   Throughout the symptoms, I refused to take medications to let the vaccine run its course. My family drove me back from work coz I was weak and lightheaded and in severe pain at 10.30am. Came home, took one Advil 200mg at 11am. I was completely pain free  at 12pm. Lungs still felt weak, needed to breath deeper for two days but then got better.

                                                My right shoulder joint on the side of the shot started to hurt within a week of getting of the shot. It was very painful, and I had problems moving my arm and carrying my tools. I went to Urgent care and I have been referred to an Orthopedic specialist. I have lost the range of motion in that arm and I can?t lay down on my side. I have never had any problems since I injured that shoulder 20 years ago as a kid. I take an Aleve or Tylenol  if I need to but it does not really help with the pain.

But then by Tuesday (4/6) of the next week I started feeling pain in my right arm and then sometimes I would get the sensation of it falling asleep.  I havent felt that sensation anymore since Sunday (4/11).  By Friday (4/9) I started feeling pressure in my chest in the mornings.  I have been having these two discomforts till today.  Yesterday was the worst feeling it was morning and then all of a sudden everything went white and I was about to faint then my heart started racing so fast.  I have never experienced any of these symptoms in my life.  I am not a person that gets sick or is sick of something.

It lasted about 24 hours. LEG PAIN:  About 5 hours after my vaccine, both legs were very sore/painful.  Both legs have been sore every day since the vaccine. Pain/discomfort is worse in both calves than in upper leg. Pain/discomfort is least in the morning when I wake up. It gets worse throughout the day and with movement.  After 15 minute walk, my calves are tingling/crampy. I get some relief by laying down and putting my legs up the wall.

I also had  intense joint pain from my upper leg all the way to my right ankle.  I also experienced nausea along with my headache.  An  ultrasound of the right groin was performed to check any clots in my right leg. The doctor who saw me prescribed Emetrex for the headaches and there has been no follow up since then.  I still have a headache today but is a lot less in intensity.

                                                Patient had a reaction immediately after the JJ vaccine. Patient passed out for 10-15seconds, her body stiffened up, she felt hot and then cold and started sweating excessively. Patients eyes closed briefly and then opened. Patient then became conscious and was unware what had happened.  Patient is not on any medication and had not eaten all morning. After administering the vaccine a small amount of blood came out. I gave her a cotton ball to apply on the area and to hold. After 20-30 seconds she said she felt faint and hot all of a sudden. Her body then went limp and her eyes began to close. Her body then stiffened up for a few seconds. After shouting her name a few times she regained consciousness and was able to talk. she didn&#39;t realize what had happened. Her body was fine again but she had urinated during the episode.  Upon speaking to the patient I learnt that she was nervous about the vaccination and she had felt dizzy in the past when giving blood. I observed the patient over the next 45 minutes. Her speech was fine, she was still a little light headed. She was in her seat for 40 minutes, then I asked her to stand and to move a little to see how she was. She was able to walk a bit but then sat down as she still felt light headed. She than sipped on water and continued talking and seemed to get some energy back.

                                                Pain in right shoulder blade that radiated to chest and tingling in finger.  Went to ER around 4/17/21- d diner was done and was not elevated. Followed up with doctor a couple days later.  With same symptoms and more back pain. EKG Showed a slight inversion. Blood work including Troponin, liver, and platelet count all came back normal. Tried to work out but felt like I injured myself after only 10 sit-ups. This pain still exists. My anxiety grew like nothing I have ever experienced. Pain in my ankles, both feet began about a week later. Stress test done on May 4 with normal results. Followed up with doctor on May 5 for ankle pain and hip pain. Blood work tested Inflammation, Autoimmune, Rheumatoid, Thyroid all came back normal. Another d dimer came back elevated at. 65. Was prescribed buspirone for anxiety. Had a CT Scan and Venus Doppler- all came back clear. I still have pain in rib area where I feel like a pulled something. I am afraid to exercise, I still have pain in back and side. Will follow up with one more d dimer then hematologist if still elevated.

                                                After the second day of receiving the vaccine, I have pain in my arm, my nevers are tense, pain has spread to the back and down the sciatic nerve. I also have a lot of joint pain in my arm where I received the vaccine and back of my knee. I had therapy to improve the pain but it is still going on and I had to stop working because of the pain. Also, I had allergy for two weeks and lost of smell and taste, I was tested for covid and it came out negative.

                                                I started getting fatigued and achy around 5 pm. By 6 pm I started to feel chilled and a fever began to form. By 6:30 or so I was shaking intensely and my fever was climbing quickly. By 8 pm I had a fever of 102.7 F. I took two Advil around 7 pm. My fever stayed that high for less than an hour, but it stayed at around 101.5 throughout the night. When I wok up at 6:30 it was still over 101. It took until early afternoon to go all the way back down to my normal temperature of 97.6 (that has been my normal temperature throughout the pandemic). I had a pounding headache throughout the night (with a fever) and for most of the next day. Today, on the 3/8, I will have some joint and muscle achiness. The most intense aching was in my hips and low back. FYI, I am marking that I have recovered from my adverse reaction in the field below because I am considering the high fever and intense headache and bod aches to have been the adverse reaction. My mild aching right now would not have been worth reporting.

Fever was between 100-102 for about 48 hours from symptom onset, and had significant joint pain in all joints, but especially knees. Major fatigue but unable to sleep because of intensity and discomfort of symptoms. Outbreak of new aphthous ulcers in mouth. Contacted physician to ask if I could take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower fever and get relief from joint pain - was advised both were safe to use. Took acetaminophen.

I put an ice pack on my head because it feels swollen and there?s a lot of pressure that it?s painful. This morning I tried to eat crackers so I could take ibuprofen but I threw up immediately. I?m currently still experiencing a lot of head pain/ache and nausea and muscle tightness.

Had about a  2 second warning that I was going to faint. I felt perfectly fine prior to fainting.  After fainting where I was unconscious for 15 seconds, I was dizzy.  Today (4/4/21) - I am very tired and weak and have lower neck pain due to fall.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

                                                After the shot, when I was waiting in the monitoring lot, I felt intense pain in my arm and it made my muscles tense all through my neck. I also got dizzy and lightheaded. The girl in the car next to me had waved over one of the attendants as well because she was feeling weird too. I got home and had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had and felt flu like symptoms and very weak. The next day at work I was so sick I had to go home. I was puking and had diarrhea  over and over for a few hours. I also felt lightheaded and dizzy and weak. Also had the headache. I was getting chills as well once I got home. Today I just feel very weak and just &#34;off&#34;.

About 10 minutes after the shot, she came back to the pharmacy and reported she was not feeling right.  She was extremely tired, weak, and dizzy.  She was told to sit down for further observation and given a bottle of water.  About 5 minutes later, she said she was still feeling really bad.  She said she was not thinking clearly and didn&#39;t feel right. She was also experiencing moderate pain down her spine.  She said her thinking was so affected that she wanted to seek treatment.   Patient declined offer to call EMS, and proceeded to an urgent care clinic next door.  Urgent care later called the pharmacy to inform us that patient had been transported to the hospital by ambulance.

These effects lasted for two hours, then I had anxiety and trouble sleeping for rest of night.  The headache carried on into the morning and became severe. Upon taking Advil, the pain drastically decreased. I had a mild headache, along with fatigue, a little queasy after eating and an unpleasant spacey/dizzy/heady feeling for the rest of the day.  By morning of the 9th, all effects ceased.

I felt a little nauseous, and my gut was upset. I had chills, fever, and then began to have painful muscle aches on my backside. My sleep was significantly disrupted - I woke up at midnight two nights in a row after my fever broke, then had disrupted sleep the whole rest of the night, waking up at least once an hour, the second night in significant pain from muscle aches. I didn&#39;t feel well enough to get out of bed for about 40 hours, would get chills if I got up for more than a couple minutes. I began to feel better second morning after symptoms began, took two Tylenol, then improved  rapidly  with no further side effects.

It became visibly swollen over the day and unable to turn my head without extreme pain. The lymph node in the area is extremely tender and warm to the touch. Around 5:30 a rash started occuring on the neck where it is swollen.  All of this is occuring on the opposite side of where the injection was given.  No other side effects have been noticed through out the days after the injection until today.

At 6:30pm I began to have uterine/abdominal cramping, vaginal pain, lower back pain. At 7:30 I began to feel extremely overheated and a little fatigued. At 9:00pm I felt chills, extreme fatigue, all over body ache and joint pain. At about 2:00 am overnight I again felt extremely overheated. The following morning I continued to feel fatigue, abnormal temperature swings, body ache and joint pain. This lasted until night (about 30/36 hours after the injection). About 48 hours after the injection, I felt some dizziness and abdominal upset.

(not sure if this is still there) Did not miss work due to these side effects.

                                                Within 5 minutes I started to have flank pain on the rightside. Was having a panic attack so couldn&#39;t breathe well. Flank pain started spreading to my side and mid to lower back. Then it started in the left side. Then it went across my whole mid back and got extremely stiff. Part of my top lip is numb. Over 4 hours and I still can&#39;t breathe properly despite the use of my anti anxiety medicine hours ago. Neck pain. Legs walking in slow motion no matter how hard I tried to push them. Hyperventilating after coughing 2 or 3 separate times. Shooting pain in my back when I lay down. Can&#39;t catch my breath laying down.

I was unable to sleep due to the pain and around 2am it became severe to the point of being unbearable. Standing would relieve the pressure enough so i attempted to remain standing as tolerable. I also had severe lower back pain that made it difficult to walk. These symptoms remained until apx 3pm the day following the vaccine (4/8/21).

Was prescribed decreasing dose of prednisone. This was the morning of the 15th. As the day went on my thighs (both, very high up near groin) started aching. Uncomfortable to walk or sit for long periods. Getting worse as today, the 16th, has gone on. My hips are very achy and sore today. Hives have finally subsided.

                                                April 7, my husband &amp; I got the shot. Same night, we started feeling chills, fever, muscle pain, fatigue, headache all at one time gradually increasing throught the day. Only in the eve, we could contact our physician &amp; advised to take paracetomol( acetominophen)  and we took three doses with 4 hrs interval. The next day eve, we came to normalcy with our regular work, less tiredness, less muscle ache, less headache (not fully gone)and fever stopped. After 3rd day- april 9th till today there are no side effects mild or adverse seen in us. Still due to recent reports/news about J&amp;J, we would like to stay vigilant for next 2months.. Hence, wanted to voulntarily report or update on our experience of the shots

Patient reported to ED provider that using ibuprofen nearly relieves headache and makes her functional and had the most improvement the day she visited the ED prior to her visit. Patient received a CT scan of the head without contrast that was unremarkable. Patient was diagnosed with headache and neck sprain and was prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours, and diazepam 5 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times a day as needed for muscle spasm. 2021-04-12 - patient developed left lower extremity pain 2021-04-14 - patient followed up with Neurologist outpatient as directed by ED provider and was advised to get an MRV and left lower extremity doppler.

Upon examination, there is subtle swelling to left lower extremity and doppler revealed multiple DVTs in left lower extremity. CT head without contrast was unremarkable, however, CT venogram of the brain reveals thrombi of the right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinuses, as well as IJ. Patient was initiated on argatroban and admitted to inpatient at the time of this report. &#34;Heparin induced platelet antibody&#34; and &#34;lupus anticoagulant evaluation&#34; tests are ordered and pending.

                                                The evening I got headaches, chills, muscle, loss of smell and taste. The third day I woke up with swelling like hives and rash around my right eye. I took 10mg of Claritin. The hives spread around the back of my neck and the rest of my body over the course of the morning. Within a few hours it had spread to my chest and my throat felt like it was closing. I had taken Benadryl but it didn&#39;t seem to help. I was also fatigued but had no shortness of breath. I had not eaten anything before the hives started. It had been 48 hours after the shot that I was in the Emergency Room, the hives started around 36 hours. I was given Epinephrine 3mg, Prednisone and Famotidine and given steroids for a few days. I have not had any problems since the first three days after the ER visit.

I was given Pepcid, Benadryl and an Epi. I was released after a few hours and I went home and slept for two days. The guy that gave me the shot must have hit a bone and I was in pain for weeks. I am still experiencing some issues from it. My doctor has me stretching every morning due to my shoulder feeling tight. She says it could be a nerve issue.

                                                I was diagnosed with Lupus at 10 years old and experienced many symptoms between ages 10-20. In my early 20&#39;s, my symptoms lessened and I had not had a flare in over 15 years.  The first day after vaccination, mild soreness in my left arm...no big deal, just a vaccine.  By the third day after my vaccination, I realized I was having pain in multiple joints, left wrist, hand and shoulder.  As the days passed, the pain and swelling in my joints continued and spread throughout my entire body.  I tried to wait in out in hopes the issues would resolve themselves.  Finally, after 6 weeks, I realized I was having a flare and made an appointment with my doctor who said she had other autoimmune patients experience the same thing but since it had been so long, she could prescribe steroids (which I had used during other lupus flares in my childhood) and that should resolve things.  I have since had 4 rounds of steroids of varying doses and am on hydroxychloroquine but, as soon as the steroid round ends, the pain and swelling increase again.  I cannot open bottles, have difficulty sleeping due to pain, cannot perform many of my duties at work and am overall able to do minimal physical activity.  My knuckles have turned into dimples and my fingers are 2 ring sizes larger than normal.  Prescriptions listed below.  This is the most expensive free vaccine I&#39;ve ever received and also has had the most negative impact.  I sincerely hope we can stop the Lupus which remained dormant for the last 15 years before vaccination.  This has the potential to have major long term health impacts.  4/29/21: 20mg prednisone for 4 days, 10 mg for 3 days 5/10/21: 20mg prednisone for 4 days, 10 mg for 3 days 5/28/21: 40mg prednisone for 5 days 6/8/21: 5mg prednisone for 14 days

                                                The vaccine administrator didn&#39;t listen when I told him he stuck the needle into the wrong place, and proceeded to insert the injection despite my protest. I felt an immense pressure in my shoulder, and the sensation of something cold trickling down my arm. The administrator was standing over me during this process while I sat in a metal chair and I&#39;m not sure he wanted to even touch me. My fiance and I received the shot together, however only he experienced a slight fever. I only experienced increasing pain when moving my arm. No other health changes. The pain was immediate and progressively got worse.  My primary care provider assessed me, and agreed that the injection was indeed pumped into my shoulder joint, instead of the muscle. My PCP is also worried about the efficacy of the vaccination, and whether or not absorption was successful. There is possible rotator cuff damage, and chronic pain when performing NECESSARY routine daily activities. I&#39;ve been ordered on pain medication, as well as physical therapy and have been advised that many vaccine related shoulder injuries never heal, or require surgery.

                                                Tuesday, June 8, 2021 - J&amp;J 1-dose COVID-19 vaccine administered at 12:45 pm During injection - immediate pain at left shoulder injection site. Extreme throbbing and burning sensation; felt like being stabbed with a hot rod. Was advised by pharmacist to move around and ?shake it off? - indicated that was common feedback for the vaccines.  Injection triggered an underlying sense of anxiety - hard to explain, because have never experienced anxiety issues, but felt body going into ?flight or fight? mode. Has had this feeling since; with no prior experience or conditions pre-vaccine. Experiences daily and sometimes comes on in stronger bouts.  4:00 pm  lower &amp; mid back pain. Severe muscle aches. These symptoms lasted for ~7 days. Worsening from onset for the first ~48 hours. 4:30-5:20 pm Extreme fatigues. Initial bout of narcolepsy. No prior condition or tendency, this has since occurred daily post-vaccine with immediate, rapid onset. Daily bouts last from ~20 minutes - ~2 hours per day, with time of day varying. Even after a full (8&#43; hours) nights rest; patient still becomes narcoleptic.  Has negatively affected patient?s life &amp; ability to sustain their pre-vaccine lifestyle routine. 8:15 pm start of a headache, which lasts ~3 days. It feels like a migraine with similar symptoms. Patient has a history of migraines, is very familiar with the symptoms. 8:17 pm extreme back pain. Feels like someone is stabbing burning knife in mid-back (isolated spot, just to left of spine) - comes on very sudden &amp; intense for a minute or so, then goes away. This happened a couple times in the following ~20 minutes.  Wednesday, June 9, 2021 5:22 woke up - hard to move (literally unable to get limbs to respond), entire body aches, back feels like it?s thrown out, did not sleep well, experienced a subconscious sense of anxiety throughout night; hot and dizzy and very nauseous. 5:50 am finally able to physically get out of bed, very painful to move, every muscle aches and feels like it?s seizing, even holding the phone hurts. Could barely make it 20 feet to the kitchen, almost passed out, had to go lay down again. Could not remain standing, too dizzy and nauseous. Started to rapidly get light headed. Went to lay down for a few minutes again.  6:00 am returned to the kitchen, but could not remain standing, so had to drink some water while sitting on the floor. Feeling miserable &amp; am unable to remain standing without being about to pass out. Even sitting upright is a challenge.  6:10 am experienced the equivalent of a hot flash, extremely dizzy &amp; nauseous had to lay down on kitchen floor tile to avoid passing out. Laid on tile floor in a puddle of sweat 6:30 am sudden onset of chills - could not stop shivering. Crawled to couch to lay down with a blanket - Inside temp is ~79F, should not be cold. Laid shivering under blanket for 5 hours, experienced extreme fatigue and passed out for ~5 hours. Challenges thermal regulating the next ~48 hours (alternating between hot / cold, but not to those extremes). Difficulty standing and being upright for ~36 hours, frequent lightheaded sensation. Extreme fatigue with rapid onset narcolepsy for ~4 days after - only being able to stay awake for a few hours at a time. The rapid onset narcolepsy has lingered and still occurs daily, but typically only lasts 20-120 minutes in total duration at a random interval each day (no existing pattern or triggers). Sense of anxiety and dread also has occurred daily since - lingering symptom that has no pre-existing conditions; has triggered stress eating, bouts of extreme introversion, pulling away and other negative  subconscious coping mechanisms. Both these lingering symptoms are extremely concerning to the patient, have occurred daily for a month now, and have negatively impacted the quality of their life &amp; relationships, personal/work.

                                                I got the vaccine, and within a couple of days, I started having chills, fatigue, nausea, muscle and body aches, and headaches. It got continually worse, and I eventually developed a migraine, blurred vision, tingling, severe nose bleeds, weakness (like peripheral neuropathy). The symptoms all got worse and worse, and I eventually went to the neurologist. They did a CT venogram; the results were normal. The BP was elevated, and they noted I had a really high heart rate. My blood work had abnormalities on the CBC and metabolic panels. I was sent back to my PCP and he found abnormal results in my blood work, plus he found abnormalities in the test for thyroid stimulating hormone. I still had elevated BP. A PCR COVID test was done, and I tested negative. They also tested for antibodies to see if I was responding to the vaccine; no antibodies were detected. They said it was weird and that I probably had lingering vaccine side effects that would go away, and in case the COVID test was wrong, I was advised to self-isolate. They plan to conduct further thyroid tests and blood work in the future to see if there are any changes. I am still having all the symptoms, and on 7/13/2021, I developed symptoms that are consistent either kidney stones or kidney infection. I plan to see my doctor to have this looked into.

                                                Hours after the shot was administered, The lower half of my body started to freeze up. By the time I woke up the next morning, I was in so much pain it was very difficult to walk. Starting from my hips (bilaterally) down to my feet were inflamed and my muscles started to knot up and made it very difficult to walk or touch.  I went to urgent care 36 hours after the shot when I noticed I broke out in a full-body rash and still had difficulty walking. From there they gave me a covid test, took pictures of my rash, and gave me predniSONE. Once on that, I started to feel a bit better and went on with my daily workouts for the next two weeks. Then at week 3 of getting the shot my legs bilateral were unstable where wabbly and inflamed again. I had to hold onto countertops to walk or my legs would give out. This is when I went to my primary care.  From there they said to just rest and I may just be having a bad reaction. I took time off of work to rest and hope that they would get better, but after another 3 weeks went by and nothing got better, it got worse, I went to the hospital. They did an ultrasound to make sure there were no blood clots. That came back negative and they referred me to a neurologist who denied my visit. So now I am in the same amount of pain with no answers.  To this day nothing has changed, I am just trying to get though my days in pain.

I spoke to a doctor through phone who confirmed these aren&#39;t normal side effects from the vaccine.

Few hours later developed typical &#34;flu like symptoms&#34;.  Next day woke up and both arms, hands, legs and feet and side of face had pins and needles and felt numb. Heart rate sky rocketed and went to ER. Felt like I was going to pass out.  Took blood work at hospital and doctors reassured that the feeling should come back in my legs and arms. When I left  6 hours later my legs were still pins and needles and my joints began to hurt.  A week later and this feeling continues to come and go, but is not consistent.  My joints still randomly hurt and I am an active 38 year old with three kids.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of receiving the injection I experienced pain and numbness in my left arm down through my hand. These symptoms are consistent with what I experience during a migraine. Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine the pain expanded to my neck and face on the left side, soon after followed by a mild headache.   Over the course of the day, within a couple of hours of vaccination, my headache remained mild but expanded to a general head pain that wasn?t confined to just one location. Also around this time I began experiencing neck muscle soreness and became very tired.  It is now approximately 10 hours post vaccination and I still have a mild headache. Migraine symptoms still present but not as notable. I feel run down, tired, an overall sense of malaise, and have full body mild muscle soreness.  No medications or treatments used so far to treat these symptoms.

EMS was called, she was evaluated.  She was not transported and was released to go home after evaluation and complete resolution of her symptoms. I spoke with her today, she states she had a similar episode after her nasal piercing 2 years ago and she believes related to anxiety.  She states other than arm soreness and muscle aches today, no other symptoms persist.

A few hours after, I felt flushed and slightly feverish with generalized body aches. 6-7 hours after the vaccine, I experienced extreme fatigue, extremely high fever that registered as &#34;err&#34; consecutively on the thermometer numerous times (min of 5 times checked), severe headache, worsening body aches, left flank pain, GI upset with nausea, congestion, dizziness and many heart palpitations. The high fever broke around 11pm and my temp was 102 when checked then and I was drenched in sweat. The fever continued to decrease throughout the next 12 hours. The extreme fatigue, severe headache, dizziness , GI upset and nausea continued throughout the day Saturday and most of Sunday.  I also experienced burning in my chest that radiated into both shoulders, anterior/posterior neck and between both shoulder blades in my back all day Saturday. The burning has decreased over this past week, but I am still experiencing it with some exertion, but not consistently.  Fatigue continues some and SOB at random times.

My stomach hurt, I was nauseated. I went through hot &amp; cold sweats &amp; chills. I got really light headed &amp; disoriented. I began to get a fever.  I felt far from flu symptoms. My heart was racing. I had to get into my shower repeatedly &amp; just lay. I cried. I dont recommend this to anyone! It has been 2 days &amp; i am still experiencing symptoms. I read the fact sheet for the Janssen shot. I am going to get a check up by a doctor. I feel like I am having an allergic reaction. I never felt so much pain in my life; my side effects are far from the flu symptoms.

                                                5.5 hours after getting the vaccine, I had chills (guessing I had a fever) body aches, a headache, joint pain, muscle pain, skin pain, nausea, I was exhausted, felt very emotional (felt like crying), had the constant feeling like I needed to stretch, and I could not get comfortable or lay still. At one point my fever broke, I woke up at 245 am drenched in sweat. The symptoms previously stated all came back about 255 am. I could not get comfortable or sleep but was extremely exhausted.  I tossed and turned getting tiny naps here and there until I got out of bed at 8 am (4/8/2021), I was again drenched in sweat, tired, had a headache,  was nauseous and food sounded horrible. I could not move around much because of joint/muscle pain and would get random bouts of chills. I had to just lay down all day but was never hungry and  did not eat again until that night around 7pm. On 4/9/2021 I woke up at 630am drenched in sweat I was still tired and could not exert myself (just going downstairs made me have to stop and catch my breath) throughout the day I would get random nerve pain in the elbow  and forearm of the shot arm. This morning I woke up with the shot site hurting worse, a headache, still tired and drenched in sweat (it was 40 degrees in my house and i had a thin blanket covering me). My appetite is back today but still cannot exert myself.

                                                I had period like cramping, sever muscle cramps everywhere I ever had an injury in my life hurt. It get like the day after a car accident. Starting at 8 hrs after the vaccine was administered. When I breastfeed my baby for 36 hours after it felt like razor blades when the milk passed through my nipples and I had clogged ducts. Normally it is not painful and I don?t experience clogs. I got temporary relief soaking in Epsom salts in a hot bath. Even in the hot bath my nipples wouldn?t flatten or go smooth. I?ve never experienced a totally body reaction like this. It really get like every pain receptor that ever had activated reactivated. After 6 hours it subsided and I felt fatigued. During this time my temp was 102.5 I had a fever for 8 hrs. The second day at hour 28 the muscle aches returned but not as bad. While I don?t have a temperature I still feel warm and flushed and had trouble sleeping the second night my back is still sore.

                                                I have many allergies and adverse events from prior vaccines, so I took a Benadryl before the injection. I was very pleased nothing detrimental happened at the time. My head and neck were a little itchy but went away, some dizzyness but went away, all after about an hour. The arm didn&#39;t blow up like usual.  That night, I started to experience the usual vaccine side effects i.e. headache, feverish, sweating, joint aches. All this I expected starting around 8:45 -9pm.   At about 10 - 10:30 pm, I began to have abdomen pain/pelvic pain... I started feeling like I was getting period cramps and lower intestinal discomfort. I just had my period though, so it didn&#39;t make sense (about 7 -10 days ago). I am also on the pill so I know for a fact I just had it and started a new pack. I was very confused and thought it was odd...can&#39;t be, maybe it would go away.   I woke up about 3am with intense uterus/period cramps which kept me up, in and out of sleep. About 5am I felt like I had my period (fluid down there), went to the bathroom and indeed, I was bleeding... a lot. The cramps continued, the bleeding continued and now 6 days later it is finally going away. I never get head aches and my head has continued to hurt on and off also.

Numbness lasted about an hour. 40-50 minutes post vaccine nausea would come and go. 4 hours post vaccine the typical flu-like symptoms began: extreme fatigue, mild headache, muscle weakness, painful skin, lack of appetite.

                                                Starting about 6 hours after administration I developed a headache and low grade fever around 100.1. I was ill that night and still feeling tired the following day and feverish. My left knee, which I had previously had a lateral meniscus transplant with a cadaver graft, starting swelling up and becoming increasingly uncomfortable. By Wednesday the 17th, I could barely put weight on the leg and the pain level had increased to 6/10, with 10 being the worst pain. This knee had previously been on a positive healing trajectory since my surgery. By Wednesday night, I couldnt put weight on it and pulled out the crutches to walk (I had been off of them since early February). I was dealing with a family emergency so did not have the capacity to deal with it at the time. Thursday morning, the 18th, all of my joints started becoming painful. I chalked this up to vaccine reaction. I was still fatigued and the knee was still extremely sensitive and couldn&#39;t bear weight. Friday and Friday night my joints became visible swollen and were so painful I was crying trying to find a comfortable sleeping position. I couldn&#39;t put any pressure on my shoulders for sleeping, the neck was stiff and tight, my hands and feet were visibly swollen with fluid and I couldnt even lift a cup due to the painful, enlarged finger joints. Every joint in my body seemed effected. Saturday morning I called my doctor who determined it was due to the vaccine and it seemed my immune system was attacking my joints. I was prescribed 40mg of predinsone in a 8 day taper. By 24 hours, the pain had receeded to a normal level of ache and I could put some pressure on my left leg again. By 48 hours after starting steroids, the swelling was reduced and I started to feel more normal. I have no history of autoimmune disorders or previous rhematoid issues.

This lasted 2 days.  Muscle pain  was the worst down the spine and at injection site, but persisted for 7 days! Joint pain worsened in hands particularly. Had to take anti inflammatory medication to alleviate it at day 6.  Still taking medication, so unsure if this is over.

                                                Severe throbbing left leg pain that awakened me from sleep and kept me awake for a few hours. Every 1-2 minutes my left leg would experience severe shooting pain and my knee would bend and jolt.

                                                * Arm was very sore for about the first 10 minutes.  Moving it reduced it pretty quickly and was no worse than a minor ache for most of the next day or so. * Had a mild headache before the shot (believe due to not having had caffeine that day yet) * At about 6 pm on 4/10, lost appetite due to mild nausea (just enough to not want to eat but not enough to vomit) * At about this time I noticed I also started to feel a little winded, akin to walking just briskly enough that you have to breath harder than if you&#39;re just sitting / resting.  It did not get any worse than this however, so I opted to keep a close eye and see if it eased (which it would by end of Sunday, 4/11) * At about 8:30 pm on 4/10, noticed I felt warm, had a fever between 100.4 to 100.8 * Also around 8:30 pm I noticed that pain I normally feel from my herniated discs and pinched nerves (L4/L5 L5/S1) just ACHED and was more painful than normal. * Started feeling tired (I&#39;m usually up until around 1-2 am, and I was ready to go to bed by 9pm on 4/10)  Also felt a little forgetful / hard to concentrate on anything * When I went to bed, I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to the white light from my monitor.  This is usually a sign of a painless migraine with auras that essentially blind me for about a half hour.  I did not have auras, though my headache was steadily getting worse to the point I suspect it might have actually been a migraine) * At about 12:30 am on 4/11, the headache got to the point where I could no longer ignore it (best I can describe is it felt like someone was trying to peel my skull of like you would an orange) so I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen.  I also by this point had a fever of 102, though it would drop to 100.5 or so within a few minutes of taking the Ibuprofen. * At about this point the arm starting aching a lot more, I assume because I wasn&#39;t using it while sleeping.  It felt like someone had punched me multiple times hard in the same spot. * I felt much better on the morning of 4/11.  However as the day continued I felt more and more tired.  My temperature was higher than normal but very mild; it stayed around 99.8 for most of the day that I took it.  By Monday, 4/12 I felt mostly fine aside from my arm aching worse than it did when I first got the shot.  Now on 4/14 its pretty much no longer achy.

My left hand experienced the same shooting pain followed by tingling in my fingers. My right arm them experienced the same pain and tingling. I then began to sweat, get dizzy and felt like fainting. I have had pain and tingling in my hands and feet ever since, along with sensitivity. I also have pain in my joints and legs similar to what I imagine arthritis would feel like. I also have throbbing chest pain and pain in my legs since vaccination.

I have an IUD in place (placed in December 2017).  The first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine,  I had mild symptoms of headache, low grade fever and aches from the neck up. 2 days after receiving my vaccine, my period began and continued as a light period until April 14, 2021.  I continued with headaches in the temporal region and experienced light headedness and blurred vision throughout the day (still continues as of today 4/19/21). I went to my primary physician on 4/15/21 and was sent for labs (CBC, CMP, and TSH level), an EKG (after hearing an irregular heart rhythm), and a MRI of my brain. All of my labs and MRI were reported as normal. My EKG showed occasional PVC&#39;s.

                                                Around 1am Tuesday, April 6th (the day after the vaccination), developed acute onset fever (Tm 102), chills, extreme muscle aches, profound malaise/fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea.  Those symptoms lasted about 24 hours and, by midday Wednesday, she was back to her baseline of intermittent dry cough, shortness of breath, and no smell or taste.  It wasn&#39;t until Sunday, two days ago, that she developed sharp, pinpoint right superior parietal scalp pain that, after a few doses of OTC Aleve, did somewhat improve.  Other than two 220 mg OTC Aleve tabs twice daily, she has not been taking anything else for her symptoms other than prescribed asthma/allergy meds. She states that her shortness of breath has been helped from the use of albuterol as needed.  Unfortunately, the Aleve has not helped with her chest pain, which she describes as a &#34;constant ache.&#34;  Initially, patient had some pleurisy, but that has apparently cleared up.     No history of CVT, PE, and she does not smoke or take oral contraceptives.

Overnight the bump got a bit smaller and the bruise expanded. Over the next several days the bump kept diminishing. The bruise remained about the same size and kept getting darker. It?s been one week now and the bump is very tiny (size of a small pea), and the bruise is incredibly dark, but showing more of a healing process color.

                                                About one hour after my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced dizziness. I took a shower and felt chills all over my body and back pain as well. I then  went to sleep and my head started to hurt. My head pain grew in intensity and I felt dizzy. At about 7pm, I started vomiting profusely because of my headaches. I then went to urgent care because I am also diabetic and was worried of how I was feeling. At the urgent care they gave me Paracetamol and nausea medication. My headaches lasted 3-4 days then they went away. Also since I was on my third day of my menstrual cycle at the time of my J&amp;J vaccine, my menstrual cycle got irregular and lasted 5 days longer than my usual 3 days.

                                                About a week after being vaccinated I started experiencing bad headaches, chest pains and pains in my leg. I went to the emergency department at Hospital to get checked out. They took blood and I had a high d dimer test result. They did an Ultrasound of both legs, and a CT with contrast of the lungs and a CT of the head. No blood clots were evident at the time. Over the next couple of weeks my left leg has continued to swell and hold fluid. On 5-11-2021 I had another ultrasound of the left leg again to rule out a possible blood clot. Again they did not find anything. After reviewing blood work from a coag profile all results were elevated but not worrisome per the dr. I continie to have more swelling in the left lower extremity, muscle aches and pains in that leg along with more busted blood vessels. I have experienced pains in places that I have never had before. Example a sharp pain started around my left pelvic area and shot up to the left shoulder and then burned for several minutes.

As the days passed I started getting worst and worst I was loosing mobility in my body my husband had to take me to the restroom. On 04/06/2021 is when I went to the Emergency Room. When I got to the hospital I could not breath my ribs hurt a lot &amp; I had horrible back pain. They put me oxygen and gave me fluids but they said I had to get transfer to another hospital and they transferred me on an ambulance. In the other hospital us where they transferred me they kept poking my stomach when I asked them why they kept poking it they told me that it was to stop the blood cloths. I was hospitalized for 5 days. When I was sent home I was still not feeling good I was feeling sick still I&#39;ve been trying to recover slowly but I am not the same. I&#39;m still in a lot of pain I can&#39;t move my arms because of how much it hurts my back keeps hurting a lot as well. I want to go back to normal to how I was I can&#39;t do anything I can&#39;t even cook for my kids. I now have depression.

Sever periods of chills followed by sweating and feeling hot. Nausea, headache. Took Excedrin, Aleve and tums. Worst of the symptoms subsided by 24 hrs post vaccine administration. Slight nausea and headache still persists at time of filling this report out. I feel it&#39;s important to note that I had COVID in December and feel the adverse reactions were due to having sufficient antibodies against COVID. Perhaps it shpuld be recommended that people get antibody titers to determine if the vaccine is necessary as is done to determine if HepB boosters are necessary.

It was a bad headache on left side of head. I was just not feeling well. On the 19th day, it went away. I still from time to time I do still feel pain in the head on the left side. I had a lot of tightness in my left leg. In  previous years, I have had blood clot in my leg and after birth in my stomachs - so with the pain in calf I called a doctor and went. They did a visual. After a lump appearing in my leg, an ultrasound was scheduled. I went  Urgent care on May 10 - she ordered an ultrasound but her office didn&#39;t ever follow up with me. On 17th, I saw my Primary care and she sent me straight to get an Ultrasound - on the 18th, it revealed I had a blood clot.

When I couldn&#39;t take it anymore, I called my doctor and I asked for an x-ray.  I had physical therapy. Was referred to Spinal specialist  - did some alignment- have had a bone x-ray and an actual scoliosis x-ray - will find out results on July 15th. I have never felt the lower back pain before - the every day pain on the lower back. On the tailbone area. Right now, I&#39;m doing exercises and Dr. will do some more alignment on my back.

                                                I experienced heel pain and then a swollen bruise on the side of my left leg, which radiated heat. I had internal thigh pain and left side groin pain. I made a doctor&#39;s appointment. There was a concern that it may be a blood clot. I had an ultrasound and took blood tests. I was diagnosed with having an inflamed vein called phlebitis. Since the diagnosis, I&#39;ve been experiencing severe uneasy bruising. Pain in the leg has subsided, but I am still dealing with some bruising.

                                                After receiving my Covid 19, Johnson and Johnson, shot in my left arm, on 7-13-21 ,I got observed for 15 min and then i was told i was okay to leave. As soon as i stood up from sitting down, my left hip started to hurt. It was a sharp deep pain. I was able to walk with a limp for a couple of days, and then the pain became so intense in my groin area and hip area on the left side,  i could no longer use my left leg because of the pain , and was taken to Urgent care on 7-15-21, was seen, and was told that the Covid shot was probably causing the pain in my hip and groin  because of the inflammation that the shot causes , and it was my body thinking I actually had covid, which i didn&#39;t, but because of the shot, my body thought so. No medication was prescribe, was told if the pain hasn&#39;t gone away within 3 days to return to the urgent care, or emergency room. Well the pain kept getting worse and by 7-19-21,I was no longer able to put any pressure on my left leg,  so I was taken to the emergency room, where they gave me a shot of pain medicine in my top right thigh, and given Robaxin 500mg to help with the pressure in my groin and hip. They also did an ultrasound in the groin area and found no blood clots.  Also in the last week my nose on the left side is swollen and tender, never had any issues with my nose before the shot, nor my hip or groin in that much pain until the shot.

                                                Janssen covid-19 vaccine EUA  Aside from injection site pain, about 12 hours after receiving the shot, at 12pm Tuesday, I had a headache, muscle aches, and chills with a temperature of 99 degrees. It subsided with Tylenol but returned as it wore off. On Wednesday morning my temperature was 100 degrees.

                                                Upon injection into the right arm, blood started to pour out of the injection site. Bleeding stopped once the nurse administered pressure. There were no immediate side effects present, other than soreness at the injection site. Approximately 17 hours after the vaccination, the following symptoms started: nausea, malaise, fever (102.3), chills, headache, and lower back pain. The onset of side effects was intense and required that I immediately stop what I was doing and rest.

                                                I started experiencing flu-like symptoms at around 5 PM on 3/14/21.  I was feverish and had chills, muscle aches, and a headache.  I had very strong chills for a few hours and then I noticed that my resting heart rate was around 128 bpm at around 1:30 AM on 3/15/21.  I was running a 100.6 fever at that time.  My fever subsided in the morning and the headache persisted throughout the day, and I was very tired as I did not get much sleep the night before.  I did not work that day (Monday, 3/15).  At the time I was about 7 weeks pregnant.  I noticed some very light spotting later in the day on 3/15, and then I continued spotting on 3/16.  I consulted a midwife at the  facility at 4 PM on 3/16/21 and took a blood test to measure my hCG hormone levels.  The following day, 3/17, I received the results that I had a normal level of hCG hormone and normal hemoglobin levels.  As the day continued, the spotting turned into bleeding, and eventually the bleeding became heavy starting around 4 PM.  I received an ultrasound on 3/18/21 at 8 AM and later spoke with a midwife from facility at 11 AM that day, confirming that there was no viable pregnancy detected via ultrasound.  I had lost quite a bit of blood at that point.  I am, as of 8:35 PM on Friday,  March 19th, still bleeding and experiencing the impact of miscarriage.

Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

                                                3 mild reactions to report.  1 - A little over 24 hours after vaccine, my ankles were extremely swollen.  I elevated over the next 24 hours frequently an swelling went away.  2 - On Friday, March 26, swollen glands under my left armpit (shot received in left arm), swelling is completely gone as of 3/29.  3 - the evening of 3/28/21 I became itchy on my scalp, arms and back.  I have showered and applied lotion and have not introduced anything new to my routine which is why I believe it may be shot related and worth mentioning.  The intensity is mild but if it persists or worsens I will contact my doctor.

                                                At bedtime I noticed a slight queasiness. Just enough to make me close my eyes to go to sleep. I also felt &#39;off&#39;.  About 30 mins to an hour later I notice that every move I make, the joints I&#39;m moving hurt. Like EVERY joint is now sore when I move. (With the exception of fingers/toes) I tossed and turned all night and got a headache. The queasiness was very mild, but happened any time I moved.  This morning now my joints no longer hurt, but I still have the headache.

                                                I was fine until about 5 hours later and then oh my was that rough. It started with severe back pain first that came on very sudden. Then I noticed I was sweating real bad and I was so weak it took all my energy to just lift my head off my pillow. Small burst of energy like sitting up became  quite a challenge. All I have done is sleep none stop and when i wake ive noticed a bit of confusion. For example I thought i woke up at 7am tomorrow and then kept falling back asleep on and off till about 8:30 when i realized it&#39;s still today. The body aches and pains were very rough too. My husband went at the same time for the same shot and what Im experiencing vs him is not comparable! He has mild discomfort mine is extreme. Also Ive had a headache a pretty bad one  since about 10pm yesterday as well. Ive been unable to even think about food Im too tired to care even. I have not ate since I was vaccinated yesterday. Ive never reacted to any vaccine or shot of any kind till now.

I have also had a sore arm since receiving the vaccine. Also, I went to this vaccine clinic with 2 of my neighbors that also had the exact same reactions.

                                                The shot was administered by a young woman at pharmacy, who I later learned was an intern. She injected the shot less than two fingers down from my shoulder bone, much higher than I have ever had an injection given before.  I immediately felt intense pain, and the intern had trouble pushing the syringe down fully.  She said ?I need help!?, and her male manager ran over, and quickly jabbed the syringe further into my arm, and pressed extremely hard down on the syringe, forcing the remaining contents into my arm. I immediately felt a shooting, searing pain down my entire arm, into my wrist, and  my arm went numb, felt heavy, and tingly by my hand.  The manager pulled the needle out of my arm, and said ?you must have hit bone, the needle is bent?.  I then felt extremely nauseous and woozy, and my vision started going in and out.  I fanned myself and after about five minutes my vision stabilized, and I felt less nauseous.  It is now 9 hours later and I have intense shoulder and neck pain, and limited range of motion of my shoulder.

Since that day I have had off and on dizziness/lightheadedness. On March 19 I fainted in my kitchen. I hit my kitchen table and had a huge knot on my head and bruises all down my left side of my body. My left shoulder still hurts from the fall and I still have a small knot on my head (left side just above my left eye on my forehead). I went to my primary care doctor on  March 24 and reported the event. I asked if it could be related to the COVID vaccine and she said she wasn&#39;t sure since the Jansen one was so new, but that she had seen these effects from the other two vaccines.  At the doctor&#39;s office my blood pressure was on the lower end (110/60). My normal blood pressure runs about 118/70. They ran some blood work and that all came back normal. They did an EKG in the office, but my blood pressure stayed pretty close to the same as it was the first reading. They then sent me to get a CT scan on my head, which also came back normal. She did diagnose me with a concussion. I was out of work the entire week (March 22-March 26) due to this. She also ordered me to have an echo done. While at the office for the echo, my blood pressure ran 99/46 (this was on March 31). The results of the echo came back normal.  I also got a monitor to wear for 72 hours on March 31. I took that to the doctor on April 5 and I am still waiting on results from that.  Since the event on March 19, I have had headaches and body aches. I have also had slight lightheadedness off and on.

My lower abdomen and back also hurt and was cramping as if I was in labor.  I took two Tylenol PM and 10mg of Cyclobenzaprine. Then the chills started, I have never been that cold in my life while I was shivering that is when the sweating started and a basically sweat through three pairs of pajamas last night. Woke up around 3am with a pounding headache. By 10am I was feeling wrung out, but a lot better. I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep. Woke up around 3:30pm took a shower and was able to take my daughter to soccer. I am still weak and have some achiness in my knees and ankles.

                                                Immediately when I received the injection, I felt a cool fluid rush around my heart with a moderate discomfort/pain. I reported this to the tech who administered. He didn&#39;t seem alarmed &amp; advised I wait 15 mins. I still felt a &#34;coolness&#34; around my chest but otherwise felt &#34;fine&#34; so I was permitted to leave. As the day went on, I felt my chest (lungs &amp; area around my heart) feel tighter &amp; tighter &amp; my breath grew more &amp; more &#34;shallow&#34; like I couldn&#39;t take deep enough breaths &amp; I was short of breath. In the evening, it intensified. I was very fatigued (couldn&#39;t go up our stairs or talk in complete sentences without feeling &#34;winded&#34;). The tightness in my chest was worse &amp; was accompanied by periodic acute pain in my heart. I also had pain my lower back. I went to the emergency room around 10PM that night. An EKG, blood tests &amp; chest X-ray were conducted. The ER doctor said all tests came back &#34;normal&#34; &amp; they weren&#39;t sure what my issue was. I went home &amp; rested. I woke the next morning with the acute pains gone but the tightness still lingered. I did not feel &#34;normal&#34; until almost 72 hours after my vaccine.

Then visited my physician on Apr 02. The doctor prescribed Meloxicam 15 mg. since I also had seasonal allergies for which the Dr prescribed Fluticasone 50 mcg and Azelastine 137 mcg nasal spray. The Dr also requested for lower back MRI.  I have scheduled the lower back MRI for 04/16. I did let the doctors office know today about the vaccine.

                                                Immediately at 15 minutes: blurry vision; felt off and felt loopy (out of it);  I was dropping food on myself as I was eating. My pupils were really small. I felt out of it. Finally I got home (son drove me). I had mild chest pains and heart racing (had this initially, too). And the chest pains and heart racing kept happening off and on through the night. I had headaches that night and I felt nauseated. Next day, I had to wear sunglasses inside my  house as I was light sensitive and my pupils remained small. I still felt body aches and nausea but the eyes were the biggest concern...shining light by my eyes didn&#39;t make my pupils bigger. The light that came off my phone aggravated my eyes and my head. Thursday, I still had nausea but headache wasn&#39;t bad with Tylenol. Those full two days all I did was sleep. Friday, I felt like things were mild and Tylenol was helping. I called heathline for my eyes. As those still weren&#39;t improving. I got into my eye doctor for an exam (4/9). There was no inflammation and he decided to dilate my eyes. Of course, my eyes were blurry and my eyes responded to that dilation. I napped after returning home. My pupils after the nap were finally responding. I still had a little light sensitivity in my eyes but not as much as I had had and pupils were doing what they should with light. So this was 3 1/2 days later. I still do get mild headache and mild chest pain - it comes and it goes. I have a doctor appt - general check up  - that was already scheduled for tomorrow and he will examine for chest pain.

Carried on with my day like nothing happened.  3/29/2021: (1) Uncharacteristic, debilitating headaches began started around mid-afternoon (ish) and continued on/off - occurred approximately 5-7x and largely tapered off by 4/9/2021.  (2) extreme soreness continuously occurring on the upper right side of my back b/w the spine and scapula. I could barely move it most days. Has gotten slightly better beginning 4/12/2021, but remains unresolved as of this report.  4/15/2021: woke up with severe headache again.

                                                Within minutes of shot, on the shot going in - it stung so bad I cried and I have a high pain tolerance &gt; extreme nausea right after the shot was in; I felt short of breath - Heartrate - While standing in line, my heartrate was 75 or 76  and it went up to 130  beats per minute after the vaccine (I have a watch that tells me); my heart was racing. I was putting cold water bottles on my neck to feel better. Heartrate went from 130 to 100 at 45 minutes out. It stayed in the hundreds for a couple of hours. About three hours after shot - I developed itching and hives all over - chest, arms, and tops of thighs. I took Benadryl. The injection site on arm stayed incredibly painful - I couldn&#39;t even move my arm. 4/12/2021 - I got in contact with someone from Clinic. They felt like there had been a reaction to vaccine - advised to continue Benadryl. A localized reaction to injection site. First 48 hours  bone, muscle, joint pain was extreme - it hurt to be alive. It took a week for that to fade so I could function again. Got in contact with Dr. again 19th. Swollen oval under my skin about 2 -3 inches long at injection site; fatigue and nausea is still there. Ran some bloodwork. Advised to take Benadryl when itching came back. This morning, I called the doctor today 20th - an allergist was pulled in for this conversation as well - I was prescribed to take Zyrtec; Claritin and a prednisone (to prevent reaction from continuing) and also Zofran for the long term reaction to the vaccine. Watch the injection site for any redness and heat (there&#39;s none right now). Three days after vaccine, I did get a blistery rash across my neck at my collarbone area, down my chest and under my breast and across my rib cage on front and a little on my back on the back of my shoulders and down along the spine. Additionally there was a flat orangish rash that developed - on my face and nose. And then my skin started peeling off there and it (that flat orangish rash) showed up  also on the middle of my chest too right in the middle of the other rash on my chest. That is improving with the medications I&#39;m taking.

                                                First I had a funny taste in my mouth - 2-4 hours after vaccine. 8-9 hours after the injection - I woke up with the first of what would become extremely severe body aches. I took some Aleve - that helped some with the symptoms - but not efficacious. It turned into bone deep pain that made me cry. I would say 7 on the pain scale. That lasted two days. It started slow and then it got big. It was very bad for 12-16 hours. I didn&#39;t leave bed and I cried a lot. Worse than childbirth. I was left with another two days after that with some severe fatigue and then I started recovering. About 10 days after vaccine,  on the morning of the 17th, I thought I had a spider bite but it was the beginning of a rather severe shingles outbreak which I haven&#39;t had before.  I had a telehealth appt with employee health -  I was treated  with anti-viral - Valtrex generic on the 19th. The rash was mostly gone with the  medicine - everything is scabbed over but the nerve pain is still here to this day. I still missed work this week.

I had a rash on my shoulders, ankles and forearms. It was little spots about six inches. Those symptoms lasted for 36 hours. After that point I had very low Oxygen levels and my Asthma was very severe. My Nebulizer and rescue inhaler were not very effective. It has been almost nine weeks and my Oxygen levels are still lower than normal at 96 or 97.  Before the vaccine my Asthma was controlled and I rarely used the rescue inhaler. I use my rescue inhaler once daily. I am using my Nebulizer once daily. Immediately after the vaccine I was using my Nebulizer four times daily. It is still not near the level of control I had before the vaccine.

                                                I got a fever, headache, fatigue, and nauseous for 3 days after the shot. My left arm was very sore and it went into my neck.   It is now 4 months later and I can still feel exactly where my shot was given. I have pain in my left arm and am weaker on that side. I am very fatigued all the time and get nauseous randomly.  I also get severe night sweats. Every day I take a nap at lunch and go to sleep by 8 each night. I am not sure what will happen when I have to go back to the office.  I also get random fevers where I feel bad and my fever goes to 101 degrees. Those usually last a day and then subside.
