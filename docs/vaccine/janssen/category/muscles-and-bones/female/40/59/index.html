                                                Dizzy, run down two hours after injection. Woke up 4 am then off and on with extreme body pain, sore neck , lower back, right hand and arm. Headache and fatigue at 6:45 am got up with two children (2 yrs and 10 months) ate small breakfast by 9 am I couldn?t get off the couch or stay awake. My head started aching and my eyes hurt, I felt extreme chills two thick blankets weren?t enough to warm me. Extreme fatigue, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I fell asleep and didnt have the energy to walk to my bed until 2:30 pm.  It set off my stomach and I was vomiting off and on until around 9 pm. By then I could keep little bits of fluid and food down. Then I was hot. I felt flushed but had no fever. My usual heart rate is 52-54 bpm via Watch while laying down. My heart rate during this hot period laying in bed was 102 -101 bpm. Which is consistent for my workout heart rate. I went to sleep and woke up 7 am with my kids and was well enough to take care of them but not do all my usual chores. I couldn?t bend down or put my head lower than chest or the extreme throbbing headache was back. Still had body aches and fatigue but nowhere near yesterday. It is 11:22 pm Sunday and I feel spent.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA About 6 hours after receiving vaccine, sudden onset of fever to 101 degrees with chills.  About two hours after the fever began, extreme fatigue and muscle and joint pain, and left breast pain began (had the injection in my left arm).  The extreme fatigue lasted for about 9 hours, during which time I felt like I could barely walk or move in bed.  After the extreme fatigue passed, and for about 24 hours, I continued to experience moderate fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and headaches.  A bad headache has bothered me for about 36 hours since the extreme fatigue passed.  All symptoms are now clearing up (it is now about 42 hours post vaccination).

                                                In addition to the known side effects of extreme fatigue, low grade fever and body aches, I also have right arm pain at the site of injection with right arm swelling, warmth and right axilla swelling and tenderness.  The arm pain was began immediately at the time of injection and did initially lessen some for the first 12 hours until it started worsening mid-morning 22-24 hours after the injection.  Around 26 hours after the injection the arm pain worsened such that it couldn&#39;t be ignored and the axilla pain became very prominent almost worse than the arm pain.  Upon inspection I noticed obvious swelling and pain in my right axilla.  The right arm and axilla pain has persisted and worsened over the last 2 days to now include upper biceps, upper triceps, lower deltoid, trapezius, clavicular and right lateral breast pain.  The axilla and arm swelling has persisted and worsened over the last two days to now include swelling in my upper arm, around my clavicle, my upper chest and upper back.  The initial axilla swelling has not decreased any and is more prominent than any of the swelling located elsewhere.  Of note, I cannot easily palpate any axilla, clavicular or cervical lymph nodes.  If there is lymp involvement the nodes are not appearing to be extremely swollen with palpation exam.

Fever waned to 101 and came back at 11am at 102 degrees. Started feeling nausea around noon and had body aches in my joints, specifically my hips and left elbow. Took Tylenol again. Fever continued until around 7pm and then it lowered to 99.1. By 8am the next morning all symptoms were gone and temperature was back to normal. The injection site and arm never hurt besides joint pain.

                                                Had a sore arm within hour of shot (got it at 7:30pm). Felt a little yucky before going to bed. I made sure to hydrate significantly before the shot and after. I woke up at 3am with chills and had them for about an hour.  Woke up the next morning at 9am with with medium neck and head pain and feeling a little chilly and out of it. Mild ache in joints and body overall. At 10am I took one ibuprofen, but at 11am (200mg), kept pushing fluids. 11am headache got worse temp 98.7 (slightly high for me, I am usually about 97). Started having some gastrointestinal issues around noon. Felt nausea and sweaty palms loss of appetite. Had a bowel movement (normal in appearance).    That all seemed to pass and I felt better, still tired, for most of the afternoon. Arm was sore to the touch and when moving. I managed to eat a few small meals, kept up hydration, and took a nap late in the day. I woke up at 5pm with headache and body aches all over. No appetite again. Had very little to eat, kept hydrating,    At 7pm my vision got a little blurry and I had a minor vasovagal episode. Center of vision blurred, got chills and sweaty, nausea, and I had to poop  (it was less formed). I rested, cool compress, and raised my feet. It all passed in about 20 minutes. I had major loss of appetite rest of the night (couldn&#39;t eat anything), kept hydrating, and went to bed.  Slept through the night with no incidents.   Woke up at 9am second day and had a small breakfast, though my appetite is still not back. Generally feeling exhausted, but no headache or aches in the body anymore. My arm is still sore. Had some more GI distress (another less formed poop around 11am).   My appetite returned by early afternoon on the 2nd day post-vaccine. Still tired and generally feeling &#34;off,&#34; especially mentally. Had brain fog all afternoon and my ears felt plugged today. Hard to concentrate on a task.

I felt clear headed but exhausted for the rest of the day.  My chest has been tight and congested since then. Hard to breath and my voice is rough and raspy. This is ongoing and I still have chest tightness and a raspy voice.  On 4/12/21 I started having horrible joint and muscle aches again throughout my body and felt so tired. Horrible headache and stomach pain, bloating and nausea.

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving the J &amp; J vaccine, my left arm, and then left leg began to feel heavy and intermittently tingly (that was not what I consider the adverse event, but I want to give you the full context). Then approximately 40-45 minutes after the vaccine was administered, I was sitting and typing on my computer when out of the blue I felt considerable  tightness in neck. The sensation began at the base of my neck and moved upwards across my neck and rose into my head. At that point, it felt like my neck and head were in a vise. That continued while at the same time it felt like there was a great deal of pressure directly on my sinuses.  This all continued for 1-2  minutes, at which point the tightness in the necks  diminishing until I  did not feel it any long. The tightness and pressure in my head lasted another 10 minutes or so. It gradually diminished, before fully dissipating after. The entire event lasted about 12-15 minutes and was very scary, as nothing like that has ever happened to me. Once it was over, I continued to feel heaviness and intermittent tingling in my left arm and left leg for another couple of hours. By the next day the heaviness was gone, but I was a bit congested and had a headache.  I didn&#39;t know who to report this to until the J &amp; J vaccine administration was halted and it occurred to me that maybe my experience  should be documented and reported. A friend found this website for me.

Right lower leg and F&amp;A also had minor pitting, but not the pronounced swelling seen in the left.    Did self MLD massage, elevated and wore compression.  Tingling in left leg overnight and felt heavy.   Called doctor&#39;s office as soon as they opened on Day 17 post.  Saw them that afternoon.  Swelling had already gone down significantly either on its own or due to compression, elevation, and massage.   Practitioner noted pitting edema in both ankles, more pronounced in left.  It was not painful or warm, so she ordered a D-dimer test if I still had swelling over the weekend.   Since swelling continued to improve, nothing else was done.

                                                Within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine on 3/9/21 I felt exhaustion, body aches, chills and headache. About 30 hours later I started to experience extreme leg pain/tremors, severe nausea and an unrelenting headache, lower back pain and continued chills. 6 days after receiving the vaccine (3/15/21) I tested positive for Covid-19 and the symptoms worsened. 8 days after receiving the vaccine I developed a cough and sore throat and trouble breathing. 10 days after receiving the vaccine I went to the emergency room (3/19/21) and received a chest x-ray and diagnosed with covid pneumonia and given antibiotics to treat along with a CT scan. Symptoms started to subside about 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine, although to this day I am still troubled with a lingering headache and constant fatigue. Throughout the duration I relied on Tylenol and Motrin. At the hospital I was prescribed indomethacin and ondansetron for pain and nausea.

The acute pain diminshed after about 3 hr and I could walk again but the hip flexor area remained tender and felt like a sore muscle had been pulled for about 3 days.  About 5pm I developed really bad chills which lasted about 24 hrs and was really intense about the first 6hr.  About 11pm I developed a severe headache preventing me from sleeping which lasted about 9hrs.  4/10 I had occassional chills, the headache had subsided a little but had a nagging tension feeling and I was really fatigued and really wiped out the remainder of that day.  My Gynecologist advised I stopped taking my Birth Control for the next month to lower my risk of blood clots.

The day before I couldn&#39;t work at my desk due to pain in my low back and hip flexors, which is also abnormal. Then the period was heavier than normal lasted 3 days longer than normal. It looked like there were clots in the blood.   I mentioned this experience to a friend, who said several of his female friends also experienced bizarre periods after receiving the JJ vaccine. Was this drug tested on women of reproductive age before being released?

                                                One day after vaccine I missed worked, was in bed all day with fever of 101.8, headache, body aches, abdominal pain etc.  On 4.2, I couldn?t breathe after attempting a lower-than-normal intensity elliptical workout (I do 60&#43; min elliptical workouts 5x/week and 6&#43; mile walks the other 2 days/week). Following that event I had significant trouble getting a full breath and had dull upper left back pain and very localized pain in upper left abdominal area/lower left rib area that got worse at night. I had a telemedicine appointment with my pcp on 4.14, was Rx?d advair and albuterol. Had another telemedicine with my pcp on 4.16 because breathing and localized pain were more concerning. PCP sent me to the ER. At the hospital ER they found elevated troponin-I and an abnormal ekg (normal chest X-ray and cat scan) and diagnosed me with an NSTEMI heart attack. They transferred me the other hospital where they did more testing.  Troponin-t was normal, ekg was determined to be a normal atypical variant. I completed an exercise stress test and the cardiologist determined that I would not have been able to complete the full 15 min with no abnormalities if I?d just had an NSTEMI so they changed the diagnosis to Acute Myocardial Injury.  On 4.23 lab results showed troponin-I is still elevated.  I still cannot Get a full breath and still have some left back and lower rib pain

I feel alot better but I still have a little lingering cough.  This past Friday I woke up with a pain in the right side of my neck which got worse so I went to my PCP on Sat who diagnosed me with Carotidynia where he states my corotid artrery is inflammed and was prescribed an antiinflammitant Diclosenac with the intents of decreasing the inflammation.

                                                Was diagnosed with a DVT 3.5 weeks after vaccination. Started experiencing symptoms of DVT 20 days after the vaccine. Symptoms were not atypical and were almost not checked for DVT at ER.  Started with twinges in my right leg for several days. Then pain in my back right behind my heart. Then developed sporadic chest pain and heart palpitations. I was afraid to go to the ER because of COVID because my 12-year-old daughter has a heart condition.  Then on April 30 mid-day my right thigh began to hurt like a  pulled muscle although I had not injured it or pulled it. I couldn&#39;t walk on my leg the pain was so intense. My family was very worried about a blood clot because of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. That night I had really sharp chest pains and my thigh pain was no better by the next morning. I went to the ER told them my symptoms. After the ER doctor examined me he said he was 99% sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot because my pain was in my thigh and there was no redness or swelling. He told me my chest pain was probably due to anxiety. I asked if he would check my leg anyway. Once the ultrasound of my leg was done the DR came back and said I had a DVT. Then I had to have an MRI of my chest which he told me was a lot of radiation. I did not have a PE. They did not prescribe Heparin because they felt the DVT was from the vaccine. So I was giving Eliquis. Since then my family DR has run more tests and I do not have any genetic reason to have the DVT. I do not and have not taken birth control in the past 20 years. I am now on a blood thinner for at least 90 days if not longer and I am continuing to have twinges and chest pain twinges.

                                                Low back pain began about 6 hours after shot.  Next morning, 12 hours after shot, woke with muscle aches, headache, chills and sweating.  Approximately 18 hours after shot, hives began to appear at wrists, thighs.  About the same time, diarrhea occurred twice, and severe dizziness occurred.  Likely brief loss of consciousness occurred, resulting in fall due to sudden dizziness upon standing.  Hives became progressively worse, became severe and full-body.  Called doctor, who instructed us to go to ER for IV steroids and additional care.

                                                Started with chills shortly after getting the injection, which got progressively worse. At 9:30 pm, the evening of injection, chills got worse, along with a headache and muscle aches that started with my shoulders and moved quickly down my body, eventually, ending at my toes. It hurt to move, even my fingers. I took 2 regular strength Tylenol, which helped get me to sleep. I then woke up around 4 am in a puddle of sweat... I took my temp and no fever, but body aches, headache and chills were still prevalent. I spent the next day in bed without moving or eating much - drank a lot of water. Tylenol every six hours. An hour after taking Tylenol, I seemed to be well enough to not be moaning and groaning, but it wore off too quickly and I had two hours of feeling horrible before taking more Tylenol for a bit of relief. I woke Sunday morning around 5 am in another puddle of sweat and severe body aches and headache. I took more Tylenol, went back to sleep and woke around 9 am feeling groggy, but quickly realized that I was feeling 100% better! Just like that. I also had pain at the injection site that for some reason seems to be getting worse today, Sunday (April 4). I do not have swelling or redness. It just feels hot and very very sore and getting worse. Heavy and hard to lift.

I could tell after the vaccine I had a viral type infection. I still have not recovered and I will see my eye doctor tomorrow.

                                                About 45 minutes after I got vaccinated I started to feel a strange sensation (a kind of tingling) in the right side of my head, inner ear,  and jaw. Then about 15 minutes later I felt the sensation in the right side of my tongue. The best way I can describe it is similar to the same sensations I feel when the Novakane is wearing off after having a cavity filled. It&#39;s Monday (4/12/21) and I can still feel it a tiny bit in my right ear, where my jaw connects (right side), and my right cheek. Hopefully, it will go away when the stiffness in my shoulder goes away.  Also, during my 15 minute waiting period I had the same tingly sensation going down my arm to my fingertips, but I was told that some people experience that sensation as the vaccine moves throughout their body. Other than that I experienced the stated side effects.

                                                When I first got the shot I noticed it in my throat. I told the nurses they had me wait 20 minutes before I could leave. I felt dizzy but not dizzy enough to not go home. It felt like it went to my stomach, then my head, and then I could feel it in my joints.  I drove home from the city. Two hours pass, I notice a rash but I didn&#39;t think anything of it due to indoor allergens, springtime plus it went away within an hour.   I started to get chills and fever. I had a lack of sleep due to pain throughout the first night. I was waking up feeling like my head was on fire from my ears to the top of the skull area and in front of my face by my eyes too. My eyes felt like they were going to burst. I layed in bed for 24 hours.   Day two: pain, tiredness, headache, and sensitivity to light for the next few days. Symptoms come and go for days then wean off.   Next, I had issues with anxiety, sleeping, yet being really tired as well coupled with problems sitting still. These are subsiding but still there.  I am still very tired today and a bit anxious on April 13th, 2021. I also notice my typing skills, as well as testing skills, are not as sharp as before the vaccination.

Everything but the soreness of the injection site and tightness in the muscles on that side lasted about 48  hours. The tight muscles and soreness lasted about a week.  *** THREE WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** Sunday, 4/12/2021 I woke up and stepped out of bed and my left ankle gave out when I stepped down. Internal rotation, weakness in left ankle. It happened again as I walked shortly after. That day I tripped many times due to weakness in that ankle. When I showered and shaved my legs I realized that I had absolutely no feeling in the left lateral part of my lower leg. It felt like I had a novocaine injection in my leg. I could not even feel a pin prick there. By Friday 4/9/2021 I started to have some sensation, but still decreased sensation and weakness in my left ankle even at this moment.  ****4 WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** My period started Monday, April 5th, 2 days early. By Friday, 4/9/2021 and through the day and night Saturday 4/10/2021, I had such a heavy period that I kept soaking through tampons, pads, and 2 pairs of jeans. I have never blead like that and could not keep up.

                                                With prior vaccines and flu shots, I have either had no side effects or mild.  But with the COVID vaccine, I was sicker than sick!  I wasn&#39;t expecting to miss as much work as I did, nor go to the doctor three times in a week&#39;s time.  I received it around 11:30am on Thursday, March 18.  Around 1pm, my mild headache started to intensify and had ringing in my ears that would repeatedly come and go (still is doing so today, just not as frequent).  Around 4pm is when all of the &#34;normal&#34; side effects started?chills, hot flashes, sore arm, and super sleepy.  I woke up a couple hours later, with a headache that was WAY worse and was super nauseous.   This was close to 10pm.  Then, around 11pm that same night, I developed HORRID shooting ear pains and took my first Tylenol.  The ear/jaw pain was more than I could stand - had it in both ears, but the right ear was more intense.  It felt like I had a lighting rod between both ears and had these intense &#34;zings&#34; that kept going back and forth, like they were playing ping-pong.  The painful &#34;zings&#34; reminded me of those felt during an ear infection but WAY MORE INTENSE.  My jaw was super tight, as well, with a horribly intense headache.  I spent the entire night night doing warm compresses on my ears, taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours, staying in the shower, and lots of crying.  It was so bad that I felt the need to go to the ER but didn&#39;t feel comfortable driving and didn&#39;t want to go the ambulance route?and thought it was pointless because going to the ER for ear pain would leave me there for hours and hours since I didn&#39;t feel it would be viewed an an urgent emergency.  My goal was to make it through the night and see if I could get into my PCP doctor the following morning.  I took another Tylenol around 5am, and I thankfully cried myself to sleep for a couple of hours.  When I woke up, I called my PCP but couldn&#39;t get in, so I did an online doctor visit through my insurance company.  My fever was about 103.06 at its highest during the night but was gone by 3:34pm Friday afternoon (assuming because I was taking more Tylenol than I had been post-online doctor&#39;s appointment).  Around 7pm Friday evening, I knew I needed to go to the ER or urgent care.  I got a ride and was taken to urgent care for my intense ear pain.  They gave me a Toradol injection and Tramadol prescription.  By bedtime Friday night, the injection was doing its job and made the ear pain and zings were much less intense (didn&#39;t get the prescription until a couple days later).  On March 20, Saturday night, is when I developed a red, itchy rash on my back and tummy.  Over the next couple of days, it was on my chest, arms, legs?pretty much come and was in various places.  I called my PCP Monday morning (March 22), left a message, and they called me back to tell me to restart taking my Zyrtec/HCL to see if it would help the itching.  It has and am just mildly breaking out at this time.  The stinkin&#39; ear/jaw pain returned on Tuesday the 23rd, so I loaded up on OTC ear drops and made an appointment with my PCP for Wednesday, March 24.  She saw no ear infection and essentially told me to keep taking the pain meds.  I received the vaccine on March 18 and did not return to work until the following Thursday.  In retrospect, I should have just missed the remainder of that week, too.

                                                Injection given very high on left shoulder. When injection started?burning pain went through the shoulder and then followed bloodflow down left arm to fingers, back up arm, down left side of back of neck, down the back, down the back of the left leg to foot, and back up to the middle of body before the burning no longer followed a path. Upon standing, I was dizzy, and told the pharmacist, and I told her that something felt wrong. She asked me to wait outside the pharmacy, standing, for 10 minutes. I was shivering and visibly shaking. Immediately after the injection, the burning on the left side persisted for over 30 min, and was over the whole left side of my body.  I could not move my shoulder joint without a lot of pain. The pain has gotten worse each day, around the shoulder.....pain in the rest of my body has lessened.

I also was experiencing allergy/asthma like symptoms that included difficulty breathing and shortness of breath that worsened over time I couldn&#39;t speak in full sentences or laugh I was unable to walk 10 steps without gasping for air, after a couple of days of trying to maintain and cope with my theses symptoms. I couldn?t take it anymore, as I was preparing myself to go to the emergency room. I got into the shower the steam from the shower felt like it was suffocating me and I passed out my children took me out of the bathtub and rushed me to the emergency room where I was given several tests that include x-ray, CAT scan, artery bloodwork and vein bloodwork. I was being treated for asthma and given several different breathing treatments and steroids, unable to keep my stats at a decent level and the hard rebound even after continuous treatments, I was admitted because the breathing treatments were not effective. I am still uncertain of the ?actual outcome? the Hospital doctors treated me for an asthmatic episode and gave me directions how to handle my asthma i was prescribed prednisone and referred  to my primary that would then refer me to a pulmonologist and cardiologist. At the hospital I was told that there was black spots on my lungs I was told that I was being treated for infection, but then also told it could be pneumonia no certain  answer was ever given and i was given and antibiotic and was also told that I needed to see my primary for a way to maintain my asthma. The antibiotics seem to work for a couple of days and again I&#39;m back to having difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, muscle pain soreness and mild lingering headaches.

                                                ? Acute CVA (cerebrovascular accident)  Hospital Course/test results:  Work up with MRI showed 2 small acute infarcts in R temporal lobe region, and findings which could represent subacute infarcts in L frontal lobe.  Neuro deficits now resolved.  Neurology consulting.  Suspicious for embolic phenomenon.  She does also have a IUD to treat her menorrhagia, which may predispose her to clotting.  However when we did further research Mirena IUDs were not found to raise the risk for blood clot-related heart attack and strokes but the company does recommend clinical consideration for removal in such situations. We contacted  OBGYN oncall physician and spoke to doctor today. From his recommendation is not to remove the IUD at present time because the risk is very low comparing to the higher risk of severe menorrhagia that patient had experienced in the past. Since she will have annual visit with her GYN at OBGYN, patient should have that conversation with her GYN for options.    Patient remains stable and symptoms free. Repeated brain MRI and new MRV did not reveal new findings. Her HA resolved on its own. She was initially started statin and full dose of ASA then changed to low dose ASA plus Plavix (21 days) then ASA as monotherapy after. Currently hypercoag panel is still pending. Echo showed no evidence of intracardiac shunting with fair quality and technically adequate study. Neurology recommended outpatient follow up with neurologist and 30 days heart monitor to look for Afib/flutter. Currently her headache is resolved as well R hand weakness/tingling is resolved. She is stable to go home today.    A1C is 7.3 while on Metformin (2000mg daily). She may need additional agent to get A1C &lt; 7 as outpatient.    Neuro also recommended outpatient sleep study.

                                                The first two days I had a normal reaction with fatigue and soreness.  On the second night I developed a severe sinus issue that caused my tongue to turn white/gray and be dry and sore.  Frequent diarrhea, headache, sore throat, soreness, low grade fever for half a day and a resulting acid reflux condition. (I have never had acid reflux before) I was tested for Covid and Strep, both negative. Continued lymph node sensitivity for two weeks.  3.5 weeks in, I developed muscle tension, unrelenting, from the back of my head all the way down my spine. I had continued chest pressure and some numbness on my left side in my arm, leg and later my face. No home remedies worked and rarely do I get back/neck/shoulder pain. I was not doing anything strenuous. I went to the ER where they tested me for blood clots (J&amp;J news had just come out and I have a family history) and prescribed valium for the muscle tension which has somewhat helped.   I fully recognize that this might be bad luck, a series of unfortunate events after I received my shot.  However, I have not been sick all year, I have never had acid reflux issues or pain like this in my neck/back/shoulders previously.  The fact that in the 4 weeks after the shot I have not had a single day where I felt normal is a red flag to me. I feel like it is worth reporting in case anyone else has had a similar experience.

                                                Patient is a 41 yo woman with no PMH who presented to an  outside urgent care with left flank pain found to have a wedgelike defect in  the posterior left lower renal pole suggestive of a renal infarct.  She  underwent CTA which did not show any embolism, thrombus, dissection.  The  radiologist did note mild beading of the bilateral renal arteries, however the  radiologist at Valley View reviewed the images as well and was not as convinced.      Left renal infarct: Given suggestion of mild feeding of the bilateral  renal arteries, patient underwent CTA of the chest, head and neck which did not  show any other signs of fibromuscular dysplasia.  Echocardiogram did not have  any thrombus or decrease in function.  Patient did not have any arrhythmias on  telemetry.      Blood cultures were ordered and pending on discharge, but patient did not have  any of endocarditis      A hypercoagulable work-up including factor V Leiden, protein C, protein S,  Antithrombin, lupus anticoagulant, beta-2 microglobulin, anticardiolipin  antibodies were all sent and are pending at the time of discharge      Discussed the case with hematology at hospital: Most experts  treat with 3 months of anticoagulation other evidence is not entirely clear and  aspirin 81 mg may be a reasonable choice.  In light of the patient&#39;s lack of  insurance, decision was made to treat with 1 month of apixaban followed by 81  mg of aspirin daily indefinitely      Discharged with a short course of oxycodone 5 mg #15

                                                About 9 pm I felt fatigue, I went to bed. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol as a pain medication. I drank a bunch of water and took an Emergen-C. I fell asleep by 10:00. I slept and I woke up - shocked awake around 04:30 am - I was super thirsty. My whole body was really sore and stiff and I had a headache.  It was uncomfortable but not unmanageable. I decided to take more Tylenol and Ibuprofen and drink more water again. I got back in bed and was feeling a lot of symptoms - I was really sore in my thigh muscles, lower back, knees and forearms. I had slight chills; I was pretty uncomfortable. I couldn&#39;t get back to sleep - I couldn&#39;t sleep on my arm with the injection site. This was about 5 pm. I never actually had a fever. But just a lot of fatigue and body aches. For the next day or two - I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol every 6 hours. Within 48 hours, the body aches started to subside. I still felt a bit fatigued and I still do feel fatigued to this day. Into the next week, I started feeling like (towards the middle of the week - about the 7th) I was having an urinary urgency feeling. It was a sensation in my lower back like a UTI was coming on. I haven&#39;t gotten one in a long time ( I use to). On Friday or Saturday, when I wiped, I was seeing a slight pinkish hue  - a trace of blood - in my urine. Decided to take probiotics and Vit C. and I started to feel better. But Sunday morning, I was back to feeling pretty bad. I visited the Urgent Care on Sunday, the 11th. In the visit, they took a urine specimen. Dr. saw blood in my urine from the test. And an absence of nitrates in the urine and she said it wasn&#39;t  a typical UTI. They decided to culture the urine specimen. Macrobid - 2 times a day for 7 days - antibiotics was prescribed. I felt a little better the second day of taking it, I thought, but it was up and down. Culture showed there was no UTI.  Friday, the 16th, I had my annual visit with my PCP, I was feeling okay by this time. But I still had a sensation in my lower back - not a pain but a sensation and I still feel this sensation now (on my left side). She asked me to come back after the antibiotics to take another urine sample. Lab test. I feel some fatigue but I&#39;m doing normal daily life.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

Also, my lying down heart rate was 130, which is 50-60 bpm higher than normal  April 11: A fever between 100 and 101 all day. Took a Tylenol in evening.  April 12: Fever, headache gone. Just a little tired and fatigued. Then I seemed to have been recovered.  April 21-22: Achiness, tingling pain in arms, left back, shoulders.  Then this seemed to have abated.  April 28-29: Tingling pain in arms, hands, sometime back and feet.  I have never experienced these symptoms pre-vaccine so it makes me wonder if it is related to the vaccine

Today I still have a headache abd feel a little tired but almost back to normal.

Approximately 7 hours after the injection (6:45pm), physical exhaustion set in; mental state was wide awake (thinking about everything/mind racing), however. Approximately 1 hour after the exhaustion began, slight fever and chills started.  By 9 pm the fever and chills increased to the point of teeth chattering and touch to the body felt raw.  Throughout the night, the fever and chills continued.  Sleep was mixed with pain in the legs and restlessness, coupled with a mild headache.  In the morning, the headache increased, but the chills subsided and the fever had broken (8am); slight nausea.  Eating food seemed to keep the nausea at bay; body exhaustion still existed.  headache subsided by the evening. no further chills/fever symptoms.  1.5 days for major adverse symptoms.  Soreness at injection is still continuing (no discoloration or lump, just soreness).  no vomiting, diarrhea, migraine  perhaps related, but not sure...my right leg had a broken fibula a month prior, but was ~98% healed.  The evening of the injection, that ankle was swollen to the size when the injury first occurred.  Earlier that day, the ankle had no visible signs of injury (no swelling, discoloration, etc).  In the morning, the ankle appeared as it had the day/week before.

                                                Patient was given the Janssen vaccine and within 3 minutes the pt complained that she was lightheaded and dizzy. As I walked out of the pharmacy to see what her reaction was her muscles tensed up and she became completely rigid and stared sliding out of her chair. By appearances it looked like she was shaving a mild seizure, with a blank stare. By the time I got her down on the floor and got her coat off to see if there was an allergic reaction to the site the patient came too and asked me why she was in the floor. At that time she was clamy but knew who she was and where she was. Paramedics were called and while they were here she stated that she was dizzy and nauseous so they ended up taking her to a location hospital to be seen. While there they drew blood as a precaution.

Told the nurses they took me back in a room took my vitals at that time I started to feel weak like my arms and legs were Jell-O or jelly. I also felt jittery the nurses gave me apple juice and crackers they put me in a private room they check my vitals again my heart rate was elevated and my blood pressure also went up . 02 That?s normalsats normal My feet are they just started to feel numb as well. A doctor came in and checked me out they felt like my exam was normal but they also felt like I might be having a mild reaction around 1500 I started to get itchy but no hives noted I took a Benadryl 25 mg at 1500 around 1515 my feet were still numb but I definitely felt better still kind of felt like my arms and legs were weak but not as bad so after an hour and a half I was allowed to leave and was told to rest for the rest The day and you call or go to the emergency room if I had trouble some side-effects about four hours after the shot  my lips did start tingling at home I did check my oxygen saturations and it was normal I look at my lips to make sure that they weren?t swelling the only thing I noticed was that a scar I have on my lip that usually you can?t see was more prominent and you could actually see it my lower back hurts a lot

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approx 7 p.m.,  I noticed moderate pain in my lower back, hips, and legs. Around 7 30, I felt very cold and began covering up with several blankets and turning up the heat. Husband and kids reported the house was not cold at all. Within 15 minutes, chills began and increased quickly to an almost violent state. I was shivering so badly, it became painful and scary. My husband added three blankets on top of our down comforter and sent me to bed. It took approx 15 minutes to warm up, stop shivering, and slow teeth chattering enough to relax and fall asleep. Awoke around 1:30am feeling incredibly thirsty and in desperate need of water. Upon standing, the pain in my body was excruciating which made it extremely difficult to walk. Finally in the kitchen, I took Ibuprofen 800mg and filled a large bottle with water. I began to feel incredibly dizzy and needed help from my husband to get to the couch. It took approximately 2 hours before I began to feel any relief from the ibuprofen. Around 6:30 a.m., about 60 to 65% of the pain had abated and I had finished around 100oz of water. The remainder of the day was spent feeling extreme fatigue and a general sense of unwell. Appetite was poor throughout entire event. This all continued into the evening until bedtime at 11pm. Experienced moderate insomnia overnight, falling asleep around 2:30am. Could not fall asleep due to constantly thinking about the stress of the previous 24&#43; hours. Upon waking this morning, I feel almost back up to 100%.

Felt as if I were floating to chair. Sat for 20mins, legs weak, odd sensation across shoulder blades &amp; cervical spine. &#34;Slow&#34; &amp; woozy for duration of evening. Physically moved slow, cognitively slowed down, inability to focus. Internal body-wide sensation difficult to define. All very similar to immediate effects I have from alcohol. Passed out (sleep) 9hrs later &amp; woke 100% fine at 8am.

I have a herniated disc in my lower back and this was severely aggravated by the vaccine. My back and fingers hurt so bad I couldn?t sleep at all. Tried not to take Tylenol finally took some after 3-4 hours and it helped a lot with fever and joint pain. Also had a headache. Fever and pain was gone after 8 hours. Then felt very low energy with a headache all the second day. Third day I felt great except are sore.

I had a slight fever and just stayed in bed the day after. Ibuprofen seemed to help the headaches but not the body aches. No nausea. Within 72 hours I was almost back to my normal self, but still extremely tired, and my neck and back hurt quite a bit. Today marks 13 days. As of 5 days ago I began to get cold like symptoms. Neck and back still extremely uncomfortable, neck barely able to move side to side. I have a bit of a cough with phlegm. Headaches are still happening quite a bit, and still super tired all the time. I feel like I?ve been sick ever since I took the shot, and have to take several days off work.

                                                Patient complained of left arm heaviness at 12:44pm. BP was 158/98 Pulse was 101 and O2 saturation was 99. No other complaints at that time. After observation period patient went to the bathroom around 1:00pm and vomited in the restroom. She returned to post vac area where BP was checked (208/124) Pulse (107), O2 saturation (98), and respirations were at 28. No blurred vision, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Due to elevated BP we elected to call EMS for further evaluation. While waiting for EMS BP was taken again at 1:30 pm and it was  170/92 and pulse and apical HR were at 96, respirations at 24, O2 Sat at 97% and pt. reported arm was less heavy but she felt a tingling sensation from her arm to her wrist. EMS arrived at 1:35 and BP was 220/120 and temp was at 97 degrees.

It sounded like woody woodpecker when my teeth were chattering against my mouth guard. Then the fever came in. 17 hours after the vaccine, my fever is still at 101.  Did not sleep much. Woke up with severe headache and muscle pain. Drank a gallon of water yesterday and 32 oz in the middle of the night. Despite that, I?m still thirsty.

                                                About 3 hours after the vaccine was given, I had chest pains and started running a fever. I had acute lower back pain and felt overall very lethargic. The fever continued  through the night and broke around 3am.  The next morning I felt okay but by 10am started to run a fever again for the remainder of the day and chest pains and headache/body aches were now VERY present.  It is now 5 days after the shot and I?m just starting to feel like myself again. The headaches and overall body aches lasted for days.  I also had blurry vision on and off during this time.  My husband and I workout every day and eat very well.  We?re not overweight and don?t smoke. The injection site is still sore 5 days later.   I will complete another form for my husband but he experienced the EXACT SAME reactions....every one of them.

I was unable to keep the appointment because I was  feeling so dizzy that I slept the whole day. The next day, I called the doctor&#39;s to let them know I was feeling okay, again. I

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid in January 2021 and have not regained my taste or smell.  I was in bed for 2 weeks and had a prolonged fever up to 105 degrees--so high that I had visual and auditory hallucinations.  I had hair loss in the following months and I also continue to be fatigued.    I received the vaccination on 4/6/21 around 11am; a slight headache and face flushing occurred about 30 minutes after shot, but generally felt ok.  Woke up at 4am on 4/7/21 with chills, extreme joint pain, body aches, migraine headache, and a fever of 101.5 degrees.  Took Tylenol around 6am and went back to bed.  The migraine headache, chills, body aches, and extreme joint pain continued.  I was dizzy and extremely fatigued.  Woke up around 9 am and fever was at 102.7 degrees.  Joint pain and headache were almost unbearable at this point and I took a hydrocodone.  Took temperature around 12 pm and it was 103.5 degrees.  Fever continued rising to 104.4 degrees at 2:30 pm.  Took another Tylenol and went to sleep.  The next day, my fever had fallen back down to 102.5 degrees.  I continued with Tylenol to control me fever to around 101 degrees.   My fever persisted for 3 days.  I still have extreme fatigue, joint pain, burning scalp (which will likely mean more hair loss), zero appetite and weight loss, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.  The side effects are exactly how i felt when I got Covid in January.

After I arrived home, on or about  10: 45, I ate an egg sandwich and the dizzy sensation faded. However, severe fatigue set in  and by 1 PM I went to lie down.  On or about 1:30PM, I awoke with severe chills and a fever of 101.5.    The Chills lasted from about until about 3AM on April 9th.  The fever, however, went down after I took Tylenol at about 8PM.  I remained in bed on April 9th until 8AM and proceeded to work from home with fatigue and a headache that would not go away with Advil.  By April 10th the a majority of the initial symptoms abated and only a sore left arm with a slight tingling sensation remained.  On Sunday, April 11th, my right ankle started to swell and left leg had some pain (behind the knee) .   Elevated the leg and the swelling went down on the right ankle and left leg felt better after massage on the 12th.

                                                Thursday 04/08/21 - 1:35 PM Went to Fairgrounds to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson - Janssen COVID-19 vaccine shot with my husband. Both of us wore our masks, walked in together, went through the line together, we both got the shot in our left arms and then set together and waited the 15 minutes before we could leave. A little later at home we were working on some landscape lighting and I felt a bit foggy, light headed and kind of out of it. I was drilling into masonry and the first hole went fine but the second one for some reason just wasn?t going and I touched the drill bit with my fingertip on my left hand to see if it had smoothed out and I knew in my head not to do it and that it should be hot as heck but I didn?t feel anything at all so later that evening when I took a shower my finger was burning and I knew I had burnt it. That evening I begin to feel crippling cold, my fingernail and toenail beds had turned purple and I was shivering violently. I got under a pile of blankets with my dog and  tried to slow my breathing I could feel my heart beating in my chest and it felt like the air I was breathing was cold and frosty. I had a 104&#43; fever that night. My husband got me some aspirin a cold washcloth for my head a popsicle and water to help bring down the fever. And I was able to sleep on and off that night. When I woke up I had a 103&#43; fever and a tingling and numbness in my arms. Before the fever my arms felt tight and cold and I had a tingle that ran from my elbows to my fingertips. Again it was aspirin cold washcloth and lots of water to drink to try and get my fever down.   Friday 04/09/21 Was spent in bed trying to drink water and sleep through it. My arm was sore, not at the injection site but the whole top part of my arm felt like I had been hit by a truck. I had a fever again that evening.   Saturday 04/10/21 I thankfully woke up fever free but my arms were tingling. I had to take my husband to the airport that morning at 6:30 AM. I came back home and went back to bed until about nine when I woke up my arms were cold and sore and tingling it seemed to be getting worse in my left arm and I felt shots of electricity from my elbow down to my fingertips. At one point I took a picture because my left arm hurt so much more than the right and my fingertip beds were purple on my left and pink on my right. I took aspirin and took a nap. I couldn?t hold my phone with both hands hands like normal sitting in bed because my left hand goes cold and achy. Woke up worried that both my arms were aching and tingling from my elbows to my fingertips seems to be where it stays the most. Then that pain subsided and my lip started to tingle. After a few hours that stopped but the tingling in my arms is about constant not as strong sometimes, not in both arms sometimes, it seems to almost always be in my left arm and at one point scary enough that I almost went to the ER. Went to bed around 11:30 PM and the tips of the toes on my left side were tingling and it went to the whole leg.  Sunday 04/12/21 I woke up with a coughing fit  and mucus at around 1:00AM and my right leg with a little tingly at 4:24 AM awake again and coughing woke me had to get a drink and my stomach was buzzing and stopped now just back to the bottom half of my left leg. All of a sudden after a coughing and sneezing fit I got a tremendously sore burning throat out of no where that only lasted about five minutes. I noticed my left arm straining to hold up the pizza box tonight when my right arm had no trouble at all. Then a little later in the day stiffness in the back of my neck. It is a weird strong dry cough and I was scared to go to the ER because my symptoms were so varied and ever-changing I didn?t know what they would do with me and I didn?t want to just get stuck in there for days with him not knowing or making it worse. I told my husband ? It?s so random I?m a little scared no one is going to know what to do with me...?I?ve had issues with allergic reactions and no one being able to diagnose them and me having to figure it out on my own on the Internet that I had Thyroid problems and that I was allergic to the sun for a few years in the past and aloe vera... I didn?t wanna wind up going, them not fixing anything and having a huge bill to pay. But this whole time my body is buzzing and tingling and going through something strange. At this point I am just telling my family I?m okay and what random symptoms I have had since we spoke last. They are on standby to watch my children if I need to go to the ER. The constant buzzing, numbness, cold tingling in my arms is worrisome.   Monday 04/12/21 I am use to the numbness and tingling being a constant thing on some part of my body... There are times when I feel fine but I know it won?t last long. We can add an upset stomach and diarrhea to the list. I had a metal taste in my mouth for a little bit today. Both arms legs and my lips have randomly buzzed, ached or tingled. The websites say call 911 for emergency or call your local medical provider for assistance so I called the local ER to see if they could tell me if my symptoms were normal or if it?s something I should come in for and they couldn?t give me any advice... I was told if you feel like you should come in then come in. I had a very strong sharp pain at my elbow of my right arm tonight that made me sit up in bed...   Tuesday 4/13/21 My left arm is still sore if people touch me or if I try to sleep on my side like I normally do it hurts trying to hold my phone with both hands my arm still goes cold and achy. So far this morning my arms are both tingling and my left leg and my lips so at this point I just say I?m buzzy. 11:25 AM randomly my right arm decided to feel worse for a change but is back to a low buzz... after a few minutes. I find myself holding them up or lifting them when they hurt it seems to help a little to elevate my arms to my chest. I am just waiting to see what comes out in the media, or to see if this gets any better, or if they learn what to do about it... It isnt over, it hasnt stopped yet.

After 1&#43; hour felt mostly better so left .   30 minutes into my drive home felt sudden onset of nausea, left fingers tingling &amp; numbing with save wave of extreme dizziness. Pulled onto median and called 911. My face started stiffening into a pucker like position and my muscles all through my body stiffened, but weakened with sharp tingling. I couldn&#39;t stand so they carried me out of car and took me to Hospital.   The rooms were full so I  was in wheelchair waiting for room, shaking profusely, blue fingers, nauseous, dizzy and couldn&#39;t stand on my own. I was able to go to restroom w/assistance but My muscles were stiffened for 1 hour&#43; and over and i felt awful. over the course of 5 hours I gained strength back and started to feel better with just mild headache and nausea.   They did EKG, blood panel and chest xray which looked ok. Diagnoses as allergic reaction and told me to come back if more issues.   The day after shot and every day since have had a headache at base of neck and pressure in cheek/forehead &#43; nauseau &#43; dizziness and extreme tired. Today is 14th and no headache today.

A week later as I was traveling I had a very bad allergic reaction that required me to call 911, as the throat swallowed. I am still experiencing leg pain when I walk. Sometimes the face feels tight also and I?m not sure this is something from the vaccine.

Started in my knees on April 9 then progressively got worse over the weekend.  Saw doctor on Monday and they prescribed meloxicam.  Went to er on Wednesday because condition wasn&#39;t getting better and was in a lot of pain and they prescribed a steroid for 6 days.  After 6 days and not feeling any better I contacted both the doctor and the er and never got a response.  Very concerned at their lack of concern.  Im not a doctor but I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t just wake up with severe arthritis after never showing any symptoms?  Really just need someone to assist me because I&#39;m not getting better and its becoming extremely debilitating

                                                Five days after the vaccine I woke up and could feel a lump on my collar bone that was very painful and could move when touched.  The pain eventually subsided but the swollen lymph node is still there to date.  A week after I noticed another swollen lymph node appeared in my neck  and once it became inflammed my face and scalp became very to the touch and my whole mouth got inflammed also.  I went to the PCP who prescribed an antibiotic which did reduce some of the inflammation and pain in my face but the enlarge lymph node on my shoulder is still there.

Area has a knot in the muscle and is hot and extremely tender.

                                                I started to develop a headache and extreme fatigue about 4 hours after getting the shot. By 6pm I started getting severe chills and body aches. About 2 hours later the chills were alternating with fever and I could barely stand because I felt so weak from the muscle aches. I was in so much physical pain I didn&#39;t sleep at all that night. The fever lasted until late afternoon the next day (about 24 hrs total), and the body aches lasted until late afternoon the day after that (about 48 hrs total).

                                                The injection site was really sore. Ran high fever and had flu like symptoms for about 15 hours. Then those symptoms stopped but the injection site pain continued. The intensity of the pain grew for about 3 weeks. Then pain extended to neck and shoulder blade. Went to urgent care  for the  arm/neck/shoulder pain. Took neck X-rays. Given a steroid shot and an another shot I think for inflammation. Prescribed a muscle relaxer.

                                                Dizziness immediately following vaccine. Slight headache, moderate muscle aches, severe pain at injection site. It was also swollen with redness, itching, and it was hot. . Never had a fever. I immediately started taking Benadryl every 4 hours. I had really bad nausea (no vomiting)  to the point I was unable to eat and lost 7 lbs. I had really bad cold sweats so bad I was drenched with sweat multiple times a day for over a week. I ended up going to the walk in clinic about 5 days after the injection and was given Zofran for nausea.  I was also told I had a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine and any other time they would start me on steroids but they said if I took steroids it would make the vaccine not work. So I was told to continue Benadryl and deal with it.  To this day which will be two weeks tomorrow since I received the shot I still have a hard hot lump in my arm, I still break out in cold sweats, and still have a little nausea.  Never had wheezing or issues breathing though.

AND TOLD HER TO TAKE 75 MG DIPHENHYDRAMINE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT A.C.  WAS HAVING A MODERATE REACTION TO THE VACCINE (A.C. DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANAPHYLAXIS).  MOST OF THESE ADVERSE REACTIONS IMPROVED AFTER TAKING THE DIPHENHYDRAMINE.   TODAY, 2 DAYS POST-VACCINATION, A.C.  IS NO LONGER HAVING ANY SIDE EFFECTS AND IS RECOVERED.

                                                Approximately 20-30 minutes after receiving the vaccine left arm became slightly numb, noticeable during the short 10 minute drive home. Within 30 minutes of getting home there was notable numbness in the left arm, especially below the elbow and into the hand with last two fingers being the most affected; numbness was also up into the neck and felt in the left cheek/jaw up to near the left ear and the scalp. This diminished over the course of the evening. The next two days there was lingering soreness in the left neck from where neck meets shoulder and slight tingling in the last two fingers. Ibuprofen 600 mg was taken to assist with any pain, usually in the morning with other medication before going to work. By two to three days after the vaccination there was no more soreness or numbness. While no bruising ever occurred, firm pressure on the site of injection two weeks later is still mildly painful.

Next day at 8 AM ,I had waves of nausea and sore neck and body. Around 2 PM ,(24 hours after injection) flu like symptoms started appearing and by 4 PM I had 100° fever and Bodyaches and flu like symptoms that were severe. Around 8 PM the following day from my injection I started to feel better but not fully recovered until 4/9/21. Not one to get sick often and the sickness and tiredness was severe.

                                                Approximately 13 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up in the night with nausea, chills, fever, spinal pain, joint and bone pain, and the worst headache of my life that I could feel in my brain stem and spinal cord. I also experienced confusion and difficulty walking to the bathroom. The headache was not relieved by OTC pain relievers. I had difficulty sleeping and felt restless. I felt the fever ?break? around 5am with profuse sweating. I had to miss work today (I am a nurse myself who was actually working at the clinic when I received my vaccine). It is now 3pm and after taking a sleep aid and sleeping all day, I do feel better, but the headache remains. I had H1N1 about 10 years ago and aside from that, this is probably the sickest I?ve ever been and it is, with certainty, due to the Covid vaccine.

Headache that felt like no other I&#39;ve had primarily on left side above my ear. Vomiting and urination. Fatigue. Weakness.  I was on the verge of going to ER called on-call doctor instead. They advised me to try and get through the next few hours. They also ended up calling me in a medication to help with my vomiting. I was sick for a little over 24 hours with main symptoms. Still feel worn down.

                                                Lightheadedness and exhaustion set in 15-25 minutes post injection. Later that same evening, experienced nausea, muscle, bone, and joint aches as well as chest pain that were much reduced by the following morning. Malaise continued as did symptoms of nausea without vomiting.  24 hours post injection, experienced a low grade fever of 99.6 F (for me, this is a low grade temp). Fever broke after another 24 hours.  Experienced severe headaches in the middle of the forehead for 8-12 hours on 3/25/2021, 3/29/2021, 4/3/2021.  Experienced difficulty breathing 3/30/2021. Woke up from deep sleep feeling starved for oxygen and a sensation that a deep enough breath could not be taken--the lungs could  not expand enough. Respiratory rate seemed slightly depressed. It passed after about 30 minutes with focused effort on taking deep, regular breaths. Fell asleep again and did not consult a medical provider about it. The oxygen hunger / breathing issue did not repeat.  Medical professionals were not consulted for any of the episodes described above.

                                                Awoke the morning after receiving the vaccine (approximately 19 hours post shot) with stiffness in my muscles. Arms, thighs, lower back and neck were all sore when moved. Throughout the next 12 hours symptoms increased in strength and spread to entire muscle system and joints of arms and hips. Throughout the 12 hours I also experienced alternating periods of chills and overheating as well as a migraine. I used an electric heating pad to warm various areas (feet, legs, arms, neck) from hours 30 to 33. I also used tylenol rapid release 500mg at 19 hours and then again at 43 hours. At 43 hours felt symptoms retreating to feel similar to 19 hours in. By 53 hours only slight tenderness in muscles remained. Muscle tenderness was gone at around 70 hours.

                                                Received the J&amp;J Covid Vaccine shoot on Sunday, April 11th at the  Clinic. The night of receiving my shot, I had a migraine and neck pain which resulted in trouble sleeping.  When I got up in the morning, I started having severe muscle pain in my thighs and in my calf, mild cramps in the abdomen.  The leg pain lasted the entire day with exhaustion, which interfered with my ability to work a full day.  When I went to bed later that night, I still had pain behind my left knee and I was worried about if there was a blood clot.  I got up the next morning and my legs were still cramping but improved from the prior day.  When I saw the news discussing the blood clot issue associated with the J&amp;J vaccine, I felt it was important to contact my Dr. to discuss the leg pain.  They did an ultrasound (vascular scan) on my left leg and follow up with my doctor&#39;s office walk-in clinic after the scan.  My legs were examined and no clots were identified.  We discussed things to watch for.

                                                Patient reports: &#34;I received my covid 19 vaccine on Friday April 9th (J&amp;J) and need to report my reactions afterward. Had the usual immediate arm pain after injection along with nausea. Took a Benadryl and napped when got home and woke up 6 hours after injection with a tingling and swollen lower lip and constricted breathing. Took 3 Benadryl in fear of going to hospital and waited it out. Once lip went back to normal as well as breathing went to bed since it was late and slept all day Saturday. Woke up Sunday in agony from lower back pain and tailbone. Now, thurs 4/15 still in extreme pain in my tailbone. Went twice to chiropractor to help and nothing is alleviating the pain and have been practically bed ridden since Sunday. Can?t work, can?t sit, can?t walk can?t stand can?t anything without extreme pain. Been taking ibuprofen everyday and not helping.&#34;   She had a visit with us on 4/15/2021: &#34;Patient here for extreme pain on her tailbone. She had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine about 6 days ago and about 6 hours later she woke up with a tingling and swollen lip, constricted breathing, and dizziness. She wanted to avoid the hospital, so she took benadryl 75 mg and it slowly resolved her symptoms. These symptoms have not returned since. She was finally able to fall asleep that night and then slept all day the next day. The following day she woke up and experienced extreme pain in her lower back and tailbone. She saw her chiropractor twice this past week, which helped to resolve her low back pain. Per patient her chiropractor noted that her back seemed very inflamed. However, she is still having extreme pain with her tailbone and is unable to sit, stand, bend or work for more than 20 minutes without extreme pain. The only thing that seems to improve her pain is laying on her back with several pillows tucked behind and all around her. However, she is only able to stay in this position for a period of time before her body becomes stiff from immobility. She has been taking ibuprofen 600 mg TID, flexeril PRN, icing and applying moist heat to her back, but none of these measures seem to improve her pain. Lastly she has noticed that when she sits/stands for too long, her buttocks start to spasm. Denies fever, chills, n/v, numbness, tingling, incontinence or loss of bowel/bladder function.&#34;

Then the ?pause? so expected to be nervous, but 2 weeks out started the dizziness, panic attack, heart arrhythmia headache, brain fog, muscle soreness and overall unwell feeling.  I have lost time at work. The money this is going to cost me out of pocket for ER visits. Wasting peoples time.  I meditate have good people in my life, I?ve never had this typ of panic and feeling and legit arrhythmia. On beta blocker. Told to schedule a cardiologist visit.  Prob gonna need some anti anxiety meds.  There is no help out there for this. Thought doing the right thing to get vaccine.  I?m not antivax but this is super upsetting.  I?m an otherwise normal healthy social person. I cannot even go to friend house b/c of dizziness racing heart and panic

Loss of appetite that lasted for two weeks and went away.  4. Three weeks after vaccination, I  developed extreme back muscle tightness and spasms that have not resolved yet. The tightness runs from the base of the neck on either side of the spinal column down the length of the back. Massage therapy which has proven to be effective for previous issues of muscle tightness was not effective.  I have never experienced muscle tightness that went down the entire length of my back it cannot be resolved by muscular therapy.

I had a headache and slept most of the next day.  Definitely felt like my body was fighting something.     I have an approximately 3 inch diameter circle around injection site that is a red, swollen, hard, lump,  It is hot to the touch and extremely sore---at times it itches.  I am shocked how big and hard the knot is.  Its crazy!  I cannot put weight on that arm.  Extremely sore.  It is now 4 days after the vaccine and the knot does not seem to be getting smaller.  In fact, it may be bigger.

                                                Around 7 pm on 3/13, I developed brain fog, trouble walking, and then fever, severe muscle pain worse in legs, and chills.  Most of these symptoms seemed to improve on 3/14, but then on 3/15, I developed new onset of shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  On 3/16 around 1 pm the shortness of breath worsened and I went to the emergency room.  I felt that I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath in and I had chest discomfort on the left side of my chest worse when taking a deep breath.  My legs were hurting as well, especially my left leg.  I had sinus tachycardia (heart rate 106-120) and increased respiratory rate (rate of 20)  with O2 sats 100% on room air.   My breathing and heart rate improved somewhat with 1 liter oxygen therapy, 1 liter of IV fluids, albuterol inhaler, and decadron 6 mg orally.  It was thought that I had a delayed asthmatic/allergic reaction to the vaccine.  I do not have a history of asthma.  I was prescribed a Medrol dose pack and albuterol inhaler.  My hands and feet are very cold and tingling on 3/18.  Shortness of breath and chest pain seems to have improved but not completely gone as of the time of this submission on 3/18.

                                                I started getting fatigued around 7:00 pm that evening. It was hard to finish walking my dog. I was getting the chills to the point that my teeth were chattering.  I couldn&#39;t wear a shirt at this point because it felt like sandpaper on my back, but I did not have a rash.  I went to bed earlier than normal and woke up around 11:30 with the worst headache of my life.  My head was throbbing and pulsating and any little movement made it worse. The bottom of my head hurt, where my head connects to my neck.  My lower back hurt.  I woke up every 1 1/2 hours in pain, due to terrible headache.  After suffering for several hours, I finally took some Aleve at 7:00 a.m. the morning following the vaccine.

                                                As soon as the shot was administered in the deltoid muscle within 3 seconds my axillary node was on fire and I couldn&#39;t put my arm at rest.  Extremely painful in my armpit.  The injection nurse said that is not normal and gave me a sheet to report to the CDC scan code.  My entire left arm was on fire within a minute.  She had me sit for 30 minutes.  I had no other reaction.  My arm was subsiding a little bit to toleration.  I went home and rested, drank a ton of water.  I went to bed and woke up at 2 am in a cold sweat, I felt like I was freezing and could not stop shaking.  My teeth chattered.  My husband put on many blankets and helped me get warm.  He said I was burning up.  My muscles were so weak and painful, joints hurt and extreme head ache.  I took some Advil and he warmed me up.  My left arm was numb up my left side of my neck and my left cheek.  I took the day off work.  In addition, in the morning I felt like my left leg and foot had minor numbness and prickles.  I could walk but it was colder and prickled on the foot each step.  The next day I was 50% better and made it to work barely.  It took me 3 days to recover from the flu like symptoms.   My left arm continued to feel numb and had bouts of prickles and tingling.  The muscles were hard to use in my left arm and I really didn&#39;t use it at all.  Over the course of 2 weeks things have improved.  I still have not recovered feeling in my left pinky and ring finger.  They are weaker still today.  Every morning my left arm is numb for a little while (I don&#39;t sleep on my left side) but recovers to about 75% except my pinky and ring finger.  My left neck and cheek have a warming prickle feeling every morning for about a half hour.  They mostly wake up to entirety.  My L foot at the bottom has period/episodic prickles.   Daily my left arm is colder and is weaker than before.  I am a high school teacher so I don&#39;t have to use my left arm very much but it is causing pain and negative sensations and is reducing the amount of use of my left arm.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA:  Immediately after the vaccination my arm was sore and shortly after my right hand was stiff.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccination I began to have extreme chills and a fever that was near 102 F.  I had a fever and chills all night and woke up with a migraine.  After sleeping most the day from extreme tiredness I woke up to my head feeling very weird and I was acting very sleepy and irritable according to those around me.  After 24 hours, most  reactions have gone away except for soreness at the injection site and a pain in my right leg.

                                                Immediately after getting the vaccine I began to feel very strange with symptoms of light-headedness, dizziness, and lethargy. Around 3-4 hours later is when the real symptoms began. First, an extremely rapid heartbeat. My left arm began to feel numb. And I was seized by an episode of extraordinary fatigue. 6 hours after the shot, I was having muscle and joint pain to the point that I felt like I was being stabbed with knives - particularly in my tailbone, ankles, and shoulders. High fever followed, uncontrollable chills and shivering, intestinal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal cramps. The following day I had a headache and continuing extreme fatigue as well as pain in both arms.

                                                On 3/23, I received the vaccine. Within a few hours, my right elbow began to hurt and swell. On 3/24, I could not move my arm due to inflammation and intense pain. The skin was hot to touch. I also had a high fever and severe headache. (The fever broke within 24 hours and the headache lingered for about 48 hours.) On 3/25, the arm swelling started to decrease but was still intensely painful, red, and hot. I treated the arm with ice packs, Advil, and Bio-freeze. On 3/25, I also contacted my PCP by email with my concerns and progression photos of my arm. Another doc responded by having his nurse call me. They denied the reaction could be vaccine related. The nurse insisted on their diagnosis and that I should take antibiotics for a skin infection. I disagree because my symptoms did not match their explanation. On 3/31, I contacted my rheumatologist (due to the inflammation) and they referred me back to my PCP. I am filing this report b/c I believe this was related to the vaccine. Lesser symptoms remain.

Reflux symptoms at 4AM which caused me to take 2 OTC Gaviscon which gave relief. At 7AM experienced a fogginess and severe fatigue.  Lack of appetite throughout the day.  All symptoms continued throughout the day and that night.  Next morning at 7AM muscle aches had subsided except for some aching at injection site.  Took two ibuprofen for that pain.  Felt foggy and fatigued through time of report at 1:22 PM April 13.

That night she started feeling fatigued, developed a headache, had some body aches and chills that lasted through the following day, then symptoms resolved.  One week later on 4/14 she developed severe bilateral joint pain, specifically in bilateral shoulders, elbows, and knees- to the point where she could barely walk. She was also very fatigued and had chills. This lasted through the following day and started to subside, but then noticed small, papular lesions scattered across chest and arms. The lesions are itchy, small- 1-2 mm, and follow no particular pattern.  She states that today her symptoms have overall improved other than the small itchy bumps. Denies any headache, abdominal pain, joint pain, fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or redness/swelling of extremities.

While I was getting her tylenol she fainted, hitting her head on the floor. When she came to, she started experiencing the chills along with an irregular body temperature. I put blankets on her, gave her water, and tended to her eye. I was able to move her from the floor to the bed within 15 minutes. She fell asleep around 2am. She has been doing better but has been experiencing off &amp; on headaches &amp; nausea. We did not go to the doctor since we do not have insurance.

Day five, I broke out in a full body rash - Saturday evening. It started on  the right arm and it spread all over my body. It lasted off and on for thirty-six hours. It migrated over my body. I went to the ER, and they said I was having a reaction to the vaccine. She prescribed me steroids, I didn&#39;t take them because I was hoping the rash would get better without them. I went to my Dr. the next day - by the time I did see my doctor the rash was getting better so she said I didn&#39;t have to take the steroids. I was taking Benadryl from the time the rash started and continued until it was gone. The rash ended on day 7. Once the rash went away, I had fatigue for four days.

It eventually ran up right side of neck. A few days later blister-like welts appeared along right shoulder/upper back and later right side neck. A lot of pain and burning along right shoulder and neck followed and continued for 3 weeks. Chills and headache also followed for 3-4 weeks. Slowly the blisters opened and crusted over.

I had, in this order, compounded, with the peak happening about 12 hours afterwards: immediate dizziness about 10 minutes after the shot, nausea started about 30 min, at 4 hours a strong headache that didn?t go away until now, took Tylenol at 7pm, stiffness in the joints, hands, and feet started about 6 hours of shot, at 8 hours pain in the shoulders and neck, at 12 hours cramping all down my back and my hips and low fever. Fever continued until around 6am despite taking more tilt at 2am. Finally got to sleep at 6am. Woke with remaining stiffness and headache at 7:30am. Nausea continued for another 6 hours. Headache continued for another 6 hours. Muscles remained sore due to severe cramping last night.

                                                Experiencing muscle weakness in my proximal muscles severe enough to be in a wheelchair.  The symptoms began three days after my vaccination.  I had COVID-19 (diagnosed Feb. 1st, 2021) and 3 days after my COVID symptoms went away, I had severe weakness in my proximal muscles which put me in a wheel chair for 4 weeks. I was diagnosed as a &#34;long hauler&#34; with Post-Covid syndrome.  I had just started walking again on Monday, March 15, 2021 and my vaccine was Friday,  March 19, 2021.  I asked my neurologist prior to the vaccine if he thought it was safe for me.  He assured me that it was.  I started experiencing muscle weakness again 3 days after vaccination, which coincidentally, was the same time frame that I experienced these same symptoms post COVID.  It appears the vaccine caused a relapse of post-COVID syndrome.

I wasn?t able to wake my husband and remained as calm as possible. I drifted in and out of sleep. By 4am I was able to wake my husband. He used our elevating bed to sit me up and gave me ibuprofen and water through a straw (not sure why that was his solution and just thankful I?m here today to type this response). By 6am I had terrible shooting pains in my hands, fingers and then Charlie horses in my feet and calves. That is when the ability to move came back. At that point I was extremely fatigued and exhausted and felt like I had a terrible flu. I was in bed for the next 6 hours clammy and  sweaty and in a very achy.  24 hours after the vaccine I was back on my feet.  50 some hours after the vaccine I still have an aching in my hip on my left side and tenderness at the injection site.

It&#39;s been over a month and the injection site is numb to the touch, while the surrounding area burns, tingles and is soar to the touch. If I move my arm a certain way, I will get a tingling shock in the area (feels like hitting funny bone). Muscles up and down arm burn after non-strenuous activity.

The next morning I woke with a mild headache, body aches started to return around 10:30am as the Tylenol wore off. Additional 400 mg of Tylenol was taken. General fatigue was experienced the rest of the day. After the 2nd night of sleep I felt fine.

I have also noticed that my vision is not clear is blurred and that continues. My stomach pain and pain in my legs continue at this moment and I am very tired.

                                                Starting  the day following the vaccine, I had shooting pain (nerve pain) in all of my limbs? both arms and legs. It has been more severe in my legs. The only time I experienced any similar pain was several years ago when I had shingles, except that pain was isolated to one side of my body and only in my arm. This pain is exactly like that except it is bilateral and is happening in arms and legs. I did also have the standard muscle ache post-vaccine, but this shooting pain is in addition to it. The nerve pain peaked about 32 hours post-vaccine and has persisted in my legs through today, which is 4 days post-vaccine. I have only self-medicated with ibuprofen or acedomenophen, which reduces but does not eliminate the pain. No signs of this pre-vaccine. Was feeling totally healthy? to the extent that I exercise daily and ran a half marathon a month ago.

Fell asleep, but had chills and muscle aches the remained of the might. The following day I was on the couch all day with chills, muscle aches and fatigue. Took a lot of naps. Around 4pm on April 7 I took about 200 mg ibuprofen for another headache  (I don&#39;t usually get headaches). The muscle aches and fatigue started to ease up by 8-9pm on April 7. Went to bed and woke up feeling myself again on April 8.

                                                I reported previously that the day of the shot (that evening at close to midnight) I fainted.  I woke up on my bathroom floor.  I walked down my hall and saw black dots and felt dizzy with nausea.  The next thing I knew I was on the bathroom floor and didn?t remember how I had gotten there.  It is Friday and I now am experiencing shooting pains in the side of my head.  I also have been experiencing pains in my calf muscles and some chest pains.  I am still extremely tired and having abdominal pain.  I have contacted my doctor?s office about the fainting but I am going to call Monday to get an appointment to get checked out.  I am concerned about possible blood clots.

It persisted strongly and then body aches and chills started shortly therafter.  Now, on the second day, I noticed a feeling of bruising around the same base area of my neck and around the front left collar bone, it feels like a nerve/vein is swollen and tender.

I stayed in bed for a couple of hours. At 5am I got up with all the same symptoms and took my temp which was 101.4. My head hurt like there was too much pressure in my skull. I ate toast and took some ibuprofen and went back to bed. These symptoms lasted for 10 hours. Then for the next 5 hours I just had a fever off and on and fatigue. 3 days after the shot the gland in my left armpit became swollen. It has gone down in size but still sore 5 days later. I still feel tired too.

                                                When I got the vaccine I fainted. I never fainted before with vaccines. The real problem started a week after I got the vaccine I felt extremely exhausted, and I&#39;m  having  a hard time getting up from bed in the morning.

Took Tylenol extra strength rapid release gel caps. Woke up at 11 pm with body aches, moderate/severe back pain, fever 101, nausea. Iced back and neck and called pharmacy at 1:30 am to see if I could take ibuprofen. Took 2 ibuprofen at 2am and that helped subside the back pain, body aches, and fever. Felt tired, achy, nauseous for the next 24 hrs.  Felt about 75% better 48 hours later, but still tired and off and on nausea. I also had a mild headache from day 1 - 3 and a dry cough that continues a week later.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine  On 4/12 I started having a lot of pain overnight, especially the left side of my body. My left hip is hurting really bad, my left arm sometimes hurts. My back is also now hurting. Nothing I take alleviates the pain, I have tried Aleve, Tylenol and Ibuprofen. I am extremely fatigued both day and night now. My bones feel very painful even sometimes down to my feet. While most of my body hurts, the left side seems to hurt more than my right side. When I got the vaccine I felt very &#34;out of body&#34; if that makes any sense, but now I feel very off. I also seem to be bruising easier than I used to before as well.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I developed a significant headache and nausea.    Approximately one hour later if I was in the sun I became overheated, flush and an overall feeling of nervousness,  I adapted to these symptoms knowing they would considered normal but I no longer feel these should be considered normal.  Around 7pm on Monday I started running a fever that started at 101.1.  Between Monday night and Thursday morning it bounced around but stayed between 101.1 and 103.2.  It did not go away completely until Thursday morning.  At least I hope it is gone for good.  On Wednesday around 10am I developed abdominal pain that by 4pm had me sitting by my car unable to continue for about 10 minutes.  It was extremely stressful and still to the time of this report is still has not completely gone away.  The most concerning for me is the back pain with it.  At the time of this report I still have a headache, nausea, abdominal pain with back pain and vertigo.  I have contacted my doctor&#39;s office and they have made notes but suggested I report everything here.  They have started me on baby aspirin and electrolytes as I am also experiencing interment diarrhea.

                                                Severe R shoulder/arm pain since injection.  Upon receiveing the injection I experienced severe pain in my R shoulder joint, but the nurse told me that was normal.  Over the following hours/days/weeks the pain began to radiate up my neck, down my arm and into my scapula and lat areas.  My range of motion (ROM) had become severely limited and I began to experience neuropathies in my right arm and hand.  I tried all OTC pain relievers which had absolutely no effect.  On April 6th, I was in so much pain that I went to an urgent care clinic.  They provided me with prednisone, soma and celebrex (upon completion of steroid).  In addition, I started myself on gabapentin which was provided in the past.  I have one more day of celebrex remaining.   While my symptoms are not nearly as bad as they were, they have not resolved.  I continue to have pain in/around my R shoulder, neuropathy in my R arm and limited ROM/weakness cross-body and above 90 degrees.

                                                I had the vaccine n Sunday, Tuesday morning I woke up with a very tight feeling across my chest/ rib cage area, particularly on my right side, underarm, under breast area. I also had some weakness in my left arm where the shot was given. The tightness in my chest was not affecting my ability to breath, I was able to go on my usual daily hour-long walk but it was concerning me enough for a call with a Dr. I had spent the day before (Monday) using a wood pellet BBQ so I though maybe the issue was related to smoke. The Dr prescribed a salbutamol inhaler which I have used before for seasonal allergies but that didn&#39;t really d anything to help with the tight feeling. The feeling of tightness remained all week (and still does to some extent 11 days later).  On the Friday I noticed a small dark spot, approx 2mm,  a bit like a blood blister on the back of my right thigh. I have had these before fairly infrequently, and I see a dermatologist once a year for a check up and they are not concerned, and they usually go away on their own. But, the combination of a new blood spot and the continued tight feeling across my chest had me concerned enough to call my regular Dr&#39;s office.  I was also feeling occasional sporadic aches in my legs in varying places. I spoke to a practice nurse who was very reassuring that she had spoken to many other patients that had also been experiencing chest tightness that had gone on for days after the Janssen vaccine, so after that I felt less concerned about the symptoms. I am still experiencing the tightness in my chest which has affected my shoulders and neck with what feels like muscle tension, and also been accompanied by some mild headaches at the sides of my head. I was pretty anxious about getting the vaccine which is not something I usually struggle with and on the Tuesday after the vaccine I felt particularly irrational and also very tired.

                                                At three AM I woke up with the room spinning, I couldn&#39;t focus, felt like I was falling. I had horrible pain in my back. I was sweating and vomiting.  My husband carried me to the car and brought me to the ER. At the Er I was given a patch for my back pain, medicine for the dizziness and nausea. The dizziness didn&#39;t subside. I couldn&#39;t walk. I told them I had gotten the vaccine two weeks before and they said it wasn&#39;t related. I was diagnosed with a bladder infection, high blood sugar, and vertigo. I was discharged in the evening but with no improvement.  I was not able to focus or walk for days. I saw my OBGYN, he was the only doctor I could see right away and he referred me to an ENT. The ENT can&#39;t see me until the end of June.  I wasn&#39;t able to drive for weeks. I am slowly regaining my balance but still feel waves of dizziness and my eyes can&#39;t focus well when I am reading. The back pain is gone. My OBGYN also doesn&#39;t feel the dizziness is related.

I could hardly move and felt an ache in all my muscles and bones.  It was very intense pain.  The entire next day I had severe body pain and severe fatigue.  I tried to go for a short walk and felt dizzy.  Everything hurt.  I took Tylenol regularly all day and mostly slept.  48 hours later I was feeling better.  Slowly regaining stamina and pain is now diminising.

Fingertips still feel like electricity is running through them and fingers/hands still hurt; extremely hungry/thirsty from 03/25/2021 - 03/29/2021; fatigue, pain at base of skull under ears, tinnitus extremely loud and both ears feel like ear ache; During the night of my high fever, lower back where kidneys are started hurting very badly.  What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

                                                Severe headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, dizziness, sore arm. Body chills started around 1am, by 7:00 a.m., I had headache and dizziness, with extreme fatigue. I almost passed out after breaking out in cold sweat by 8:30 a.m. Started running a fever around 9:30 a.m. Took Tylenol for headache and body pain. Slept until 1:30p.m. Woke with a fever of 101.4 and severe headache. Took more Tylenol and laid back down.   By 4:30p.m. I was able to lift my head off a pillow and walk without dizziness. Chills and low-grade fever returned around 6:30pm. Went to sleep.   Woke at 7:30 am. No headache, slight fatigue, sore arm. No fever, no dizziness.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

The flu-like symptoms included muscle aches, nausea, stomach pain including more significant pain in the upper left stomach area, headache and fatigue with difficulty sleeping.  I needed to take time off from work due to these side effects and had difficulty performing daily activities.  Also experienced pain at injection site that got worse in the first 12 hours and lasted also approximately 36 hours.  Minor nausea, stomach pain and injection site pain have continued after 36 hours with ability to return to daily living activities.

NO FEVER but major body aches and soreness. AFter the chills wore off I was in a sweat..this pattern of chills, vs soaking sweats continued throughout the night. Add to that dry heaves due to nausea but no vomiting. The dry heaves just added to the muscle pains that I already had. I was in bed until 5 pm the next day, no energy, sore body aches to the point that my skin hurt. still no soreness in my arm at all. I finally had the strength to get out of bed at 5pm took a shower and ate 2 pieces of toast to combat the nausea. Fast forward next day, felt fine and arm was mildly sore at injection sight. SO glad J and J is only one dose.. I would have dreaded a second day like that.

                                                At time of shot, burning in arm as serum was being injected, and extreme dizziness where I almost fell off the chair. Dizziness lasted for a few minutes which created nausea. Sat at site for approximately 25 minutes after shot. Left arm was sore between shoulder and elbow, which was to be expected. Later in the evening, experienced fatigue. When trying to go to bed around 11pm,  my left are was throbbing. I did take Tylenol at about 6pm. Throughout the AM hours, sever body aches started, extreme fatigue throughout the following day. Flu like symptoms continued the next day.  I had heard of these symptoms for the other shots but not for Johnson and Johnson. Hungry but too weak to actually cook.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 1:08 pm.  Once administered I was instructed to sit in the auditorium for 15 minutes for observation.  During that time I had a few heartrate increases and nausea but nothing out of the ordinary or concerning.  After the 15 minutes, I walked out to my car and thankfully my husband had driven because what happened next would have caused an accident.  Our drive home is approximately 20 minutes from where vaccine was administered.  In the car I began to feel a tingling all over my body that gradually began to feel like ?pins and needles? (like when you sit on your legs for too long and they ?fall asleep?), with the worst of the feeling being in both of my hands. I began opening and closing my fingers to try and get them to feel normal.  By the time we pulled into the driveway, my hand had locked up in a weird position and I was no longer able to communicate with them and make them move.  They were temporarily paralyzed.  My husband opened the door for me because I wasn?t capable of doing so.  Once I stepped out of the car, my body began to convulse and shake.  We stood there for a few minutes because one, I couldn?t make my body cooperate and two, we didn?t want our children seeing me that way.  My husband kept asking me if he should call an ambulance.  Of course, he should have but I think he was so scared and shocked that he just didn?t know how to react.  I had trouble forming words and sentences at that point and could not tell him to call. I felt pretty calm considering what was happening to me and I could not control myself.  My husband decided to walk away from me and coerce me to go to him.  I stood there for a few minutes trying to communicate with my legs.  Once I took my first step, my body stopped shaking and I started to regain feeling in my hands.  I went and laid down for a bit and began to feel a bit better.  Around 7pm I was feeling extremely cold.  So cold that I put on three layers of clothing and two comforters to try and warm myself.  That did not work though, as it was more of a cold from nerve endings than it was from temperature.  I went to bed around 9pm but didn?t fall asleep until around midnight.  I was feeling waves of cold down my body. Like a skin prickling when you hear a beautiful song and you get goosebumps and your hairs stand up.  I woke around 3am to an extreme headache and a fever of 102.6.  I took Tylenol and went back to bed.  When I woke in the morning, I felt better but had weird and random muscle twitching.  For the past few days I?ve been suffering with extreme fatigue which is not like me at all.  Even when I?m tired, I can still manage to function throughout the day.  Not only have I been tired, my body is weak, my muscles are weak and my joints hurt. I?m hoping this ends soon and doesn?t get any worse. It will be two weeks this Sunday.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I was vaccinated on Tuesday, 4/6--on Wednesday, I had the typical side effects of a sore arm, fatigue and muscle aches. On Thursday, 4/8, my arm was less sore and my fatigue and muscle aches were almost gone, however, I woke up with chest congestion and a cough. No fever but the coughs were painful--it almost felt like I had bronchitis. Nothing dire--I can breathe fine, no fever, I don&#39;t feel sick, but I just have this deep cough. When I looked up the side effects, I didn&#39;t see cough or chest congestion so I thought I would report it. Today is Friday, 4/9 and my cough seems to be getting better, although it&#39;s still there and I don&#39;t feel 100% yet.

                                                Shot at 12:18 Friday afternoon.  One hour later increased pain in neck where my cervical issue is a current problem. Around 7:30pm overwhelming fatigue and the beginning of chills and the start of low grade pain in joints throughout my body.  I took my medications and was in bed by 8pm. Over the course of the next 6 hours, The chills increased, sweating, fever 99.5, the feeling of my muscles and tendons tightening up and I would have to repeatedly stretch to relieve the accompanying pain, extreme thirst, nausea - at one point vomiting bile. The pain in my joints was around a 7 on pain scale. I could not get comfortable and was writhing from side to side. Around 2am I took a 2nd Hydrocodone for the pain. At 10am  I finally took Nurtec for the massive migraine.  At 11:30am (about 23 hours after injection) the headache was relieved, the joint pain had significantly decreased. My neck still ached. I was very fatigued and it was with effort to move from the bed to the couch. I slept on and off throughout the remainder of the day.  I had no appetite but forced myself to eat yogurt with fruit. It is now 11:44am Sunday. I still have no appetite. With exception of some mild fatigue and loss of appetite, all other symptoms have improved.

The day after the pain was better but I got a burning rash in both armpits. It was not raised and burned on the right side more. It was a solid area in my entire armpit and very red. I had no soreness around the vaccine site. I used steroid cream and took 50mg of Benadryl. Two days later it was gone.

                                                I received the shot in my left arm and experienced the expected symptoms of a sore arm and tenderness at the injection site the day of the shot and the day after.  Yet on the third day when symptoms were supposed to be getting better, I developed severe pain in my upper left  shoulder and across the back of my neck into the middle of my back.   My collar bone area on both sides was also sore.  I did nothing physically to explain this additional pain.  It was so uncomfortable that I spent most of day  3 and 4 after the shot laying around while taking Tylenol around the clock.   The worst of the pain was gone by day 5     but I continued to have discomfort in my left shoulder for almost another full week so much that if I wore a bra, I would have to take it off half way through  the day because it caused so much discomfort with the strap on my shoulder.  Everything feels ok now  that it has been 3 weeks since my vaccine but the muscle pain and discomfort was very painful and unpleasant way past the listed side effects of the vaccine.

Chest tightness and heart racing ? Simply felt I was going to die ? of course I didn?t but it was the worse feeling in life worst than flu symptoms

As injection was being administered I felt pain on inside upper arm down to wrist. Pain subsided. Day progressed. I used my arm to grocery shop. About 6:30 -7:00pm I noticed stiffness and inability to lift arm with extreme pain in attempts to lift arm. During the night had restless sleep. Had to use other hand to move arm into resting positions. No comfortable position.  Saw general practitioner on 4/12/2021. Received a paper with physical therapy exercises. Today, 4/13/2021, Still extreme pain to stretch arm to side and in front. If raising arm overhead with help in range of motion exercises (abduction) cannot lower arm without severe excruciating pain in inner shoulder area. New symptom includes numbness in wrist and forearm.

I would fall all on my bad and then gradually move my self by holding onto the head bead to actually get in the bed. This lasted 2 days and I had stopped taking the antibiotic because I felt so ill from the shot. I then began vomiting.

                                                I had the J&amp;J vaccine on 4/1/21.   I have a history of blood clots. I have tested positive twice. Once back in 2001 when I was pregnant and later on around 2008. I have had these symptoms before, but since I have a rare bone disease and have medical issues I really don&#39;t like to complain and just deal with this stuff with the pain pills I have a prescription for.   Anyway, yesterday I was feeling a little off. My hands, feet and limbs in general tingling. I had a headache which is rare for me and tried to drink extra water, but by 5pmish came I took a handful of tylenol since I had an after work walk to go on with a girlfriend. After the walk I came home and had a desire to lay down and go to sleep. my leg was starting to go from tingle to burn. i decided that i needed to eat some dinner. after dinner i was struggling with breathing while sitting in the recliner chair watching TV, so I told my other half I needed to lay down, this was around 7pm. Then it was just a crazy leg burn from the back of my knee into my foot. I was describing it as if I someone pour gasoline on me and lite the match and I was burning alive. I took a muscle relaxer and forced myself to sleep.   The day after the J&amp;J shot. i had chills and was so cold that mid day when I had breaks during my work from home, i climbed in bed with a heating pad to warm up. the shot also left a scare on my arm, which i found odd since i give myself six injections a week for my bone disease.   I tested positive with Covid December 20th, 2020 and it was a rough first week, but after about 10 days I was pretty much back to walking around and feeling better.    You&#39;re more than welcome to have all of my medical record information, just let me know what you need.   My doctor switched over to a different portal that I don&#39;t have access to and I haven&#39;t talked to her or her office since I had covid back in December and it&#39;s still a few hours before her office opens to report this, but I saw this on the news.   My leg is still tingling and stiff.  Again this is not my first time going through this, so I usually just push through it, but since I saw the news I am reporting it.

                                                Patient is a 47 y.o. female who is evaluated today for the above concerns.  Patient presents with concerns related to possible reaction to the J&amp;J COVID vaccine she received last week. She developed some face tingling/numbness, then felt like her throat was closing - not sure if due to lymph nodes swelling or possible reaction. She thought about going to ED or using epipen, but ultimately did not need to do either. She has been on zyrtec for her allergies which have been really bad too, so was not sure if that could be contributing. Later that evening she developed headache, chills, joint/muscle pains and fatigue which continued through the night and into the next day. She also had burning of her skin, specifically her hands and feet. She continues to have some fatigue, joint/muscle pains and mild headache.

                                                Within a half hour of injection, I experienced pain in my left leg (thigh muscle mostly). Throughout the day the pain spread to my left hip and left calf. Additionally, I felt like my muscles were ?on fire? on the left side of my body. I also felt a ?tingling? in my body, fingers and toes, leg muscles, primarily on left side. (I assumed at that time that this was ?normal?.) About 11 hours after injection, I experienced extreme muscle pain all over my body, lasting for about 12 hours. (Flu-like muscle pain and the feeling that all of my muscles were on fire.) The following day, I began to feel the feeling of pins and needles everywhere but primarily on left leg, thigh and calf.  By Thursday evening (three days following injection), I felt the most severe pins and needles feeling as well as ?itching? primarily in calves and hands and feet. I was so uncomfortable and panicked, I couldn?t sleep. On Friday evening, I felt intense leg pain and ?heat? on left side in both calf and thigh muscle and couldn?t sleep. On Saturday evening and all day Sunday I had a headache which I can?t say was related but caused me great concern. Now, eight days later, most of the pins and needles feeling has subsided but the pain in my left leg (thigh muscle) is at an all time high. Extra strength Tylenol is not helping. I did have a consult with my doctor last Thursday and I called again yesterday and I?m waiting for a call back. (Last Thursday, she agreed that my symptoms were unusual and thought I might need to see a neurologist.) Additionally - my left knee has bothered me and feels like someone hit it with a bat. I?m not sure if this is joint pain?  FYI - I have no apparent swelling in legs, no numbness, no trouble breathing and no significant headache today. I never had a fever or chills. The injection site burned for a few days (mild)  but was never red.

                                                That evening at 08:00 pm, I had chills, very slight fever (right under 100 degrees); fatigue. Saturday, I woke up without any of those symptoms but a terrible headache on Saturday morning - I had to go to work. It was severe enough for me to not go to work. Headache remained up until yesterday. The headache was pretty severe on Saturday, Sunday and I went to the doctor on Monday or Tuesday. I went because of the length of time of the headache. No meds were prescribed. They offered a brain scan which I decline based on the Dr&#39;s explanation of what the scan really does. Dr told me to take Tylenol. It was a &#34;cluster&#34; headache - the right side of my head towards the low part of my neck. The headache was always at that location. Tylenol was enough to lower my headache from the moderate to a minor. I didn&#39;t take much of it. I have not had a headache today for the first time since that Saturday. Muscle pain on my upper chest wall - it felt like I had been bench pressing - that symptom was on Wednesday and Thursday of last week (14th and 15th).

She also started to experience &#34;leg pain&#34; or &#34;tendon pain&#34; in the groin area.  All side effects subsided within about 24 hours except the leg pain.  It has now been 5 days and she is still having this pain with any movement of the body.  If she is resting and sitting still, she is fine.

                                                I had chills, fatigue, headache, and bilateral calf and thigh muscle pain that started about 6 hours after the vaccination and lasted about 36-48 hours. I took Tylenol 500mg after the onset of symptoms and three times a day. The symptoms went away by mid-day on 4/13/2021. Since then, I have been experiencing bilateral calf muscle pain off and on. I also had an enlarged axillary lymph node n the left side (side of vaccination). I reported it to urgent care on 4/18/2021 and was told the muscle pain was unlikely to be a clot since it was bilateral and there was no swelling or discoloration. I was told to hydrate and follow up with my primary care provider if it continues.  The calf muscle pain has continued - almost every other day - and responds to Advil. I have an appointment to talk to an MD tomorrow (May 5th)

In the evening, began to experience extreme fatigue, and in morning of Saturday, March 13th, 2021 began to experience fever, 100.3F, very bad headache, fatigue, and bad muscle aches--aching legs, back. Fever has is gone as of afternoon March 13th, however,  still experiencing headache, fatigue, and aching muscles, similar with what I experience when I had influenza B a couple of years back.

It felt like my bones were made out of glass and someone had taken a hammer to my bones.  My face was swollen and red.  Unable to sit up.  Walk from bed to toilet only.  Overall, I would say extreme flu-like symptoms.  Temperature 99.6 all day.   I could not take the pain any further at 4:20 pm and took 1,000 mg of Tylenol.  I finally fell asleep and woke up at 8:30pm and could walk again and my fever had broken.  I still don&#39;t feel great, but I think the worst is behind me.

That lasted through the night and I woke up with a slight fever, 99.9.  The aches were in my joints and muscles.  It actually felt like I was having back labor. I took advil, and I was able to sleep and sweat out the fever. These symptoms were similar to one of my worst Lupus flares.  These symptoms lasted until Tuesday, 3/9/21, afternoon.  The following Sunday, my joints feel extremely stiff and achy.  Not sure if it has anything to do with the vaccine.  I took Advil and it seemed to help.

Slight headache that started around an hour after injection and lasted approximately 24 hours.  Next morning felt muscle aches, fatigue and runny nose.  Felt like coming down with an illness.  These symptoms lasted approx. 24 hours after injections.  Felt completely back to normal again by 48 hours.

                                                6 hours after shot I began to feel major muscle aches and chills. Within an hour of this onset I had a fever of 102.4 and was wearing 2 coats, had the heat blasting, and was in  many many blankets and still chilled. This went on for about 7 hours. Also during this time my heart rate was elevated to about 100 beats per minute (normal is 60-65 for me). and also the hear beat seemed &#39;loud&#39; like someone was dribbling a basketball in my head (maybe this is a sinus symptom??). After these symptoms subsided I had a splitting headache for several more hours.

Because of this, I was getting nauseous and fever spikes. Then about 3:30am, I had water like diarrhea. After that, I started to feel dizzy (I was fine as long as I still) with cold chills along with being very tired.  When I got home, I took some Ibuprofen and took a nap (4 hour nap). Began to feel much better. When I woke up, I felt better but still had a stiffness in my shoulder blade area and left side neck.

                                                Upon receiving the shot, I immediately felt lightheaded, not dizzy or vertigo but just detached from my surroundings. I felt spacey. I felt like that for the rest of the day. I took Tylenol as the clinic recommended. Then after I went to bed later that evening I developed a headache that woke me up around 3:00am. I was very uncomfortable, experienced chills and was sore all over like I had worked out hard. I also experienced joint pain which I don&#39;t normally have. I still feel rough this morning and running a slight fever of 100F. I just wanted to report my side effects.

                                                Around five hours after shot I felt what I would describe as brain fog and light headache, by the evening I was aching, chilling and had 101 fever. Aches in my muscles and joints as if I had Rocky mountain spotted fever again. That is what the side effects reminded me of. This went on for over 48 hours. I have never been so sick. Very nauseous by next day. Also fell to the floor from nearly passing out the following morning. Took a minute for the light headed To pass. Arm pain still today. It was very scary and seemed to be a very serious reaction. Friday after noon finally started feeling better. The other strange part of this is that my daughter and best friend and I received the shot together in the same lot number and every one of us was deathly ill with the same symptoms. I am the only one with the fainting spells. Still feel fatigued today. And shoulders and left arm injection site still sore and achy.

Within approx. 30 minutes, I was having extreme chills, some slight stomach cramping, and the neck/upper back aches became very intense. It felt like a case of the flu, but worse. I did not experience vomiting. I took 600mg of Ibuprofin at about 10:00pm Those symptoms ended at approx. 12:30am on 4/8/2021. I was quite exhausted all day on 4/8/2021. Throughout the day on 4/8/2021, I felt lightheaded and a bit dizzy. That symptom lasted for just that day only. I continued to feel tired through 4/9/2021. I now feel completely recovered.

                                                Weirdly despite a right arm injection - left arm ache and left thigh muscle spasms started a few hours afterwards. At 7pm heavy sweat and slight fever. During course of evening nausea, neck, shoulders and lower jaw severe ache by morning. Small sores (the little bubble kind) similiar to mild food allergy broke out on inside bottom lip only and passed only when soreness left lower jaw near late afternoon. Felt better by 5pm. Slight muscle aches in left arm, shoulders &amp; tiredness remained through following day April 2. As of today, 4/12 - I&#39;m having the heavy flow menstral cycle of a freaking teenager. Not fun. I&#39;m accustomed to a very light period at my age not the uteras ripping heavy flow of those first 20 years. Hoping this is a one time deal.

I was extremely thirsty which caused me to consume over 60 ounces of water overnight.  Woke up about 7am and went to prepare coffee and blacked out.  When I woke up I was on the floor and had a bursted nose and EMT was called.  I was transported to the ER where I was administered IV fluids, EKG and CBC were done but clear and I was diagnosed as severly dehydrated.  I was released about 5hrs later but the consistant feeling of constant thirst has remained even still today.  I have also had a lingering headache also.

Overall a feeling of ratchetness,  pain, and misery.  Next morning I woke with the headache  and sore arm but I felt MUCH better. By Monday, all I had was sore arm and slight headache. Now, today, Tuesday, I have small headache, some coughing, sore forearm and thigh (really weird because this just started). Overall I feel good and I am glad that Saturday is over!

                                                Initial symptoms was exhaustion and nausea around 12:00 pm. .  Headache, chills and trouble breathing followed.  Symptoms worsened as the day progressed.  I triggered a high heart rate alarm on my watch while sitting and dozing about 6:00 pm.   I ended up in bed at 6:30 that night and slept off and on with fever, chills, headache and throbbing arm pain until 7:00 am 4/9/2021.  I had to use my inhaler during the night to help breathe but do not remember the time.  The next day I was much better with the exception of tiredness, nausea and headache throughout most the day.  I have pretty much fully recovered on Saturday 4/10/2021 with only tiredness continuing to bother me as of the this report.  I am sleeping more than usual.        I did not notify the clinic of my reaction as they were closed over the weekend.

On Saturday,  I woke with up my equilibrium being off ( kinda like when you&#39;re on a ship ) and pretty intense back and joint pain.  By Saturday  night, my equilibrium  was a little better but I still had back pain. I went to see the doctor and was advised to take Advil.  By Sunday, my equilibrium was better and there was a reduction in back pain. Each day  the back pain has gotten better.

Next day, fatigue and muscle and joint soreness. It continued for almost three weeks. The third week I got calf pain that was very painful. I went to Urgent Care. It lasted until the next day (so for two days total). When I woke up on the 6th it was gone like it wasn&#39;t even there. The third day after the vaccine, the injection site started hurting - but not swollen or anything. The muscle at the injection site still hurts - the pain comes and goes.  I did get an iron transfusion (march 8th) before the vaccine - I had a doctor&#39;s pass to take the vaccine.

                                                Headache and general tiredness began 30-45 min after shot.  Muscle soreness (injection site, rib muscles, leg muscles, back muscles and neck muscles) began soon after.  By 6pm, muscles had become painful.  I had chills but no measurable fever.  I got in the bed but unable to sleep due to muscle pain and discomfort.  Hip joints and back began to ache.  Fever and chills worsened over the next several hours to measurable with highest at 102F.  I took 1000mg tylenol generic which did not lower fever but fever did not rise higher.  Throughout the night, I experienced calf muscle cramps and foot cramps, stomach pains, joint pains, inability to sleep, worsening injection site soreness and armpit soreness (likely lymph node soreness).  Once in middle of night I may have felt chest tightness but I even doubted that I really experienced it as I had been thinking about all the AEs I was experiencing.  Symptoms continued through night.  Next morning, developed a cough so I made appointment to get a COVID exposure test at 1pm on 13th April because I had flown in plane on 10th April.   Cough could have been due to allergy type post-nasal drip because of high pollen in area.  By late Tue evening, I felt better.  Headache had resolved and muscle symptoms improved.  Now (3:45pm on 15th April) I am still experiencing lymph node/armpit soreness and general inability to focus, think clearly.  I feel like I am in a fog.  I emailed a message to my physician and reported this through VAERS

                                                The evening after the vaccine was administered I experienced severe pain in my right leg (4/10 at 7:30pm). The pain occured in the groin and knee area and mostly through the thigh. I took 1000mg of Tylenol and it helped resolve the pain. The following day (4/11) I experienced the same leg pain and continued with Tylenol which helped. Monday I had dizziness and almost fainted so I went to the ED to get examined (4/11). I have a family history of blot clotting and carry the prothrombin gene mutation so I&#39;m aware of issues with leg pain and get evaluated. The pain has continued over the week and is now in my left leg with mild pain. Visited walk in clinic to have a follow up on 4/15 and they administered a Covid test.

                                                At 6 A.M on 4/10/2021 (the day after the vaccine) I woke up with a pounding headache. Similar to a hangover. I had chills, muscle aches up and down my legs, fever, extreme fatigue and hot flashes. Site of injection was not sore at this point.  Throughout the day I felt weak and could not keep my eyes open for longer than 20 minutes. I fell in and out of sleep and took two aspirins every six hours.  The headache went from very bad to a dull constant headache that lasted for three days.   When the muscle aches in my legs subsided on 4/10 they then moved to my buttocks muscles. I could not keep my eyes open but kept waking up with chills, headaches, body aches, hot flashes and fever.   On 4/11/2021 I woke up feeling better but still had a headache. I felt weak and tired. Symptoms eventually got better throughout the day.   I did not feel any soreness in my arm until day three and four. Headaches subsided on day three.

Appetite started to return this morning, 3 days after the vaccine but the fatigue, weakness, muscular pain and a general unwell feeling continues.

On Tuesday, I tried starting ibuprofen, but it did not really remedy the pain.  I went to urgent care Wed. evening.  They sent me for an ultrasound to rule out blood clots.  No blood clots, but lymph nodes were visible in ultrasound.  They suggested I follow-up with PCP.  On Thursday and Friday, the leg felt crampy but less painful.  Friday night the pain traveled down my right leg to ankle as well as right lower lung had dull ache.  Returned to urgent care.  They are treating the leg for cellulitis (1000mg daily of generic Keflex.)  They said if the leg felt better in 24 hrs, probably cellulitis, but if not, it might be a response to vaccine.  There is no relief after 3 doses and 24 hr &#43; later.

                                                I got sick to my stomach an hour after getting the shot and it lasted all night. I didn?t have much appetited. I had vomiting and diarrhea for seven hours. I had hives about an hour and a half after the shot all over especially and my feet. The hives were extremely itchy, and my skin felt like it was on fire. The next morning, I went to urgent care and gave me an anti-itch medicine/antihistamine Hydroxyzine. The prescribed medicine knocked me out, but it only helped a little with the itching. The hives stayed for another four days. I have also had severe joint pain that is still lingering in my feet and hands. I don?t normally have joint pain, but it started the day after the shot.

                                                Approximately a half hour after the Janssen vaccine was administered on Monday, March 15, 2021 at 2:00pm, I felt a dull ache/sensation in the back, lower part of my head. No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

After the majority of the body aches subsided, I ended up with facial pain from my temples all the was into my neck. This pain occurred on both sides of my face and was so bad that I couldn?t lay on my side with the side of my head on the pillow. The pain felt like severe joint pain, but also felt like it was in my glands. It felt like my salivary glands wanted to burst.  I used CBD cream topically to try to help with the pain, also CBD tincture internally. Finally resorted to Acetaminophen 1000mg. The acetaminophen seemed to help the tiniest bit. Then my fever broke. Once I began sweating I could feel the pain in my face almost melting away.  This lasted about three hours. When I woke up at 8:00AM the side effects seemed to have all subsided. I still had a very mild headache.

                                                Immediately after the shot I started feeling tingling in my left hand fingers. At 2 pm I started feeling warm, not feverish. 12 hours after the shot I started feeling achy and cold. When I woke up on March 25th, I was achy, with chills and internal heat, no fever though. Basically every muscle hurt and I really couldn&#39;t move.  I spent the entire day in bed unable to eat or even move. I had to take the day off from work.   I think I had Covid in Feb 2020 before testing began. The symptoms I felt in February 2020 were exactly the same beginning 12 hours after the vaccine.

                                                I received the J&amp;J shot in the arm at 12:30 PM on 4/6.  At 7:00 PM -I started experiencing severe muscle cramping in both arms and both legs.  By 9:00 PM  chills started and were added to the severe muscle cramping experienced earlier. I took one Ibuprofen pill at 10:00 PM and tried going to sleep.  I was up all night with insomnia and muscular pain.  I had a low grade temperature of 100.3 starting around 12:30 AM.  Today, 4/7 I&#39;ve had low grade temperature around 99 and severe muscle cramping in both legs early morning.  Right now at 4:30 PM on 4/7, my temp is gone but I remain extremely fatigued and have muscle cramping in both legs.  I tried taking a nap today and failed to sleep. The last time I was able to sleep was Monday night 4/5. I am hoping this will resolve itself by tomorrow 4/8.  If symptoms don&#39;t resolve by 4/8 I will contact my PCP on 4/9. Thank you hope this information helps. I didn&#39;t expect to have insomnia as a symptom of this vaccine.

                                                Went to bed at 11 pm, woke up with severe headache, chills, fever and leg pain. Pain in legs became increasingly worse throughout the early morning, from the waist down. Became nauseated, chilled and fevered with severe headache and leg pain until 04.07.2021. I took an 800 MG ibuprofen on 04.07.2021 which seemed to help decrease the deep cramping leg pain and eased the headache. I did not seek any treatment because I figured there would be some side effects from the vaccination. I am still experiencing slight chills, leg pain, tiredness, mild joint pain and moderate chest and head congestion.

On Saturday evening my right arm started to hurt from my bicep to my fingers. When I woke up Sunday morning I couldn?t move my arm without extreme muscle and nerve pain. I wasn?t able to make a fist or grip anything in my hand. It eased up throughout Sunday and by the evening it was fine. Also on Sunday morning I vomited twice and once in the evening. By the evening I also had diarrhea, which is still going on. I woke up Monday feeling sore all over had a fever of 101.9. The fever broke the same day. Throughout Monday and more so on Tuesday and today I am constantly itchy especially my fingers. It feels like I have things crawling on me. I called my pcp yesterday (Tuesday) gave them my symptoms told them I had been vaccinated on 4/6. They didn?t call me back until today (Wednesday) &amp; wouldn?t let me split the office fee in two so they wouldn?t see me. I also called the pharmacy on Tuesday  spoke to the pharmacist was advised what was going on is side effects and I needed to report it. The diarrhea and itchy feeling is keeping me from being able to work and I?m not sure what to do from here.

I was standing in my kitchen and all of the sudden I became dizzy, my heart rate shot up, I became very nauseous and my  entire body became sweaty and hot and every muscle in my body hurt. My husband also received the J&amp;J shot at the same time and day and at 11:45 pm (15 min after I got sick) he was abruptly woken up out of a dead sleep to find himself running to the bathroom with severe nausea and vomiting. He was very pale and very very dizzy, his heart rate was elevated and this lasted for about 24 hours for him. We are about 10 days out from getting the vaccine and I still have muscle pain in my legs.  All other symptoms lasted about 24 hours.

                                                The next day after the vaccine around 12n I began feeling really fatigued and developed a fever off and on through out the day which went as high as 101 causing me to take a tylenol.  I had chills, muscle aches and a cough started.  I had a headache on Sat and Sunday. Sunday I was still fatigued,  slight temp, winded and lightheaded more than dizzy.  The temp finally diminished by the Sunday evening but still winded and very fatigued to date.  I reached out to my PCP for the SOB I was experiencing who advised if it gets any worse to go to the ER for further assistance and the symptoms still persisted so on Tues I went to the Urgent Care but they referred me to a outside makeshaft to setup for COVID testing but nothing still was done.  So  I went back to ER who checked my O2 sats which was good but still nothing was done there either and I am still experiencing the SOB.   I developed a bruise on my left forearm which developed yesterday and today my lower legs has developed various light colored little greyish looking bruises and is very sensitive to the touch.

I have developed a limp and I dont have the strenght in my hands and feet that I once had.  When I push myself to perform activities the numbness , fatigueness, and pain is just so intense that its nearly impossible.  If I continue to try to push myself to perform activities its as if my body begins to shut down and does nothing.  Its as if im ok until I begin to perform any body activities.

Fingertips tingling, leg cramp if walk, can&#39;t form word, sharp pain on collar bone (only happen once). Janssen vaccine was administered on Apr 12, 2021. On the same day I have severe headache and mild pain on muscle. Severe headache extends to the next day and occasionally happen during the first week along with mild to moderate muscle pain. On the second week (Apr 19 to Apr 23, 2021) have frequent muscle pain, muscle on calf becomes stiff and harden and occur more frequent. It alternates between right calf and right forearm. I also often have tingling on fingertips, numbness on hand and feeling fuzzy on arm, legs. Symptoms comes and goes but get worse if have short walk. Foot and back of the knee on right leg cramp and more stiffness and more pain. On May 2, I woke up with numbness on my right foot and discover red spot on the instep. This prompt me to go to Urgent care. Since numbness and feeling of fuzzy along arms and legs but at the urgent care could not diagnose since they don&#39;t have tools to run the test so they advise if it bothers me, I should go to the ER. I worry about high cost of ER so I went home and plan to go see family doctor on Monday but just 5 minutes away from urgent care, I have trouble saying out the word that I want to say. It just doesn&#39;t come out although I try to form a word. At that point I more concern if I would have stroke so I ask my husband to turn around to go to Emergency Room. While waiting to be treated, numbness occurs more on feet and under of the forearms, Doctor run blood test, order ultrasounds, MRI scan on the head and EKG. All result came back normal but numbness and headache still persistent. I was discharge in the evening but still have no idea what cause it. The discharge paper indicate that it is &#34;Paresthesia&#34; and I believe Janssen vaccine is the cause for all the symptoms that I have. I still have numbness on feet and leg stiffness still occur even sit down for less than 5 minutes. Should the staff administered the Moderna type that I have signed up for. I believe this side effect won&#39;t happen to me. I signed up for Moderna but after check in, the staff show a note &#34;L@837&#34; to the fire fighter. I don&#39;t know what it means but heard their conversation that &#34;We don&#39;t do that today&#34; then after vaccine was administered, I found out that it is Janssen that I have not signed up for.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms within an hour after receiving vaccine injection:  consisted of right-sided facial numbness, right-sided eyelid droop, right-sided mouth turn, right-sided tightness in neck muscle, pressure behind right eye, headache, loss of balance, difficulty speaking.  The injection was at 3:15 pm and started with arm soreness and stinging, a slight headache, and some tingling in my right hand while waiting 15 minutes after the shot, I had also felt a sensation going up the right side of the back of my neck almost immediately after the injection.  The Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms started by 4:00 pm.  I had a low-grade temp that evening of 99.9.  I emailed my neurologist who I see for migraines, of my symptoms.  The following morning on 03-10-2021 I woke with a severe migraine, fullness in my right ear, more pressure behind my right eye and it is watery, with new ringing in both ears, louder in the right ear.   Still residual numbness and drooping of right side of face and eye, tightness in right side neck muscle in front, and speaking better.   Woke up on Thursday morning 03-11-2021 with flu symptoms and migraine gone.  Eye pressure still there and now having significant pain moving my eye and now more feeling of fullness in my right ear.  Eye pain was concerning.  Dr advised me at this time if symptoms have continued or gotten worse to go to the emergency room.   Today, Saturday 03-13-2021, I am still experiencing moderate eye pain behind/above my right eye with pressure.  I am continuing to treat the pain with oxycodone prescribed by ER Physician.

                                                I am having neck pain and left arm pain.  I would say that the arm pain may be muscular.  I have been taking  ibuprofen and tylenol fo the past few days.  I went to the Chiropractor and had temporary relief of the neck pain.  It lasted for maybe 10 minutes it is hard to turn my head to the left.  I am just letting you know about the reaction.    The other thing is that the injection area the first day was very itchy I know better than to scratch it.  It becomes very itchy on and off yesterday and today.  These are probably not what you want for adverse side effects but I am letting you know that this is the case with me.

I used IcyHot with Lidocaine on the spot throughout the day. I took Aleve pain reliever, and iced the location also. Pain is very slowly subsiding. Still sore now (72 hours after vaccination) but am able to do daily functions.

                                                About 7 hours after the shot I was slightly light-headed but not badly then started to feel pain in my left shoulder joint, then left armpit, then soreness in my neck and upper back on my left side with beginning of headache. 2 hours later I developed fever reading 100.1 and got sniffly, headache increased a lot. Lay down. Headache increased, as did muscle aches which spread to all over but stronger on left side. My left knee, which had had a cortisone shot for pain on Monday and had been hurting less since Wednesday, suddenly hurt SO much! Took ibuprofen with slight relief of aches but not much help to headache or knee pain. Have had to ice knee continually and can no longer walk without limping, more actions than usual result in pain spikes in my knee. Headache and chills/fever constant all that night, along with aches and a lot of knee pain. Next day (today) headache, fever continuing, plus left shoulder join &amp; armpit pain, joint aches in general &#43; lots of knee pain. Took ibuprofen again. Helped enough to do basic things. Am resting with icing knee. Will be going back to bed shortly. (It has been 28 hours since my J&amp;J shot.) Please note: I do not normally take Ibuprofen (or Tylenol) unless desperate since it makes me nauseous.

                                                Background: With Chrohn&#39;s and with the Erythromycin - I had some fatigue; stomach upset; and joint pain. I didn&#39;t go into it with no symptoms. These that I am reporting would be increased. I could feel injection go into the arm. By the morning of the 15th, I think, increase joint pain and fatigue from my baseline. My knees; feet hands - achy in the joints themselves. Fatigue: wishing I could have a nap throughout the day. These lasted for about a week. I had stomach upset that I believe may have been from the Erythromycin - but that didn&#39;t change that stomach upset - still had it... it may have gotten a little worse (the nausea. By morning of the 23rd, I took 2 mg Ondansetron for that nausea. That helped a lot with the nausea. Around 2 am on the 24th, I woke up from a very bad nightmare and I woke up with a pounding heartrate. My chest was really thumping. I got up to the bathroom. My heart kept pounding harder and faster and didn&#39;t come down. My watch said tit started going up to:  122 to 144  to 154 and it kept gradually going up. I was petting the dog and sitting in the recliner. I phone my Dr&#39;s on-call number and spoke to him on the phone. I called 9-1-1 by his advice. Paramedics came - Heartrate stayed up.  I was still able to walk around the house. I followed up to their truck and they checked me over. By that time as they were taking my vitals my heart rate started to calm down.  (It was elevated about 15 minutes about all together) My blood pressure - 160 over 110 when the paramedics checked me but that was coming down as they had me at the truck and the heart rate went down to 80-90 and was continuing to go down. It hasn&#39;t come back.  They listened to my heart. Never had that happen to me before like that. Didn&#39;t have to go to ER. I do have the apple records of my heart rate, etc. if needed. The joint pain and fatigue faded back to my baseline.

My chest pain was sharp, stabbing pain that comes and goes, intermittently. I am on day 24 with chest pain. I was referred to the heart doctor, they did an EKG which was normal. MY PCP did a tri-triponent blood test was normal, an also ordered a D-dimmer and it was elevated, i was sent to ER to check for pulmonary embolism which was clear. Another EKG was done and it was normal. My electrolytes were normal. I had stress test this morning 04-14-2021. My PCP ordered platelets due to my left leg pain and heavy feeling and burning feeling that comes and goes. My platelets were normal. My WBC is very low and  I have an echocardiogram scheduled on Monday. The ER doctor said that the vaccine caused the inflammation on my body and my chest, having an auto-immune reaction.  I still have chest pain.

                                                On March 21, 2021 at around 5:30 I had fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness. The next day, March 22, I had heart palpitations, dizziness and still fever.  On March 24, 2021 at approximately 8:00 pm, my right leg became heavy and felt numb. On March 25 I woke up to my mouth locked with Bell&#39;s Palsy like drooping on the right side of my face.  My mouth remained unable to open fully for the next day and the numbness and pain in my leg increased.  On March 26 I went to the ER because I was afraid I was having a stroke. They gave me tests and said I did not have a stroke. They gave me steroids and they helped with my jaw but the pain in my leg increased. The pain in leg continued with more pain in my knee. I followed up with my family doctor and they sent me to have an ultrasound of my leg to check for a blood clot on April 9th No blood clot was found. Pain continued and increased so the doctor sent me for an MRI on April 14. MRI showed moderate effusions to the knee joint and I have an appointment with a orthopedic doctor on Tuesday April 20th. I continue to have stabbing pain in my knee and swelling and discomfort.

Following the headache I experienced bruising on my thighs, tightness in my left arm, bruising oat the injection site for at least one month and a weighted feeling on my chest along with tightness and shortness of breath. Subsequently, I experienced blurred vision and loss of sight one month following injection. The loss of sight lasted close to 10 minutes.

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the , vaccine on April 5 at 3:15 pm, I had uncontrollable shivers and chills, shaking violently through my whole entire body.  I was freezing cold to the bone.   I felt nauseous and threw up my entire dinner.  That didn&#39;t make the nausea go away - I continued to throw up that evening 5 or 6 more times.  The nausea continued the next day making me throw up 3 more times.  And yet the nausea persisted for a whole entire week.  I had a horrible headache that night that has stuck with me these last ten days.  My muscles ached and shot strange pangs through my body.  I was exhausted.  I could not stay awake.  I was so weak and tired.  I had no energy and just laid in bed for a solid four days. My throat hurt, my neck hurt, my head hurt, my arm where the shot went in hurt so bad.  Very strangely, my stomach was constantly bloated and hurt inside like a bad stomach ache - even if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything it still bloated and hurt.  The painful stomach lasted seven or eight days.  I had diarrhea for those seven /eight days.  I was completely dehydrated.  The diarrhea lasted way too long - it was difficult to return to work.  The second day after the shot I woke up to my left eye red, like some blood vessels had burst.  It took four or five days for my eye to go back to normal.   my heart has a stabbing feeling randomly all the time now and it is hard to breathe.  I wheeze and cough all the time.  It is very uncomfortable.  This heart issue has persisted the entire time since getting the vaccine.

                                                Immediate muscle tension in left arm  following vaccine shot in left arm.  The soreness persisted for several days. Painful to lift left arm higher than my shoulder.  The morning of day 3, I woke up to feel a pronounced skin irritation under my left armpit.  Later that day, I noticed a small welt on my left arm and the irritation had grown to include my upper left arm front and back. Over the next few days, the number of welts increased and the pain was increasing from the skin irritation. The tension in my shoulder started to give way to feeling tightness in my left chest.   I reported the symptoms. I tried to report to the Health Department, but they wouldn&#39;t take a report stating that the symptoms I was reporting did not match &#34;known symptoms&#34;.  On 4/13/21, I went to the Urgent Care to have the rash examined. The doctor tentatively diagnosed as Shingles. However, because of the chest pain, he referred to the Emergency Room for blood tests to rule out a possible Pulmonary Embolism.  The blood tests came back normal. I was prescribed 12 Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and discharged.  On 4/15/21 I returned to Urgent Care because the welts were continuing to spread and the pain was increasing. Including sharp pains associated with the shingles. At this visit I was prescribed 21 tablets of Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen and 21 tablets of ValACYclovir.

My chiropractor pointed it out that it was visible. One at the base of my skull one on my right pectoral muscle and in both arm pits. The one on my occipital region is the most painful. The one on the left side are still swollen after four weeks. The one in my arm pit was painful with palpating it.  They have seemed ot reduce in size but they are still swollen.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

The fever and flu symptoms went away after 24 hours but the stabbing chest pain lasted for 37 days. The pain was in the center of my chest in different places and it felt like tightening and clenching. The D-Dimer  was elevated and other tests were normal. My Platelets were tested later and were normal. Doctors indicated it was an inflammatory immune response. I went to a Cardiologist for a Stress test which showed ST depression. The chest pain stopped after 37 days. I did have shortness of breath which came and went over the course of four weeks. I am normally in good shape and I run, dance and work out two to four times a week. I have been unable to work out since this began. I also had lightheadedness, chest pain and palpitations seemed to go together. I still have lower back pain and Tinnitus which started two and a half weeks after the shot. It has been five weeks.

I had a rash on my right shoulder four days after the shot. It was a red patch that was itchy and lasted for two days.   Two weeks after the shot I had leg fatigue and weakness. I normally get tension headaches but the pain in my left leg was from my knee to my groin. It started as a sharp pain and then it became a dull ache that was there all day. The leg pain was spreading, and my headache had been there for four days. I was advised to go the ER because of family history and the current news about the vaccine.  I was discharged after eight hours and all tests were negative. I was told that the headache had progressed to a Migraine and prescribed Toradol.

                                                Shortly after getting the shot she reported feeling &#34;off&#34; as she was driving she started feeling short of breath and her heart was racing. When she got home around 5 PM she was still feeling short of breath and reported that her heart was racing. She was unable to speak clearly, but was stating that it was due to be being short of breath.  She also reported feeling lethargic and fell asleep until the next morning. She slept until approximately 12 pm the next day. When she woke up she reported feeling right sided cheek tingling. At that time she thought she had just slept wrong. When she attempted to walk down stairs she was limping and reported just feeling very weak on her left side. On Wednesday she slept in late again complaining of lethargy. When she awoke that Wednesday (3/10) her speech was markedly slurred. She was also saying things that didn&#39;t make sense. She was dragging her left leg when she tried to walk. We immediately took her to the ER and she was worked up for stroke. When she was triaged in the ER we mentioned that she had just had her COVID vaccine and voiced concerned that maybe she had a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She was admitted to hospital on 3/10 for a possible stroke.  Her MRI was done later on 3/11, Her MRI showed that she has strokes on both sides of her brain in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The doctor referred to her stroke as being caused by a &#34;showering of clots&#34;. The doctor said this usually only happens to someone with cardiac issues. My mom has no cardiac history. Her doctor ordered an 2D Echo of her heart and no abnormalities were found (3/12).   She is still disabled from her stroke. She was hospitalized from 3/10 - 3/16. She was the discharged to other care facility from 3/16-3/26. She is currently needing outpatient rehab in a day neuro program. She attends this at outpatient facility. She has to walk with a cane due to persistent left leg weakness. Her speech has a slight slur, and she suffers from short term memory loss. She intermittently has trouble with her equilibrium and reports feeling dizzy. She sometimes has a hard time swallowing or says that it doesn&#39;t feel right when  she swallows. She also trouble with word retrieval. She has left-sided neglect which correlates  left eye visual deficits. She currently requires care from a general physician, neurologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, neuro ophthalmologist and neuo psychologist. She was started on a new medication regime 325 mg aspirin daily, plavix for 21 days (now completed), metformin, amlodipine, coreg and losartan. She is going to need outpatient rehab until at least June from the last update we received from her rehab doctor.

First dismissed this as &#34;sleeping in the wrong position&#34; or tension from work.  Headache/muscle ache tightness really has not gone away since receiving the vaccine.  Have been to chiropractor 3 times for adjustment with no improvement.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

I had a fever and am still fighting this fever.  It was at 103 on Sat.  It was 101 this morning. I feel fluish-body aches, headache, eye sockets hurt, exhausted.   On sat, after the chills, my legs hurt and felt like they were 100 pounds.

                                                About 5 or 6 hours after the shot , I developed body aches and chills and had a fever of 101. This lasted through the night, along with a sharp pain in my chest that developed in the night and radiated from front to back, which made it difficult to sleep. During the night, I took some rolaids and moved the couch to sleep more upright, because I think the pain may have been heartburn or some other GI thing (I rarely get this feeling, but I have had it before, and my last meal of the day was several hours before i went to bed and before my symptoms started). By morning the next day (Sunday), my whole left arm was achy, down to my hand and fingers, and my right arm also but not as severe. My left armpit felt tender (and still does today, but not as bad).  By mid-day, I started to feel better, the fever was gone, and by late afternoon, the body aches were gone. My left arm and hand was still tender, but not as bad. By Sunday night i would say I was back to about 80%, and by Monday morning, 95%, and by late Monday morning, back to normal, other than the slight tenderness I still feel (today being Tuesday) in my left armpit.

I had on Sunday, the day after I had pain under my left rib toward my side, leg and groin. I had developed red spots on my legs. I contacted my PCP and they sent my platelet test and it can back ok. I went in to see my PCP and he checked me and only thing he came up with  due to my auto immune disease it triggered inflammation.  I&#39;m still in pain everywhere and can&#39;t touch certain parts of my body, my Dr. can&#39;t figure out where it&#39;s from and believes it&#39;s from the shot. If it&#39;s not better in a week he wants me to go back.

She did not have any other symptoms until 8 days later when she had 104 fever, could not walk, had stiffness in all of her muscles and aching, diarrhea.

They ran fluids on her and at the end of the day they said she was okay to go home.  The next day the fever started again and he ended up calling an ambulance to take her to the hospital.  She went to Hospital on 3/16, who took her to another Hospital.  They sent her home about 4 days later and said that her symptoms were from the vaccine.   He called and he filed a report with them.

                                                The night of my injection I woke up with extreme left arm and scapular pain.  It radiated down to my fingers.  It all was heavy and number and tingling.  That continued most of the day.  The next day I was extremely fatigued and weak and stayed in bed.  I think had left ear and lymph node pain on the left side of my face and neck.  This continued for days.  By the 1 week mark after my injection, I ended up at the urgent care with facial swelling and extreme lymph node pain.  They stated it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine.  As of yesterday, I continue to have some swelling in my jaw and occipital region as noted by the PTA where I go for physical therapy.  I continue to experience extreme fatigue, worse than normal and dizziness.  My left pinky still has some tingling and vibration feeling.  I also still get cramping on this finger and on the ulnar side of my palm.

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

Later that evening I experienced some difficulty breathing, severe muscle pain in my legs, arms and shoulders, and moderate to severe headache. Burning but no rash around my hips and back that felt like severe razor burn.  Today, I am still experiencing leg pain, burning sensation and headache.

                                                An immediate burning sensation at the vaccination site as the vaccine was being injected. The burning sensation spread from the injection site upward to my  neck all the way to my right ear. The burning sensation then started from my injection site down to my elbow. The burning sensation stopped after a few minutes, then I felt silently nauseous and lightheaded.   After waiting 15 minutes I felt fine enough to go home. However, the pain and stiffness in my neck was ongoing throughout the following day and night and was only slightly relieved with 500mg doses of Tylenol every 4-5 hours.  On a couple of occasions the day of and the day following the vaccination I did feel fleeting chest pain, but not enough pain or intensity to warrant a trip to the doctor. This morning (4-11/21) the aching sensation in my neck and arm (primarily neck) have lessened, but still present.

                                                I had rear end pain started March 20 in the morning, it gets worse and worse till 3/23 that I can not tolerate and had to call clinic to make appointment. They got me in on March 25 (Thursday). Dr inspected and told me it&#39;s thrombus that caused huge pain. They did the surgery right away, removed thrombus. I never had blood clots problem and I was healthy, which my blood test result can prove. Thrombus generated 12 days after my J&amp;J vaccine shot, I am reporting this side effect. You may find all my medical record from Doctor&#39;s office.

                                                At 5:00 pm I started to have severe cold chills. I then developed a fever of 102.2 at 10 pm. I had severe nausea, body and muscle ache through the night. My fever spiked as high as 103.5 several times during the first night. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and it did bring it down.  All symptoms continued through out the next day 04.09.21.  About 2 am on 4.10.21 I woke up and felt much better and that continued through out the day. Sunday 4.11.21 I started experience nausea again with slight fever of 101 no chills. I have since developed some nausea in the following days but no other symptoms.

My pulsatile tinnitus also greatly worsened.  The worst of the reactions lasted two days.  Fatigue, muscle aches and injection site pain lasted 7 days.  I did not seek treatment, though I should have based on the information that is currently being put out regarding this vaccine and possible adverse reactions.

                                                I developed a low-grade fever nine hours after getting my shot on Wednesday morning. The next day, Thursday, I woke up with achy joints. Acetaminophen helped with the pain and the fever and so I felt better and was up and about by 3 pm that day. I was perfectly fine on Friday, but by Saturday late morning, I had a mild, migraine-like headache, like the feeling of having an elevated blood pressure. By late afternoon the headache started intensifying. I had a severe headache and great pressure in my head from Saturday night through Sunday night, and the acetaminophen wasn&#39;t helping much. By Monday morning, the pain had lessened, and I managed to get out of bed. It&#39;s been a week since I got vaccinated, and although I no longer have a headache, I am feeling woozy every now and then, like there is still pressure in my head.

                                                The night after the night of my vaccine I had a tightening of my whole left side, from my eye, down my neck, into my shoulder and chest and down left arm.  Then I started to get shooting pain all around my shoulder blades.  I brushed it off thinking that most people had complaints of feeling pain or sick the few days after their vaccines and then they said it went away.  Mine never went away.  After about 5 days it really started to worry me.  The pain was very intense- unbearable even- and i couldnt move my left arm or lie back in any way without incredible pain.  I called urgent care and they told me I could come in if the pain was bad but that maybe I wanted to see my regular physician to see what was going on.  I made an appointment with my doctor but it wasn?t until the end of the next week.  After 8 days, I couldn?t take it anymore.  I went to urgent care- they did an EKG and a chest xray and said all was normal.  They gave me an anti-inflammatory (naproxen) and a muscle relaxer. They took blood and the only thing they noted to me was that I should have my doctor check my platelette count.  They told me they thought it must be muscular.  I went home.  Neither of those medications seemed to help.  The pain was less in the day when I was moving around, but towards the end of the day it was getting so bad (still is) that I can?t sleep or get comfortable.  My doctor did blood work and couldn?t seem to find the source of what was going on with me either.  She prescribed me a new anti-inflammatory (meloxicam), a new muscle relaxer (cyclobenzaprine) and a pain killer (hydrocodone acetamin).  Sometimes those medications help- they knock me out- but when I wake up I feel the same.  I can?t take them in the day because they make me too loopy and tired.  I don?t know what is wrong. I can?t seem to get answers and  nobody can figure it out.  It is definitely my left side. I feel it in ky head, my chest, my shoulder and down my left arm and it has been almost 5 weeks.  It seems to be getting worse not better.  Looking for help or direction please

                                                I received my shot at 10 a.m. on a Thursday morning. Around 6 p.m. on the evening of the shot, I began experiencing severe chills, and I threw up once. The chills lasted approximately four hours. In addition, I had an extreme headache. Once the chills subsided, I began sweating profusely through my clothes. I still had the headache. Around 2 a.m. in the morning, I was unable to stand or speak for about an hour.  Once I was finally able to move again, my skin - not my body, but my skin - hurt all over. I could not lay on my back due to extreme pain in my skin, particularly the skin on my back, shoulders and buttocks. Anything that touched my skin, no matter how light of a touch, felt like I was being severely bruised. My skin was in pain for about four hours. The sweating continued through the following Sunday morning.  I soaked through multiple sets of clothing and woke up every morning completely drenched. When I weighed myself Sunday morning, concerned about dehydration, the scale reflected a 4.2 pound weight loss over the course of less than three full days.  The headache lasted through Tuesday, April 14th, a total of five days with a strong headache. I am still experiencing some sweating but not like the initial round of sweating. Because my shot was given on a Thursday, I only missed one full day of work. However, had the shot been given at the beginning of the week, I am confident that I would have missed at least three full days, it was so debilitating.

                                                Immediately after shot ...probably within 10 minutes or so I had vasodilation of my sinuses &amp; headache. It came together &amp; was quick like feeling inside of my nose swell &amp; slight headache. I WAS VACCINATED WITH MY DAUGHTER 18 YRS OLD WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES AND SON 20 WITH PRIOR HISTORY OF DENGUE IN PHILIPPINES. At night as it was getting dark,severe symptoms hit us at home all around the same time. Severe excruciating pain in the back of our head and it ran down into our necks &amp; jaw. I have had migraines &amp; it was worse pain in the back of the head. My son said it felt like dengue when he spent a week in the hospital,which comes with low platelets count. To me it felt like when I had infection in my left mound after double mastectomy and spent five days in hospital hooked to Ivs with 2 antibiotics &amp; they thought I had staff &amp; going septic. I had horrible headache with that. My daughter reacted the worse,she was crying with head pain &amp; shivering non-stop &amp; her body aches hit all over first. She slept with a hot pad on her head &amp; had ringing in the ears &amp; if she tried to get up she heard rushing water sound in ears &amp; felt like going to pass out. My body aches hit as I was trying to get strength to drive to ER if needs be,but if felt like crippling arthritis in arms wrists jaw legs knees &amp; ankles. I slept with hit pad on my head &amp; would move it to joints. Really none of us slept. Son had body aches all night too. Bad headache in back of head for all of us. Took 2 arthritis tylenil. All had stomach aches. Yesterday I was spinning &amp; severely dizzy. We are fatigued &amp; barely moving.

                                                I have not had a period or any period related symptoms for 13 months and had considered myself, by definition to be in Menopause. 13 days after the vaccine  I started having lower back pain, cramps and headaches. I didn&#39;t know what it was as I hadn&#39;t considered it to be PMS. The next day, day 14 post vaccine, I got my period and ended up in bed with lower back pain, heavier than previous bleeding and headaches. Today, is day five of the menstrual bleeding. While the bleeding is lessening, the cramps and headaches are not. This is not typical for me based on my recollection of PMS/MS. I am concerned that the cramping and headaches have not subsided and I am concerned as to why I am having a period after 13 consecutive months of nothing.

I experienced a reoccurrence for 4 days in mid April. I wouldn&#39;t have said anything but friends nagged us after the J&amp;J blood clotting issue.  (We both also experienced severe piercing &amp; throbbing pain in the bone beneath the injection  for about 14 days.) I mentioned both events to my GP on 3/26/21

                                                With autoimmune issues - I was unaware that getting this shot would throw my body into a severe flare up.   by 8 pm on the day of the shot - continuing for 3 days - I had an extreme PSA flare up in which my joints all swelled, could barely move, terrible pain widespread throughout my body.  Had I known that people with automimmune diseases may end up with a severe flare due to the vacccination - I would have opted to NOT get the vaccine.  It is my understanding that the test groups did not include people with the autoimmune diseases.   In addition to the severe autoimmune flare up - since that has resolved, I have had an upper respiratiory cold - runny nose, sneezing, now coughing and congestion every since.  So once past the 3 days of flare, I have had now 6 days of cold type symptoms that nothing seems to help - no over the counter cold or sinus medicines are helping at all.

                                                I felt pain in my left arm where the vaccine was injected, but not limited to the site, but also under the arm and in the full arm till the arm wrest.  Also, it included pain in the arm pit.  I didn&#39;t go to a doctor.  The pain was reduced after taking two 500 mg Tylenol, but there I still feel my left arm heavy and not normal.

                                                The patient received the IMZ and was waiting in the post vaccination area and noticed that her hands had turned blue. The patient said she had no symptoms and no complaints of any fever, tingling, or chills. As a precaution, the patient received a dose of diphenhydramine to counter the potential reaction. After advising the patient to seek medical attention, the patient mentions she spray lavender on her hands and that could have been it. Janssen was contacted and notified. They stated that that symptom was not a symptom found in their drug trials but that they would note it and to advise the patient to seek medical care, which was my recommendation as well.

                                                The day of the vaccine not much trouble, the injection site was a little sore. As the evening came I started feeling the body aches, the chills. The next morning  I had a headache, I had joint pains (elbow, knee and hip). My arm pain was really severe. I could not even sleep on that side of my arm, the pain was excruciating.  I also noticed as I woke up that I also had hives, and it was red and hot and itching, blisters, all over my hand. I then contacted my PCP and they suggested Benadryl capsules. It took about a week for the rash to go away, I finally can wear my ring back (hands were very swollen). Now, I noticed I developed a cough about after a week after the vaccine. The rash is gone off my hands but the skin looks like it is peeling (reminds me of when a person has a real bad sunburn on skin and the burnt skin starts peeling off) from all the blistering and the rash on my hands. I did have COVID in late November, early December. I tested positive on 11/30/2020. The new skin that is being exposed is really tender and sore. I notice with each passing day skin feels better not so sensitive.  I get a little bit better each day, a little more energy each day.

I can move my face/mouth/etc......but it just feels like when the numbness is fading and your feeling is starting to come back.......not sure if that helps for a description?    this happened right after I left the clinic,  it last maybe an hour or two I can&#39;t quite remember and has not happened randomly several times in the last 2 wks.  Nothing ever major - not trouble breathing or swallowing, etc.......just that weird sensation in my facial area best described previously when feeling is coming back after having been numbed by the dentist.  Not in my mouth but in my face--outer lips and face.   Lasts about an hour or two-is and then I&#39;m fine again.

                                                Day of shot (April 1): Immediately after shot, left arm was sore. Developed fatigue at 2pm. A few hours later, I had a 101 fever, chills, stronger fatigue, strong headache, muscle aches. Around 6pm, I began vomiting continuously. I spoke with an advice nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room. I continued to vomit until about 11:30pm, I was weak and felt like passing out a few times. Later in the evening, I took a Tylenol and finally went to sleep. On April 2nd (day after shot), I woke up with fatigue and headache, but fever was gone and I no longer vomited. I took another Tylenol and headache went away.

Fever stayed near 103 overnight until I took tylenol somewhere between 2-4 am.  By 5 am the fever was down to 101.5.  Fever stayed between 101-102 most of the following day (4/6/2021), dropping to 99.5-100 around  6pm.  Stayed low grade under 100 through the night and was back to normal by the morning of 4/7/2021.  I felt mostly normal on 4/7/2021 aside from severe muscle tightness in gluts, hamstrings, and thighs, with soreness in my lower back (unknown if that is related to the vaccine, but it was not present before 4/7/2021).  Today, 4/8/2021 the muscle tightness &amp; soreness remains but the fever is still gone and I feel otherwise normal.

I had tenderness under the right armpit for about a week (assumed swollen lymph nodes).I had redness on the bicep below the injection site on Days 5-7. I also was tired on Day 2, 3, and 16 and took short naps. I experienced some muscle twitching in the bicep on Day 1, which still continues. On Day 6, I woke up with muscle twitching all over my body, randomly and intermittently. I was able to go about my day normally, but every few minutes something would twitch for a few seconds (my right arm, my left arm, my left knee, my right hip, my lower back, my left pointer finger, my left eyebrow, my diaphragm, etc). I drank a lot of fluids and took magnesium, zinc, D, B, C, omegas, turmeric, a multivitamin, and ate a banana for potassium on Day 6 and 7. Day 7 and 8, I only had muscle twitching in the right bicep again. Starting on Day 9 and continuing through the present, I continue to have intermittent twitches lasting a few seconds all over my body again. It is less frequent than on Day 6, but continues.

                                                I received my vaccine about 3pm Sat. April 3rd. About an hour or so later I started to feel ?run down? but nothing major. At 9pm I began getting chills but did not feel feverish. By 9:15 my body was aggressively trembling. Even my teeth were chattering. I could not control the shaking. I put many layers of blankets on me and turned my heat up to 80 in an effort to get warm. At some point I dozed off. I woke up at 12:30am and had a fever of a little over 101 degrees.  I fell asleep about 3am, still aggressively shaking.  I woke up at 9am (April 4th) and my head was throbbing. My fever was now 102.2. Also, every muscle in my back and shoulders ached. I sat up because I needed to get to the kitchen for some water. Once I stood up, my body felt like it was weighed down by heavy sandbags. I could barely walk to my kitchen and back. I went back to bed and covered up in massive blankets and tried to stay still. I did not take any pain reliever because I was too nervous to.  I never had any nausea but smells bothered me and I had no appetite. My fever stayed at 102.2 until I went to sleep (around 10pm).  Monday (April 5th) I still had chills but much milder. My temp was just over 101 all day. My head felt better but my muscles still hurt. By late evening (10pm) my fever was just over 99 degrees. I was feeling better and I no longer had chills.  Tuesday (April 6th) I woke up fever free. I felt mostly normal again except for my muscle aches.  Today is Friday (April 9th) and I continue to have muscle aches. The worst of it is in my lower back and it?s pretty severe. It feels like I lifted heavy weights with my lower back muscles. I have not been seen by a Doctor yet as I have no insurance. I?m not sure if I need to or not.   I wanted to contact you because I am a healthy person and what I experienced was BRUTAL. I have NO IDEA how a frail or vulnerable person could go through what I went through. Also, people need to know that they may have to take time off of work to deal with these side effects.

Muscle aches and headache also began about that time.  Went to sleep.  Around 1:30 woke up with nausea and sweaty chills.  Walking to the bathroom was difficult due to extreme fatigue.  Fever measured at 103 degrees.  Took Tylenol.  Nausea resolved by 7am 4/10, but had no appetite. Fatigue throughout day (4/10) - slept most of the day.  As of 7am on 4/11, mostly better.  Remaining symptoms are a lingering headache, moderate fatigue, and vaccine site muscle soreness.  Perhaps some brain fog, as this form seems challenging and it shouldn&#39;t. Note:  I had had little sleep the week prior to the vaccine, which may have affected my reaction.

Around 6:00pm the same day I received vaccine, I started getting chills and strong aches in my back and legs. I felt very dizzy, lightheaded and sleepy. Chills were gone by the next morning, but aches and sleepiness continued for 4 days. Dizziness and lightheadedness continues til now. A little over a week after vaccination, I had random bruising on my legs on the same side I received vaccine. My lymph nodes were visibly swollen and my breasts felt extremely tender. Bruises are still healing, but lymph nodes and breasts seem relatively normal now, exactly 3 weeks after initial vaccination

                                                Received JJ vaccine March 10, 2021.   On March 23rd, when waking, a severe pain in lower right abdominal quadrant and right hip area began to occur. Pain continued thru several days, went to walk in clinic and they referred to ER. Primary care provider too far to drive safely.   Pain ranged from 3 to 5 with intense burning, stabbing or spasm.  Had only taken Tylenol at home before finally going to seek care.  CT scan and labs completed.  Determined to be muscle strain.  Pain medication did not relieve symptoms.   Applied ice and heat treatment with nsaids and flexerill.  75% improved by March 29th.  Saw pcp on April 9th. Scheduled to have ultrasounds this April 16th.  Pain is only level 2 every  other day and lasts maybe 2 hours.

                                                - within the first 30-40 minutes: I could feel numbness creep up my arm on the side of the injection.  It traveled as high as my eyebrow.  It felt much like an injection would if you were getting a filling at the dentist.  I couldn&#39;t see any swelling or puffiness but definitely numb.  This passed within the first few hours. - first two days - I was very sore and achy in my muscles all over my body, but on the third day it was centralized to just the muscles on my upper arm and under the arm kinda into the &#34;peck&#34; area I believe it would be called. - day 6 - today I have mild diarrhea and a slight upset stomach.

Lasted approximately 4 hours. Extreme dizziness for approximately 2-3 minutes while sitting still at 4 hour mark - resolved with rest except arm pain, which lessened slightly over the first hour but remained unresolved after 4 hours.  Within 30 minutes post injection - redness, heat, and swelling at injection site.   After injection (approximately 12-13 hours post injection) - Fever (100-101.7 consistently over 3 days), extreme fatigue, headache, muscle aches/joint pain, severe chills. Fever broke midday April 4, and other symptoms except arm pain and headaches slowly resolved by April 7. Arm pain remained at a fairly steady level throughout that time and past April 8 (one week).  Currently (April 14, two weeks post injection) - arm pain has lessened, but remains in upper arm. Particularly sensitive to touch or movement, but can be felt at rest. Redness is gone, but palpable hard lump and heat remain at injection site. Pain and sensitivity noted when medical provider palpated underarm lymph nodes on right side. Not noted in same action under left arm. Headaches continue intermittently.

Within first 3-4 hours had bad rash on arms, legs, face, neck and chest, fast heartrate, breathing and out of it sensation. I felt like I was having a partial analpylaxis reaction - like throat 1/2 closed but that I would be ok. I took Benadryl and used a Ventolin inhaler. Rash was better by 2nd day.  On 2nd and 3rd day I was having massive headache (felt like pressure from inside all over out to all cranial sutures), severe neck stiffness on rt side, lumbar vertebrate pain, iliosacral and hip pain, felt painful radiating spasms down my left and right legs, also jaw and teeth pain. Taking Naproxen and now ASA.  Very shakey and jittery. Occasionally have lower arm pain and numbness on left side. Also have injection site symptoms but minor compared to above. It&#39;s been 1 week and allergic part of rxn is over but concerned with possible neuro and bloodclot possibilties..  On day 2 or 3 I also had problems with my brain with reading comprahension.

Onset of right eye not blinking/closing. * MAR 21st = Emergency Room.  Diagnosed w/ BELLS PALSY.  [Ruled out stroke]  The following week after my vaccination (approximately MAR 15th), I experienced a strange feeling at the back of my throat.  It can best described as a &#34;sore throat&#34;.  I noticed it upon waking up.   I could feel it at the back of my throat when swallowing;  the act of swallowing would enable me to &#34;feel&#34; the sensation at the back of my throat.  This was unusual and not normal for me.  I thought I was coming down with a cold virus.  I had not been sick for over a year and thought it was a strange feeling.  I was concerned.  With the recent schools, restaurants, and gyms opening up with less restrictions, I learned from coworkers that there was an increase of illnesses  because our immune systems are not as strong and germs are easily transferable during the usual interactions.  Therefore, I expected my sore throat to be the start of a harmless cold virus.   Then, later in the week (MAR 19th), I noticed my eyes were abnormally dripping tears.  It is my experience that I get this effect in the office setting or during winter when my eyes are &#34;dry&#34;.  However, I was neither in the workplace (office), nor was it winter.  I was not sure why my eyes had excessive tears coming out.  Finally, on SUN (MAR 21st), an obvious physical symptom finally became apparent to me and my family members.  My speech was impaired.  I could not chew properly.  I could not drink from a cup.  I struggled during breakfast.  I was not sure if I was having a STROKE.  I recited the alphabet to hear for a slurred speech.  I looked in the mirror, and my smile was not perfect.   I got dressed and went to the Emergency Room.   The doctors performed physical PUSH-PULL tests, eye tests, etc.   DIAGNOSIS = Bells Palsy.     OTHER SYMPTOMS = &#43; shortness of breath.  &#43; leg swelling.  &#43; headaches.  &#43; excruciating pain in the neck, especially during sleep (laying down).

Those lasted until Sunday at 09:00. It just abruptly stopped. I woke up with rash all over my face and itchy and swollen eyes on Saturday and I went to the eye doctor on Saturday. I was given eye drops and and an anti-histamine; That is helping. I am still a little bit itchy on my face but it&#39;s better.

I ate a banana, drank lots of water and took a magnesium capsule to help with the leg cramp. and by 1pm I started to develop a headache.  I did not report because I have frequent headaches.  It intensified as the day progressed.  after Sunday, this became a daily occurrence. Early afternoon I would start to get intense headaches and i would go home take benadryl and sinus medicine to help  ease the pain.  Continued on daily until Saturday April 17th when my headache became so bad I could not stand it anymore.  I was nauseous and shaking.  No fever but profuse sweating and weakness.  Went to the ER around 930pm and was released around 12am after they gave me an IV with anti nausea meds and benadryl.  Sunday I was weak with headache all day.  Woke up today (Monday 4/19) with a headache and felt fatigued and severe headache.  It does not feel like a sinus headache nor tension, nor hormonal.  It is my entire head throbbing and left side of my head is sensitive to pressure.  I have not sustained any head injuries in the past year or longer.

                                                Saturday, April 3, my heart rate went up and I didn&#39;t feel well. My blood pressure was a little high. I did not go into the doctor at that time. My heartrate went basically normal that night. But it was doing things like that for a few days off and on after that. Two weeks ago this Thursday, (8th) I did go to ER - my back was starting to hurt and my blood pressure was high. I was prescribed a medication for heart palpitations - Propranolol. I&#39;ve taken it a couple of weeks. The heart palpitations have not gone away. I&#39;m having them quite a bit. I have to hit the button on the Zio Patch every time I have symptoms and I&#39;ve had quite a few.  Note: Shingrix vaccine on April 11th, injection on my left arm; and that was dose 1 or 2 - Lot # 444M2.

The next day the sore throat was gone, and body aches got worse. All my joints ache. I felt chilled in spite of outdoor temperature of 79, and a hot bath, blankets and sitting in front of a fire. It was 74 inside the house. I started to get a bit of a headache but it never developed into a full headache. At about 6pm (day 2) I started to get  hot. Anything touching my skin bothered me.   At about 7pm (day 2) I took two Tylenol and the symptoms improved by about  8:30pm.

I was experiencing headaches all day. The following morning on Sunday I woke up and passed out, I guess my blood pressure dropped and I don?t know why and this is never happened.  Had no appetite since Friday and maybe that?s why but my BP is 120/60 as of 10:08am AFTER I passed out at around 8:30am. I?m now feeling better all of a sudden, can drink coffee and hopefully I?ll get a shower....... oh and my joints are sore, I think whatever could go wrong , did!

I woke at 5:30 the next morning with a fever of 99.9 F, a headache, chills and body aches.  These symptoms continued throughout the day and were alleviated somewhat by tylenol.  I slept a large part of the day and felt better when I woke the next day, Monday.  On Monday I felt mostly normal but still had some body aches including a back ache on my left side.  I also had more injection site pain and a red rash about a half dollar in size that was tender to touch and by night time was itchy.

                                                Vaccination was 10:30 am.  Around 6:30 pm, my right knee started to throb.  I took an epsom salt bath, where my upper back started to hurt.  I went to sleep around 8:00.  I woke up around 10 pm unable to open my eyes all the way.  I believe they were swollen nearly shut.  I could see a slit of light coming in from outside.  I couldn&#39;t move my left hand at all (left arm is where I received vaccination).  I held it up to the outside light, and it was swollen.  The light coming in from outside hurt my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t see enough to call for help.  Around 1:30 a.m., the swelling went down enough for me to open my eyes.  I have never seen them look so bloodshot.  It was scary.  I could move my hand again as well.  I spent next day in bed resting.   Monday, I noticed a small rash on my right shoulder.  I went to work and was there about 20 minutes before I started feeling hot and dizzy.  I went home and spent the day in bed.   I was able to go to work the next day, Tuesday, without problem.  One week after vaccination, the rash on my shoulder went away, but a small rash broke out on my right shin.  This one was deeper.  One week later, there are just a couple of small scabs left in the spot on my shin.  I feel my energy level is close to normal.

Around 4pm the same day I had bad neck pain. And pounding heading, about 1 hour later starting getting chills and fatigued. By 10pm had body aches and muscles pains. I took some Motrin and went to bed. I couldn?t sleep as my mind kept racing. In the morning (day after vaccine) I was feeling worse. All symptoms continued in full force and I couldn?t get out of bed. 10am I was able to drink some Alka seltzer cold medicine and lay back down. I continued to have chills pounding headache bodyaches muscle aches and sweating, but no fever. I felt like I had a bad case of the flu. I?ve continued taking 600 mg Motrin every eight hours and this has helped with the pains and bodyaches. Day 3 woke up feeling much better, noticed a funny smell in my nose, I haven?t been blowing my nose or had any mucus, but I can?t explain the smell. I still have body aches and muscles pains.

She drank some water and then we took her blood pressure. she started to feel better and then felt a tighness in her neck. I retook her blood pressure and it was elevated. She then began having the chills, upon the last reading of blood pressure we call emergency services because it was elevated again. The last time we took her bp before emergency services came the reading was better. Ems checked her vitals and after a while let her decide whether or not she needed to go the hospital. She chose to leave and her son drove her home.

I will not be able to get to speak to my Dr. until Friday 4/9 due to his vacation.  The nurse was not helpful today and suggested I go to a walk-in clinic.

( I am not prone to headaches,  just mild sinus discomfort or slight hangover from alcohol)    This headache was much worse.  Arm pain increased as time progressed and spread farther in arm and even neck and lasted for 5 days.   I felt tired for about 5 days.  I had some mild headaches more than normal after the five days and until present.  Added note.  I don?t get sick often.  I worked as a flight attendant for 28 years and exposed to lots of whatever.  I don?t get sick with more than a little cough or something but never miss work.  I felt pretty bad for 5 days after this vaccine.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine  During the injection I had extreme pain in my left arm at the injection site.  This lasted for about 1 hour and then calmed down to a dull ache.    About 7 pm Wednesday night (April 7) I started a low grade fever of 99.6 degrees.  Over the next three hours it increased to 102 degrees.  It stayed this high for about five hours.  (During this time I also experienced severe, almost uncontrollable shivering.)  Then it slowly dropped back down to 100 degrees by about 5 am.  It remained there for about 12 hours.  Then at about 5 pm it dropped to about 99.6 degrees where it stayed until I went to bed at 10 pm.  When I woke up at 2:30 am Friday morning I was covered in sweat and the fever was gone.    In addition to the fever, I had a moderate to severe headache, extreme body aches and Joint pain, as well as exhaustion.  As the fever diminished, these symptoms did as well.    By Friday afternoon all I had was some body aches and joint pain along with a minor headache.    By Saturday I was fully recovered other than some minor discomfort at the injection site.

I woke about 11-12pm with my surgical sight burning and hot pain. I took my pain medication but it didn&#39;t touch it. After about 3-4 hours in which I took another pain pill, a muscle relaxant and a sleep pill, the pain and burning subsided. The site was then sore along with my left arm where I received the site. Today 4/13/2021 is the first day I feel good.

                                                Lady had vaccine, was told it was Janssen but lot # is Moderna.  She got the vaccine, the night of the vaccine around 5:30 she got a raging headache (she does get reactions to most vaccines).  She took Tylenol and her arm did hurt.  The next day she was still really hurting, her headache was really, really bad, and it stayed until Sunday.  Then on Sunday she was ok.  On Monday when she went to work and her right arm went limp, and while she was walking her right leg gave way and almost fell, grabbed hold and steadied herself.  The raging headache/migraine came back and she started getting nauseous, her lower back hurt, her upper neck area hurt like somebody was pounding her neck.  Then she got diarrhea and really really tired on Monday and Tuesday and also had loss of appetite.  Then yesterday 4/13/201 she just had the headache and a sound in her ear, went to UC and got drops for it.  Her temperature was 96.5, and her normal is 98.7, and was told that she was really cold.  Her PB was really high and the doctor took it again but it was not as high, attributed it to anxiety.  Last night the lower abdomen pain started, feeling like she was getting her period which she has not had in over a year.  She saw a little blood on her panty liner, and was thinking she was going to have a period, but the pain is excruciating in her lower abdomen.   She has also taken Tylenol off and on for her symptoms, and feels like she is cramping.     She is having hot/cold flashes as well, and has not had these issues from menopause.

                                                CEREBRAL INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION WITH FREE FLUID IN  BRAIN BEHIND  EYE; FLARED UP ARTHIRITIS; This spontaneous report received from a patient and concerned a 52 year old, White, not Hispanic or Latino, female. Initial information was received on 16-APR-2021 from the patient, with additional information received on 20-APR-2021 from the patient.  The patient&#39;s weight was 170 pounds, and height was 65.5 inches. The most recent body mass index was 27.9. The patient&#39;s family history included rheumatoid arthritis in father, and concurrent conditions included arthritis (possibly rheumatoid arthritis), chronic back pain, and hip pain. The patient was due for a surgery, but it was cancelled due to pandemic. She had no history of headaches or migraines. Patient received several unspecified vaccines (had several vaccines 3 years ago before trip ) with no problems. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805020 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 15-MAR-2021 on right arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid 81 mg, daily, ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, metaxalone, oxycodone, and zinc. The patient concurrently receives spinal/epidural pain injections every two to three months.  Approximately 16-30 hours after the vaccination, she had a flare up of her arthritis (left hip, L3, L4, L5, sciatic pain on the left side going all the way down to her knee, ankle, and foot, where her normal arthritis hurts daily). Pain medication did not help. She also developed migraines which caused pain behind the left eye similar to severe sinus infection, light sensitivity, her face felt tingly and numb in her temples and cheeks (left side). She was concerned about a stroke, but did not have droopiness and could smile on both sides. On 29-MAR-2021 (day 14 post vaccination), the patient went to her pain specialist to receive her spinal/epidural pain injection because she was in a lot of pain and she was &#34;overdue&#34;. In retrospect, the patient wondered if she should have waited longer after having received the vaccine before doing so. On 30-MAR-2021 (day 15 post vaccination), she awoke and was blind for several (12 - 14) hours. She thought she had a stroke and took 4 baby aspirins. She was rushed to the hospital and was hospitalized on 30-MAR-2021. After the initial 2-3 hours that she was completely blind, it would come back within minutes. The vision came back in halos. It was blurry but if she moved or bent down, it would go again and then it would come back very quickly. Several tests were performed. The MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) did not show clots, stroke, or tumors, but showed intracranial hypertension. After the CT and MRI, a lumbar puncture was performed (results not provided). The patient said that the hospital noted cerebral intracranial hypertension with free fluid in her brain behind her eye. In the hospital, bloodwork was normal except for her triglycerides which were high. Patient reported that her platelet levels which were &#34;perfect&#34; and provided &#34;318&#34; as a specific example. She was discharged on 01-APR-2021.  Corrective treatments included: steroids in the hospital for the intracranial hypertension and prescription strength aspirin 325 mg. The patient was not certain if injectable blood thinners were given to her in the hospital. She was discharged with methylprednisolone, alprazolam, twice a day prn to treat her headaches, aspirin 325 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 5 mg, daily, for high triglycerides. After patient was discharged, she had 2 episodes of lightheadedness with the blindness. The first one lasted about 5 minutes maximum and the second one on 12-APR-2021 lasted approximately  30-40 minutes. She had to be sitting down and her vision returned in halos with a lot of fireworks like bright stars. The patient had ringing in the ears, especially the left ear and when she had these episodes. On 14-APR-2021, the patient patient went to PCP (primary care provider). She stated that alprazolam helps her headaches. On 20-APR-2021, she had a &#34;good day&#34;, did not experience headaches, and did not take alprazolam. She will follow up with a neurologist and an ophthalmologist. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the cerebral intracranial hypertension with free fluid in brain behind eye and flared up arthritis were not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 52 year-old White female was hospitalized for intracranial hypertension 15 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine.  Medical history includes an unspecified arthritis with chronic left hip and back pain for which she receives epidural injections every 2-3 months, and a body mass index of 27.9. She has no history of migraines or other headaches and has tolerated multiple vaccinations previously. Concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid 81 mg daily, metaxalone, and oxycodone. Approximately 16 hours after vaccination, she experienced a flare of her arthritis which her pain medications did not relieve. The next day, she began to experience migraine headaches which were associated with pain behind her left eye and sinuses, left-sided facial tingling and numbness without weakness, and light sensitivity.  Fourteen days post-vaccination, she received an epidural injection because she was in a lot of pain. The following morning, she awoke and experienced visual disturbance, described as &#34;complete&#34; blindness. then return of vision with halos and blurriness, and intermittent loss and return of vision depending on her body position. She took 4 baby aspirins, went to the hospital, and was admitted. MRI showed intracranial hypertension but no clots, stroke, or tumors. A lumbar puncture and CT scan were also performed. Blood tests, including platelet counts (e.g. 318), were normal except for high triglycerides. She was treated with steroids and aspirin 325 mg and was discharged 2 days later. She was given methylprednisolone, oxycodone-acetaminophen and alprazolam prn for headaches, aspirin 325 mg, and rosuvatstatin for high triglycerides to continue at home and will follow up with a neurologist, ophthalmologist and her primary physician. Based on the available information, the relationship of intracranial hypertension with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered inconsistent.

But not only did I experience it, but I&#39;ve heard from others that they have as well.)

Was woken at approximately 5am with severe abdominal pain, and extreme back pain in my left kidney. Kidney area was worse than abdominal pain but both were severe. I have had kidney stones in the past, the pain of this was way worse. Was unable to take a bowel movement. Suffered thru with pain increasing until unspecified date at around 2 am I drove myself to unspecified hospital. Was admitted to emergency room and given an in mild pain meds and anti nausea meds. Was given a ct scan of kidney, then a second  ct scan with contrast, as well as blood test. After awhile they came back to re draw blood because they said my blood had clotted and they were unable to use it. I was released after 5 hours with no prescriptions or knowing what or why I was in so much pain.  Pain lasted until unspecified date

My numbers where showing too much levothyroxine, so dr lowered my meds. Now I&#39;m hypo so he has increased. I have tingling in my right butt and hip area since the shot. My diverticulitis is worse. I sleep about 13  hours a night. I have fog brain, sores on my tongue, I have had thrush. I&#39;m always tired. Its hard for me to format words or sentences.

                                                Had shot on Monday.  Horrible pain in arm at injection site that went up my neck to my head.  Sinuses flared up and ears started beeping.  Became dizzy and nauseous and had difficultly breathing.  Went to pass out due to blood pressure drop.  Had to breath in alcohol wipes and then both arms went into pain as if falling asleep only 100 times worse.  Could not moves my arms - hands were cramping.  Took 1 hour to get back to some normal to drive home. The next day/Tues my sinuses where still a little swollen along with a little bit of arm pain, nausea and fatigue.   Wed - Fri sinuses continued to be swollen then on Fri - Sun had coughing.  Following Mon was weaker and feeling low immune.  Tues ended up at doctor&#39;s office having gone into a sinus infection.  Was also experiencing shallow breathing in neck and chest.  Started Augmentin 875mg 2 x a day Tues - Fri.  Then Fri night went into a severe inflammation in my chest, throat and esophagus with difficulty to catch my breath and couldn&#39;t eat.  Sat reached out to document through EMR and was prescribed a Steroid (6 days) which I started on Sun morning.  Was very weak and took that whole week with full does of steroid to get back to normal breathing.  Finished Antibiotics (12 days worth) 2 days after completing the steroid which was now Sunday.  Then still had some sinus recovery where ear was beeping in and out for 2 more days.  By Wed of the 4th week things were returning to normal.  Total time to recover was exactly 4 weeks.

Then yesterday  morning was a little achy and by afternoon was miserable the next day she got really tired, joints hurting and had to take a nap.  She cancelled one of her appointments  she&#39;s a home health nurse and went to sleep and when she woke up her throat was swollen, hurting, labored swallowing and when she would drink her ears would pop, and her tongue was swollen but could breathe fine, and then it progressed to where she could not swallow at all.  She took two Benadryl&#39;s and went to rest, and she was not able to move and had to have help getting dressed.   Her joints are swollen, her hands are swollen, but her throat is not hurting like she was yesterday.

I had Lyme disease about 5 years ago and it felt very similar to those initial symptoms. The elbow that was most affected by the Lyme disease was much more uncomfortable than other joints.

                                                At about 8 hours post injection, I began to have muscle soreness and slight nausea.  By 11 hours post, I was shivering uncontrollably and had migraine-like headache.  By 13 hours post I had to shed blankets for the fever and sweating. Even taking ibuprofen the fever was high.  The next day I kept taking pain medication for severe body aches. This morning, second morning post injection, I let the pain meds wear off.  I discovered I still had body aches, occasional stabbing head pain, and tingling down my left arm and into my 3rd and 4th fingers.  Currently, third evening post injection, I?m still aching but everything is noticeably improved. I don?t need pain meds anymore.

Took tylenol every 4-6 hours which helped only slightly.  Still felt all the same symptoms by next day as well as nauseous and light headed.  Symptoms started to improve by noon and pretty much resolved by that evening.  Total time of adverse symptoms about 24-28 hours.

Did not sleep well much Friday night due to these symptoms.  Sudden pain in left side of my head about 40 min after the vaccine after I walked to the car and sat down after the 30 min wait. Pain starts as a slow dull ache, increases rather sharply, then goes away quickly. Have this pain several times or so yesterday and today even after taking ibuprofen.   Also pain in my neck with what feels like stress headaches with ibuprofen relieving it.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Approximately 7 hours after the shot, my body was in a continuous state of needing to stretch. It is like when you wake up in the morning and need to stretch - a whole body stretch- but this was continuous. Over and over and over, right after each other. It went on for many hours. Also, 40 hours after the shot, I noticed a body rash (it could have been there the previous day but I was in bed all day feeling horrible and didn&#39;t notice). I also have a rash on my sacrum area, and I could barely walk with the pain in my bones in that area. As the morning has progressed, I am feeling better in that area but it is still sore. It has been 40 hours after my vaccine and I am still not 100%. Aside from the horrible headache, chills and flu-like symptoms, these are the other side effects I thought need to be reported.

No treatments yet....but if still bad after this weekend, will seek medical help.  Left eye swelling started at 2pm today, with pain. the eye lid and the area around the left eye are painful and swollen. I have been using hot compresses.  Difficulty catching my breath today durning a morning walk. I have been walking for months on the same path and can hold a conversation, but today, I could barely walk and talk. Once I stopped talking I eventually was able to catch my breath, but we had to walk a much slower pace as well.

                                                I had the vaccine at approximately 7:35 AM and by 1:30 PM I was not running a temperature, however, it felt like my insides were going to burn as my core felt like it was on fire. I still feel like more core is on fire, but it has subsided and is less concerning as it was on Friday, 3/26/2021, and Saturday, 3/27/2021  My eyes became sensitive to light on Friday, 3/26/2021 night and my eyes are still sensitive especially to artificial lighting. Natural light hurts as well but is more tolerable.  My heart rate definitely increased Friday, 3/26/2021 through Saturday, 3/27/2021 however I did not experience the other symptoms on the critical list (such as inability to breathe) therefore did not go to the hospital.  I suffered from muscle weakness on Friday, 3/262021, and Saturday, 3/27/2021. The muscle weakness was only in my legs.

Probably 30 minutes after I also felt a little dizzy but I also have a chronic condition called vestibular migraine. I was fatigued later in the evening. Had full day on day after vax  because I already had things on my calendar but was dragging by the time I got home. Aches all over especially joints, head and injection site was warm to touch and somewhat swollen. Also started running fever one day after. Highest temp 101.9 . I also started having diarrhea, full on three days after. My taste and smell had been off since having covid in august, but I swear they are since taking vax. Today is Tuesday so I&#39;m now five days in and temps normal today. My body aches are also improved but my head is still a bit achy.

On 3/31,  I began to experience body chills and congestion which lasted several days. On 4/3,  my symptoms increased with lower back pain and abdominal pain on my right side.  I went to a clinick on 4/3 and received a positive covid test.  My symptoms increased over the following weeks to include: temperature, body aches, sweating, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, coughing, dizziness and persistent diarrhea.  I went to the ER for care on 4/8 and have been receiving continued care from my physician regarding possible pneumonia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.

A few minutes later I felt difficulty breathing and realized that my throat was swelling.  My heart began to race, but I cannot say if that was a result of the other symptoms I was experiencing.   The dizziness and weakness lasted for about 2 hours. The difficulty breathing and swollen throat eased after about 7 hours.  Just as I thought that I was feeling better, a fever set in around 11pm along with the chills, joint aches and pains, and general malaise. These flu-like symptoms lasted for roughly 36 hours.

Pain was through my left eye towards the back of my head down to my neck. Lasted for awhile.  Took Tylenol and was able to get rest about an hour later.  Woke up that morning pain was still there but it was bearable.  Two days later it happened again.  Awaken with excruciating pain.  Didn&#39;t think it was related to shot because it had been almost 3 weeks since I had shot.  On 04/15/21, it happened again.  Never had any issues with headaches.  Not only have I been having headaches, I&#39;ve been having pain in my legs, feeling lethargic, etc.

For the next 24 hours I pretty much was bedridden.  It has been just a bit over 2 weeks since my vaccination and I am still struggling with fatigue and muscle (or joint) pain.  I have been to the doctor and she ruled out any of the blood clotting issues.  She also did blood work and everything came back normal.  If I do to much at one time I become very achy in my neck, shoulders, lower back.  It is difficult to fully raise my arms with out pain and discomfort.  I also become very fatigued.  I?m unsure if it?s muscle pain, nerve or joint pain.  I?m a very active person so this is not the norm for me.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included rheumatoid arthritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, possible sjogren&#39;s, penicillin allergy and sulfa drugs (sulfonamide) allergy, and other pre-existing medical conditions included opiates allergy causing rash.  The patient experienced drug allergy when treated with Azithromycin, Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin for an unknown indication.

Concomitant medications included Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) to prevent blood clot, and Prednisone for an unknown indication.  On 09-APR-2021, the patient experienced stinging in the right arm for a few seconds while getting the vaccine shot, then pain in left arm, stomachache in the night, profound weakness in the legs, heaviness in both legs and both arms, shortness of breath, out of body feeling, severe pain in the epigastric area. It was reported that vaccine could have triggered a rheumatoid arthritis reaction in legs hands, feet and arms. The feeling of weakness and heaviness in the arms and legs were still on going, and the reaction with Aspirin occurred about 30 minutes ago but became better once she took a liquid antacid. The patient took the Aspirin to prevent clots because she was on prednisone, which was read on the news that blood clots may form after getting the vaccine. She attributed the heaviness of the arms and legs as a possible rheumatoid arthritis flare. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable.

                                                Muscle aches started about 12 hours after the injection.  First my legs and back but after another 12 hours it was mostly my legs.  Legs felt like the muscles were being pulled.  (It felt like the beginnings of the extreme reaction I had to ampicillin 2 decades earlier, though not nearly as severe.)  My arm swelled slightly, was warm at the injection site and ached about 12 hrs after the injection.  The leg aches lasted about 2 days, the arm ache lasted about 1 day and the slight arm swelling lasted about 6 days... Reason for my reporting:  I had an annual eye exam 4/14/21 where a retinal scan was done.  The optometrist saw some blood spots in my left eye and referred me to an ophthalmologist.  Ophthalmologist performed additional scans and tests including a Fluroescein angiography and determined I have BRVO (Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion) which is a series of blot clots in small vessels of the eye&#39;s main vein.  He did not say it could be a result of the vaccine but I have no risk factors associated with getting BRVO.  Since it is not affecting my vision yet, the doctor wants to monitor it in 3 months to make sure it has not worsened.  Since the Janssen vaccine was put on hold for causing other types of blot clots in women in my age group, I am wondering if the vaccine caused the blood clots in my eye.

I had all over body aches for two days but my hands still ache after tree weeks. I woke up in the morning an noticed a big bulging blue vein in my right eyelid right above the outer part of my eye. One week later my thumb started to throb and then a big bulging blue vein in my left thumb. It felt like it had been injured but it looked better within hours. I called my doctor and he advised that I go to the ER. I also had trouble with my head throbbing for a week after the shot.  My eye was painful and lasted a little over a week and my eyes were a little blurry. Both problems have resolved but I still have an ache in my hands after three and a half weeks. It is a deep bone ache which makes it difficult to work with my hands.

I may of had a fever but I couldnt get up to check so I am unsure of that.  For the next week I was so tired I could hardly function.

It was muscular - it moved up from my chest to shoulder the next day and then went away after about a week. I was icing it and massaging it and taking muscle relaxers.  I had a routine visit with cardiologist yesterday. My blood pressure has been elevated lately and so they have added another blood pressure medicine for me to start - I just picked it up and will start tomorrow - Losartan  - 25 mg (and I am already on Metoprolol) and I&#39;m taking an antibiotic for a procedure I had done on Friday

Also when I laid down for the night, I was accutely aware of my heartbeat, which according to my smartwatch was beating at a rate of 71.  The next morning, I still was experiencing chills, and felt achy/stiff/sore muscles - possibly from tensing up and  shivering all night.  Pain at the injection shot also started the morning after the shot.  By bedtime the day after the shot, the symptoms had eased up.  The next morning the symptoms were gone, except for a little residual injection site discomfort.

Nausea lasted 3 days, but indigestion lasted 5 days.  On day two I went for a short walk and it felt like there was a brick on my chest...I could breathe ok, but heavy feeling in my back and chest.   I walked on day 3 with no issues.  I also developed 4-5  hives on my stomach on day three which were gone on day 4. I took tylenol for the fever and aches after talking with the nurse at my doctors office. After speaking with a few female friends who had the same vaccine, they experienced similar side effects, however their husbands who received the same shot had no issues.  I am wondering if the shot is affecting women differently.

On Sunday (2 days later), I awoke covered in a raised, itchy rash all over my body.   It lasted until Tuesday.   On Wednesday, I had severe muscle tightening in both calves, originating in the muscle behind my knees.  It was so painful, I couldn?t stand in one spot for longer than 10-15 seconds.   I had to either sit or walk.  I finally have relief from that pain today (Friday).

                                                Left upper arm, shoulder and neck became very achy. I began to experience chills without a fever around 8:00 pm. Around 11:00pm, I began to feel nauseous. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep, my heart was racing. By 3:30 am I had vomited at least 5 times. Throughout the day on Monday, I was still very cold, nauseous (without vomiting) and somewhat lightheaded. It is now Tuesday and my stomach is still upset. I have not contacted my physician at this time. I have been treating myself with ginger ale, Pepto Bismol, saltines and rest. I&#39;m not 100%, but feeling much better.

                                                Vaccine at 6:30pm on Thursday. Arm was very sore.  Woke up at 7am, tired, arm still very sore.  Took 2 tylenol, went to work, started to get a headache, on top of head, above my eyes. Took 2 more tylenol at about 1pm.  Starting to feel worse, finally left work at 3;30pm.  Went home, had fever about 100 or so.  As the evening went on, I had 102 fever, extreme pains, more so on my legs (especially my bad knee felt even worse), the worse headache I think that I ever had.  Even my breasts were sore.  it hurt just to lay down.  Took 2 more tylenol, felt the same.  Woke up the next morning, less pains, but my bad knee still hurted more than usual, 100 fever, tired, headache much less. Basically, had to lay down all day.  I had no energy.  Arm still very sore.  Sunday, felt much better, slightly more energy, arm still very sore.  Monday, feeling much better, but my arm is still very sore.

                                                I was vaccinated last Wednesday, March 24, at 8 pm with the Janssen vaccine.  As soon as I was vaccinated (on my left arm), I put on my coat and I felt a brief  and sharp pain in my left arm. And nothing else. On Friday night, I felt a very slight tingling in my left hand. And pain in the upper arm, in the region between the place where the vaccine was applied and my elbow. This pain seemed to spread to the forearm. Since then, I have tingling / numbness in my left hand and forearm and pain throughout my left arm, left shoulder, upper left center of the back and neck. And these pains and numbness have been increasing every day. Ten days have passed since the vaccine was applied and the condition only worsens. I took Voltaren in the last 3 days and the pain has not subsided. I am worried and scared. Was it a case of thrombosis or pulmonary embolism? In addition, I saw in the CDC information that, during the JNJ vaccine tests, there was a case of a severe reaction called brachial neuritis; as I didn?t know what it was, I did a Google search and, apparently, the symptoms I have coincide with those of this disease. Anyway, what do you advise me to do? I have waited until now imagining that the pain and numbness would lessen. But the opposite happened and everything just makes it worse. I look forward to feedback and guidance. I haven&#39;t been to a doctor yet, but it looks like it will be necessary. Thanks.

That night started developing some tiredness and body aches and a slight fever.  Saturday I could not get out of bed.  Chills, muscle aches and fever, ran a fever so high 104 plus I was delirious and could not get warm.  Sunday fever was down to 101.  Monday had a full blown head cold that lasted for 24 hrs.  About 2 weeks later I developed this right ear ringing.  It never stops and it is getting louder.  24 hours a day.

                                                I started feeling dissy around 9:00 p. m.  or shortly after  then having a mild headache.  As the night progressed I started having chills and the headache gotten worse.  I took a ibuprofen and went to bed. In the morning I woke up feeling very weak with excruciating pain in my joints and muscles and a chronic headache. I could not move around without holding on because I was disoriented. This went on until the  second day I woke up without the pain but still feeling weak in my legs and entire body.

My left leg - I started feeling some pressure behind my knee when I was walking. It happened two days in a row and then it happened a week later (April 22th). I  called the doctor and they sent me to get an ultrasound done.  I&#39;m a carrier for Factor V Leiden which I knew.

                                                I began having a burning and tingling sensation around my ribcage on my right side. I attributed it to possible swollen lymph nodes as the result of the vaccine. I had tenderness there for about a week. It started getting better and on my right side in my waist area, I had a sensation on my skin with no visible rash or anything, but it felt like my skin was burning and tingling. I thought maybe I was getting shingles, but never broke out. The same pain then went to my inside upper arms, both of them and then it spread into my armpits. and down both my sides. At times, the sensation was across the top of my chest. There is no rash, there is no visible inflammation and my skin doesn&#39;t feel warm to the touch although it is burning and tingling to me. It has been going on now for weeks. I have taken naproxen to see if it was some kind of inflammation as an immune response and it has helped on some days but not on others. I feel stupid to make a Dr appointment because there is nothing to see, but the painful sensation is real. It feels like a really bad sunburn.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The morning after the vaccine was administered, I awoke with a scratchy throat,  itchy eyes and feeling very tired.   Throughout the morning,  the fatigue increased and I felt flushed in my face, but chilled in my arms and body.  I went home at noon and  found I had developed a fever of 100.9, which eventually increased to 101.3 later that afternoon.  I felt joint pain and general malaise.   Two days after the vaccine, the fever had broken and the joint pain was better. I still have fatigue, but it is improving throughout the day.

I woke in the middle of the night in a crying fit because I thought I was going to die I felt soooo bad ! It was worse than any flu Id ever had! My joints hurt, my head wanted to explode , fever of 101.3 , breathing issues , exhaustion, thirsty...this lasted 2 to 3 days. Ive had a couple of days here in beginning of april til now of waking up feeling sick again. It doesnt last all day. Sometimes it just before bedtime. I guess I just feel a bit sick, but that could also be the cancer that ive had since july 2020 that hasnt been treated by a health care system I have?

I took my daily meds of 125mg of Diamox, and 100 mg of Azathioprine.  At 11:30pm I woke up with a 104 fever, sweating, and a lot of muscle cramping in legs and feet.  My head felt like it was going to explode.  My cerebral fluid pressure was up and felt in head and down spin.  I did not rest well and found it difficult to get comfortable all night.  I took an 200 mg of ibuprofen at 12:00am and started to feel some relief.

Broke fever after 5 hours but headache remained severe for 18 hours.  Muscle fatigue remained for approximately 2 days.  Remained in bed until symptoms passed.   Arm swelled up on 4/4/21, area where received shot.   It was almost everything I experienced with COVID in Nov 2019 over the course of 3 weeks squeezed into 24 hours, having suffered before I knew to go to bed and didn&#39;t go to ER.   If I hadn&#39;t experienced this before I would have gone to ER.

                                                It started with just a pain in the arm - normal soreness from the injection  site and up the left side of my  neck - but then it spread to the whole upper part of my left arm. It was very , very painful. It wakes me up almost every single night because it hurts. The pain will radiate  - now the pain is more in my arm area and now it&#39;s radiating to my back on on the shoulder blade area on the left side - my  neck is a tiny bit sore right. The soreness in the arm is always consistent but the radiating pain moves around somewhat. I am wondering if they gave me the injection incorrectly.  It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s  what the description of &#34;COVID ARM.&#34; I don&#39;t have any swelling or redness and I haven&#39;t ever.  I take Aleve every now and then. I called the doctor last week and she told me to wait a couple of weeks and watch it.

First wave within 60 seconds of shot (ended up on floor - embarrassing!).  Second, and most severe, wave about 10 minutes later while sitting in chair.  Apparently, I passed out with my eyes open.  Hubby got nurse.  They said I was unresponsive.  Nurse checked blood pressure and heart rate after second wave - both normal.  Third wave, much less severe, hit after 10 more minutes.  Ice water/weakness feeling in arms and legs and not so much in chest area.  Nurse speculated it could be low blood sugar (based on medications).  Have never had low blood sugar event previously AND had eaten about an hour prior to vaccination.  However, drank 4 ounces of orange juice, just in case.  Went home about 20 minutes later... no other significant side effects.  No swelling/redness at injection site.  No other illnesses, etc.

I had about 2 more very sharp pain in my ear that evening, and feels like I have something trapped inside my ear.  I still feel as though something is still in my ear and my neck is very tight.  I have  had a headache since the injection, and started getting chills and fevers on April 8 and has continued.  I have been extremely tired since April 9....it is interfering with my work.  My stomach hurts and feel miserable.  I have not yet recovered.

                                                next day extreme fatigue, fever lethargy.  Got better but never got energy back and had some body aches and trouble sleeping.  On Wed. March 25th an EXTREME headache began and I could find no relief with High doses of Tylenol or Ibuprophin or a mixture of both. It was my whole head. Stayed on the couch all day Saturday and Sunday  27th and 28th unable to move because of the pain and extreme fatigue.  Monday the 29th made myself go to work but was not able to function or get much relief.  On Tuesday the 30th went to see physician who said he thought it was Occipital Neuralgia and gave me prednisone and said use hot compresses. Told him I thought it was more due to other symptoms like hallucinations (shadows I would see) Mind not clear and made me worry about driving. Asked if the shot could be a possibility. He just said he couldn&#39;t rule it out.  The doctor also mentioned I felt very hot but never took my temperature. I Took the prednisone. Headache did start to clear on Wed the 31st in the evening but my neck seized up where I could no longer turn it to the left and was very painful. Also felt like my lymphnodes were swollen.  I called on call doctor and they prescribed a muscle relaxer.  I did not start to get better until Sunday April 11th. Experience a couple occular migranes as well during this,  Still experiencing some fatigue and almost to a fainting point in the mornings

                                                Started with a dull pain in my right side.  After Dinner on that Friday (3-25-21) I  threw up.    Thought I had food poison(ate fish). running a low grade fever fell asleep an woke up feeling better however a sore stomach (like if stillsick).  Saturday evening the pain started to get worse/running high fever and a tenderness in my stomach. Went to Emergency. After being admitted and doing testing turns out I had appendixsitis.  Surgery was Sunday afternoon and turns out was a preforated appendix.  I am not sure if this is related at all to my getting the vaccine however too coincidental that I received the shot on the 15th and this happened so suddenly within 2 weeks.

At that point, my bad symptoms started. I was up all night.  1. I had nausea and I threw up. I had body aches and no energy to move. 3. About an hour later, my heart started &#34;racing&#34; really bad. I felt like I was running a marathon, and I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace. I could hardly catch up my breath.  4. Then, my right arm started tingling and feel heavy. I couldn&#39;t feel any of my &#34;fingers&#34; on my right hand.  5. My body kept going from extremely hot to extremely cold. I felt like my blood pressure was up and down. I had more nausea. I could barely move. 6. I threw up again and, eventualy, I slept.

                                                I am reporting per recommendation of the V-safe system/conversation. I am reporting as the patient. I received the Jansen vaccine through a special monitored vaccine clinic due to a past severe reaction to a Shingrix vaccine. I did not have any immediate symptoms after the Jansen vaccine. The following day I developed aches/pains and fever to 103, but this resolved within 48 hours. I then noticed itching, swelling and pain at the site of the injection and developed a mild headache, called my primary doctor on 4/13/21 and was seen on 4/14/21 at which time a CBC was done.  CBC including platelets-normal.  However, within the next few days a more severe headache then developed, which was severe enough to limit my activities by 4/16/21. Because of the rare problem of thrombocytopenia associated with clotting, it was advised I not take aspirin or ibuprofen. I also was having some mild abdominal pain, low grade fever (to 100.7), malaise, dysuria and arthralgias. My headache continued to be limiting my daily activities and on 4/17/21, I went to a Urgent Care. However, they were unable to check and get results back on a CBC within that day, I had a normal neurological exam, my UA had some abnormal findings but not clearly indicative of a UTI and a culture is pending.  A rapid Covid test was negative.  It was recommended that if I was concerned I could proceed to a local ED for further testing. I  decided to continue to try conservative treatment and monitoring at home. As of today 4/18/21, the headache has mostly resolved and I no longer have a fever. I am still having some dysuria and joint pains.

                                                4/5/2021--Received Janssen vaccine.  Felt very hot during the day.   4/6/2021--Woke up with very bad headache and rash on the injected arm plus on my stomach.  Went for a walk and felt pain in my left calf and achilles tendon.  Went to work.  4/7/2021--Started my work day as a Personal Trainer/Fitness Instructor at 6am as usual.  Taught cycling classes and trained a few clients.  Went for walk.  Still had a headache.  When I got in my car to head home, my vision was super blurry and I felt very dizzy.  I ate an orange and peanuts and hydrated more.  I was not even sure I could drive home.  I got home told my family how I was feeling.  My husband noticed my eyes were very red and swollen.  I took a shower, drank a smoothie and ate a salad.  Used my aunt&#39;s BP cuff to check my BP and it was 148/99.  I have NEVER had HBP.    4/8/21--Woke up feeling disoriented as if the left side of my face, body were off--neurological stuff.  I went to reach for grapes in the refrigerator and could not grab them.  I felt like I have never felt before and ask my husband to drive me to the ER.  While at the waiting room at the ER, I felt chest tightness and pain and nauseous.  My BP was 153/111.  Again, I have never been diagnosed or been treated for hypertension.  They did EKG, lab tests, chest X-ray.  Once my BP came down, they sent me home.   This is before all the JJ Janssen vaccine &#34;news&#34; came out and the reasons it was paused.  I developed a very bad cough about two hours after I got home from the ER.  4/9/11--Made appointment with a brand new primary care doctor.  Saw her on Monday 4/12/2021 as recommended by ER.  I had never met her before.  She prescribed a very low dose of BP medication, which I did not take because the number one side-effect is dry-cough.  I was already coughing a lot, later on with blood.  4/11/2021--Still feeling pretty bad, I woke up to the news of the Janssen vaccine being paused.  Frankly, I felt relieved that I was not going crazy.  This truly has been one of the hardest things I have ever gone (and still am) going through.  I became concerned about the pain in the left calf and heel could be a clot.   Called primary care doctor.  Had ultrasound of legs and chest x-ray the following day   4/12/2021--Had persistent cough with blood.  Went to ER at 9pm.  Had EKG, blood work, CT without contrast of chest, covid test--negative.  Got home around 2am.  4/19/21--Followed up with primary care doctor who after explaining to her I am extremely fatigued, still blurry vision, dizzy, cough better but not gone, chest discomfort on the left side, she referred me to an ophtamologist and cardiologist.  My insurance and this poorly established referral system is very difficult to navigate.  Up to now I am still waiting for the referral and pre-aurhtorization to the opthtamologist.  (4/23/2021).  I want to say, I am pretty healthy. I have worked in fitness and wellness for over 30 years. I have never drank alcohol, smoked or done any drugs.  Prior to this no physician has told me I have HBP or any issues for which I have to be medicated.  I take zero medications.  Even when I had the bad headache from the vaccine I took nothing.  I have not worked in two weeks and had not driven until last saturday.  If I don&#39;t work, I don&#39;t get paid.   I pay for almost $600/month for my insurance in the marketplace.  This has been another stressor of this storm.  Getting providers to really listen and insurance companies to take situations like this seriously.   I could not drive at night.  This has been rough and I look forward to being myself soon.  This reaction felt like a heart attack/stroke with extreme fatigue, acid reflux, cough with some blood, muscular pain.  The rash and headaches were the least of my concerns.  I am not yet recovered from all of this.  I sure hope there is no permanent damage and that this too shall pass.  It is important to note that I have tried reporting this event several times to the VAERS website online.  I completed the 4-5 pages multiple times and it would not let me submit.  I also called the VAERS 1-800 number to report and they told me to go back to the online form.  I left several messages when I could not get it done online and to this date no one has called me back.  I called to report my adverse reaction and they told me they do not take that info.  I also called the health dept.  After several phone calls to them a nurse called me back but did not take a formal report.  When someone is feeling pretty sick, this is a lot to ask of.  I persisted because I feel this is important to be reported.

                                                Received Vaccine on the 4/8 that night I was very cold had 5 blankets, teeth shattering, severe headache, &amp; knees like if they were breaking them. The following day slight headache, weakness, not feeling good.  On the evening of 4/15, it hurt to breathe and I had a burning sensation on my rib cage going to my back. I thought I could handle it until Monday to see my Dr.  but by the time I went to the ER it hurt to walk, talk, breathe and the burning sensation would not go away.  I went to the ER on 4/17 he said I had a collapsed lung, gave me something for pain via IV.  Did an EKG, Chest X-Ray, CT Scan, and Lab work. He let me go and said to take deep breaths every hour on the hour and to drink lots of water.  I got in to see my regular Dr. on 4/22 and he said I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  He gave me Gabapentin 100 mg 3 times a day and Tramadol q 6 hours for pain.  I called him back because I still have the pain and now I am taking 300 mg Gabapentin in the am and 300 in the pm.  It is still not working.  I am constantly hurting the burning sensation on my rib cage and goes back to my back, it hurts to breathe, walk, talk, drive, I have blurred vision , dizziness and weakness.  I have an appointment with Dr.   again tomorrow.

                                                My appointment was on time, 4pm on 4/3 at the Pharmacy.  The young girl that gave me the shot told me she was certified, and she gave me the shot in the presence of her manager.  I have given  myself shots for years with diabetes, plus many flu shots, and have never felt pain like that.  I expressed this to her, how painful it was, and she just said &#34;I know, I know...&#34; as if it was normal for the shot to be so painful. I knew instantly something was wrong.  They were more worried, it seemed, about a potential adverse reaction such as an allergy shock, since I&#39;m allergic to a few things, but I did not experience that.  I waited 15 minutes, my arm hurting the whole time, and they suggested I go buy Tylenol for the pain, which I did.  My left arm has hurt since then. I got a horrible bruise from this shot (will send picture) that took weeks to heal.  Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel pain and don&#39;t have full mobility of my left arm. I can type, but not lifting anything heavy and have to go easy with anything on the left side.  I thought at first it might be what people were calling &#34;covid arm&#34; but I discovered that was more about soreness, not pain.  I tried ibuprofin, but after three weeks I&#39;d had enough and made a doctors appointment.  Since I was also noticing my left shoulder was very tense and tight, and I was starting to get neck stiffness in same area, I started googling before my appointment.  When I entered my symptoms, SIRVA kept popping up, so I wondered if that was what I now had because of the improper vaccine administration.  I asked my doctor for an MRI order to find out, but she said we needed to do an Xray first (which only showed mild issues related to osteo).  She offered a prescription of taking Advil 400 mg three times and day and to use a muscle relaxer when I needed it, such as at night (Cyclobenzaprine).  She said to try that for a week, and if it wasn&#39;t better, that another Dr could order MRI.  Since then I&#39;ve also added a pain spot under my left shoulder blade. Insurance called and said the order was &#34;under review&#34; so that&#39;s where things stand now. If they don&#39;t approve, I guess I will go next to an orthopedist for guidance?  This has cost me health, due to lack of sleep also - I wake up with pain in the middle of the night, even when I take the meds. Praying for a diagnosis, and solution, soon.

                                                The day I received the shot, my arm got warm and sore.  The soreness traveled to my shoulder and neck.  I got headachey, alternating between hot and cold chills, a little bit of nausea and extreme tiredness.   This continued for the next 5 days which seemed like they were considered mild reactions according to the CDC website.  Most concerning though, is on day 5, (3/14/21) in the evening as I was getting into bed, I started getting a red, extremely itchy rash on both my arms, my lower back and my upper legs, to the point that I could not sleep because it was so itchy and had to take Benedryl.  I have not changed anything in my diet or in the products I use on my body, so I can only attribute this reaction to this vaccine.  I am still a little itchy on my arms today 3/15/21.   I am also still getting the hot and cold chills and still have a little bit of nausea, not bad, but enough to be &#34;off&#34; certain foods.

                                                I sat down for about 15 min and by the time I got back to my car, I noticed I was getting a light headache. I assumed I was just tired. About 30 mins later, my shoulders started to hurt. I woke up around 11:30 and I felt like a Mack truck had hit me. I had a fever, headache and chills. I remained this way for about 3 or 4 days, but improved. Then I started to become very lethargic. Just lifting my arm was a chore. On Monday, I went to see my doctor and he said that I was fine after checking everything, to include my thyroid and liver enzymes. Everything was fine, so my symptoms were attributed to the vaccine. Today, I have no pain, but I am very lethargic.

I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis March 2020.  Dietary changes have kept my rheumatoid arthritis in check -- not requiring any medication, even ibuprofen -- since May or June 2020.  Within 24 hours of receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, my knees, ankles, hands, wrists, and feet began to hurt.  (I also had a 100 degree fever for 24 hours.)  Unfortunately, 2.5 weeks later, the joint pain persists.  The vaccine clearly triggered a flare up, but I hope that within another 2 weeks, the vaccine will have finishing tweaking my immune system for COVID response and the pain will abate.  I do not know yet if that will be the case.

All night and through to the next morning I had a high fever, though I didn?t take my temperature. I was achy all over, had an incredibly horrific headache which strong migraine over the counter pills did not help,  I would go back and forth from shivering to sweating (my body would be drenched in sweat) and just feeling miserable. I slept off and on until about noon. Then all symptoms slowly went away. By about 2:00 I was up and around though tired. By early evening I was perfectly fine.

                                                8 hours after injection started having severe lower back and leg pain. Then came the horrible headache causing nausea and dizziness which ultimately resulted in causing me to pass out while attempting to get to the couch. Once I came to the body trembles  started accompanied by being freezing cold. The headache and diarrhea lasted into the next day with symptoms not lessening until day 3. Still have to take Tylenol every 4 hours to keep headache manageable.  I did not seek medical treatment but would strongly warn those getting this shot of the possible  loss of consciousness. It came on very fast, 8 hours after the injection,  and could be deadly if someone was driving or not near soft surroundings.

                                                In the middle of the night of the 10th of April I started having what seemed like normal side effects---muscle aches, headache, fatigue.. and then all day on the 10th the same side effects.   Then last night I slept 9 straight hours but woke up  sweating a couple times in night and in morning woke up sweating but my aches and headache seemed better than the day before so I went downstairs to make tea.  After pouring a glass of orange juice and having a couple sips I started to feel strange --dizzy and oversome with a strange feeling that was not quite like the feeling before fainting -- my back had a weird pain and i was a little nauseous as well. ..it was more overwhelming -- more loss of control like a huge wave of dizziness and ringing.  I made my way to a couch to try to regain balance -- but was still very dizzy-- something happened to make me try to get up and go upstairs so I remember walking 12 feet or so then told myself to sit down.  Before that happened I must have blacked out.  I faintly remember moving myself across the floor but then must have blacked out again.  I woke up at the base of the stairwell and then was able to walk upstairs.    I had collapsed the first time onto a hard floor as my orange juice glass had spilled all over and when I got upstairs my sweatshirt was covered in juice.  I don&#39;t remember any of that.  Once upstairs I drank water and have been fine since then.  I had eaten dinner the night before but maybe it was the sweating in the night that dehydrated me and i cramped up and had a strange pain in my back---i don&#39;t know.  I am a very healthy 56 yr old woman 5&#39;3&#34; 105 lbs so maybe the Johnson and JOhnson one dose was a lot for my body or maybe my body was just doing what it&#39;s supposed to do to react to vaccine.... i also may have had asymptomatic covid in the last year so my body was overreacting.   This happened 7 hours ago and I seem fine aside from slight headache and continued weakness from vaccine but I thought I should report the incident in case there might be something more or in case others had similiar responses.

Woke up Saturday night, tried to massage the leg pain to include a back massage.  Took a Tylenol 8hour muscle ache and pain which worked. It took the pain away. So far no returned left leg pain.

                                                Became Lightheaded within 5 min of injection, progressed to severe dizziness, black spots in my eyes, could hardly lift my arms,  progressed further to nausea, was given zofran on tongue by EMS, progressed to severe vomiting.  EMS took blood pressure it was 93/50 hear rate was very low. Called ambulance and advised I go to hospital immediately.  Blood pressured jumped to 150 then dropped again.  Once in ambulance they put IV in and gave Zofran through IV, I don&#39;t know if they put anything else in there.  Blood pressure stabilized around 110 which is normal for me, I normally have low blood pressure and heart rate.  Nausea and dizziness dissipated by the time I got to hospital.  They put EKG on also while I was in ambulance and said I was having PVC&#39;s advised dr to do another EKG once I got to hospital.  Felt better by about 5:00 PM.  Overnight I had slight fever and body aches, took Advil and symptoms subsided.  Slight soreness in arm and armpit, but not major.  Have been feeling fine now other than being traumatized by the whole event.

                                                FOR 3 WEEKS FOLLOWING THE VACCINATION:   I had aches in all of my joints (elbows, wrists, and knees).  I thought maybe i am developing arthritis.  This lasted for approx 3 weeks and then suddenly stopped. Was it joint inflammation?   I had no other symptoms.   I did not visit the doctor. Within 5 hours of the vaccination, symptoms started with pain in both of forearms.  Overnight I developed fever, lethargy , aches and pains.  Took Tylenol.  Slept for approx 36 hrs.  I felt much better after 40 hrs.   I was not concerned.  I would say my symptoms were moderate or worse. In March of 2020, I had shortness of breath in my left lung .  It lasted for days.  I was concerned but I did not visit the doctor.  It eventually went away.  Could I have had Covid then?  A sure possibility but I will never know!

                                                Thought I should let you know I was vaccinated on April 8 with Janssen (J&amp;J).  I had a severe reaction - chest pain and back pain for the entire day.  I alerted Drs., but I&#39;m sure it should be reported.  I took my ZyrtecD prior to vaccine, which I&#39;m sure helped in some manner.  I was better on Friday with lingering back pain.  Today I am down with bad headache and stomach pain, but I am aware there is a current stomach bug.

By 7:20 I had to go to bed.. the chills, bad headache, body aches were too much. At 10:30pm I woke up with incredible body and head aches, it felt like every past sport injury was being attacked; I could feel pain in layers: skin, tissue, bones; my stomach felt like a lead anvil was sitting in it, I tossed and turned and could find no comfortable position, my butttocks began to ache beyond belief too, as if pokers were going into them. Sometime between 2:30-3:00 am I think I fell asleep, but between 4:00-6:30am I was sweating profusely, and finally got up at 7:00am to change my bed sheets and clothesjust soaking

Within the past week and a half, I feel a little tired and light headache. Sometimes, I had trouble sleeping at night.  But, starting end of the second week, the symptoms got worse. I am suffering from a sleep disorder. I felt exhausted, bigger and longer headaches, joint pain, muscle pain. My Blood pressure went up. I visited my family doctor today.

I felt a weird sensation near my heart that was only momentarily - like a bubble or something about 1/4 inch in length move through a vein near my heart - I think I felt it again near my stomach a few days later - weird.  and then my face felt like I was losing sensation - like it was tingling .  that lasted a little longer, like a sagging.  I thought maybe I put on weight.  i was concerned and went to pharmacy to get my blood pressure taken - which I have never done in my life.  I am 56!  They no longer do that bc of COVID - so I asked a nurse friend to take it. She measured 124 over 60 something.  that is high for me.  I am typically 106/62.  I checked my records.  I started running then - in case I have put on weight.  I am 155 (high).  But now I started getting a constant headache about a week ago.  I am in a new job - so have thought it was due to stress or I reactivated a concussion  headache.   i started taking  Ecotrim 2 everyday now.  I am NOT an aspirin taker and I do not get headaches.  I try not to take ibuprofen for the headache.  I am not sleeping.  I have slept well ALL my life up to now.  I go to bed late now like 11;30 and I don&#39;t sleep.  I have a lot on my mind.  so it could be that.  Under a lot of stress.  this just started the last week.  A very new pattern.  I started a new job 3/15/21.  I was drinking coffee for the first 2 -3 weeks and now am not drinking it.  I don&#39;t drink much alcohol but I have had 1 glass of wine on the weekend or beer.   I run about 3 miles 2-3 times a week.

                                                I had J&amp;J vaccine around 12:30 on 4/12/2021.  No issues at all until 11 p.m., started with sudden onset high fever (103), shaking chills, mild short-lived nausea, and immediate thumping splitting headache and very severe body aches and joint pain.  In bed until 12 noon the next day  feeling terrible.  On couch rest of day with fever fluctuating from 100.3 to 101.1. Went to bed 4/13/2021 with 101.1 fever, woke up 5-6 times drenched in sweat (fever trying to break?) and then was able to get out of bed, fever resolved.  Still achy and puny on 4/14/2021 but much better.  I took NO medications during the side effects/adverse events from the J&amp;J vaccine.  I do have significant left arm pain at the injection site still on 4/14 but there was no redness, warmth, or rash at the site, arm looks completely normal.    Very typical flu like reaction.

By Day 5 or 6 - full body aches and my arms felt like there was pressure on them.  I was feeling very tired.   As more days passed; I was feeling tired, could not raise my arms, legs were weak and hurting.  If I did anything (shower or carry a simple laundry basket) my arms would hurt so bad, I was out of breath and my heart was pounding so hard.  By the week of March 29th - I was laying down in the middle of the day, no energy at all.  Called the doctor and because of the shortness of breath &amp; Body aches, they would only schedule a video visit for Monday, April 5th.  After talking to me, they schedule to see me that day at 11:45 AM.  I had weak muscle response in my arms, pale, and out of breath.  They did blood work.  Two hours after getting home; they called and said I needed to get to the emergency room.  My red blood cell count was dangerously low, and they ordered a blood transfusion.  I sent 6 days in the hospital.

                                                At approximately 2AM on Thursday, a severe headache (I would term a migraine based on prior experience) woke me. I had no apparent fever, but my body was stiff and I felt my heart rate was elevated. I drank some water, in case it was dehydration-related, but was unable to fall back asleep. I also experienced some nausea at breakfast but ate toast and had some (caffeinated) tea about 6 AM. Around 7 AM I took two (2) ibuprofen, which dulled the headache slightly. However it persisted into early/late afternoon hours on Thursday. (My customary activities were curtailed somewhat.) Since I have had migraines in the past, I treated this as I treated those: hydrating, taking pain medication as required, remaining quiet, reducing exposure to light and sound, etc. I continued taking two (2) ibuprofen periodically as I felt the need through bedtime Thursday night.  Friday I had periodic headaches (again, attributed them to rebound migraines or just headaches), felt tired, and been a bit &#39;out of it&#39;. But my systems did not prevent me from functioning. I did repeat the two (2) ibuprofen on Friday night at bedtime.

On 4/17 a burning redness and swelling of her legs bilaterally which worsened and she became unable to walk secondary to pain and swelling. Also reported shortness of breath. The rash was initially wheals spreading up legs with pain, burning and allodyina to light touch. It then spread to arms bilaterally.  She admitted to Medical Center and discharged with dx of urticarial rash with petechiae. I saw her 4/19 with painful palpable purpura, significant diffuse joint pain, puffiness on all 4 extremities and starting to appear on abdomen. Areas on legs where condition originally started had began clearing. Likely Henoch Shonlein Purpura.

It lasted 36 hours and then I felt my Vestibular Migraines. I was dizzier than usual. Under my left armpit was very painful reaching toward my left breast. The area of the shot was not painful. I also had dizziness chest pains under my right clavicle immediately after I got the shot. The chest pain went away for three days and then it came back.  It was like an extreme muscle ache. It was a dull and intermittent pain. I was referred to a Respiratory clinic and I still had a low grade fever.  My left arm was stiff two weeks before the shot and  three days after the shot my  left shoulder was frozen. I had an appointment with my Orthopedist and she confirmed an encapsulated shoulder problem.  At present after three weeks my shoulder is still frozen and my armpit is still a little painful. The chest pains are less frequent.

                                                Since receiving the J&amp;J covid-19 vaccine, I have experienced severe joint pain in my hips, my knees, and sometimes ankles.  I have not contacted my Dr yet, but I am concerned about the joint pain not going away.  I also googled it and I saw that there are other people experiencing the same joint pain after the covid-19 vaccine.  Please let me know what to do.

Pain/ache in all joints now, muscle pain as well, along with vision blurriness at times, fatigue and autoimmune rash on my hands and in my groin.

The unexpected effect is tingling and coldness in both hands/fingertips.   I could logically assume it is from the swelling in the neck pressing on the nerves, as I have experienced a similar feeling occasionally in the past due to compressed discs in my spine and neck.  At this point I am not particularly alarmed but I wanted to make you aware of this side effect.

                                                No pain at injection site.  But 9 hours later I started shivering and was achy. Temperature is 101.3 and holding around 100.3.  very bad headache.   Lukewarm wash cloths for soothing/ cooling.  It&#39;s 19 hours do far of fever and headache and achy muscles.   I haven&#39;t taken any pain reliever.

By morning my neck and shoulders were achy as well as my left arm and I was still a little fatigued. By the next day my only symptom was soreness in my upper arm and especially at the injection site.  5 days after the injection I still have soreness at the injection site. I took a few doses of tylenol and rested. My job  has forced a 10 day isolation on me because they said fatigue and achy muscles are signs of COVID-19. So I am getting plenty of rest.

Symptoms remind me of shingles-caused neuralgia which I sometimes experience on left side. Facial tingling, feeling of tightness in muscles, including inner ear are less familiar to me. Symptoms appear to change in degree--slight to more noticeable--as this first day wears on. (Now nearly five hours since vaccine.) I have gone about day as normal, eating and exercising, drinking plenty of water.

                                                After my vaccine I had tenderness in my right arm at injection site and a sharp pain in my right clavicle bone. The clavicle bone pain slowly went to an ache. But then I noticed my arm was ballooning up a d the injection site was hard. Then, About a week after my COVID vaccine, I experienced leg pain (left) behind my knee and my arm was getting larger and warm to the touch. My first appointment with my doctor was 3/24/2021 at 1215pm. He checked out the areas and ordered a ultrasound Doppler of my left knee. I called the vaccine center as it says on the paper given with the vaccine. I spoke to someone and explained my symptoms. She suggested a ultrasound of my arm as well. I called my primary care doctor who added my arm to the order.

Crushing pain all over body, joints and muscles. Stabbing headache similar to a migraine. Dizziness. Diarrhea for 1 day; abdominal pain for nearly two weeks. Intermittent nausea for nearly two weeks. Felt like I had a fever, although the thermometer said 99.7. The feverish feeling lasted for 3 days. The crushing pain lasted for nearly two weeks. The dizziness was intermittent for two weeks. Got a full-blown migraine headache 4 days after vaccine. Please note: I did NOT take my nightly aspirin dose for 2 days prior to vaccine so as to not affect the immune response. I restarted my nightly dose at 11 PM,  6 hours following the vaccine. Still had all the above-mentioned symptoms.

                                                Muscular pain, more than just aches.  It was as if all of the muscles in my legs had shortened.  It wasn&#39;t like a sudden cramp that just went away after a few minutes. Nothing I did seemed to help, walking around, stretching,.  It got progressively worse.  This started around 9 pm.  I took three (200 mg) ibuprofen at about 10:30  p.m.. That didn&#39;t help much, unable to lay down and sleep,  too uncomfortable in any position. . Finally around midnight I took a muscle relaxant, and that  worked. When I woke up this morning, I felt fine.  No muscle pain or aches.

I also experienced chills, low grade fever of 99.8 and had swelling to my joints in my fingers and toes. My right arm pain radiated upwards to my neck. These symptoms lasted 12 hours and as of today I still have pain in my neck. Since 03-15-2021, I have been seeing a chiropractor for my neck pain. I see him on a weekly basis. At the chiropractor&#39;s office they apply ice, heat and do a muscle rub help with my neck pain that still is present.

I have a high tolerance for pain and consider myself stoic) and I was shaking so hard I thought I was going to have a seizure or something. I was very tired and slept through the night. This morning I feel like I have the flu ? headache, body aches, fatigue. Thank you.

This is persisting and can&#39;t stand for a more than 30 minutes without incurring additional pains and stiffness.  The stiffness is such that it feels as there is a sprained muscle or bone by the right ankle and top of the sole of left foot.

                                                I began with numbness on the left side of my face and neck about 15 minutes after the shot and it lasted about 6 to 7 hours. I began the expected side effects at about 10 hours after with fever, muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue, terrible headache. I thought I had to suffer through it so my body could react properly but at 22 hours post shot, I finally took 2 Aleve which helped tremendously. I felt great when I woke on Monday then Monday night began with the left side of face very mildly numb again. I&#39;m not doing anything for it.

Approximately 17-18 hours after injection (by noon Thursday), muscle &amp; joint aches began (hips, shoulders, hands, neck), with chills, fatigue, and low-grade temp (99.6).  Tylenol helped, but brain fog was severe. By  9:00pm, my temp was 101 and I felt severe body aches &amp; miserable.  Only very mild symptoms the next day (Friday) and by Saturday I was fine.  It was like a 24-hr flu.

                                                Uncontrollable shaking, teeth chattering, fever of 102, barely able to walk due to the shaking, nausea, body aches, and joint pain, occuring approximately 7 hours after vaccination and lasting approximately 14 hours . Severe facial/sinus pain on left side of face March 20 (approximately 48 hrs after vaccine) lasting about 24 hours. And then Mild facial/sinus pain on left side of face lasting another 24 hours. Used ibuprofin, meloxocam 7.5 mg, and extra strength tylenol to help relieve side effects. The first 7 hours after the vaccine none of the anti-inflammatory medications helped to relieve any side effects. The facial pain I experienced a day later was relieved somewhat with the anti-inflammatories.

Reported the continued arm pain the next day to the doctor and she ordered an ultrasound. Report negative on blood arm clot. Got a fever, body aches, headache, tired, triggered a migraine per doctor, localized reaction of 2 3/4&#34; at injection site with redness, swelling, pain. Almost passed out at a store - Became dizzy, tingling hands and sweating and taken to ER by ambulance. ER ruled out blood clot but found I had a UTI without any symptoms-prescribed an antibiotic. Contiue to have minor headache and minor discomfort at injection site. Awful experience and adverse reactions!

Prior to vaccine, I was energetic and worked out vigorously every day for 60 min (20 mile bike ride and weight lifting).  Typical muscle sored prior to vaccine was a day or 2 after increasing weights.  Now, I can only work out 2 days a week.  Muscles ache constantly and I cannot sleep because of the pain.  Ibuprofen only helps a little.  Prior to the vaccine I slept 7-8 hours a night.  Since the vaccine, I am sleeping 10 hours and am still tired.

                                                My issues initially started about an hour after the vaccine.  I became very subdued, no appetite and &#34;foggy&#34; for a lack of better words.  I attributed this to what others stated were &#34;typical reactions&#34; and did not make a fuss over it.   The following day I was VERY tired and stayed in bed and then about half way thru day 3, I became alert and resumed normal activity.  At day 13 I began to have upper thigh pain in my left leg and began to feel winded as I was would walk up steps and do housework which had not happened previously ever..  On 4/14/21 I requested an appointment with my primary care doctor, however he was booked for 2 weeks and I was referred to an associated PA  where I received a virtual consult.  He told me that I was &#34;over the age&#34; of the women that were having reactions ,even though I had requested a Doppler.  He only ran bloodwork, and in fact never even called me back on the bloodwork, and just posted it in the online profile.  My ankles are VERY swollen and have bluish pitting and my feet do have considerable pain.  I do have right side abdominal pain everyday since the 13th of April.  I now need to find a doctor that will run diagnostics and respect my concerns

                                                24 hours of receipt  my eyes hurt. My bones and joints hurt. I was extremely cold.  Lasted approximately 4 hours 50 hours after receipt  my eyes hurt again. I was freezing and shaking.   My bones hurt again.I would start sweating and become extremely hot then cold again. My mouth was dry and I was extremely thirsty. I could not sleep.  This lasted approximately 6 hours and I was fine. All reactions were very similar to those experienced when I had COVID in December 2020.

                                                3/11/21, 5:00 pm started to feel very cold, fingers started to feel numb, by 6:00 pm had severe chills and shivering, fingers were white and fingernails were blue. I became extremely dizzy, so much so that just moving my head or moving from under my blankets or even talking would create a sensation like zaps or electrical jolts inside my head. By this time, I had about four thick blankets on me. This calmed the chills. If I moved even just my hand outside of the blankets, I would immediately start shivering again. I felt my worst at about 9:00 pm. Slowly got better. Drank a lot of water. Dizziness and chills subsided by about 12 midnight and left me with a headache. Tylenol helped reduce that. Slept the rest of the night. Today from about 9:00 am until currently 5:40 pm, I have had slight muscle aches, fatigue, slept on and off all day. Still a bit dizzy but not too bad.

                                                My left arm started to sting immediately after getting the shot, then the stinging subsided.  My left arm started to hurt later in the day and I had pain all the way down my left arm and left side of my chest. This pain throughout my left side was not helped by Ibuprofen and  made sleep very hard.  I had intermittent sharp pain in my neck, shoulder, and left arm for days.  The injection site turned red, hot, and a raised area the size of a silver dollar appeared  and was med-red in color for about 8 days.  The color is better/ almost normal as of today, but still a hard lump under the skin and a bit itchy.  This has caused pain throughout my back and shoulders since I got the shot....but it has not been activity limiting.  I had a slight bit of nausea for a couple of days as well.  My husband had his shot just after mine and experienced  Chills , headache, and nausea at about 9:00 P.M.  His chills subsided at about 3:00 A.M.  He continued with the headache for another day/ fatigue for 2 days/ and nausea for about 5 days.  He has also had tingling in his left arm (about 7 days)  and a funny tingling on his tongue for about a week.

                                                Most troubling adverse event has been Vertigo and Dizziness.  Within 13 hours of vaccination, I experienced chills, joint pain, weakness, muscle aches, fever.  36-40 hours fever decreased as did most body aches,  but I then started experiencing intermittent Vertigo.  It has  decreased in frequency, but still as late as 16 days later it has occurred.  In between I have daily had light headedness/dizziness  (still having dizziness) and sometimes a low grade fever, i.e. around 99.5 as well as headache.  Not sure if all this is related to vaccine, but I have never had Vertigo before.

                                                I received the vaccine at 8:45 am on 04/11/21.  By 3pm I was experiencing fatigue and full body muscle aches, which were temporarily helped by Tylenol.   By 5pm I had fatigue, very severe chills, a low grade fever (just under 100) and moderate to severe body aches.   Today, 4/12/21, I am fine except for some lingering fatigue.  I am very grateful to have received the vaccine, and am only reporting in case this is helpful to other people.  (My husband got it at the same time and had no ill effects.)

Took Tylenol at 4 am.  Did not take anything else since.  Fever subsided in low  99&#39;s throughout that day. No other symptoms.  4-10-21 Woke up fine, no fever. Went to work at 7 am.  Toward end of work day, vaccination site became sore and I felt out of sorts.  4-11-21 Woke up fine, no fever. Went to work at 7 am. By noon, feeling foggy. Very sore throughout my body, especially upper body and vaccination site. 4-12-21 Woke up ok, no fever but not quite myself. Went to work 7 am. At about 8 am began to feel a bit foggy , dizzy and almost past out. Blood pressure taken by medics was normal but high for me, after resting  for 15 minutes it had gone done to my normal.  Went back to work station sitting  down but the foggy &amp; dizziness continued off and on. Went back to my hotel to rest at 1 pm. While resting felt better but when moving out of bed sensations would come back. Some pain in left side vaccination and shoulder/neck pain but that may be related to chronic issues. 4-13-21 Stayed home to rest, fogginess continues, pain in vaccination site down arm.

To this day I am still dealing with the headache, the pain not just in the arm but allover, gastro intestinal problems. It has impacted my sleep tremendously because the level of pain is very high. The one thing that went away that very first night was the low fever.  But this vaccine is like a Wish (cheap store) Vaccine. They SHOULD NOT give this to immunocompromised people and the &#34;few days&#34; rhetoric does not apply to us and that should be specified! Initially I thought this was to be expected when I heard a Doctor on the news say: &#34;if you fell like you got ran over by a truck, that is normal.&#34; So,  that is how I felt, so I thought it was normal.

                                                Approximately 6-7 hours after injection, all over my body, my skin was &#34;tingling&#34; and right thumb and lower back pain increased.  The tingling all over my body was not really painful, more like the nerves were just very active.  It was hard to get comfortable to sleep.  The symptoms lasted approximately 6-1/2 hours.  No other symptoms.

                                                I previously reported that 8 hours post vaccination I had severe teeth-chattering chills, severe muscles spasms throughout my body and aching of every joint.  That stopped after 5 hours at which time I felt like I was on fire from the inside.  Several hours that later and I developed a headache, nausea and diarrhea.  I took my temperature upon arising and it was 100.3.  I was fatigued.  The headache then diminished by 24 hours post vaccination.  I continued with abdominal upset, bloating, loose bowels, fatigue and fluctuating fever for 9 more days.  On day 17 post vaccination, I had a medical appointment at which time my BP was taken.  Because I always had good BP, I do not monitor it between medical visits.  It was 178/96.  I had never had high BP.  I always ran 120/80 or below.  I bought a BP cuff and checked it again later that day after resting.  The BP increased that evening to 188/101.  I made an appointment with my PCP the next day.  At that time, my BP was 188/110.

These symptoms have lasted for since the day after I got the vaccine.  I was able to cycle 20 miles a day and complete 45 minutes of weight training 4 to 5 times a week prior to the vaccine.  I have since been unable to do these activities consistently.  Even yoga can be painful and exhausting after several days.  I am exhausted by 8pm and often sleep 12 hours.  Prior to the vaccine, I slept no more than 8 hours and awoke early.  Some days are worse than others with all the symptoms.  I have not seen a doctor.

                                                Got my vaccine today  It hurt when the pulled the needle out  About 30 minutes after on my way home. My finger tips on my left arm went numb, same arm where I received the shot.  By the time I got home  I had a headache, so I took some tylenol.   My mouth is dry on and off. They told me to drink water and Gatorade  I slept for about 5 hours. I feel better but I still have a dry mouth.  The next morning my arm was swollen and itchy around the injection. I used an ice pack for the swelling.  About 24 hours later I was sweating on and off and my headache continued. I took another tylenol. And my body muscles were hurting.  I did not see a physician during any of the episodes.  It&#39;s the morning of March 23rd and I feel okay today.

                                                Within 25-30 minutes I felt a very sore area on my right side just up from the bottom of my rib cage. I reached for it and I could touch the exact spot with one finger. It was almost like if you had run into the corner of a table really badly. It came on fast. Within less then 10 min later it felt like a small balloon was getting inflated with the sore spot right in the center expanding. The soreness was not that big just this strange feeling like that area was expanding just like a balloon. I would say it was about an 8&#34; circle. This strange feeling and soreness lasted all evening. It even woke me up in the middle of the night. It was slowly gone by the end of the next day. The next day I only felt a little tired and not well. Nothing major. I have not heard of anything like this. I have no doubt this was from the shot. I had only gotten in my car to drive home. As soon as I pulled in my garage it came on very suddenly. No other reason for this.

                                                My shoulder area became very sore 8 days after the injection (no symptoms prior).  It felt like I&#39;d torn a muscle and couldn&#39;t lift my arm above my head or use it to carry or lift items.  It got sorer through the weekend so Sunday morning I applied Chinese cups to the area (I&#39;m a licensed massage therapist) and the whole shoulder area (4 cups) turned dark purple - I&#39;ve never experienced so big of an area turn purple.  It relieved a little but Monday I went to see a neurological chiropractor which relieved some.  On Sunday and Tuesday I took 800 mg/ibuprofen which seemed to help relieve some of the pain.

Extreme Weakness, Nausea , especially when I would try to eat .  Increased thirst/ urination .  My ankles and feet swelled .  My friend who is a pharmacist instructed me to take a Tylenol but I couldn?t even get out of bed to get one to take.  ? any movement made my head swim and I felt like I would throw up.

The pain subsided after a few hours, and I assumed that it was gallbladder related because of a single gallbladder attack&#39; I had over 10 years ago.  o Three days later (30 MAR 2021), while on a Zoom call with a friend, I began to experience more severe upper quadrant abdominal pain and nausea, saying several times over the hour that I thought I might have to vomit.

Went back to Dr. On the 22nd. He considered it still an inflammatory response. Now at 26 days out, still have some lower limb twitching and upper body muscle spams have begun again mainly on right hand side non shot arm.

                                                Immediately that evening, I started to get headachy and nauseous. My arm in the injection site was very sore. The next morning, the other arm was sore. It was difficult for me to raise my arms above my head without feeling extremely weak. I couldn&#39;t lift anything above my head for the fear I would drop them. Knee replacement surgery on both knees about 4 years ago - I felt pain in my knees; all my joints; all of my teeth; my vision was blurry. My head hurt so badly. Tylenol dulled the headache and joint pain but it didn&#39;t help it to go away. My chest also hurt quite a bit. I felt extremely lethargic.  I didn&#39;t feel like getting out of bed. I could only get the  meals  made (I&#39;m a caregiver for my mom and mother-in-law) and then get back into bed. I usually walk five miles a day. I&#39;m still not there yet ( to walk that much) but I&#39;m getting better. The nausea lasted until the 17th. The headache just left finally on April 23. The body aches, teeth ache and joints subsided around the 17th also. The blurry vision - I still have a a little bit of that but it&#39;s starting to improve. The weakness in the arm - that is starting to improve - I do still feel kind of weak when I raise my arms above my head. The fatigue I still have but I&#39;m feeling a bit of improvement.  I have to keep checking my bed to see if I accidentally put the massage setting on (and I hadn&#39;t) because my body was shaking  in entire  body- That started on the second day after the vaccine and stopped about the 19th. I called to the advice nurse to register my health complaint and she had me come in for a full workup. And she asked me to go to ER. They kept me in the ER overnight.

                                                When I received the injection, I experienced a sharp intense burning pain which shot up my shoulder, neck and behind my ear. This has never happened before. My shoulder/arm were sore for approximately one week which seemed typical to how I respond to a vaccine. After a week I began experiencing a sharp pain in my neck and shoulder area which has gradually worsened to where I am now icing it multiple times per day. There is also numbness and tingling down my forearm and into my thumb and index finger.  The pain is unmanageable at times and I am unable to get a full nights rest and have near constant pain when keyboarding.
