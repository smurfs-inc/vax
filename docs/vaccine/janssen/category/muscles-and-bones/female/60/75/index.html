The days after vaccine I had extreme tiredness and felt like I had a bad cold with a lot of coughing and shortness of breath.  I was coughing up a lot of mucus.  The cold like symptoms are still ongoing, 2 weeks after the vaccine, but are less extreme.  8 days after the vaccine I started to have pain at the injection site.  My upper hurt if I touched it.  Twelve days after the vaccine my upper arm hurts if I raise my arm and if I shake my inhalers to use them.  This seems like a muscle pain from the injection site to my shoulder.

                                                7 hours from vaccine, my heart started palpitating and I started feeling sick. I got in my car to go home from a friends house and started severe chills and called Doctor for fear of heart attack. They told me to go to ER. I continued driving home. Chills got worse. I got in shower with heater on and chills persisted. Drank coconut water and heart palpitations resided.  Got in bed and fever spiked to 102 and every bone was inflamed in pain. Nyquil did nothing. After a few hours of severe and unbearable pain I called ER. Headed over to ER at 3:00 a.m. and sat in parking lot. Fever broke at 3:00 a.m. which was hour 14 after vaccine. Other than severe nausea, pain calmed down. Drove home with Tylenol. Took 1,000 mg and finally rested at 4:00 a.m. Woke up at 8:00 a.m. with nausea but pain gone. 24 hours from vaccine, most of the reaction gone. 48 hours out body normal but pain in injection site.

                                                Felt hot within a few minutes after the vaccine, then passed out. The NP on site said she was unable to find a pulse so did 10 chest compressions before I woke up. Called the rescue squad who did an EKG on route to Hospital and once I was in the ER another EKG was performed along with blood work and chest X-ray. Entry was noted as allergic reaction but diagnosis was noted as Vasovagal Syncope, Adult. EKG?s performed along with labs were normal. I have pulled muscles, tendons and ligaments from the chest compressions which were questionable but since that day have experienced tingling in upper body and arms and have felt bad. Went back to my Primary Care Doctor for follow up on March 29 for another EKG. Have had panic attacks from the situation and per Doctor will take 2 months for my chest, muscles, tendons and ligaments to heal. Hard to determine if the way I have felt is from the vaccine or what transacted when I fainted. Today which is April 9, I still feel weak, normally I am very energetic. Just wanted to report as when I saw the news that others had some situations thought best to let you know.

Took 2 Tylenol every 4-6 hours to help the headache. It lasted until Sunday morning. My nose felt stuffy when I woke up Sunday morning at which time there was blood in my nose. The rest of the day it was clear but a small amount appeared Monday morning as well. Both sides of my temples are sore to the touch as if they were bruised. Other than that and being weak the other symptoms are gone.

I kept waking up scared.  I started to have a flare up of my Arthritis. I still have feelings of tiredness, headaches and my back has been really flared up. I have a disability with my spine being crooked. The pain has been a lot worse than normal. I have been visiting the Chiropractor frequently three weeks after my shot. I did not have as much back pain before the vaccine.

Was on a walk and went home and sat in a chair. 4 hours after injection my neck and upper back was killing me. I have had a previous injury from a car wreck 40 hears ago. I slept in the chair that night and the next days on a heating pad. My back felt like a horse kicked me. The next day my eyelids were too heavy to lift for about the duration of a movie. I could not fall a sleep, but could not lift my eyelids. I had vaccination on Friday night. I could not stand any sunlight until Sunday. My sinuses were killing me and the back of the head. On Sunday afternoon I could eat chicken broth and drank lots of water. By Sunday night, I felt fine and ran 5 miles on the treadmill. Feel great now.

She reported that her mother was having &#34;flu-like&#34; symptoms approximately 3 weeks after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine. She also mentioned that she was having a headache in the back of her head and neck which are known to be possible indication of a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis which has been rarely associated with the J&amp;J vaccine. I advised the daughter to take the mother to the emergency department for further evaluation and she agreed that she would take her right away.

                                                I took 1 Benandryl about 1 hour before the injection of the vaccine prior to leaving my home.  My son took me as I would anticipate some type of reaction given my history.  J&amp;J was the one my doctor recommended in hopes that I could handle the response better and only need 1 dose. I had options to get pfizer or moderna, but my dr wanted J&amp;J so I waited several weeks longer to get this one.  Within 10 minutes of having the injection, my  ears swelled up, and felt like I was on a bad plane and could not burst clear.  Then my throat on left side, the same side I got the shot swelled.  My face was full of red and rash and my son mentioned he was concerned how I looked.  I told him my symptoms and then took another Benadryl before we left the store. I told the pharmacist that I was having a reaction, they wanted to call 911-I said please no. I am used to having reactions and would want to see if I can manage it with Benadryl at home.  I came home and took my Alegra (as I take my alegra at night before bed to help with congestion).  Going forward every 2-3 hours I would take another benadryl rotating the time frames and slept as much as possible. It took several hours for the swelling to subside, longer than I was used to.  Over the next several days, I would have times when my ears, throat would swell, my face would be red and rashed, especially at night my face will get red, rash and ears and throat swell late at night. It waxes and wains depending on how I feel.   After the main allergic reaction of 12-24 hours later, I stared with the COVID symptoms, fever, chills, body ache, the joints that I have trouble with hurt so much more (knee, foot, arms, hands) I was so thankful I did not catch COVID. I don&#39;t think I would have survived. On Friday, March 19, 2021 was the first day I started to feel better except for the late night episodes of allergic reaction. I take Alegra or when needed Benadryl. It seems to lower my swelling response.

                                                Migraine headache for a week, had a MRI of the brain to rule out blood clots.   A torn rotor cuff that happened 10 years ago that was a no issue, became very painful and inflamed to the point of needing a Cortisone shot and MRI to see what is going on.

Woke on Friday  3/19/21 with fatigue and diarrhea with body aches.  Woke Saturday 3/20/21 with fever 101.7. (During this duration to include today I have  taken Tylenol rotating with Motrin every 2 hours, this never broke my fevers). Fever continues on and off with body aches, nausea, the worst headache I have ever experienced and pain in the base back of my neck L side.  These symptoms have continued since Saturday.  It is now Friday, 3/26/21.  I will say that during waking hours 8am - 10pm on Wednesday 3/24/21 and Thursday 3/25/21 I had no symptoms except absolute fatigue.  The fever returned on those two nights at around midnight with it breaking about 4 am, waking up in a pile of sweat.

I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

                                                I was fine at first but after 11 hours, I began to get a bad headache within 30 minutes I also had nausea and severe pain all over my body to the point I did not want to move at all. Ibuprofen did not help. I was so tired, I could not move. It lasted through the night and would wake me up. I slept most of the next day until about 1:00pm.  I finally began to feel better about 12 hours after it began and within 24 hours I was back to normal other that the sore shoulder.

On April 8th woke up very dizzy, had to lay back down for a little bit.  On April 10th woke up not being able to take a deep breath without a very bad pain in my back (it felt like my right lung)  same issue the 11th, and 12th.  This pain was not severe unless I took a deep breath.  I was able to go about my daily activities.  Today April 13th still a little tight in my lung but do not have the pain in my back that I had the last few days.

                                                Right after shot, did not feel anything that morning till around 5pm I started to feel feverish, headache, tired.  My arm never got sore or swollen.  AFter 5pm till, the feverish feeling and hot cold got worse as time went by and I started shaking uncontrollably - pretty severe.  I took Tylenol early hoping to stop the achy feverish and shaking but did not seem to help.  THis went to till about 1am or 2am when I could finally lay down and try to sleep.  The shaking had stopped.  I did take more Tylenol and drank some herbal chamole type of hot tea.  I could not sleep that night.  Next day I was exhausted, body aches and still had some feverish feeling.  By the way, took my temperature and it was normal.  Then on Wednesday, I believe is when I had a huge episode of diarrhea (came on sudden).  I kept calling and talking virtually to the doctor telling him all of what was going on.  The next day I the feverish feeling and body aches and being tired kept happening  - adding headache getting worse.  I kept taking Tylenol.  Seem to help some but did not take the pain away. EAch night , I could not sleep due to the headache.  I started to feel better but then on the weekend, I had that headache and tired feeling.  The headache was getting stronger and it circled my whole head and both shoulder and around my neck.  It scared me because I felt at times that my throat was getting smaller.  I could still swallow but it was so strange.  I kept putting heat packs and ice packs and taking Tyelnol.  I know that on Thursday or Friday the week, the doctor told me if I wanted to to go get tested for Covid and I did.  I was tested negative on both the quick test and the other test that takes longer.     I had that headache, sinus tension pressure for quite a few more days.  Overall it took 7 days. I had to take off  most of the week from my telework job because I could not function.  I also did not eat much and drank lots of water during this time.  It seem to go away and then about a week later, I got this painful diarrhea out of the blue and went to see an urgent care doctor.  They tested me for blood, urine, and stool and they were negative.  I was also having pain on my left side.  Then it seem to go away after I was on the BRAT diet for a few more days.  Then the diarrhea happened again the next week or so.  This week, as of yesterday, I got a very strange throbbing pain in my left hand and not sure where that came from.  It can be extreme at times.  I tool Tyleonol but the pain is still there.  Also, during this time and before the shot, I got a trigger finger issue on my right index finger.  I don&#39;t think that has anything to do with the vaccine.  Please note I have been told my doctors and I know this for a fact, my body is super sensitive to food, meds.  I don&#39;t usually get the flu shot because of that.  Today I am experiencing the left hand pain and now metal tasting in my mouth.  I am about 5 weeks out from the vaccine.  I wish I had never taken it.  I pray nothing more will happen  in my body  If I have left anything off it is because I did not write this down when was happening.  I really thought I was going to die one night because of the pressure I was having in my head, neck and shoulders.   I have a little bit of a headache now and told my PT doctor that if I needed to know, I could get a brain or some kind of scan to see if I am hainvg any issues. I am going to bring this up to my virtual call today.

Patient reports that she felt lightheaded after the vaccine when she was leaving. She got home and felt better but then that night woke up in a delirium which passed by the morning. She had some weakness in her extremities, brain fog, cold feeling, funny GI feeling and fatigue for 3 days and then was fine.   Two weeks ago she started to feel that the circulation in her lower legs was cut off with sensation of blood pooling in her legs with associated numbness and tingling. She describes it as what you feel when a tourniquet is applied to your arm.  No visible lower extremity swelling, redness and no pain.    One week ago she felt like her right hand was not working well and then left hand too. She then felt pooling in her arms like the sensation in her legs.No swelling, redness or pain.   She reports she did a hand stand and afterward felt pooling sensation in her lower abdomen which has since resolved but continues to have a prickling sensation that comes and goes.   Last night while lying on her back she felt the pooling sensation in her chest and this morning throbbing in head and chest and neck. That is when she decided to come in and be seen.    Patient denies severe headache, backache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, bruises, unusual bleeding or rashes.   Patient has not had a physical exam with blood work since 11/9/17.

                                                Starting around midnight, my joints were extremely achy. I went to bed, but tossed and turned, even though I was very tired, but so sore. I got chills and fever, but didn&#39;t take my temperature. The next morning, took my temperature and it was 101. Ate a piece of coffee cake with some tea. Was very tired, so went back to  bed. Was also a bit queasy, and not hungry for lunch, and had a mild headache. Slept most of the day, had chills and fever off and on, and joints very sore. I did eat dinner. The next day I was much better, but still had some soreness in my joints, one or two episodes of mild chills, was somewhat tired and lethargic. The next day I was more or less back to normal. I did take Tylenol at some point, but I can&#39;t remember if it was the afternoon of the first day of fever, or not until the next afternoon. I know I did take it again the next morning.  All in all, it felt like a full-blown case of the flu, but was of short duration.

I could not bend over, lie down or sit for very long without severe discomfort. I ended up seeing a chiropractor within the week who has been treating the problem over this past month.  X rays were taken. I have been treating it with ice, ibuprofen, and aspirin.

Left ring finger went numb, white and cold, with bruise appearing on the middle digit. Other finger tips turned pink. Skin turned red onhands with tingling sentation. Right hand blood vessels came to the surface and began to swell at intersections. Skin on rt. hand looked whiter and dry. The sudden onset sent me to the emergency room, the condition began to fade in 3 hours, not completely. The same reaction occured the next day at 12 noon. I took a hot shower and the condition improved followed by extreme tiredness. *At the time of vaccination, &amp; on both of these events I had a stiff neck/red skin.

                                                Fingers on left hand began tingling around 30 minutes or so after shot.  While riding home in the car, both the numbness, heaviness feeling in my arm and the tingling worsened.  Then a strong sensation went up the left side of my neck and into the left side of my face where my face started tingling.  That was so powerful and unexpected it caused me to gasp and grab the side of my neck.  My husband turned the car around and we returned to the hospital where they took the information and had me sit for a while checking back a few times.   My arm, fingers, neck and face continued to feel numb and heavy with my face and fingers tingling.    After no improvement and some escalation as it ebbed and flowed, I had an April 12 appointment with Dr at Medical Center.  Some blood work was done afterwards.  A PT appt. is set for April 29th.  It has been more than two weeks now and unfortunately, the numbness, heaviness and tingling continue.

My chest was burning like it was on fire - lungs felt like they were on  fire. I woke up the next morning, with a little bit of body aches - I slept the entire next day pretty much (the 7th). On the 7th, I noticed that my heart was beating - fluttering- skipping- beating. My left left also swelled up and was red. I had  PVCs with pulmonary embolism on that left leg  in1996 - when I was doing the chemo. My left leg ached, burned and got red on the 7th. I was going to see the PCP the following week and I was still having issues with the heart but the leg was getting better. It can still swell, burn and get red quite a bit of night because I stand on my legs all day - but the amount of pain and swelling did go down over that week while I was waiting to see the doctor. I had an ultrasound on my leg. And a heart halter to monitor my heart for 24 hours. I do have PVCs.  Stress from vaccine caused Herpes Outbreak - that was on the left inner thigh right next to genitals - bumps within four days of vaccine.  Created more pain. Took Benadryl for pain - helps with the nerve pain - two days with. I took 3000 mg a day of Tylenol for three days after the vaccine.  Have not recovered from the calf and heart symptoms.

Minor arm pain the first day, I expected that. Did my regular errands and was fine, a little tired.  The next day, (Sunday)...I went to church, had a headache, arms aching like mad, arthritic symptoms , legs cramping, joint pain in elbows especially, were off the chain!  I returned home and took immediately to the couch, where I had a low grade fever and stayed all day. I had no appetite, no energy to get up except to go to the bathroom.

Sunday I was feeling pain around my lest breast where I had had my mastectomy in June of 2006. That eased up the next day.  Feeling stressed because I have bad tinnitus and was worried about a reaction.

                                                Initial reaction was flu-like symptoms but more concerning reaction was a bad rash with red small bumps on the same side as the shot was given directly above my left breast that was severely itchy. This rash is just now starting to dissipate but still itches; I used OTC cortisone creme and Benedryl to address the itching. The other major effect involved my left arm. For a full week, the muscle in which the shot was given was extremely sore to the touch and the whole arm ached. I still cannot fully extend that arm above my head without it feeling like an aching weight. Lastly, I had a pain in the center of my back as a hard ache that one week later still has not fully dissipated. It appears to be going away, but has lingered longer than I would have expected.

I took 2.5mg of Ambian thinking that if I could just fall asleep, I would sleep it off. After an hour of non-stop symptoms, I fell asleep for about an hour only to wake up  with the severe neck and back pain and headache still present. The body shaking had subsided.   The next day, I was tired but fine.

                                                2 hours after I received the vaccination, I came down with severe chills.  My entire body was shaking and I could not get warm.  I got extremely fatigued to the point that I could not get out of bed.  I got a severe headache (and I get headaches a lot...this one lasted for almost 10 days).  It seemed that every bone and muscle in my body began aching, from head to toes.  My fever went up to almost 102.  These symptoms continued for a course of four days, except the headache and fatigue (which lasted for approximately 6 days and the headache for 10 days).  I alternated Tylenol, Advil and Alleve.  They did not help hardly at all, unfortunately.  2 weeks later, I developed lymph node swelling in my right arm pit and alongside my right breast.  Today, these lymph nodes are still swollen and are painful to the touch.  I experienced pain at the injection site and if I touch it, it is still painful today, but does not ache like it did initially.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I grew exhausted and had to sleep into late evening and was chilled,  had a fever of 101 and developed severe pain and inflammation on the top of my collar bone that was feverish and migrated toward my shoulder region on the same side as my vaccine. Ibuprofen would not help with the pain but helped with the fever. My mind told me that I had things to tend to the next day, but still was forced to sleep off and on for 2 more days. After a week and a half, not only did I have thirst, but also food didn&#39;t taste right and was metallic.  This lasted for 2 days and finally my taste was restored. The exhaustion lasted off and on for 2 weeks and I just listened to my body. The pain and inflammation on my collar bone has subsided 4 days ago but still have pain in my shoulder when I sleep.  On April 5 around 8:30 a.m. a nasty virus hit me out of the blue. I grew week and tired and had to go to bed. I slept all day until around 9:00 p.m. and woke to uncontrollable diarrhea and fainting spell while in the bathroom. I had abominable pain and nausea that last for a half hour and then I returned to bed. The next 2 days, I was week and exhausted but continued with my regular routine.  My equilibrium is still affected from time to time.

Also during that time, waves of nausea but no vomiting, also uncontrollable shivering but I wasn&#39;t cold and I wasn&#39;t hot but weird shivering. I did not take my temperature as I didn&#39;t feel like I had a fever. Around 13 hrs after a stabbing pain in front of thighs like hot pokers started and around 14 hrs thigh pain was still present but then the calves on both legs started to get the same stabbing pain.   At around 24 hrs after - headache remained, pulsating teeth stopped, thigh pain stopped but calf pain remained. Headache remained off and on for several days. General brain fog also lasted for about 1 week. The calf pain comes and goes even after 2 weeks. Arm where shot was administered was very tender to the touch for the last 2 weeks.   Lastly, I wouldn&#39;t say I had shortness of breath but at times I just felt like I needed to stop and force myself to take a very deep breath.

                                                The  day after my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced left leg and knee pain with numbness sensation. I had a left knee replacement in September 2020.  I experience numbness below and above my knee cap. I also experienced bad migraines , arm soreness at the injection site. I called my doctor and he gave me an appointment to see him and he did not think it was related to the vaccine but he was not sure since I do have history of rheumatoid arthritis.  Today my left knee and leg still feel numb and I am taking my regular medications as instructed.

                                                In the evening I started to feel aches in my eyes and joints.  I was having trouble falling asleep.  I woke up every 2 hours. My heart bpm went up to 102 in the middle of the night.  I know this because my fit bit was vibrating and encouraging me to keep exercising and I was just laying in bed trying to sleep.  I finally got up around 2:30 in the morning and took 1 Aleve. I also took my temperature with a forehead type and it was 98.5, so no high fever.  I took another Aleve around 7:00 in the morning.  Now I am feeling fine.  It&#39;s now 8:22 a.m. and I am working from home.  I just wanted to report that the aches in joints and 102 bpm and unable to fall asleep were my side effects.  I feel fine now.  I will continue to take Aleve as needed.   I have never been tested for Covid.  I have never had any symptoms to warrant testing for covid.  Since March 13, 2020 I have been fortunate to work for a company that has us all working from home.  We are still working from home.  i am 63 years old.  I shop around 6 a.m. in the morning for groceries to avoid people. I do not go out.  I have been very careful.

Thereafter I was just very tired for 24 hours.  I took an Advil  about 10 hours (around noon) after the headache set in, which lessened the headache.

About 8 hours after injection, muscle ached and so was chilled but felt ok otherwise.  FitBit alerted me that I was earning points for being in my ?active zone? even though I was just watching tv - resting heart rate is 66   (actively exercising, heart rate  is usually less than 120) but it was 136&#43;.  HR stayed elevated ( Verified HR with pulse oximeter) while I was not  doing anything. Took temperature (forehead thermometer) and it was 103F.  Took Tylenol. Heart rate slowly went down after Tylenol kicked in and fever came down to 101.  Heart rate stayed a little higher than normal and fever lasted 24 hours. By 48 hours, all was well.

                                                At the time of injection I felt a pressure pain radiating diagonally downward toward my armpit.  Where she injected me was very high up on my arm almost close to the top.  The pain at injection site was quite sore for the first few days and then went away for the most part for a day or two but has now come back much worse.  It hurts to lift my arm or move it and feels like I&#39;ve lost strength to raise my arm.   I am in constant pain now and my arm around the injection site is painful when I press down especially on the bony area.

                                                March 13, 2021-1:30pm-Shot administered to right arm-it bled and the nurse had to apply pressure with an alcohol swab. It stopped immediately. 1:40-started feeling a tightness in the muscle in my neck under my right ear Stayed a few minutes longer than the required 15 to see if anything else presented. Mentioned it to the nurse and rep. The rep asked if I was nervous about getting the shot. When I said yes, he said it may just be that. Told me to contact my doctor with additional issues.  1:55-When leaving the parking lot, I felt my lips and nostril on the right side go numb-it felt like when Novocain is wearing off after a dentist visit. As the day progressed, the area under my ear and down my neck got more and more sensitive. My lips continued to feel numb. My injection site was tender and black and blue. When I went to bed at 9pm, I began experiencing lots of pain in my right lower jaw. I took a Tylenol but it didn&#39;t alleviate the pain. I called on-call doctor. Since I already had taken a Tylenol, he suggested an anti-inflammatory and warm moist compresses and to contact him again if things worsened. 3/14/21-7:00am-Upon awaking, my jaw pain was virtually gone but the whole area I had had the issue with was very tender to the touch. My lip still felt a bit numb.  3:25pm- It is now 26 hours since my vaccination. I still feel like I had trauma to the right side of my face and neck because it is sensitive to the touch. I also have a continued slight sensitivity of my lips on the right side. My glands on both sides of my neck now seem tender, as well. 3/15/21-3/17/21-I continue to have random pain/tenderness in the aforementioned areas. I also have an aura of tingling in my brain from time to time.

Vomited in middle of the night.  Felt very drained and tired with myalgia all of the next two days.  Majority of symptoms went away after that but I felt as if I was coming down with a cold for the next 7 days - today my nose has been running all day and I have a stuffed head  (and I have not had a cold since November 2019). I  had a covid test yesterday because I need to accompany my husband for a medical procedure on Friday - that was negative. I have seen no one, gone nowhere, and done nothing different since I received my vaccine than I had beforehand yet I am displaying symptoms normally associated with a cold although I have no fever.

                                                My symptoms started 03-18-2021 at 11am where I developed chills, was very sleepy that I slept 15 hours straight. I felt very fatigued and my eyes hurt so much and I could not keep them open. On 04-06-2021 I still was not feeling well. I started to have problems with my right side of my face, eyes and mouth which gradually got worse so I went to the hospital. At the hospital they checked me for stroke, performed lab work, did MRI and CT scans and the  the doctors came back and said it was Bell&#39;s palsy. I again went to the hospital 04-11-2021 but this time due to GI issues with pain.  On 04-14-2021 through 04-15-2021, I started to experience neck pain behind my right ear. At the hospital they had prescribed my prednisone 50mg, so I took half for my pain.  I still have trouble sleeping and have lots of pain.

The muscle pain was so severe I had trouble sleeping and sitting but could stand pain free.  This lasted about 3 days. I took Tylenol to help with the pain and used a heating pad also. After day 3 it was all over and I&#39;ve been fine ever since!

During a follow-up visit she informed me that it was a superficial blood clot and set up a second ultrasound on 04/28/2021 for confirmation that it had cleared.

                                                24 hours after the vaccine I developed a sharp pain on the inside of my left knee, slightly above the knee cap.  There was a soft bump in that area.  At work the next day I felt more sharp pains and bumps developing around my knees on both legs. The backs of my thighs were also beginning to burn.  I contacted the hotline set up at my work for adverse reactions when I got home from work that night.  They were concerned and had me call my doctor.  My work is onboard an aircraft and she did not want me to fly again without an ultrasound. I had an ultrasound perform on my left leg and the thigh of my right leg. It was normal.  Over the next week I would get stinging , painful bumps and used NSAIDS to help. Approximately six days after the shot the burning sensation on my thighs got worst. It spread for the back of my thighs to the front and then to the calves, arms and shoulders in that order, I started taking Benadryl to release the burning. I went to my doctor who sent me for another ultrasound and blood up. Three weeks after the injection the painful stinging bumps are still happening and the burning is on my legs, arms and shoulders. I am going back to the doctor today and talk about prescribing Gabapentin.

Lasted for 36 hours approx. 2) Approx ten days later on April 19th, 2021, I awoke at night with severe left shoulder pain/deep ache. It came and went over the next week, but became more constant and severe. I couldn&#39;t sleep most nights without sleep meds, and even then it was for a few hours, and on my back. I couldn&#39;t sleep on either the good and especially not the bad shoulder.  Via a phone call, my PCP suggested I begin treatment with Ibuprofen, 3-4 times per day. I took 2-3 Ibuprofen at a time. As of today, May 12, 2021, I am still taking Ibuprofen 3 times a day as I still cannot sleep on my bad (left) side. I didn&#39;t think this was related to the vaccine shot until my husband said that he also was having shoulder pain on the same side as the injection. His was milder and lasted about a week, but began about the same time as mine did.

                                                at injection, arm was not opperable, too weak to pick up coat or purse. After about 15 minutes the full use of arm was back. The muscle is still affected and strained after 6 days. I waited a half hour at the site and got into my car at 3:45. On the drive home within 30 minutes my face started to itch and turn red, then my mouth inside started to itch, then my eyes started to itch. After that my throat started to feel gravely, so I took 75 mgs of gel cap benedryl. This is what I feel and take upon getting stung by a bee. I also took my albuterol inhaller two puffs which I also always have on me because of my asthma. I was sleepy but had dinner and went to be. I did not feel that I had to take more benedryl during the night.

I couldn&#39;t knit ot fine motor skills, It bothered me. I woke up on Sunday where I had extremes muscle weakness in both my legs. I called my PCP, they were surprised by how the reaction was delayed.  They wanted me to get a test for the strength in my legs and sent me to the ER. I wen to the Er they tested for stroke, blood work, scans, they were worried about Guillain Barre Syndrome.  I stayed there about 5 hours.

Right away after receiving the vaccine-- stiff neck on the left side which after a night&#39;s sleep, moved to my right side of neck. No big deal.     Tired &amp; &#39;drunk&#39; after the vaccine which lasted until mid-afternoon the next day.  No big deal.       The worst of all happened at 3 1/2 days, a rash started in the evening, went to bed, woke up the next day with rash almost everywhere. Red, swollen, &amp; itching like crazy.   The next day- Sunday, along with Monday &amp; Tues. was horrid. I am covered from my scalp to the tops of my feet, my crotch hurts, as do my breasts. Used Benadryl cream, aloe vera to no avail.

These symptoms are typical of those who have taken the J&amp;J vaccine and in fact, if you read the actual stories of the side effects of people who took this vaccine, shared on sites, these symptoms are closer to 100% present rather than the far lower and untrue percentage revealed by the CDC. These symptoms need to be better tracked and people should be forewarned how COMMON these side effects are; they are not rare!

Don&#39;t remember reactions to previous vaccines but not surprised considering allergies. Left side of face felt strange but didn&#39;t look any different when a selfie was taken. Sometime during the afternoon/evening, experienced a headache of short duration. Approximately six hours after shot, experienced chills and low grade fever. Simply went to sleep. Better the following morning, though very tired.  Probably unelated rough itchy patch on RIGHT arm the day following vaccine. Went away with no treatment.

Immediately had to lay down and took Advil/Tylenol.  Could feel the movement of joint pain from shoulders to elbow, hips to knees.  Headache.  Couldn&#39;t navigate stairs safely.   In bed or on the couch for 24 hours until 6pm Friday 4/9/2021.      Three of us from the same company had the Janssen Vac within a day of each other and all 3 of us had the same adverse reaction.  To me, that is not mild symptoms when it debilitated me and kept me from going to work.    Most family members have had Pfizer with two shots and had NO side effects.

I have been in bed sleeping off and on feeling ill in waves.  I feel less ill for hours at a time, during which I get up out of bed and function relatively normally.  I felt completely fine (except for injection site achiness) until about an hour and a half after the shot, after which I went to sleep for several hours after which I felt better.    The major symptom is the general feeling of &#39;being sick&#39;.

                                                2 weeks post inoculation developed burning sensation/tingling /pain from armpit to thumb; some tingling in thumb - sensation more like nerve pain vs muscle pain.  After two days gradually improved.  Muscle strength not affected, but movement in most directions elicited sharp pain coursing down arm.  Gradually improving to pain over the deltoid near injection site;  as of 19 days since initial pain motility much improved but still periodically throbs and sensitive to pressure and certain movements.   No treatment except restricting use of arm and time.  10 hrs post inoculation developed chills, myalgia and headache.  Chills and myalgia resolved in a few hours; an aspirin the next day resolved the headache.    This reaction was not unexpected.  Did not have pain at injection site until 2 weeks post injection.

I was unable to straighten leg when lying in bed.  I managed to stand up and walk it off, but with pain as severe as in January when knee was replaced.  Leg continued to be sore, then Monday night I didn&#39;t have the same issue w/bending, but I did wake early with horrible stabbing pains in knee.  I treated with Tylenol, Alprozalan &amp; Ice.

I took a 500mg acetaminophen tablet to prevent my fever from climbing.  I awoke the following morning with a headache and still a low-grade fever of 99.  I was feeling fine about noon except for being tired.  I continued to feel like I had low grade flu like symptoms. for the next couple of weeks.  This could have been related to DST beginning which is always a challenge for me. About 10 days later, the muscle in my right arm where I received my shot started to ache.  Perhaps it is because I slept on it wrong and that created the ache.  Now 5 weeks later I still feel some muscle ache in my arm, especially when I lift it over my head.

Note: I called Dr.&#39;s office to report my symptons to the nurse the day after my vaccine shot. I was not sure if it was due to new BP meds or vaccine shot. The nurse said it was hard to say. The nurse did increase my Lisinopril to 10MG 1/day per the doctors orders.

Over the next couple of days, became very ill, spent five days experiencing severe headache, disorientation, confusion, neck, shoulder, and back pain together with generalized arthralgias and myalgias. Around the 2nd week post-vaccination began to experience ?numbness and tingling? initially, affecting all fingers and toes; symptoms gradually evolved into ascending paresthesia affecting the upper and lower extremities. (worse in the upper extremities). Neurological symptoms are accompanied by painful electrical-like impulses running along my spine and elicited by flexing my neck (Lhermitte neurological phenomenon). Neurological signs and symptoms prompted me to go to the emergency room. Currently, I am under the care of a neurologist and undergoing extensive diagnostic workup.  Present treatment: Glucocorticoids (tapering) and Gabapentin. Among the initial rule out diagnosis, were transverse myelitis, and Guillain Barre. Present preliminary r/o diagnosis: Post-vaccine immune reaction ? No definitive diagnosis yet.

She reported these on 4/19/21. I advised her to contact her PCP to get evaluated for the signs/symptoms that she is experiencing to rule out anything severe. She did not seem to understand and asked to speak with the manufacturer. She said that she would contact the manufacturer and walked away.  When I attempted to contact her again today on 4/20/21, the phone number she provided to us has been disconnected and we have no means of reaching her at this point in time. I am hoping she heeded my advice and contacted her PCP to get evaluated.

It was like my back was tired and the muscles were really tensed.   Moving helped but while sitting is when the issue back hurt worse.  I reached out to your Chiropractor on 3/31 who performed a few settings on my back to help with the tension but the pain went up and down during that time and seems as if the pain went away on it on.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient had experienced headache after vaccination. On 27-MAR-2021, the patient began to experience intermittent pain on right leg. On 30-MAR-2021, she experienced headache again and was still having leg pain; she visited the Emergency Room (ER) and was admitted on 30-MAR-2021. On 02-APR-2021, the patient experienced clots on right leg. On APR-2021, a catheter was placed in catheterization procedure and her right leg vein was unclogged of a clot. A second clot did not require removal because the vein had already unclogged itself after medication. The patient was administered unspecified anticoagulants. She was discharged on 5-APR-2021 and was prescribed ticagrelor which was then changed to clopidogrel. On 18-APR-2021, the patient experienced a headache again and feeling of pressure on legs and hands. Patient was advised to visit ER. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from clots on right leg and intermittent pain on right leg on 02-APR-2021, recovered with sequelae from headache on 19-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from pressure on both legs and pressure on hands. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 64 year-old Hispanic or Latino female with history of high blood pressure and diabetes was hospitalized for clots in her right leg 13 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Concomitant medications were not reported. On the day of her vaccination, she experienced a headache. Ten days later, she began to experience intermittent leg pain. Three days later (ie, 13 days post vaccination), she went to the emergency room (ER) and was admitted to the hospital. During the hospitalization, a clot was removed via catheterization and she was administered unspecified anticoagulants. A second clot resolved on its own without surgical intervention. After 6 days in the hospital, she was discharged with ticagrelor which was later changed to clopidogrel. She recovered from the clots. Thirteen days after discharge, she began to experience headache and &#34;pressure&#34; in both legs and hands. She was advised to go to the ER; no further information was provided. Based on the limited information, the relationship of the serious events with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant. Additional information is being sought.

Originally I had used heat, before finding the information online.  Nothing seems to help at this point.

                                                My initial symptoms were very minor and occurred the day after I received the vaccine: 99.5 degree fever and very mild headache. But several days later, both legs felt strangely weak from the calves to the feet. I also experienced occasional tingly feelings, pain, and often numbness. It was subtle at first but increased in intensity until April 21. I began to fear Guillain Barre syndrome. I scheduled a doctor&#39;s appointment for April 22, but the doctor&#39;s office cancelled and told me to go to the ER. At the ER bloodwork was done, which was normal. I was told to follow up with a neurologist if needed. It is now May 2 and my symptoms have slowly improved. It was frightening to have the symptoms for about a month. I was prepared to possibly feel unwell for several days, but expected neither my symptoms nor their duration.

I felt asleep and about 2 hours later I woke up and I had an SVT episode where my heart rate was beating was up to 200 by then the fever had gone down to 99. I called the nurse line.. they told me to call an ambulance. I called the ambulance they took me in they immediately put fluids they monitored me for 7 hours and they sent me home afterwards. I slept for 24 hours. Then on 4/27/2021 I had another SVT episode where my heart rate went up to 176 beats per minute. This lasted for 2.5 hours but I did not have to go to the the ER.

The cough got worse, and I had green sputum. After ten days I contacted my doctor and he prescribed antibiotics. It cleared up a little, but it was persisting. I was tested for Covid-19 and the test was negative. I had the cough for almost three weeks. I developed a weird bruise on my right forearm the size of a silver dollar. It was round and it took a couple of weeks to go away. My arthritis in my hands was also worse than normal for the three weeks.

I started having diarrhea about 5:30pm.  Later in the evening  around 8:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Around the same time I became very, very sleepy and had extreme fatigue.  My right arm where I received the shot did not hurt and still does not hurt.  Around 6:00pm, my left arm starting hurting in the same spot where I received the vaccine in the right arm.   On the morning of 3/8/2021, I ate breakfast consisting of whole wheat bread and peanut butter and weak coffee (my usual breakfast) and had diarrhea again soon after eating.  At 3:30pm, I ate broiled, skinless chicken, green beans and small amount of instant mashed potatoes.  Around 5:00pm, I had diarrhea again.  I have been drinking a great deal of water on both 3/7/2021 and 3/8/2021 as I normally do every day.  At 6:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Soon after, I took two imodium gelcaps and hoping they will help the diarrhea.  My left arm has become increasingly more sore and hurts in the muscle.  No other symptoms.

                                                Around 10-11 hours after the injection, I began to feel body aches and soreness around my neck and upper back.  I started getting chilled but was very hot and feverish.  I went to bed around 10:00pm and had extreme body aches, shaking with chills and had a fever.  I took tylenol around 4am, when my temperature was 100.7.  The fever and aches subsided by the time I got up around 7am, but I was tired all day.  Took another tylenol around 1pm and started feeling normal, fine.  No other issues.

This has caused difficulty in taking a deep breath.  No congestion, coughing, or vomiting. Just pain with inhalation.  Pain can be palpated in ribs, level 6 and 7.  Somewhat better today, March 17.

                                                I am a well-nourished (doctor-speak for chunky), 65-year old female in fairly good health.  My main issue is severe rheumatoid arthritis, for which I take Humira (abdulimumab) by injection every two weeks.  I?ve been taking this medication for years and it has managed my condition well.  March 5 I received my (Janssen) vaccine and suffered no side effects, not even swelling or discomfort at the injection site.  Piece of cake!  March 11 I took my regular injection of Humira.  Pain started in my ankles, wrists, elbows and knees, increasing through the evening.  I developed a sore throat, but there were no other signs of allergic reaction.  Pain increased, waking me through the night.  March 12 Discomfort has increased severely.  Can?t put weight on my right leg and the slightest movement of any part of my body causes searing pain, especially in right leg from mid-thigh to below the knee.  I can?t lift the leg on its own; have to move it using my hands.  Pain is a constant 10, and I?m crying like a baby.  My left foot shows gout-like symptoms with heat, swelling and pain at the base of the toes.  The entire foot is very tender to the touch.  Taking Norco every six hours and using a cane.  I?m not a wimp.  I spent 10 years in the military, have had two total knee replacements, a reconstructed ankle and fought breast cancer twice.    March 13 Pain has diminished, but is still localized in the ankles, knees, wrists and elbows.  Taking ibuprofen instead of Norco, drinking a lot of liquids and icing swollen foot.  The most intense discomfort evolved during the 24 hours following the Humira injection.  I?m not a clinician, but it seems that the Humira didn?t react well to the introduction of the vaccine.  It?s as if it was saying ?Sorry, this spot is already taken,? and decided to duke it out.  I?m a bit concerned about the next dose of Humira, but the vaccine has supposedly done its work within two weeks.

                                                No problems the remainder of day of injection. Next morning upon awakening, I was very groggy and unable to stay awake. I slept 4 hours past my normal time for getting up. I had no balance and would stagger when standing. My entire body was in muscle and nerve pain. Even my skin hurt. I took 300 mg of Gabapentine which eased my pain. I continued to be off balance the remainder of the day, however, by the end of the day I was much better. I took several 1 hour naps throughout the day.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approximately six hours after administration of the vaccine, patient experienced sever chills and dizziness. Unable to stop shaking, patient took temperature which registered at 95.4F and then 95.1F at 15 minutes. Patient donned flannel pants, thermal shirt, and oversized hooded sweatshirt and got in bed under flannel sheets, two doubled-over blankets, a bedspread, and quilt. A down-filled king-size pillow was placed on top of patient&#39;s torso and a space heater was turned on to highest setting. Patient reports heart seemed to be racing, but did not take BP. Unable to quell the chills, the patient continued to shake, developing very stiff shoulders, neck and back as a result. This continued until approximately 2 am. The next morning, patient&#39;s temperature was registering at 99.4F and pulse was 96, but patient did not report chills. General muscle aches and mild headache were noted. At time of this report, patient&#39;s temperature and pulse are normal (97.6F and 76 pulse).

Also, I started experience a mild headache while on the way home which became VERY bad about an hour after the vaccination (at home).  My head, neck and shoulders hurt so badly that I could not move and my vision was blurry; it was a searing type of pain.  Then, I developed a fever which, at its highest temperature, was 101.6° along with overall achiness, malaise and severe fatigue,

Per interpretor, patient woke up feeling at baseline yesterday morning, when she had her COVID-19 vaccine. Yesterday around dinner time, she began having issues with vision in her right eye, causing her visual field in that eye to appear dark to her entire right eye. She told her husband that she thought she might have a hair or eyelash in her right eye and that she had an irritating pain radiating from her right eye to the right side of her face. Even after washing her eye with cold water, the sensation did not subside. At approximately 3-4 AM this morning, she also began to experience pain to the back of her head and neck bilaterally. This morning, the visual impairment improved from the entire visual field to now only just the inferior aspect of the right eye. However, she denies weakness to any of her extremities. Patient also denies chest pain, numbness, abdominal pain or nausea. She was seen at ophthalmology, at which Dr. diagnosed her with a right retinal branch arterial occlusion and decided to send her to SHE to be evaluated for the possibility of a CVA. She denies being on blood thinners or taking Aspirin. She denies any previous diagnosis of a CVA or TIA.

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

Next morning felt flu like symptoms, malaise especially. Tried to work and could only work 3 hours. Arm remained sore.  14 days later still experiencing soreness in injection site (does not appear swollen), tender to the touch. If arm is lifted up then feels like it is &#34;pulling on something.&#34;

                                                On day 11 post shot I started to feel mildly nauseated. Next day nausea increased, as did muscle aches and pain - by early evening I had repeated bouts of uncontrollable vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhea [no cramps, no warning] that lasted most of the night.  I did have a fever briefly - got all red and felt like I was on fire - but that passed pretty quickly while the rest continued.   I had to stay up all night, any attempt to lie down triggered more vomiting.  By 3 in the morning I was ?on empty? and by 6 am could lie down.  Nausea took three more days to leave completely.  Muscle pain is resolving, almost gone.  I am resuming my meds [everything that went down before came right back up].  The only tummy pain was after hours of vomiting [muscle strain].   Today is the 25th and I?m still tired and a bit foggy but otherwise feel better.  I had a call with my doctor about this and she said I should report it so that?s what I?m doing.

On April 5th started with a couple of days with severe pain in tendons of right shoulder. The pain referred into the right neck and base of occiput. On April 7, 2021, I felt off then developed a severe, stabbing headache over my right eye referring back into the occiput.  Was not steady on my feet. Did not eat dinner, went to bed.  Felt tingling around my mouth, and my neck and shoulders were very tight.  I debated about going to the hospital, but decided against it.  Still have tightness on the right side of my neck into the occiput and right shoulder.

I needed the J&amp;J vaccine, one Moderna or Pfizer as I have a history of anaphylaxis. County Public Health received about 200 does of the J&amp;J and 800 of Moderna and Pfizer.   I waited at the vaccine site about 40 minutes after the vaccine. I went home, ate, read, and became unusually sleepy so took a nap. I woke up about 2:00PM and noticed my lips and tongue were swollen, and sore. I took 2 Benadryl. The Benadryl seems to have worked as expected. I will take 2 more when I go to bed, about 11:00.  I&#39;m unusually sleepy, and my joints ache. Overall, however, I think I am experiencing a very mild reaction and I&#39;m thankful for the vaccine. I sent my doctor a message through the patient portal, telling him of the reaction. His office is closed so he will get the message on Monday.

After she received the shot her leg and shoulder pain/ache increased to an 8/10 (usually a 2-4/10) and was constant when it usually is intermittent.  Her breathing is worse and she is maxing out her inhalers and needing many more doses of her rescue morphine than usual (usually 2.4 ml of 20mg/ml Roxanol used in a week and last week was 7.5ml).  She has not been taking it for the pain for fear of med interactions.  She has increased her Tylenol use from 500mg qd to 3000mg qd.  Her tremors are worse and she is taking her propranolol for tremors 20mg BID instead of her usual 10mg BID.  Her body sweats have gone from 1 time a week to 1-2 times a day.  No fevers noted.

I have had mild tinnitus for several years, generally not noticeable except in extremely quiet settings. But 2 days after receiving J&amp;J vaccine - (the day on which I felt the most &#34;fatigued&#34; and experienced some muscle aches, which responded well to ibuprofen) - I awoke with several episodes of loud ringing in my ears.  From that time until now, my continuous tinnitus is much louder than it had been.  I keep hoping it will subside!  It&#39;s more frustrating and annoying than anything else. No pain or discomfort. For this reason I have held off seeking medical treatment.  It seems like more than a coincidence to me, so I felt I should probably at least try to report it.

I went to my Primary Care doctor, he examined my leg and immediately sent me to hospital ER because he was concerned that it might be a blood clot. They performed an ultrasound, but the results were negative and showed no signs of any blood clots. (2) Approximately three weeks after vaccine, I developed stiffness on the left side of my body in my arm, thigh and hip area. The stiffness was intense, uncomfortable and bothersome enough for me to take Tylenol for the pain the next 5 days and it lasted for about a week.

Paid no attention to it except on  day 10 because pain still felt  with left side more painful.  No lump or bump felt just very sensitive and painful upon palpation.   Left side more painful when palpated.  It seems to be going away slowly.   Did not put this on my daily  report because I chalked this up to being maybe a cold or something coming on.  After thinking about this symptom I realized it is slowly going away and as an R.N. contributed to it now as a side effect.  Below I put &#34;No&#34; regarding recovery because the pain is still there however not as bad.  It seems to be going away slowly.  Hoping it will be gone in a few more days.

The shaking turned into uncontrollable jerking of my shoulders, torso and thighs. The jerking lasted 3 hours. My family became concerned and said I looked like I was convulsing. We were making plans to go to the ER when it started to calm down. I had no control over my body. I finally stood up and my body felt like I was made of led. Headache, slight fever, and weakness persisted until 48 hours post shot.

                                                I was sent to table 6. A young woman there started to swab my shoulder / very top of my arm.  I told her to stop- I could see my friend at the other end of the table getting an injection  3 inches below the shoulder. Told the woman not to give me the injection so high. She said it had to go into the muscle. Told her there was just skin and bones that high and no muscle. She said she knew what she was doing. And gave me the injection. My arm and shoulder hurt immediately. Really hurt. I should have talked to someone in charge about her. A nurse watching us for 15 min said that pain at that point was normal. It has been  almost 6 weeks and the pain is so bad that it wakes me up. Pain pills, Tylenol, Advil do not work. Please help me find a way to get rid of this pain.  I did take a photo of the injection site later that day as the pain was still there.  Went to my doctor and she said to give it more time. That was  2 weeks ago.  This is a true story. I hope that you can help me get rid of the pain.

I finally fell asleep for an hour or two, then awaken just in time to make it to the bathroom where I sat on the toilet ALL night having severe diarrhea and vomiting into a container on my lap.   I would fall asleep, then wake up, on the toilet, very sick.    The vomiting ended after that first night, but the diarrhea has persisted.  It is getting better, though. (It has been 72 hours since the shot.)  I had a headache, my left arm ached, I was nauseous, and feverish until about 8 a.m., today, when my fever broke.  I still feel like I have a low-grade flu, which I have not had in over 40 years.  And, I still have some diarrhea.  I am sipping Coke and can eat some Cheerios, with milk and banana, but that is all that I want to attempt.

Neck muscles &amp; jaw muscles hurt. Dressed in polar fleece jammies, socks, flannel bed-sheets, two heavy duvets &amp; couldn&#39;t get warm nor stop the shaking. Tried standing to walk it off but legs were like jelly.  Tried bio-feedback to relax &amp; stop the shivering but it just continued in wave after wave. My chest tingled and my heart felt like it was working hard. It subsided around 4:30a.m. The next day felt &#39;punk&#39; muscles still jelly like &amp; jaw really ached from chattering. The 2nd day was fine.

                                                I had the Johnson and Johnson one shot vaccination on March 15, 2021 and Initially  had no adverse reactions .. However , 18 days after my vaccination, around April 2, 2021,  began to have deep muscle pain radiating around the injection site, which was in my upper right arm, in the muscle at the top of my arm.. It was SO painful,  the pain was deep in the muscle but not painful to external touch., that I had to take Tylenol for three days. Today is April 7, 2021, and the deep muscle pain is barely noticeable, but once in awhile, I will still get a jab of pain..

Approximately 10 minutes after injection, I began to sweat profusely, followed by intensifying extreme lightheadedness. I could not stand, or lift my head, as I would have definitely passed out.  My shoulders and neck became extremely painful, as if ?frozen?, also preventing me from lifting my head.  After about 35 minutes I very gradually began to recover. It was about an hour before I began to move around normally.   Pharmacy and store staff  debated calling the paramedics, but I refused.  FYI, I had not been especially anxious about the vaccine, and I have never experienced such a reaction to anything in my life. It was a traumatic experience I would not wish to repeat.

Throughout the day the swelling continued on the left side of face, then on bottom of right foot and later on top of both feet.  Went to emergency room and was treated for hives.  Over the next five days, the hives kept moving around, the right side of face, and then to upper lip.  I followed up with my Primary Care Doctor, who did extensive allergy testing.  All came back negative.  I felt that it was a result of my body reacting to the vaccine.  In addition, I was feeling weak muscles and joints that kept moving around.

They gave me medication to use for one week. The symptoms that I was having went away less than two weeks later. They told me that Bells Palsy symptoms could last two weeks to six months. It&#39;s gone right now - I don&#39;t see any symptoms of it.  I did have a virtual appt appt with my doctor -

At 12 noon I got back up and temp was down to 99.7.  Headache, body aches, stiffness, and &#34;red flush&#34; still on cheeks and nose.  Went back to bed.  Took more Ibuprofen at 7pm - temp was down to 98.7.  Headache was better, body aches improved.  Flushed hot face was still present.  Went to  sleep at 11:30PM  and slept for 10 hours.

                                                I had ligament repair surgery on my right ankle on 01/06/2021.  My recovery was going well.  I was walking well without pain and was gaining balance and strength with physical therapy.  I had almost no discomfort at the site of my surgery.  Three days after having my J&amp;J vaccination I woke up to a lot of discomfort in my right ankle, making it difficult for me to walk as I had been able to walk.  I have struggled over the last six days to get back to the mobility I had prior to getting my J&amp;J vaccination.  I spoke with representative from my orthopedic surgeon?s office this morning who confirmed that I am most likely suffering from the side effects of the J&amp;J vaccination, and she suggested that my lack of normal mobility will most likely last another week.

I could not go up and down steps as my legs would not hold me. Headache.  Week 2 to present. Fatigue, I have to nap every day and I sleep 8 hours or more at night.  Diarrhea, despite taking OTC medications  to control. Dehydration and dizziness. I am now 4 weeks since my shot on March 4th and I continue to have these symptoms.   I went to see my doctor and all lab tests are normal. There is no other diagnose reason for my continued symptoms. I wish I waited to get either the Pfizer shot or Moderna as I have not heard of these extreme and prolonged side effects from those shots.

                                                Tues. eve., after the vaccine, I got the CHILLS that lasted all night long!  I woke up (Wed.) with  NAUSEA and took the &#34;anti-nausea&#34; pills that I had left over from when I had COVID (11 - 2020).  My upper arm was now very sore, especially when I tried to lift it.  I took my temp. and I had a FEVER (101). On Thurs., my temp. went down to 99.5 and the nausea was gone.  Today (Fri.), I woke up with pain on my shoulder (over the injection site). I took Advil and iced it and it is now much better (this eve.). The only side effect I have now is the pain in my arm (mostly when I lift it). I am eating better and sleeping better now.

It seems to be in the muscle between the elbow and shoulder.  I can use my arm, but grasping items and raising them above my shoulder are very painful (like holding my hair dryer and raising it to dry my hair).  I have debated with myself about reporting this, but with the current concern with the Johnson and Johnson - one shot, I thought maybe I should report it.

                                                Calling with questions /concerns-said she had to get vaccine because of recent dx/tx for breast cancer. She said received vaccine on 3/13- then on 3/16 she was seen for one of her breast cancer therapy sessions- they have been treating her for lymphedema - she said she has been going for breast cancer in July- no chemo just radiation- surgery of breast with removal of seven surrounding lymph nodes. She was advised to wear a compression bra- on 3/16 and ever since then her left side of neck has been sore- thought it was likely related to compression bra not fitting correctly b/c too tight &amp; was professionally fitted on her- the straps seem very tight over the collar bone area that was damaged/irritated by the radiation she received on that side up through Oct 2020 for cancer. Now when she saw story today in news she got concerned could the neck soreness really be from a blood clot? She as been going the week for tightness in neck to physical therapy which started yesterday for lymphedema. Again her radiation ended Oct 2020 but she has had persistent swelling in breast &amp; fluid in lymph nodes on the left side. She still has pain in on collar bone- on same side of radiation- blisters, sore, red. As well as this new compression bra having two tight straps on each side. Her COVID vaccine shot in right arm but left side where breast surgery was She went on 3/16 for consultation on breast lymphadema - that was when told her to wear tighter bra for compression on 3/16. She is going today to be fitted for new one that is not so tight. She is approx. 4 weeks post vaccination &amp; post when started wearing that tighter bone- maybe three inches from where had radiation injury is located.

                                                Patient with questions /concerns-said she had to get vaccine because of recent dx/tx for breast cancer. She said received vaccine on 3/13- then on 3/16 she was seen for one of her breast cancer therapy sessions- they have been treating her for lymphedema - she said she has been going for breast cancer in July- no chemo just radiation- surgery of breast with removal of seven surrounding lymph nodes. She was advised to wear a compression bra- on 3/16 and ever since then her left side of neck has been sore- thought it was likely related to compression bra not fitting correctly b/c too tight &amp; was professionally fitted on her- the straps seem very tight over the collar bone area that was damaged/irritated by the radiation she received on that side up through Oct 2020 for cancer. Now when she saw story today in news she got concerned could the neck soreness really be from a blood clot? She as been going the week for tightness in neck to physical therapy which started yesterday for lymphedema. Again her radiation ended Oct 2020 but she has had persistent swelling in breast &amp; fluid in lymph nodes on the left side. She still has pain in on collar bone- on same side of radiation- blisters, sore, red. As well as this new compression bra having two tight straps on each side. Her COVID vaccine shot in right arm but left side where breast surgery was She went on 3/16 for consultation on breast lymphadema - that was when told her to wear tighter bra for compression on 3/16. She is going today to be fitted for new one that is not so tight. She is approx. 4 weeks post vaccination &amp; post when started wearing that tighter bone- maybe three inches from where had radiation injury is located.

                                                I started to have a heavy feeling in my right arm. On the fourth day it became worse, and my arm was really stiff and heavy. I was taking Advil and it didn?t help much. I went to the doctor on the sixth day. The NP thought it was a pinched nerve because it was my whole arm from the neck down. On the tenth day it started to affect my other arm which was the side that I got the shot in. I had no strength in my arms and my husband had to help me dress. It was almost two weeks after the shot I went back to the doctor. I was prescribed Meloxicam and an Arthritis cream and it did not help. Blood work did not show any definitive problem. Gabapentin and Advil did help a little. Three weeks after the shot the pain started to move to my legs as well. for one week. The pain is not as bad but now it is in my arms all the way into my neck and shoulders. It has been seven weeks since the shot and now the pain is still in my right arm and into my neck and shoulder blade. I still have good range of motion right now.

                                                On Wednesday, March 10, 2021,I started having muscle pain throughout my left and right legs.  Things and calves were like walking on raw nerve ends.  I had all types of tests, x-rays, MRI?s and dr. visits to try to find the cause.  This pain continued through March 31, until  I was finally given a prescription for a steroid by my internist who believed this pain was being caused by the Johnson &amp; Johnson covid 19 vaccination because of the time frame between the vaccine I was given and when the symptoms began.  The pain while on steroids has disappeared.  I am, as of this date, on the third day of a seven day course of the steroid medication.  The pain subsided on day two of the medication.

                                                I received vaccine at 2:00 PM on 3/10//2021.  I was tired afterwards.  By 11:00 that same night I felt nauseous, has a headache and every joint and muscle  in my body was painful.  I could not sleep or get into a position where I was comfortable.   The pain level was a 10.   I took Tylenol in the middle of the night but it did not help.  In the morning I was unable to contact my physician&#39;s nurse so I called the 24 hour Nurse Line.  The nurse took all my information and told me that I could take Ibuprofen.  I took 400 mg. and found a lot of relief from that.  I still had some symptoms for the next few days.  By 3/14/21 I felt fine.  Now today I have a stuffy nose which could be an allergy to something else.  I don&#39;t know yet.

At the same time it felt like my head (in notch immediately forward of middle of ear to ear)  was in a tightening vise.  Then I got hot and cold  but not severely.  Same for dizziness, very mild. I was nasusseous and not able to eat.  I had random muscles pains , none lasting more than a few minutes in any one place. Odd thing was that I felt no discomfort at sight of injection. Next day I felt just as bad but at 8:30pm I felt like throwing up (after having 2 teaspons of vegetarian vegetable soup). However, I only had dry heaves. I live by myself and started to get scared. I called my daughter and took a Tylenol at 9pm. Within 10 minutes the feeling of a vise and my aching teeth felt significantly better. but  stil very fatigued. Next day, today,  I feel much better but still a little foggy headed. I can eat. I can function normally, thank heavens. If I had to take another shot now, I wouldn&#39;t. Not even sure I&#39;ll take a booster when it comes out . It was very scarey.

Steroids helped quite a bit, but not totally. The day after the last steroid pill, all the aches, pains, everything came back.

                                                The day after the vaccination i had aches and chills, lasted about 24 hours and then went away completely.  About a week after the vaccination i started to get pains in my joints and bones, especially the left elbow.  I also had a swollen underarm gland in the left armpit.   Now over a month later the swelling has gone away but I still feel achy at times.  Recently, I have been experiencing a fatigue and real tiredness that prevents me from being as active as I had been.  Not sure it is from the vaccine or my diuretic or my blood pressure medication, but I have been on those about one year with no problem.  I am wondering if it is the vaccine.  I never had joint pains prior to the vaccine.

                                                When I woke the next morning I had a moderate headache, sore muscles all over which intensified throughout the day, intense pain in the spine between shoulder blades and when I tried to walk, my limbs would not do as I wanted.  They moved in wide circles- arms and legs.  This lasted through the day and next day it was sliightly better.  Balance was poor.  Had to hold onto things to walk.  Also I had fatigue.

She has swelling in her medial malleolar area with negative calf tenderness or Homans&#39; sign. Due to recent findings with Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine, will send patient for doppler testing to look for the presence of a clot. Her swelling could be due to mild injury while working in her garden or varicose veins.  o Will obtain CBC to evaluate platelets due to patient&#39;s concerns for recent vaccine.  o Other complaints that may be related to the vaccine (visual change and fluid area on shin) have now resolved. Discussed with patient that based on the vaccines being new, difficult to know what side effects may be seen, but she should continue to watch for changes and encouraged her to see an eye specialist for an eye check.  o Last vitamin D was normal and advised that no check necessary at this time and that she can take Vitamin D 1000-2000 units daily.
