The days after vaccine I had extreme tiredness and felt like I had a bad cold with a lot of coughing and shortness of breath.  I was coughing up a lot of mucus.  The cold like symptoms are still ongoing, 2 weeks after the vaccine, but are less extreme.  8 days after the vaccine I started to have pain at the injection site.  My upper hurt if I touched it.  Twelve days after the vaccine my upper arm hurts if I raise my arm and if I shake my inhalers to use them.  This seems like a muscle pain from the injection site to my shoulder.

Could barely raise my arm and could not sleep on that side or tolerate even soft touch of my entire upper arm.  No other reaction that seemed like an allergic response.  I did get very sick for 2 days with severe flu symptoms and strange shooting pains in random parts of my body.  Enough pain to wake me from a sound sleep.  Bad chills, but no fever. I did. I give my legs seemed swollen for about 3 days.   I got the J&amp;J vaccine on 3-6-21 and my arm is still swollen with a slightly smaller hard and painful ridge at the injection site and it sometimes throbs and itches severely.  Today is 4-2-21.  Starting to wonder if it will ever go away.  I still cannot sleep on that side.  The pain overall is less, but it still throbs and itches periodically throughout the day.

                                                7 hours from vaccine, my heart started palpitating and I started feeling sick. I got in my car to go home from a friends house and started severe chills and called Doctor for fear of heart attack. They told me to go to ER. I continued driving home. Chills got worse. I got in shower with heater on and chills persisted. Drank coconut water and heart palpitations resided.  Got in bed and fever spiked to 102 and every bone was inflamed in pain. Nyquil did nothing. After a few hours of severe and unbearable pain I called ER. Headed over to ER at 3:00 a.m. and sat in parking lot. Fever broke at 3:00 a.m. which was hour 14 after vaccine. Other than severe nausea, pain calmed down. Drove home with Tylenol. Took 1,000 mg and finally rested at 4:00 a.m. Woke up at 8:00 a.m. with nausea but pain gone. 24 hours from vaccine, most of the reaction gone. 48 hours out body normal but pain in injection site.

                                                Chills and low grade fever, then within another hour felt light-headed and my body hurt all over - skin was sensitive to even my clothes.  Headache started in the front of my forehead by late evening, and I literally couldn&#39;t even walk up to my bed.  Restless sleeping with all the sweating and chills.  Woke up with headache remaining and feeling very &#34;wiped out&#34; and still light-headed.  No more chills or sweats the next day, but I was weak for about 48 hours.  Honestly - I&#39;m very healthy and getting Covid directly from another person couldn&#39;t have been worse than getting  the vaccine.  :(   And I am even saying that as a 35 year professional Research Scientist.

                                                Received vaccine on Wednesday 3/17/21 @ 1250pm, pretty painful going in my R deltoid.  Started feeling very tired on Thursday 3/18/21 around 7pm.  Woke on Friday  3/19/21 with fatigue and diarrhea with body aches.  Woke Saturday 3/20/21 with fever 101.7. (During this duration to include today I have  taken Tylenol rotating with Motrin every 2 hours, this never broke my fevers). Fever continues on and off with body aches, nausea, the worst headache I have ever experienced and pain in the base back of my neck L side.  These symptoms have continued since Saturday.  It is now Friday, 3/26/21.  I will say that during waking hours 8am - 10pm on Wednesday 3/24/21 and Thursday 3/25/21 I had no symptoms except absolute fatigue.  The fever returned on those two nights at around midnight with it breaking about 4 am, waking up in a pile of sweat.

I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

Ibuprofen did not help. I was so tired, I could not move. It lasted through the night and would wake me up. I slept most of the next day until about 1:00pm.  I finally began to feel better about 12 hours after it began and within 24 hours I was back to normal other that the sore shoulder.

I returned home and took immediately to the couch, where I had a low grade fever and stayed all day. I had no appetite, no energy to get up except to go to the bathroom.

Mild flu the next day with  general Malaise.  The chills were so intense that I was constricted for much of the time with little relieve. I would call them violent chills with a tetany kind of full body involvement.  Never have  I experienced chills like I have described. I?ve never had a reaction to vaccines and tend have a high tolerance. I did not contact my physician but spoke to colleagues who suggested  report the experience.

I threw up until about midnight for a total of 7 times. The night before I had difficulty sleeping. The next morning I felt nauseous again and threw up about 10:00 a.m. I started having diarrhea which has lasted through today (Thursday) and I had lost over 5 pounds in just 3 days and my weight is still over 5 pounds less today because it is difficult to eat much. Sunday I was feeling pain around my lest breast where I had had my mastectomy in June of 2006. That eased up the next day.  Feeling stressed because I have bad tinnitus and was worried about a reaction.

                                                Initial reaction was flu-like symptoms but more concerning reaction was a bad rash with red small bumps on the same side as the shot was given directly above my left breast that was severely itchy. This rash is just now starting to dissipate but still itches; I used OTC cortisone creme and Benedryl to address the itching. The other major effect involved my left arm. For a full week, the muscle in which the shot was given was extremely sore to the touch and the whole arm ached. I still cannot fully extend that arm above my head without it feeling like an aching weight. Lastly, I had a pain in the center of my back as a hard ache that one week later still has not fully dissipated. It appears to be going away, but has lingered longer than I would have expected.

I took 2.5mg of Ambian thinking that if I could just fall asleep, I would sleep it off. After an hour of non-stop symptoms, I fell asleep for about an hour only to wake up  with the severe neck and back pain and headache still present. The body shaking had subsided.   The next day, I was tired but fine.

About 1:00 am I got so chilled I couldn&#39;t get warm, I did not take my temperature because my thermometer goes under my tongue and I was afraid I would break it cause my teeth were chattering so bad. The next day I felt very weak and nauseous.  Then I discovered I had a rash at the top of my legs. My left breast was very sore I felt like  someone punched me. Today is Monday and I still have diarrhea.

                                                In the evening I started to feel aches in my eyes and joints.  I was having trouble falling asleep.  I woke up every 2 hours. My heart bpm went up to 102 in the middle of the night.  I know this because my fit bit was vibrating and encouraging me to keep exercising and I was just laying in bed trying to sleep.  I finally got up around 2:30 in the morning and took 1 Aleve. I also took my temperature with a forehead type and it was 98.5, so no high fever.  I took another Aleve around 7:00 in the morning.  Now I am feeling fine.  It&#39;s now 8:22 a.m. and I am working from home.  I just wanted to report that the aches in joints and 102 bpm and unable to fall asleep were my side effects.  I feel fine now.  I will continue to take Aleve as needed.   I have never been tested for Covid.  I have never had any symptoms to warrant testing for covid.  Since March 13, 2020 I have been fortunate to work for a company that has us all working from home.  We are still working from home.  i am 63 years old.  I shop around 6 a.m. in the morning for groceries to avoid people. I do not go out.  I have been very careful.

Thereafter I was just very tired for 24 hours.  I took an Advil  about 10 hours (around noon) after the headache set in, which lessened the headache.

About 8 hours after injection, muscle ached and so was chilled but felt ok otherwise.  FitBit alerted me that I was earning points for being in my ?active zone? even though I was just watching tv - resting heart rate is 66   (actively exercising, heart rate  is usually less than 120) but it was 136&#43;.  HR stayed elevated ( Verified HR with pulse oximeter) while I was not  doing anything. Took temperature (forehead thermometer) and it was 103F.  Took Tylenol. Heart rate slowly went down after Tylenol kicked in and fever came down to 101.  Heart rate stayed a little higher than normal and fever lasted 24 hours. By 48 hours, all was well.

I believe I was running a high fever and was having trouble keeping the thermometer in my mouth because of the spasms but it did get up to 103.4.

Where she injected me was very high up on my arm almost close to the top.  The pain at injection site was quite sore for the first few days and then went away for the most part for a day or two but has now come back much worse.  It hurts to lift my arm or move it and feels like I&#39;ve lost strength to raise my arm.   I am in constant pain now and my arm around the injection site is painful when I press down especially on the bony area.

                                                March 13, 2021-1:30pm-Shot administered to right arm-it bled and the nurse had to apply pressure with an alcohol swab. It stopped immediately. 1:40-started feeling a tightness in the muscle in my neck under my right ear Stayed a few minutes longer than the required 15 to see if anything else presented. Mentioned it to the nurse and rep. The rep asked if I was nervous about getting the shot. When I said yes, he said it may just be that. Told me to contact my doctor with additional issues.  1:55-When leaving the parking lot, I felt my lips and nostril on the right side go numb-it felt like when Novocain is wearing off after a dentist visit. As the day progressed, the area under my ear and down my neck got more and more sensitive. My lips continued to feel numb. My injection site was tender and black and blue. When I went to bed at 9pm, I began experiencing lots of pain in my right lower jaw. I took a Tylenol but it didn&#39;t alleviate the pain. I called on-call doctor. Since I already had taken a Tylenol, he suggested an anti-inflammatory and warm moist compresses and to contact him again if things worsened. 3/14/21-7:00am-Upon awaking, my jaw pain was virtually gone but the whole area I had had the issue with was very tender to the touch. My lip still felt a bit numb.  3:25pm- It is now 26 hours since my vaccination. I still feel like I had trauma to the right side of my face and neck because it is sensitive to the touch. I also have a continued slight sensitivity of my lips on the right side. My glands on both sides of my neck now seem tender, as well. 3/15/21-3/17/21-I continue to have random pain/tenderness in the aforementioned areas. I also have an aura of tingling in my brain from time to time.

Vomited in middle of the night.  Felt very drained and tired with myalgia all of the next two days.  Majority of symptoms went away after that but I felt as if I was coming down with a cold for the next 7 days - today my nose has been running all day and I have a stuffed head  (and I have not had a cold since November 2019). I  had a covid test yesterday because I need to accompany my husband for a medical procedure on Friday - that was negative. I have seen no one, gone nowhere, and done nothing different since I received my vaccine than I had beforehand yet I am displaying symptoms normally associated with a cold although I have no fever.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included seasonal allergies, and codeine allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802068, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 05-MAR-2021 to left arm as prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, after vaccination, she felt fine all day and night. The next morning she woke up and felt sick. She had nausea, headache, hive under eye. She laid back down and tried to sleep. A few hours later, she woke up to use the bathroom. She was very nauseous and dizzy. She lost consciousness and fell trying to get to the bathroom. She fell on her bed and was uninjured. The paramedics took her to the hospital. She was given medication for nausea, headache, and IV fluids. She gave blood for lab tests and they came back normal. No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, fatigue, inflammation on left eye, and small hives under eye on MAR-2021, and vomiting on 07-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from canker sore under tongue, and the outcome of fall on bed was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).  Additional information was received from the patient on 23-Mar-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history added as seasonal allergies and codeine allergy, Vaccination site as left arm added; Additional events as small hives under eye, fall on bed; lab test of blood work added; Event outcome of loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: v1: Follow up information received updates  patient&#39;s medical history (seasonal allergies and codeine allergy), Vaccination site as left arm; Additional events (small hives under eye and fall on bed), laboratory test (Blood Work); Event outcome  (loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved). This updated information does not alter prior causality assessment of reported events 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-headache, nausea and fatigue. These events are labeled and are therefore considered potentially related. 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-loss of consciousness, fainted, heart racing, dizzy, vomiting, canker sore under tongue. These events are considered unassessable. The events have a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, are unlabeled, and have unknown scientific plausibility. There are no information on any other factors potentially associated with the events.

                                                Patient seemed to pass out. Reported fear of needles. Happened about 13 minutes after vaccine was administered. She wasn&#39;t responsive to voice for short time period with a blank stare. Once she snapped out of it, she jerked and then we tried to make her more comfortable. EMS was contacted to verify patient was okay. Patient did not want to go to hospital or ER.

The muscle is still affected and strained after 6 days. I waited a half hour at the site and got into my car at 3:45. On the drive home within 30 minutes my face started to itch and turn red, then my mouth inside started to itch, then my eyes started to itch. After that my throat started to feel gravely, so I took 75 mgs of gel cap benedryl. This is what I feel and take upon getting stung by a bee. I also took my albuterol inhaller two puffs which I also always have on me because of my asthma. I was sleepy but had dinner and went to be. I did not feel that I had to take more benedryl during the night.

                                                I experienced fever, chills, tiredness, and headache approximately five hours after administration of the vaccine on 3-10-21. Symptoms became severe within 30 minutes thereafter, at which time I experienced difficulty standing. After five hours with no improvement, I used my home blood pressure monitor to check my BP and HR; BP was high for me, 120/90 sustained, and HR varied between 135 and 150, with 143 being the most consistent value after multiple readings. I seemed to be experiencing a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; per the instructions I was given and called 9-1-1. I was transported to Hospital, treated in ER, and then admitted to the intermediate care unit. I was discharged to home on 3-12-21.

                                                Within 12 hours I became to have severe muscle aches and joint aches. All my joint felt hot, it was bad enough I wasn&#39;t able to sleep. I took Ibuprofen   to help sleep.  I slept most of Friday I has extreme fatigue. On Saturday I has muscle weakness and tingly in my hands, the muscle aches have gone away. I couldn&#39;t knit ot fine motor skills, It bothered me. I woke up on Sunday where I had extremes muscle weakness in both my legs. I called my PCP, they were surprised by how the reaction was delayed.  They wanted me to get a test for the strength in my legs and sent me to the ER. I wen to the Er they tested for stroke, blood work, scans, they were worried about Guillain Barre Syndrome.  I stayed there about 5 hours. Yesterday afternoon the tingly went away from my hands but my legs are still kinda goofy. The muscle in my forearm  and thigh feel like my muscle are really sore, like they have been tense

Tired &amp; &#39;drunk&#39; after the vaccine which lasted until mid-afternoon the next day.  No big deal.       The worst of all happened at 3 1/2 days, a rash started in the evening, went to bed, woke up the next day with rash almost everywhere. Red, swollen, &amp; itching like crazy.   The next day- Sunday, along with Monday &amp; Tues. was horrid. I am covered from my scalp to the tops of my feet, my crotch hurts, as do my breasts. Used Benadryl cream, aloe vera to no avail.

                                                Severe shaking chills, headache, fever, muscle aches that lasted several hours. Taking Advil helped reduce symptoms. These symptoms are typical of those who have taken the J&amp;J vaccine and in fact, if you read the actual stories of the side effects of people who took this vaccine, shared on sites, these symptoms are closer to 100% present rather than the far lower and untrue percentage revealed by the CDC. These symptoms need to be better tracked and people should be forewarned how COMMON these side effects are; they are not rare!

                                                On 3/7/2021 after I returned home, I ate broiled, skinless chicken, salad and  small amount of corn at 5:00pm.  I started having diarrhea about 5:30pm.  Later in the evening  around 8:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Around the same time I became very, very sleepy and had extreme fatigue.  My right arm where I received the shot did not hurt and still does not hurt.  Around 6:00pm, my left arm starting hurting in the same spot where I received the vaccine in the right arm.   On the morning of 3/8/2021, I ate breakfast consisting of whole wheat bread and peanut butter and weak coffee (my usual breakfast) and had diarrhea again soon after eating.  At 3:30pm, I ate broiled, skinless chicken, green beans and small amount of instant mashed potatoes.  Around 5:00pm, I had diarrhea again.  I have been drinking a great deal of water on both 3/7/2021 and 3/8/2021 as I normally do every day.  At 6:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Soon after, I took two imodium gelcaps and hoping they will help the diarrhea.  My left arm has become increasingly more sore and hurts in the muscle.  No other symptoms.

                                                Around 10-11 hours after the injection, I began to feel body aches and soreness around my neck and upper back.  I started getting chilled but was very hot and feverish.  I went to bed around 10:00pm and had extreme body aches, shaking with chills and had a fever.  I took tylenol around 4am, when my temperature was 100.7.  The fever and aches subsided by the time I got up around 7am, but I was tired all day.  Took another tylenol around 1pm and started feeling normal, fine.  No other issues.

This has caused difficulty in taking a deep breath.  No congestion, coughing, or vomiting. Just pain with inhalation.  Pain can be palpated in ribs, level 6 and 7.  Somewhat better today, March 17.

By the third day, I contacted my doctor (via phone) and she told me to take aspirin, Tylenol or ibuprofen. I didn&#39;t have any pain at the injection site. It got better progressively over the next few days.

I slept the rest of that night and woke up very sore in all muscles for 5 days after.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approximately six hours after administration of the vaccine, patient experienced sever chills and dizziness. Unable to stop shaking, patient took temperature which registered at 95.4F and then 95.1F at 15 minutes. Patient donned flannel pants, thermal shirt, and oversized hooded sweatshirt and got in bed under flannel sheets, two doubled-over blankets, a bedspread, and quilt. A down-filled king-size pillow was placed on top of patient&#39;s torso and a space heater was turned on to highest setting. Patient reports heart seemed to be racing, but did not take BP. Unable to quell the chills, the patient continued to shake, developing very stiff shoulders, neck and back as a result. This continued until approximately 2 am. The next morning, patient&#39;s temperature was registering at 99.4F and pulse was 96, but patient did not report chills. General muscle aches and mild headache were noted. At time of this report, patient&#39;s temperature and pulse are normal (97.6F and 76 pulse).

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

                                                On day 11 post shot I started to feel mildly nauseated. Next day nausea increased, as did muscle aches and pain - by early evening I had repeated bouts of uncontrollable vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhea [no cramps, no warning] that lasted most of the night.  I did have a fever briefly - got all red and felt like I was on fire - but that passed pretty quickly while the rest continued.   I had to stay up all night, any attempt to lie down triggered more vomiting.  By 3 in the morning I was ?on empty? and by 6 am could lie down.  Nausea took three more days to leave completely.  Muscle pain is resolving, almost gone.  I am resuming my meds [everything that went down before came right back up].  The only tummy pain was after hours of vomiting [muscle strain].   Today is the 25th and I?m still tired and a bit foggy but otherwise feel better.  I had a call with my doctor about this and she said I should report it so that?s what I?m doing.

Drawing cramping pain followed in forearm, prickling turned to numbness. Mentioned this to one attendant, who recommended sitting longer. Sensations continued, another nurse/attendant checked on me, also mentioned I sit at least 30 min. All other sensations normal-no nausea, no headache, etc.  Small finger, finger next to it,-and their part of the hand to the wrist -were first numb, with occasional tingles, now still numb.[7:30 pm.]  Slight cramp from top of arm to neck, is off -and- on from injection wait-time til now.  I left at 11:55, took temperature at 12:20, =99.4 (my usual basal is 97.6).

                                                Jansen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccination on 3/12/2021, about 8:30AM, at Fairgrounds. I needed the J&amp;J vaccine, one Moderna or Pfizer as I have a history of anaphylaxis. County Public Health received about 200 does of the J&amp;J and 800 of Moderna and Pfizer.   I waited at the vaccine site about 40 minutes after the vaccine. I went home, ate, read, and became unusually sleepy so took a nap. I woke up about 2:00PM and noticed my lips and tongue were swollen, and sore. I took 2 Benadryl. The Benadryl seems to have worked as expected. I will take 2 more when I go to bed, about 11:00.  I&#39;m unusually sleepy, and my joints ache. Overall, however, I think I am experiencing a very mild reaction and I&#39;m thankful for the vaccine. I sent my doctor a message through the patient portal, telling him of the reaction. His office is closed so he will get the message on Monday.

After she received the shot her leg and shoulder pain/ache increased to an 8/10 (usually a 2-4/10) and was constant when it usually is intermittent.  Her breathing is worse and she is maxing out her inhalers and needing many more doses of her rescue morphine than usual (usually 2.4 ml of 20mg/ml Roxanol used in a week and last week was 7.5ml).  She has not been taking it for the pain for fear of med interactions.  She has increased her Tylenol use from 500mg qd to 3000mg qd.  Her tremors are worse and she is taking her propranolol for tremors 20mg BID instead of her usual 10mg BID.  Her body sweats have gone from 1 time a week to 1-2 times a day.  No fevers noted.

Rash broke out the day she saw Dr. but didn&#39;t mention it to him at that visit. There was no rash on her anterior chest wall where she was hurting at the time.

I have had mild tinnitus for several years, generally not noticeable except in extremely quiet settings. But 2 days after receiving J&amp;J vaccine - (the day on which I felt the most &#34;fatigued&#34; and experienced some muscle aches, which responded well to ibuprofen) - I awoke with several episodes of loud ringing in my ears.  From that time until now, my continuous tinnitus is much louder than it had been.  I keep hoping it will subside!  It&#39;s more frustrating and annoying than anything else. No pain or discomfort. For this reason I have held off seeking medical treatment.  It seems like more than a coincidence to me, so I felt I should probably at least try to report it.

                                                On day 9 felt both sides of neck tender under ear by jaw line.   Upon palpation  both sides painful however left side more.   Paid no attention to it except on  day 10 because pain still felt  with left side more painful.  No lump or bump felt just very sensitive and painful upon palpation.   Left side more painful when palpated.  It seems to be going away slowly.   Did not put this on my daily  report because I chalked this up to being maybe a cold or something coming on.  After thinking about this symptom I realized it is slowly going away and as an R.N. contributed to it now as a side effect.  Below I put &#34;No&#34; regarding recovery because the pain is still there however not as bad.  It seems to be going away slowly.  Hoping it will be gone in a few more days.

                                                Six hours after the shot I began to shake. I was not cold and my temp was only 99 degrees. The shaking turned into uncontrollable jerking of my shoulders, torso and thighs. The jerking lasted 3 hours. My family became concerned and said I looked like I was convulsing. We were making plans to go to the ER when it started to calm down. I had no control over my body. I finally stood up and my body felt like I was made of led. Headache, slight fever, and weakness persisted until 48 hours post shot.

Pain in legs became intense; I could not sit on the toilet.  Went to emergency room of Hospital at 9pm; no medications given.  Pain calmed by 10pm, but sensation in legs returned at 11pm and continued until  discharge at 1:15am on 3/6.  Took Tylenol PM at home for moderate pain in legs and went to bed.  Awakened next morning to no pain, had breakfast and went back to bed until noon.  Feeling fine since that time.

                                                Ten hours after vaccination into my left arm, my right arm, right leg, and right hip bones felt as if they were being crushed.  I finally fell asleep for an hour or two, then awaken just in time to make it to the bathroom where I sat on the toilet ALL night having severe diarrhea and vomiting into a container on my lap.   I would fall asleep, then wake up, on the toilet, very sick.    The vomiting ended after that first night, but the diarrhea has persisted.  It is getting better, though. (It has been 72 hours since the shot.)  I had a headache, my left arm ached, I was nauseous, and feverish until about 8 a.m., today, when my fever broke.  I still feel like I have a low-grade flu, which I have not had in over 40 years.  And, I still have some diarrhea.  I am sipping Coke and can eat some Cheerios, with milk and banana, but that is all that I want to attempt.

Neck muscles &amp; jaw muscles hurt. Dressed in polar fleece jammies, socks, flannel bed-sheets, two heavy duvets &amp; couldn&#39;t get warm nor stop the shaking. Tried standing to walk it off but legs were like jelly.  Tried bio-feedback to relax &amp; stop the shivering but it just continued in wave after wave. My chest tingled and my heart felt like it was working hard. It subsided around 4:30a.m. The next day felt &#39;punk&#39; muscles still jelly like &amp; jaw really ached from chattering. The 2nd day was fine.

                                                About 10  hours after receiving vaccine, I suddenly began shaking, so hard I could barely walk.  At the same time, my fever shot up to 101.8, and mucus began running from my nose like never before.  Shaking subsided after an hour or so, fever broke during the night, and cold symptoms lasted about 3 days.

                                                I had the Johnson and Johnson one shot vaccination on March 15, 2021 and Initially  had no adverse reactions .. However , 18 days after my vaccination, around April 2, 2021,  began to have deep muscle pain radiating around the injection site, which was in my upper right arm, in the muscle at the top of my arm.. It was SO painful,  the pain was deep in the muscle but not painful to external touch., that I had to take Tylenol for three days. Today is April 7, 2021, and the deep muscle pain is barely noticeable, but once in awhile, I will still get a jab of pain..

Body aches and stiffness, affected my walking.  Did not take temperature at that time.  Got back into bed with 2 blankets and a comforter and still couldn&#39;t sleep.  Got up a 7AM - temp 102.2, shaking less but still  feeling cold, body was hot to touch.  I had a bad headache and body aches and stiffness were still there. I noticed at that time  that I had a bright red flush on both cheeks and my nose that was hot to the touch.  Took 600mg of Ibuprofen.  Went back to bed feeling terrible.  At 12 noon I got back up and temp was down to 99.7.  Headache, body aches, stiffness, and &#34;red flush&#34; still on cheeks and nose.  Went back to bed.  Took more Ibuprofen at 7pm - temp was down to 98.7.  Headache was better, body aches improved.  Flushed hot face was still present.  Went to  sleep at 11:30PM  and slept for 10 hours.  Today, 03/06/21, all symptoms improved, no fever, redness of face is still present but less.

                                                I had ligament repair surgery on my right ankle on 01/06/2021.  My recovery was going well.  I was walking well without pain and was gaining balance and strength with physical therapy.  I had almost no discomfort at the site of my surgery.  Three days after having my J&amp;J vaccination I woke up to a lot of discomfort in my right ankle, making it difficult for me to walk as I had been able to walk.  I have struggled over the last six days to get back to the mobility I had prior to getting my J&amp;J vaccination.  I spoke with representative from my orthopedic surgeon?s office this morning who confirmed that I am most likely suffering from the side effects of the J&amp;J vaccination, and she suggested that my lack of normal mobility will most likely last another week.

Soreness extended down arm and lasted most of the day on 4/7/2021. About 2pm I took 2 Tylenol and that started to minimize the ache, by bedtime my arm felt better.

                                                On Wednesday, March 10, 2021,I started having muscle pain throughout my left and right legs.  Things and calves were like walking on raw nerve ends.  I had all types of tests, x-rays, MRI?s and dr. visits to try to find the cause.  This pain continued through March 31, until  I was finally given a prescription for a steroid by my internist who believed this pain was being caused by the Johnson &amp; Johnson covid 19 vaccination because of the time frame between the vaccine I was given and when the symptoms began.  The pain while on steroids has disappeared.  I am, as of this date, on the third day of a seven day course of the steroid medication.  The pain subsided on day two of the medication.

The pain level was a 10.   I took Tylenol in the middle of the night but it did not help.  In the morning I was unable to contact my physician&#39;s nurse so I called the 24 hour Nurse Line.  The nurse took all my information and told me that I could take Ibuprofen.  I took 400 mg. and found a lot of relief from that.  I still had some symptoms for the next few days.  By 3/14/21 I felt fine.  Now today I have a stuffy nose which could be an allergy to something else.  I don&#39;t know yet.

                                                When I woke the next morning I had a moderate headache, sore muscles all over which intensified throughout the day, intense pain in the spine between shoulder blades and when I tried to walk, my limbs would not do as I wanted.  They moved in wide circles- arms and legs.  This lasted through the day and next day it was sliightly better.  Balance was poor.  Had to hold onto things to walk.  Also I had fatigue.
