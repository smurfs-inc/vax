That evening, patient with increasing SOB and increasing oxygen requirement and was admitted for hypoxia &#43; LE swelling.  Although SNF where vaccination took place denied symptoms at time of vaccination, per H&amp;P, increasing oxygen requirements were noted 3 days prior to vaccination.   See H&amp;P below  He is currently residing in a rehab facility following a hospitalization detailed below, but essentially he noted some shortness of breath about 4-5 days ago. They checked his oxygen saturation and noted that he was hypoxic, so started him on oxygen (reportedly 4L NC?). He reports a worsened productive cough; sputum is dark but not bloody in color. He has been fatigued and chilled; he thinks he&#39;s been intermittently febrile. No nausea, vomiting, or constipation. He endorses twice daily diarrhea, but he associates this with his bowel regimen. He also has a fair amount of lower extremity swelling which is bothersome to him; he says this has been ongoing since his MVA in January.[KE.4] He was recently seen in Nephrology clinic, where he was started on lasix 40mg daily and started on a low sodium diet[KE.3]. He is unsure if the lasix is helping his swelling, but does have robust urine output after he takes it

                                                Patient began experiencing back pain on March 14 and on or around March 18 he started coughing up blood clots according to a coworker.  Patient lived alone and was unable to be reached on Sunday March 21.  I went over to his house and found him deceased in his bed.  Patient had a trashcan beside his bed and it appeared to have some blood in it. Patient had thick mucus coming out of his mouth and blood coming out of his nose.  According to paramedics he had passed a few hours before finding him.  Unfortunately Patient has been cremated so there is no way to say that this was related to the Covid 19 shot from Johnson and Johnson, however there are new reports that blood clots have been a side effect. I would like to speak with someone from the Department of Health to discuss this further.  I feel this could be related to the vaccination and I would to know how long the Health Department knew about this possible side effect.  If patient would have known sooner that the blood clots were a side effect I feel he would have gone to the Emergency Room.  Patient had no health insurance and he was trying to prevent getting Covid.   This has caused our family so much heartache and we are all very apprehensive about getting the Covid Vaccine ourselves.  Please contact me as soon as possible, I am also patient&#39;s  executor so I am able to speak to you on behalf of patient and our family. Thank you.

Within a few days the itching spread to my entire back.  By 30Jan21 i saw my primary care physician and a light rash was presenting on my back and chest.  I was prescribed some cetirizine for itching.  By Saturday 3Apr i had a full blown body rash on my chest, back, down my arms and down to my thighs.  My doctor described it as angry red and indicated it appeared to potentially be some type of allergic reaction to a drug.  On this date 13Apr, the rash has subsided but some itching continues.

That helped   36 hours later my throught 1/2 of it, got very sore, like pins sticking inti it like a tonselitious maybe. Same time my mid/right side back started to hurt. Thought it might be gastral. Continious to this day and wordened up until today. Maybe Kidneys? or?? I was thinking again was gastral, but now I know it is not. Same pain when pressure put on it by bending, sitting in my truck against seats etc... Now I am worried. NEVEER had something like this other than a Gal Blagger which was removed.

                                                Three weeks after the vaccine my ankles were swelled up. I gained 30 pounds over the course of fourteen days. I was having trouble breathing. I was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure. I also had water in my lungs. I have not had any heart symptoms before that. I tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in June of 2020. I had multiple tests on every organ. There were no clogged arteries and no heart problems except for AFIB. My blood pressure is fine but I am taking half a blood pressure pill. I am trying to lose weight. I am scheduled to see a cardiologist on 05/25/2021

                                                Dryness in mouth when eating anything would cause an abrasion, was rough and sensitive. When opening mouth all the way feels as though rubber bands holding him back. Thought it was something that would go away, but continues to feel the same way. Attributed it to mouth disease, physician says it is not a mouth disease, he should get a biopsy.

At this point I called my doctor and started blood pressure medication, amlodipine.  I then noticed heart rhythm issue and rapid pulse rate and went to cardiologist.

                                                Approximately 4:30 pm I started feeling leg/calf pain. I was driving at the time.  Got home about 6:30pm, got out of the car and felt immediately sore all over.  I took our trash can to the street and started feeling very cold and intense body cramps and shaking, also feverish, hot flash.  It felt difficult to walk.  I went immediately to lay down. Now I felt very cold.  I slept on/off until 10pm. Woke a few times with intense leg/hip pain,  Woke up around 10pm, vitals 115/77 107  temp 101.5   Took a long hot shower, feel better, but still feel some hip and leg pain, slight fever.  I took one Acetaminophen 325mg.

                                                On day 4 after the Vaccine was administered, I felt a burning in my throat about the size of a dime. On day 5 the burning feeling was in my entire throat.  I was treating this like a Acid Reflux problem.  On day 6 the burning was there and I was also having an issue with my sinus.  There was blockage at times and other times a lot of mucus was coming out of my nose.  I also developed a cough.  I now started treating it like a head cold.  I took day and night cold remedies.  This continued for 8 more days without relief.  On day 9 I did have a 100.5 fever that went away while I slept throw the night.  I contacted my doctor and was able to see his PA.  I was tested for COVID19 and given a prescription for Doxycycline Hyc 100mg.  My COVID19 results were &#34;None Detected&#34;.  I&#39;ve taken 4 of my prescription pills  and haven&#39;t noticed a change.  I still have an Earache, sensitive left cheek bone, mucus coming from my nose and coughing.  The amount of coughing and mucus has lessened but the earache pain has not diminished.  I also have a bad headache this morning, 16 days after my vaccine was administered.

It took a full month for the pain to stop - especially if pressed on. After two weeks, the pain in the arm migrated to the central right back. I could sleep on my right side only. Lasted about two days and then subsided. About a week or so after that, I was getting a throbbing pain on my left calf. That lasted a couple of days where it would intermittently start throbbing. I called the doctor. When I went in the symptoms has subsided but the doctor  (on April 13) said to do an ultrasound if it returns. It didn&#39;t return so I have not had an ultrasound.

                                                Saturday evening May 1 I met with nine friends (all vaccinated) and ate a lot of food, drank moderately, and then did not sleep well. Approximately noon the next afternoon (Sunday, May2) while driving I noticed a developing dry-cough, chest congestion, and general fatigue. While camping that night I had some chills, thought I might have a bit of a fever, and had little appetite. I arrived home Tuesday, May 4 coughing a lot and very fatigued. Wednesday morning I went in for a Covid test. My cough and fatigue continued to increase along with muscle pain and headache. Wednesday night my fever topped out near 104. It broke and I felt much better but for the next few days (until around May 11) it fluctuated between normal and around 100-102. The Covid test came back negative but I went back for another just in case. It too came back negative. My temperature has now stabilized, the cough and congestion are mostly gone. I&#39;m still a bit tired but feeling much better. It seemed like a case of Covid without the Covid. I am glad I got vaccinated but that was rough.

                                                For the first two weeks, there was only mild headache and fatigue.  But on day 12 (or 13) following the shot, my husband had severe abdominal pain and black, tarry poop.  He passed out on the toilet in the middle of the night and hit his head, woke up in a puddle of blood (from hitting his head) . He was severely lightheaded, short of breath, could not walk.  He had to crawl back to bed.  He continued to have severe  lightheadedness, shortness of breath, muscle aches, abdominal pain, and also ringing in his ears.  He called me early Saturday morning and told me what happened and that he called out from work.  (We do not live together. He is 280 miles away because of his job.) That man has called out sick only one time since I&#39;ve met him in 1998; so when he told me he did not go to work, I knew it had to be really bad.  I drove up there ASAP the same day, and I took the pulse oximeter with me.  His oxygen levels were all over the place.  They were usually better (like high 70s to low 80s) while he was lying down.  When he would sit up or stand up, the number would plummet, reading so low I thought he was going to die. One time his finger was so cold that it took me 4 tries to get a reading.  It read at 55, but I realize that might be because his finger was too cold.

Legs intermittently felt numb and at time with &#34;pins and needles&#34; tingling. Knee joints felt as if in danger of flexing backwards. Arms were similarly affected but not as drastically as legs. Arms had better function and control than legs but with marked weakness.  Day 2: Some improvement. Able to go to work but still have fatigue and leg weakness persist. It takes additional mental and physical effort to walk. Walking does not feel automatic or safe like it was before. Still have high level of fatigue. Symptoms improve  some later in the afternoon.

                                                Patient states he received J&amp;J vaccine on 4/1; on 4/10 he had nonradiating persistent low back pain. A few days after that (on 4/13) he felt numbness and pain in his legs, in addition to ?decreased sensation in his inner thighs. These sensations were migratory and intermittent. Also noted in his upper extremities as well. He also had issues with temperature sensation in his lower extremities. On 4/14 he had slight haziness in vision while driving which resolved after 30-60min and has not recurred. He also had slight difficulty walking. On 4/15 he had an appointment with his PMD; had L-spine XR which revealed moderate lower lumbar facet arthritis, and was thought that change in sensation was likely d/t radiculopathy - was prescribed ibuprofen, muscle relaxant, oxycodone (took oxy x1, ibuprofen for a few days). Since then he has also had intermittent stabbing pains in various parts of his body which resolved spontaneously. On 4/17-4/18 his back pain resolved. On 4/18 at 4:30am he woke up with R-sided facial weakness. He has not had focal weakness aside from the face.  Was seen in ED that morning for this R-sided facial droop involving the forehead, diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy and given prednisone/valacyclovir. Yesterday 4/19 around mid-day he started having L-sided facial weakness and slurred speech. This has progressed since yesterday. Reports ability to swallow, though a little difficult d/t cheek weakness. Low back pain has returned as well. Does report constipation and possible poor bladder emptying for the last few days.  He was seen by a Doctor and referred to ED to rule out AIDP and other diseases after J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                He received the vaccine, had very painful going in and tingling going down his left arm and to the elbow which was numb, and the left little finger was numb, and a dizzy spell afterward which was typical for him.  He then on the 9th day had extreme intercostal pain in the ribs on the right side and his right shoulder extremely painful, low grade fever, chills, fatigue and inability to draw a full breath.  He called the doctor and they were on the way to the clinic they told him to go to the ER based on his symptoms.  He went to the ER and they admitted him and did blood work, and then did a chest x-ray, then a chest CT scan and it was positive for pulmonary embolism.  He was treated with an anti-inflammatory through the IV and a blood thinner to the stomach.  He was hospitalized for 1 full day, and discharged home with Eliquis double dose for 14 days and then a single dose until further notice.    He is still having fatigue and aches on the right side of his brain and aches in his feet, but is to see a pulmonologist for his lungs, as it will take up to 6 months for it to resolve.  He also has damage to the right side of the heart and lung.  Is waiting to get a CT of the brain.

I could not rotate my thumbs and I could hear clicking. I called my doctor and she confirmed Dequervains Syndrome. It was bilateral. I don&#39;t have any history or other symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis. I couldn&#39;t pick anything up for ten days and I still have to stretch my wrists to have any strength or motion. I have full motion but I still get pain when I rotate my arm.

                                                On 9 April, I suddenly experienced joint and muscular pain, along with inflammation in both shoulders. My right shoulder was in far worse pain, with loss of strength, and range of motion when compared to my left. R Shoulder: 8/10, Left Shoulder 4/10.  The pain and inflammation initially set-in at a lesser strength, perhaps 65% compared to the above levels, but increased overnight to the above referenced levels. That pain has lessened over the weeks since, and currently diminishes at a slow pace. Currently the left arm is nearly 100%, with only some inflammation and joint pain left. The right arm is better, but if I do any manual work with it, it becomes inflamed and warm to the touch. Cooling the shoulder works, heat does not.  NOTE: in 2015 I fell in an accident and injured my right shoulder. The rotator cuff was torn, and the labrum torn as well, and the pain in the Right Shoulder has echoed that injury (which I had recovered from) greatly. It still feels as if my should was wrenched all over again - and I think that injury may be why the current pain in that shoulder is greater. I have no other explanation for the difference.   This isn&#39;t easy to figure out - feel free to contact me for more information.

Also blurry vision and inability to read words on a page. Sensing something wrong, my sister drove me to emergency room at Hospital where I was admitted. I was later told I suffered a stroke. I was in the hospital for 5 days, receiving various tests. (Hospital has all info on record).  I am awaiting surgery to remove blockage from carotid artery. Doctor has all my information and should be reporting the event also to VAERS.

Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

                                                I started getting a headache about an hour along with pain in the back of my neck and a mild headache after my shot (maybe an hour or so).  Around 1100 hours, about the time I got back from the Facility, I began to feel a tightness in my throat and got a little raspy.  When I drank water and ate a little, it hurt similar a hangover as if dehydrated, but went away after a minute or so. About 1400 hours began to develop chills, causing me to get into bed, and then the chills, overall muscular pains, very tired, moderate headache and some nausea ensued as well along with an initial low grade fever.    Fever went up to 102.1 degrees and had fever till about 2130 hours and broken only after I took two (1) Tylenols. Still had a very low grade fever till about 2300 hours or so (99-100), but finally went away.    I awoke next day (13 APR) about 0800 feeling a bit better, but with a moderate headache and touch of diarrhea.  Headache lasted all day.  This prompted me to contact my treatment facility and a telecall was conducted giving them my symptoms.  They recommended Rizatriptan should my headache continue and Tylenol not enough to relieve.  I cannot take any analgesics due to my liver disease and Thrombocytopenia.  Finally  my headache went away (with a slight hint it might come back), but no more fever, chills etc.    On 14 APR, no more headache but still felt a little tired.  From 15 APR through today (16 APR), no further symptoms and feel great, but prepared to report anything that may develop laer.

                                                The injection itself was incredibly painful.  The nurse giving the injection asked why they were given extra long needles and then asked if I&#39;d like to see it.  I said, &#34;Yes.&#34;  I joked and said it looked like it was more likely for the ass than the arm.  She laughed and proceeded to inject me.  The injection was the most painful I had ever felt.  The next morning, I awoke with pain in my shoulder, neck and back.  Though I expected some reaction to the vaccine, I didn&#39;t expect the amount of pain and discomfort I experienced.  It has continued in large part to the present.  I sought medical advice towards the end of the first week.  Eventually, I received an MRI which suggested myelitis/discitis.  Of course, the MRI was more detailed.    I was subsequently hospitalized for four days where I had numerous blood cultures and another MRI (cervical and thoracic w/and without contract).  The MRI essentially had the same findings.  The doctors are stymied by my history and symptoms.  However,  given the temporal proximity between the time of the injection and the onset of my pain/symptoms (that has yet to resolve), I think it important to report this matter.  I am still is pain and my issues have not resolved.

                                                He got the vaccine, and when they administered it on his left shoulder it started bleeding.  The younger girl put a band-aide on it, and walked off and called another girl.  The other girl took over the band-aide and it was saturated with blood but stopped bleeding, but area was swollen.  They then had him wait 30 minutes, and everything was fine, and instructed to put ice on it which he did.  The pain seems to have not gone away yet and it&#39;s been over 30 minutes.  At night he feels it more as he relaxes, it&#39;s the same pain as it was when he got the vaccine and he can also feel a little knot if he rubs it.  He called employee health and they offered to do an US and gave him our information to call.    This pain goes all the way past his elbow on the left side only.  Sometimes he can feel it on his back, but it&#39;s mainly on the shoulder area.

Over the next few  hours,   the pain radiated down my left arm. Wave would come and go (of pain). The pain came on to my chest - and I decided to go get check.  Had very low energy for about four days - after that. My left arm, I lost the strength in it - I could barely lift 10 lbs over my head. Swimming - I couldn&#39;t pull my arm with my elbow high - I could barely skim the top of the water. This is still happening.  I had a doctor appt - yesterday but that was for arthritis pain that is in my knees, wrists etc - he gave me arthritis medication and I noticed the positive affects of it already. But it didn&#39;t address the arm that I can&#39;t pull up over my head. It seems like my immune system is attacking me- a couple of years ago this happened when I had a virus and it took me almost a year to get that muscle to start working again.

                                                Bells palsy is what I got two weeks later - on the left side of the face. All way from forehead to chin. Including the ear which is actually the worst part. It hurts. I went to the doctor on 6/11/2021 and was given  steroids for a week. It helped with the ache in my neck and ear but once I was off the steroids all that came back. They didn&#39;t help with my face. Bells Palsy takes months to heal - so I didn&#39;t notice any healing on face. Ibuprofen and Tylenol OTC for pain is what I&#39;m currently taking.

Patient began having some blood in his sputum since this morning at 4AM, and that occurred twice more with intervals of a few hours, both continuously improving and less blood. No other symptoms. No history of TB, no exposure to sick contacts, no recent travel. Unlikely a pulmonary embolus given normal vital signs and no risk factors. Patient was doing outdoor work in his yard for the past few days before the symptom onset and was working on mulch and compost. Although unlikely to have fungal infection currently, may be bacterial pneumonia

                                                About a week after the vaccination I began to fill chills and joint pain (fingers, elbow and shoulder on my right side).  On day 11 my right arm became too painful to use.  It felt like severe tennis elbow.  I took Tylenol arthritis  strength in the morning and the evening  and pain subsided after 4 or 5 hour.

                                                Patient received his J&amp;J vaccine for COVID-19 on 03/10/2021.  On 3/17, he was at the grocery store when he felt a sting on his left lateral ankle. When he pulled up his pant leg, he saw the small little red spots that were exquisitely tender. He went immediately to his primary care physician&#39;s office, where he was prescribed Bactrim for suspected cellulitis. The rash steadily worsened with extension up his left leg and onto his right leg and blistering of some of the lesions most markedly in his groin. Pain associated with the rash increased and remained most severe on the lateral aspect of the left ankle. He presented back to his primary care physician&#39;s office on 3/19, where he was given methylprednisolone 80 milligrams IV, discharged with a prescription for prednisone 60 milligrams daily for the next few days. Pain worsened the morning of 3/20/21 to the point that he was unable to bear much weight on the left leg prompting his presentation to the emergency department.

This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 64-year-old African American (non-Hispanic/Latino) hypertensive male patient reported &#34;heart aching&#34; 20 minutes after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The event lasted for 15-20 minutes.  Other associated symptoms developed in the succeeding 3 days: chills that lasted for hours, could not move his neck and felt it was swelling and tender, headache, sleepiness, blood shot eyes.  Nine days after vaccination, the patient reported he had a knot in the center of arch right foot.  The patient took Aspirin.  No other details was reported.  The event is confounded by the underlying hypertension.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

He denies any associated trauma, recent travel and immobility.  He is not taking any new prescription, including steroids. One day prior to admission, he started experiencing left-sided pleuritic chest pain up to 9/10 in intensity and exertional shortness of breath.  He denies any fevers, hemoptysis, sputum production, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness or lightheadedness.  The pain was persistent throughout the day.  Today, his chest pain persisted and his shortness of breath had progressed.  He also noted left arm swelling with mild discomfort.  He felt that his left leg swelling and pain had improved today.  Nevertheless, given persistent symptoms, he decided to come to the emergency room for further evaluation management.   In the emergency room, his initial blood pressure was 218/104 with mild tachycardia of 99, normal oxygen saturation and no fevers.  CBC showed a white count of 12.35, hematocrit of 50.4 and normal platelet count 198.  INR was normal at 1.06.  BMP showed mild hyperglycemia at 148.  Troponin was 5 and BNP was 8.  Imaging studies show extensive left upper extremity DVTs that involved the left subclavian vein, left lower extremity DVTs and bilateral lower lobe pulmonary emboli.   4/30/2021 Presumed unprovoked extensive DVT of the left upper extremity and left lower extremity.  However, he did recently receive Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine.  Now status post catheter directed thrombolysis to the left upper extremity.

Following weeks joint pain ebbs and flows but remains constantly higher than before the vaccine. It isn&#39;t debilitating, but it does interfere with the quality of life and activity. I reported the issue to my pain management provider, and we are monitoring it at this time to see if it will subside.

Then I started to get a severe headache that was pretty constant. After multiple days, my face became paralyzed. I also experienced severe fatigue. This was over 10 days. Once paralysis happened we went to the Medical Center. I was treated with IVIG for many days and oral steroids. I was in the hospital for 6 days. I also experienced my BP spiking. I had an abnormal EKG. I&#39;m still unable to chew properly. I was told that now I have Encephalitis and GBS (Gillian Barres syndrome).

It is especially noticeable in the morning after rising from bed, or after sitting for a long period of time.  After pushing through the pain into normal activities, the pain lessens, but afterwards, the pain returns. I especially notice numbness and stiffness in my calves and feet after waking in the morning.  I do not feel pain while not moving.  Only when I attempt to move. My range of motion has been decreased because of the pain.  I am normally an active person.Taking Ibuprofen seems to relieve the symptoms, but pain returns after the medication wears off.

MRI scheduled for June 29th, 2021. No treatment. The pain comes and goes - it&#39;s not constant. It occasionally is painful enough that I limp.

A little more than a year ago (Feb 2020) I have L4/L5 fusion surgery. The surgery was successful and for the last six month had little to no pain (no more than a 1 on the pain scale). Saturday a day after the vaccination my lower back pain was significant (5 to 6 on the pain scale). I am not sure if this was just a coincidence but thought it was worth reporting. Today, Sunday March 7th the pain is much better (about  a 2 on the pain scale and I think will completely go away as I move around more and loosen up.

The symptoms laster through the night and into this morning when I woke up feeling a bit better. It&#39;s been 13 hours since the first side effects and at this point I feel run down but most of the other symptoms have subsided.

                                                On Friday, March 12, 2021, at the pharmacy I had an 8:00 am appointment to receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson?s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. I received my vaccine in the left arm but the injection seemed to me (and my wife) to be in an odd location, which was very high up on the shoulder near the shoulder joint. Things seemed fine until Saturday evening when I started to feel some tightness in my left trapezius between my scapula and my occipital bone. By Sunday morning that same area was very tight and painful; what we used call a ?crick.? Sunday afternoon I began to feel some sharp pain in my left shoulder joint. I had very little sleep on Sunday night and by Monday morning I had significant pain in what felt like my humerus.  I made an appointment with a chiropractor  for Monday afternoon and he suggested the vaccine shot might have started an inflammation that led to the tight trapezius, which in turn was causing the cervical spinal nerves to react, thus causing the pain in my arm. At this point I was in a lot of pain and the pain was moving further down toward my elbow. The chiropractor did his usual things and told me to put ice on it and take OCT Ibuprofen and or Naproxen. I was a bit better on Tuesday and decided to attend a three-day pastors? retreat. By Tuesday afternoon the pain had expanded to just below my elbow. I consulted with a doctor friend and he thought it was likely that I was having a reaction to the vaccine and that it would pass. He as concerned to hear of the odd location of my injection. I had another sleepless night and on Wednesday I noticed that the ends of my left thumb and index finder were numb and by that night the numbness had expanded to include most of my index finder. The other arm and shoulder pain continued but varied in intensity. On Wednesday morning I called my wife and asked her to come get me at the retreat and that afternoon I called my doctor&#39;s office office and made an appointment for Thursday morning (3-18-21). I&#39;m  feeling the cumulative effects of the pain and fatigue. My overall pain level is a little less but still present, as is the numbness in my index finger and thumb. My doctor suggested the nerve inflammation was a reaction tot he vaccine.

                                                I spoke to patient by phone on Saturday morning around 9:20am. He was concerned about the fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, and muscle aches he had the night before. He felt better when I spoke to him. He wanted to know when those side effects would go away finally. Since I had the Moderna vaccine I said 24 to 36 hours. But I didn&#39;t know about the J&amp;J vaccine. We disconnect the call at 9:40am Saturday morning. After the call at some point he fixed lunch or dinner and stopped eating before finishing his meal. He had left the food on the table and in the pans he fixed it in. Very unusual for him.  The patient then went to his room where is was found Monday 3/22/21 around noon in his bed laying on his chest (he hated to lie on his chest) by the police and the HR officer from his work.   The HR officer had called my other brother around 11:15am on 3/22 /21 to ask if we had heard from the patient because he had not reported to work or phoned in. He has passed sometime between noon on Saturday till Sunday evening alone at his residence. He had towels and a trash can beside his bed when he was found.  The coroner call it death by natural causes and would not do an autopsy when even asked by his PCP.

                                                On April 7, my husband received the J&amp;J COVID vaccination. On April 17, he started to feel ill and developed severe abdomen and back pain, which were not normal symptoms of his other health conditions. He ate very little on that date (and that was the last food he had). At 3:30 a.m. on Monday, April 19, I took him to the ER because of severe pain. They gave him multiple tests, including CT scan, labs, EKG, ultrasound, and others. He was admitted to the hospital, and multiple other tests were performed during his stay. During his stay, his sodium and other electrolyte levels dropped to dangerously low levels, he experienced major swelling, his pain persisted, his swallowing ability diminished, he didn&#39;t eat, and his heart consistently ran at a high rate. He was transferred home (with comfort care/hospice) on Tuesday, April 27, and died on Wednesday, April 28, at about 9:30 p.m.

Then waves of oversensitivity with knee and foot joints hurting as if arthritis, and this lasted most of the night. I also experienced strange hallucinations in the night as if I had a high fever but I don&#39;t believe I had a fever, and I also had a migraine and neck pain. The arm where the vaccine was applied is fine and not sore at all.  I also have a slight soreness in my stomach as if I had been coughing for a while, which was not the case.  It is now 11:34 AM the following day and I believe I&#39;m getting back to my normal self but it sure was a rough night and I though you should be aware.

                                                By 10:00 pm that evening I got Chills, fever, muscle aches, headache, nausea and low back pain.  Stayed home from work for 1 or 2 days.  Felt better in all ways except my low back got very, very painful.  I asked my wife to buy me a walker to take to work because I had difficulty walking the distance from the parking lot to inside my office.  Also used the walker at work.  My boss said to go home, it looks like you&#39;re in  pain.  Saw Dr. on Monday March 15 because the low back was getting worse.  He prescribed muscle relaxors and anti-inflammatory medicine.  Called the next day asked for something stronger for pain because worse.  Nurse responded to continue on existing meds.  Went to Chiropractor on both March 16 and 18 without back pain relief.  On March 19 went to urgent care, got X-ray and pain meds.  MRI done 2 days later on March 21st which revealed a spinal abcess. Admitted to Hospital, surgery done to remove spinal abcess on March 22.  Bacteremia, laminectomies in L3,4,5 S1 to relive spinal cord pressure.  Puss had the filled spinal epidural cavity, cultured out as Strep bacteria.    Remained hospitalized until April 2nd. Sent home for 1 night then returned to hospital via ambulence the next day April 3rd with 103 degree fever.  Discharged April 8th. Readmitted to hospital for 3rd time on April 17 where I remain today with Kidney and liver function problems likely reactions to meds.  Continue to have excruciating low back back which is why continues to be hospitalized at the time of this report.

I had a rash on my arm around the site of the injection about an inch around which is still visible after three weeks. The rash was a little itchy.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

                                                One day after the vaccine I had extreme muscle and join pain all over body, general malaise, fever.  This lasted for about 3 days.  About 10 days post vaccine, the symptoms returned with a ferocious energy.  The pain in my muscles and joints is so severe that I can&#39;t roll over in bed, have difficulty walking, and getting on and off the toilet. It interrupts my sleep so that I play musical bed-chair-couch throughout the night.  Needless to say, it exacerbates the level of pain and fatigue I&#39;m already experiencing.  It is life debilitating as I cannot participate in my usual daily activities of walking, hiking, gardening, biking, etc.  As a result of joint and muscle stiffness, I am also now experiencing headaches. These extreme conditions have persisted from March 23- April 9...and I don&#39;t see relief in the future.

                                                Had a heart transplant 5 years ago. After vaccination, my calf muscles ached and I had to walk on the balls of my feet. I didn?t feel well and was achy, but all of that resolved after about 4 or 5 days. About 25 days after the vaccine, I woke up and my legs were hurting, swollen and lumpy. I went into the house and elevated my feet. I was sore from my calf to my ankles. I called the doctor and he told me to go the ER. After a 3 hour wait, one of the patients waiting almost threw up me, so I told them I was going home. Later, I went in to see the doctor about what was going on. After rubbing my calf vigorously, some of the lumps started to go away. The only thing my doctors came up with was that I was retaining water. I felt like I had gained some weight. I couldn?t stand long before my legs swelled. They prescribed a strong diuretic called Torsemide and I lost about 10 lbs. I currently wear compression socks every day, which helps with the swelling and my ankles hurt all of the time. I only take the meds as needed because it?s hard on my kidneys, which are already compromised due to my transplant meds.

                                                I didn&#39;t have pain in the arm, after an hour I had a slight headache. The headache lasted about a day. After the 3-4 day I had serve diarrhea and stopped taking my supplements. It stopped for a couple days then came back for a day. I had no headache or pain, just 3 bad episodes of diarrhea. On March 24th I went into the Hospital with severe pain in my lower left back side. I thought I was passing a kidney side, with the pain I was having. When I got there they did a CT scan and blood work and it wasn&#39;t kidney stone but I had a blood clot on the lower left side of lung and the right side as well. They immediate put me on blood thinners. I was there for a day and a night. They released and put me on medication.  I&#39;ve had minor pain but nothing like the pain I had before. I have since followed up with a Pomologist and PCP. Pulmonologist said I had blood clots but couldn&#39;t give me a cause. My PCP said she thought I had or have Covid. I asked to have my blood drawn and she said it was too late for that because I had taken the vaccine already.

                                                After receiving the vaccine I returned to work and then went home, ate dinner, showered and bed. The following morning (Easter Sunday) I woke up at approximately 07:00 AM and when I got out of bed my legs (bi-laterally knee pain) were so weak that I almost fell down,  I had to hold on to various furniture and walls to get to the bathroom.  This weakness and joint pain has been constant and continuous and is still ongoing as of this writing. On 4/8/2021 I called my private physician, and explained what was happening and he prescribed me METHYLPREDNISOLONE 4 MG DOSEPK (medrol). I took the medication as prescribed and had no relief.  On 4/14/2021 I went to ER and had X-rays taken of both knees and was sent home with a suggestion to follow-up with my private physician (on vacation until 4/26/2021) whom I have a telemedicine call scheduled with for that same day 4/26/2021. I have scheduled an appointment with an Orthopedic Specialist  now on 4/20/2021 @ 3:20 PM for an evaluation.

Then incredibly painful bone pain in the chest - originally thought it was a heart attack.  It is random  and acute pain in the chest / rib area. It varies in duration and length of time between attacks. The pain is so acute it is hard to manage. Also this appears to have attacked my lungs as I am very short of breath and cannot do any exertion. The body ache, incredible chest bone pain, joint pain and difficulty breathing have continued as I finish day 6 post injection.

                                                In about 2-3 weeks after the vaccine, I had just real achy and soreness all over. And I got very stiff muscles and was hardly mobile - not unlike my usual flares for Rheumatoid Arthritis event. My joints hurt. I hurt all over. I told my doctor I was having an ongoing flare that wouldn&#39;t stop. I had suggested that maybe it had something to do with the vaccination as I couldn&#39;t pinpoint anything else that would have caused it. He prescribed Prednisone - for seven days - I felt good during that time. As soon as it wore off, it went back to flare. He is treating me again with Prednisone for a whole month to try to calm the inflammation down.  It also could mean that one of my meds is no longer working for me. The prednisone seems to be working this time, as well. He took me off my Celebrex, too, for this period of time and so the first few days were kind of rough but the prednisone is starting to build, I think, and I&#39;m feeling better.

I developed chills, fever, headache, neck aches, malaise and extreme fatigue that lasted 12 days and then resolved for the most part except still experiencing some fatigue. I was concerned because I was expecting side effect shortly after the vaccine however the symptoms were very much delayed. Although I have been very isolated before and after the vaccine I grew concerned I may have been exposed to COVID though highly unlikely and got a PCR covid test which came back negative

Patient with known stroke on CT imaging, unable to further verify with MRI imaging.  Upon further investigation/discussion with the patient, he reports receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine 10 days prior to admission.  Patient with known comorbidities which increase his risk of an embolitic stroke however with recent findings from the CDC, unsure if this needs to be further investigated.  Patient had 2 head CT scans, showing no intracranial abnormalities and MRI was unable to be completed due to patient&#39;s size. Neurology states high probability of stroke within their consult note. Patient&#39;s risk factors for stroke include: uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (LDL 132 on Crestor 40 mg daily PTA), hypertension (as high as 182/92 mmHg in ED), physical inactivity (BMI 76 kg/m^2), and male. Low suspicion of CVST based on patient&#39;s platelet count of 212 on admission and no abnormality on head CT. MRI would have been beneficial in potentially diagnosing CVST, as well.   Our recommendation is to submit this information to the VAERS database as a possible ADR from the vaccine. The patient fits the timing of an ADR, within 6-13 days of vaccine administration, and CDC recommends watching for neurological symptoms based on their most recent press release.

(Wife with no injection on 5/21 got headache, nausea/bloating feeling and neck ache that lasted 4 days.) Husband resumed outdoor activities on 5/22 but began relapsing on 5/27 with headache, fatigue, neck and body pain that still persists as of date of this report (5/29). Item 21 is PENDING how this continues or hopefully resolves.  It is still ongoing but your computer insists I must enter something...and you do not have a box indicating ongoing.

                                                Patient had acute onset of low back pain 1.5 weeks prior to presentation on 6/3/2021.  This pain and weakness progressed to complete bilateral  lower extremity paralysis with loss of bowel and bladder function  on 6/09/2021.  Patient was seen emergently and found to have critical, bilateral lower extremity ischemia. imaging showed RIGHT RUNOFF: 1)There is abrupt vessel cut off suggestive of acute thrombotic occlusion of the proximal common femoral artery with propagation into the superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery. On the delayed imaging, small amount of contrast is seen within the severely stenotic popliteal artery and very small amount of contrast is seen in the peroneal artery extending to the ankle suggesting proximal stenosis and extremely slow flow.   LEFT IMPRESSION: 2)Abrupt cut off suggestive of acute thrombotic or embolic occlusion identified at the origin of the LEFT common iliac arteries with propagation throughout the LEFT lower extremity down to the popliteal artery. 3)On the delayed phase imaging, tiny wisp of contrast within the severely stenotic popliteal artery identified suggestive of very slow flow. The peroneal artery is also faintly patent on the delayed phase imaging with flow contrast extending to mid calf level. Due to severity of the ischemic limb, patient was offered bilateral above the knee amputations. He declined and will discharge to  hospice on 6/12/2021. He is going to die.

                                                6 days after injection woke with soreness in all joints, stiffness, fatigue. Now on day 10, the S/S are getting worst. Fingers are swollen,. I can&#39;t grasp or pinch things. I must use both hands to hold a glass or cup. Very weak, sleeping 16-18 hours a day. At times I get very chilled and start to shiver. Never have had a fever, loss of taste, or smell.  I tested NEG for the virus on day 3 (10 days after receiving the vaccine). Soreness is turned into pain. Feels like full-blown RA and if I was black I would be thinking sickle-cell because of the general pain.

There was an associated increase in pain in the knee.  I tried to shake it off hoping that the swelling and pain would go away, but I finally relented to the concerns of my family and sought care on the 6th of April at the emergency room because my doctor refused an in-person appointment.  The emergency room physician prescribed Eliquis which I have been taking.  The swelling seems to have leveled off, but my right leg still appears to be twice the size of my left leg

                                                Beginning about 10 days after vaccination, the patient noticed pain in his arm and he started ?not feeling so great.? Over several days, this pain began to radiate and involve muscle and bone aches. He continued to feel ill to what he described as the worst symptoms on Monday, April 26th, which included severe pain, high blood pressure (211/113 documented by the ER), symptoms similar to cardiac event. The patient was seen by Emergency Department who did not find a diagnosis, but gave the patient medication to lower blood pressure and referred further treatment to his Primary Care Provider.  Blood pressure mediation was taken to lower his blood pressure and clonidine 0.1mg was prescribed by his PCP because of elevated BP (over 150/90). The patient was also instructed to take Advil for pain and was referred to get an X-ray  with follow up in 2 weeks on 5/13.
