That evening, patient with increasing SOB and increasing oxygen requirement and was admitted for hypoxia &#43; LE swelling.  Although SNF where vaccination took place denied symptoms at time of vaccination, per H&amp;P, increasing oxygen requirements were noted 3 days prior to vaccination.   See H&amp;P below  He is currently residing in a rehab facility following a hospitalization detailed below, but essentially he noted some shortness of breath about 4-5 days ago. They checked his oxygen saturation and noted that he was hypoxic, so started him on oxygen (reportedly 4L NC?). He reports a worsened productive cough; sputum is dark but not bloody in color. He has been fatigued and chilled; he thinks he&#39;s been intermittently febrile. No nausea, vomiting, or constipation. He endorses twice daily diarrhea, but he associates this with his bowel regimen. He also has a fair amount of lower extremity swelling which is bothersome to him; he says this has been ongoing since his MVA in January.[KE.4] He was recently seen in Nephrology clinic, where he was started on lasix 40mg daily and started on a low sodium diet[KE.3]. He is unsure if the lasix is helping his swelling, but does have robust urine output after he takes it

                                                Patient began experiencing back pain on March 14 and on or around March 18 he started coughing up blood clots according to a coworker.  Patient lived alone and was unable to be reached on Sunday March 21.  I went over to his house and found him deceased in his bed.  Patient had a trashcan beside his bed and it appeared to have some blood in it. Patient had thick mucus coming out of his mouth and blood coming out of his nose.  According to paramedics he had passed a few hours before finding him.  Unfortunately Patient has been cremated so there is no way to say that this was related to the Covid 19 shot from Johnson and Johnson, however there are new reports that blood clots have been a side effect. I would like to speak with someone from the Department of Health to discuss this further.  I feel this could be related to the vaccination and I would to know how long the Health Department knew about this possible side effect.  If patient would have known sooner that the blood clots were a side effect I feel he would have gone to the Emergency Room.  Patient had no health insurance and he was trying to prevent getting Covid.   This has caused our family so much heartache and we are all very apprehensive about getting the Covid Vaccine ourselves.  Please contact me as soon as possible, I am also patient&#39;s  executor so I am able to speak to you on behalf of patient and our family. Thank you.

                                                The injection itself was high on my arm and was very painful as it was administered (much more so than a typical vaccination in the arm).  The pain has been persistent, and has gotten worse over time.  No fever, no inflammation at the injection site other than a red dot that resolved over about one week.  On advice of my physician (nurse practitioner) I&#39;ve been icing the shoulder three times a day and taking ibuprofen 800 mg q 6h - this has not led to any improvement - to the contrary the pain is getting worse and the shoulder is losing substantial mobility.    Something seems to have been done wrong - and am wondering if the injection itself was given in the shoulder or tendon rather than intramuscularly.

Legs intermittently felt numb and at time with &#34;pins and needles&#34; tingling. Knee joints felt as if in danger of flexing backwards. Arms were similarly affected but not as drastically as legs. Arms had better function and control than legs but with marked weakness.  Day 2: Some improvement. Able to go to work but still have fatigue and leg weakness persist. It takes additional mental and physical effort to walk. Walking does not feel automatic or safe like it was before. Still have high level of fatigue. Symptoms improve  some later in the afternoon.

                                                63 year old male with progressive weakness at bilateral faces and extremities, LEs &gt; UEs, absent DTRs throughout x 2 weeks. Received J&amp;J vaccine at 3 weeks ago. His current neurological examination and clinical history is suggestive of GBS  NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:  MSE: A&#43;Ox 3 Language: no aphasia   CRANIAL NERVES:  2nd CN: bilateral pupils are equal round and reaction to light, visual field-full 3rd,4th and 6th CN: EOM-I 5th CN: no sensory deficite 7th CN: face: symmetric, not able to smile or blowing air or holding water 8th CN: hearing loss: no 9, 10th CN: no dysarthria, palate movement:normal 11th CN: no neck weakness 12th CN: tongue: middle, no atrophy   MOTOR EXAM:  Tone: normal  Strength: 4&#43;/5 at bilateral UEs, 4 Pt symptoms started very early. Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

                                                Janssen shot on Mar 12, 2021. On Mar 25,2021 at 10 AM, I woke up with a headache, sore joints, nausea. Also blurry vision and inability to read words on a page. Sensing something wrong, my sister drove me to emergency room at Hospital where I was admitted. I was later told I suffered a stroke. I was in the hospital for 5 days, receiving various tests. (Hospital has all info on record).  I am awaiting surgery to remove blockage from carotid artery. Doctor has all my information and should be reporting the event also to VAERS.

Patient began having some blood in his sputum since this morning at 4AM, and that occurred twice more with intervals of a few hours, both continuously improving and less blood. No other symptoms. No history of TB, no exposure to sick contacts, no recent travel. Unlikely a pulmonary embolus given normal vital signs and no risk factors. Patient was doing outdoor work in his yard for the past few days before the symptom onset and was working on mulch and compost. Although unlikely to have fungal infection currently, may be bacterial pneumonia

A little more than a year ago (Feb 2020) I have L4/L5 fusion surgery. The surgery was successful and for the last six month had little to no pain (no more than a 1 on the pain scale). Saturday a day after the vaccination my lower back pain was significant (5 to 6 on the pain scale). I am not sure if this was just a coincidence but thought it was worth reporting. Today, Sunday March 7th the pain is much better (about  a 2 on the pain scale and I think will completely go away as I move around more and loosen up.

The symptoms laster through the night and into this morning when I woke up feeling a bit better. It&#39;s been 13 hours since the first side effects and at this point I feel run down but most of the other symptoms have subsided.

                                                On Friday, March 12, 2021, at the pharmacy I had an 8:00 am appointment to receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson?s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. I received my vaccine in the left arm but the injection seemed to me (and my wife) to be in an odd location, which was very high up on the shoulder near the shoulder joint. Things seemed fine until Saturday evening when I started to feel some tightness in my left trapezius between my scapula and my occipital bone. By Sunday morning that same area was very tight and painful; what we used call a ?crick.? Sunday afternoon I began to feel some sharp pain in my left shoulder joint. I had very little sleep on Sunday night and by Monday morning I had significant pain in what felt like my humerus.  I made an appointment with a chiropractor  for Monday afternoon and he suggested the vaccine shot might have started an inflammation that led to the tight trapezius, which in turn was causing the cervical spinal nerves to react, thus causing the pain in my arm. At this point I was in a lot of pain and the pain was moving further down toward my elbow. The chiropractor did his usual things and told me to put ice on it and take OCT Ibuprofen and or Naproxen. I was a bit better on Tuesday and decided to attend a three-day pastors? retreat. By Tuesday afternoon the pain had expanded to just below my elbow. I consulted with a doctor friend and he thought it was likely that I was having a reaction to the vaccine and that it would pass. He as concerned to hear of the odd location of my injection. I had another sleepless night and on Wednesday I noticed that the ends of my left thumb and index finder were numb and by that night the numbness had expanded to include most of my index finder. The other arm and shoulder pain continued but varied in intensity. On Wednesday morning I called my wife and asked her to come get me at the retreat and that afternoon I called my doctor&#39;s office office and made an appointment for Thursday morning (3-18-21). I&#39;m  feeling the cumulative effects of the pain and fatigue. My overall pain level is a little less but still present, as is the numbness in my index finger and thumb. My doctor suggested the nerve inflammation was a reaction tot he vaccine.

                                                I spoke to patient by phone on Saturday morning around 9:20am. He was concerned about the fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, and muscle aches he had the night before. He felt better when I spoke to him. He wanted to know when those side effects would go away finally. Since I had the Moderna vaccine I said 24 to 36 hours. But I didn&#39;t know about the J&amp;J vaccine. We disconnect the call at 9:40am Saturday morning. After the call at some point he fixed lunch or dinner and stopped eating before finishing his meal. He had left the food on the table and in the pans he fixed it in. Very unusual for him.  The patient then went to his room where is was found Monday 3/22/21 around noon in his bed laying on his chest (he hated to lie on his chest) by the police and the HR officer from his work.   The HR officer had called my other brother around 11:15am on 3/22 /21 to ask if we had heard from the patient because he had not reported to work or phoned in. He has passed sometime between noon on Saturday till Sunday evening alone at his residence. He had towels and a trash can beside his bed when he was found.  The coroner call it death by natural causes and would not do an autopsy when even asked by his PCP.

Then waves of oversensitivity with knee and foot joints hurting as if arthritis, and this lasted most of the night. I also experienced strange hallucinations in the night as if I had a high fever but I don&#39;t believe I had a fever, and I also had a migraine and neck pain. The arm where the vaccine was applied is fine and not sore at all.  I also have a slight soreness in my stomach as if I had been coughing for a while, which was not the case.  It is now 11:34 AM the following day and I believe I&#39;m getting back to my normal self but it sure was a rough night and I though you should be aware.

These aches eventually spread over my entire body.  The tiredness got worse as evening progressed.  Finally went to bed, &amp; could not fall asleep for approximately 1 1/2 hrs.  During this time, I experienced chills along with the body ache.  After 6 hrs of sleep, I woke this AM feeeling achy &amp; exhausted.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

About 10 days post vaccine, the symptoms returned with a ferocious energy.  The pain in my muscles and joints is so severe that I can&#39;t roll over in bed, have difficulty walking, and getting on and off the toilet. It interrupts my sleep so that I play musical bed-chair-couch throughout the night.  Needless to say, it exacerbates the level of pain and fatigue I&#39;m already experiencing.  It is life debilitating as I cannot participate in my usual daily activities of walking, hiking, gardening, biking, etc.  As a result of joint and muscle stiffness, I am also now experiencing headaches. These extreme conditions have persisted from March 23- April 9...and I don&#39;t see relief in the future.

On March 24th I went into the Hospital with severe pain in my lower left back side. I thought I was passing a kidney side, with the pain I was having. When I got there they did a CT scan and blood work and it wasn&#39;t kidney stone but I had a blood clot on the lower left side of lung and the right side as well. They immediate put me on blood thinners. I was there for a day and a night. They released and put me on medication.  I&#39;ve had minor pain but nothing like the pain I had before. I have since followed up with a Pomologist and PCP. Pulmonologist said I had blood clots but couldn&#39;t give me a cause. My PCP said she thought I had or have Covid. I asked to have my blood drawn and she said it was too late for that because I had taken the vaccine already.

Then incredibly painful bone pain in the chest - originally thought it was a heart attack.  It is random  and acute pain in the chest / rib area. It varies in duration and length of time between attacks. The pain is so acute it is hard to manage. Also this appears to have attacked my lungs as I am very short of breath and cannot do any exertion. The body ache, incredible chest bone pain, joint pain and difficulty breathing have continued as I finish day 6 post injection.

I developed chills, fever, headache, neck aches, malaise and extreme fatigue that lasted 12 days and then resolved for the most part except still experiencing some fatigue. I was concerned because I was expecting side effect shortly after the vaccine however the symptoms were very much delayed. Although I have been very isolated before and after the vaccine I grew concerned I may have been exposed to COVID though highly unlikely and got a PCR covid test which came back negative

                                                On Thursday, March 18, I had some slight dizziness during the day. After going to bed that night I woke up and the night light in the smoke alarm on the ceiling appeared to be spinning. I sat, then stood, grabbling walls for support and attempted to reach my recliner. At that point I was severely dizzy, completely lost any sense of balance and collapsed into the chair. I could not stand or walk. After 20 minutes, I asked my wife to call an ambulance. I did not think she would be able to get me into our car. The paramedics ran an EKG and tested me for a stroke. Both were normal. I was transported to the ER. The doctor gave me Meclizine. Had a CT scan of my brain, and blood work. All results normal. Dizziness resolved. They tested my balance and then released me at 3:30 a.m. on March 19. I was tired that day, but did not need further medication. During that night, as I turned over in bed, the vertigo returned. I took a Meclizine and went to the recliner for the remainder of the night. I am feeling somewhat fuzzy today, March 20. Not sure how long this will continue, or if it is related to my Covid vaccination. However, I am reporting it in the event that others may be experiencing this problem as well.

                                                3/22/21 Admission HPI: 71 y.o. male with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and COPD.  He presented to my office today acutely with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He has increased his prednisone at home recently and been increasing the frequency of his DuoNebs.  Despite this, he states that his oxygen saturations have been staying in the low 80s.  He has a hard time walking due to the shortness of breath.  He states previous to about a week ago he was doing very well.  He denies any fever.  He denies any known exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In the office today his oxygen saturations were 88% on 4 L. Because of his failure of outpatient therapy, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  This patient has a history of severe respiratory decompensation that happens very quickly.  Therefore, it is medically urgent we get him into the hospital.     3/25/21 Admission HPI71 y.o. male with a known history of severe COPD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He came to my office with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He had increased his oral steroids and breathing treatments at home and despite this was still having oxygen saturations in the low to mid 80s on 2-4 L of supplemental oxygen.  In my office he was extremely diminished and had basically failed outpatient therapy.  Therefore he was admitted to inpatient status for acute treatment of a severe COPD exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was admitted and treated with IV treatments.  He did recover nicely.  However, he was found to be extremely physically deconditioned.  Because of this he was thought to be an excellent candidate for swing bed and is being transitioned to swing bed.    4/5/21 ER Practitioner Note: Upon arrival to ED trauma room I found patient to be in cardiac arrest, CPR in progress. History is that EMS was called to the scene for a patient with chest pain.  Shortly after arrival at his home  patient developed a cardiac arrest.  They followed standard ACLS  protocol and the patient was intubated. Blood sugar normal. As CPR was given, medications were administered consisting of epinephrine and 1 mg in 2 different doses along with 1 amp of bicarb. IV access via an IO. Patient was then transported to the emergency department.  Upon arrival, CPR was continued and oxygen supplied via endotracheal tube with good tube placement verified by auscultation and good sat readings.  Monitor was placed and patient demonstrated initially a sinus rhythm but there was no pulse.  Therefore, diagnosis was PEA and no reversible causes were identified.  ACLS protocol was followed with epinephrine 1 mg IV every 5 min.  He received a total that including EMS, 5 mg of epinephrine and 1 amp of bicarb.  Monitor at this point revealed the rhythm changed to an agonal rhythm.  When CPR was given, there was good results from the CPR.  However, CPR discontinued and there is no pulse and patient had an agonal  rhythm for several minutes, pupils were fixed but not dilated year.  Lungs demonstrating clear bilateral breath sounds when he was bagged via the endotracheal tube.  No external signs of any trauma noted. The patient&#39;s sister is here and she is a registered nurse.  We had discussed management at this point with her and all were in agreement that the code be terminated.  At 1015, patient was pronounced deceased..    ACLS protocol was followed.  See nursing record for medication and vital sign details.   Code outcome: Deceased   CC time 20 minutes.

                                                My father received his shot on March 13, 2021.  He drove to move home and on March 28th started having his right arm go numb but did not tell us.  He asked to go the ER March 29th at 6:45am saying his chest hurt and was having a hard time breathing, this has happened before since having Covid in September.  I called 911 after he became dizzy and could not walk.  While at the ER suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed him from his nose down over a course of 3 days.  His brain stem was affected and he lost the ability to swallow.  After being on a ventilator for 72 hours he was removed from it and died less then 30 mins later from drowning in his own saliva on April 1, 2021.
