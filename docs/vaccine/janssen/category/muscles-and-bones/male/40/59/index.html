                                                Experienced moderate debilitating flu symptoms day after vaccination and recovered the following day.  Over one week later (3/25) developed skin sensitivity on the neck which later spread to back, torso, and legs.  Skin sensitivity persists still one week after onset, is a severe chafing feeling when skin comes into contact with clothing.  No rash or any visual signs.  Along with the skin sensitivity, mild to moderate chills from day to day as well as muscle fatigue and upper/lower back pain.  Symptoms varied in severity day to day; used ibuprofen and it seemed to offer limited, temporary relief.  Concurrent with second onset of symptoms, noticed gradual abdominal inflammation and developed sensation similar to UTI but urine dip and lab test results were all normal.  Doctor concluded immune reaction to vaccine as no other allergies or changes in routine as well as no prior medical history of any of these symptoms. Prescribed daily prednisone for three days to calm immune response; after one day symptoms were greatly improved.  Abdominal inflammation has improved and UTI sensation improved.  Still experiencing slight chills and skin sensitivity unchanged.

                                                Pain in chest and back began on Wednesday 4/14.  What started out feeling like an uncomfortable pulled muscle in my back/chest area on Wednesday escalated rapidly to very sharp stabbing pains in my chest and back by Thursday afternoon 4/15.  After discussing my symptoms with the office of my PCP Thursday afternoon, I was told to go to the Emergency Room for evaluation.  I checked into the ER at approx 6pm that Thursday evening on 4/15.  While there I underwent a blood test, EKG and a chest Xray.  Upon evaluating the results of each test the Dr on assignment stated that there were no problems with major organs but could not diagnose.    Small red marks began developing on the right side of my chest that same day and progressively expanded in quantity across the right side of my chest and back.  A follow-up visit with my PCP was completed on Tuesday 4/20 and the diagnosis of Shingles was confirmed.  Pain has not subsided and has only gotten worse as of 4/21.  Prescription treatments began the evening of 4/20.

I tried taking cold and flu medicine before bed so that I could sleep. I developed a cough and I damaged my ribs as a result of the coughing. My ribs on the right side hurt when I cough. I was prescribed a cough suppressant Benzonatate 100. I also got a steroid and the cough has gotten better after six weeks. It is still present but seems to be happening less often.

My temp read 99.1. Normal is 97.4-97.7. Took Tylenol and went to bed.  Woke up  a few hours later sweating profusely.  Took temp again, was  101.6.  Was very unpleasant.  Fever broke a few hours later, though it went up and down throughout the next day, but not nearly as high. This was easily the sickest I&#39;ve been in 10-15 years.

All of these started within 6 hours of having been vaccinated. Alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen provided good relief for muscle/joint ache. This also reduced the severity of the headache, but did not relieve it. Headache, muscle ache, and joint ache resolved by 40 hours post-vaccination. Mild fatigue/tiring more easily gradually improved over the next 48 hours. I took one day of sick leave from my job to rest.

At about 10:30pm I started feeling sick, fever of 99.6, muscle and joint pain, chills, dizziness, weakness. Left arm where I got injected also felt like it was falling asleep at some point when it shouldn&#39;t have been based on how I was positioned. I finally took an ibuprofen so I could sleep around 2:30am, and felt better a couple hours later or so. Today so far I feel fine but my resting heart rate is about 30 beats higher than normal so I&#39;m still responding to vaccine.  I think overall my symptoms aren&#39;t out of the ordinary, just way stronger than I was expecting. I felt miserable.

I began to lose my vision like I was fainting and I momentarily blacked out or dozed off, then came back awake. I started to get tunnel vision again for a minute, then it faded away. Then I continued sweating for a minute and then it faded away. After a couple minutes I felt fine again. I sat for another several minutes then left at 1:15 feeling ok with just a sore shoulder.

That (Thursday/next night) evening, I felt much better.  Friday morning, I woke up feeling completely normal with only minor pain at injection site.

                                                I started get chills and sweating around 6pm when I woke up from a nap. I was still tired so I went back to sleep after a hour or two.  I woke up again in a few hours with worse chills, minor headache, and minor joint pain. I took over the counter medication, felt a little better and went back to sleep after a few hours. I woke up around 4am to use the bathroom and still had the worse chills, sweats, minor headache and was very dizzy. I decided to lay down on a rug rather than try to make it back to my bed and laid awake for a few hours again I woke up again in a few hours a little better and repeated everything until Sunday night when all my symptoms were very mild. I eat and drank water regularly and took over the counter acetaminophen a few times.

After conferring with my primary care facility, it was recommended that I see an ophthalmologist. Confirmed that I had a Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) and recommended I meet with a retinal specialist.  Dr. confirmed the BRVO was caused by a blood clot and commenced treatment via eye injection.  I then met with my primary physician to discuss the situation.  He recommend further tests to determine whether I had other clotting.  In addition to blood work, he order MRIs of my brain, head and neck region and also recommended that I meet with a thrombosis specialist.  I met with a Dr. who ordered additional blood work for additional testing.  All tests performed to determine if I had additional clotting have come back negative.

                                                Felt severe burning/stinging pain in injection site upon injection. Left pinky and ring finger were pretty numb shortly thereafter for about a day or two. Numbness still comes and goes, but not as bad as after the initial injection. After about day 2 started to have severe pain in joint of left shoulder along with impingement, popping. Uncomfortable to sleep on left shoulder as it starts to hurt and &#34;feels&#34; as if it will pop out. Range of motion seems pretty normal, but still getting some pain, popping, and impingement with certain movements/actions throughout the day. I believe it to be SIRVA.

I?ve subsequently had muscle aches and the feeling of being fatigued.

By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

                                                After the initial 12 hour period, I experienced night-time chills followed then by being too warm and night sweats.  This happened both the first and second night.  During the day I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours for aches and pain.  Mainly my neck and back have been what hurts, although my knees, elbows, hips, etc. also were achy.  The third and fourth days I still continued to have chills, no fever throughout as far as I am aware (took my temp 2-3 times).  The fourth day I was very faint and somewhat unbalanced, felt shaky and light headed and I ended up having an anxiety attack.  I mention the last symptom as I have never had an episode like this previously in my life.  Today is day 5, still feel tired, slightly nauseous, neck and back pain, headache, difficulty focusing.

Shortly after these symptoms I begin to have uncontrollable chills followed by a fever and Nausea. The whole time starting around 8pm I had pretty bad muscle aches as well. I took a warm shower and bundled up the whole night because I had a fever, aches, chills, and nausea. It was impossible to sleep because of this and sometimes my heart was beating fast as well. The next morning I had a headache that would not go away until I took Tylenol. The whole next day I felt exhausted as well and very weak. I began to feel better on day 3 but still feel somewhat foggy from the shot. I would not recommend this vaccine to anyone and would never get it again and hopefully the foggy sensation goes away.

                                                On 4/10 I started feeling tired with muscle aches.  A few days later my skin started to hurt.  Clothing was uncomfortable when it moved across my skin. Those symptoms lasted about a week. Then as they started to lessen I had some back pain (Sciatic) and a sore throat.  Also the muscles behind my eyes were slightly painful and bright lights were uncomfortable.  Then about  4/21 most of the symptoms reduced and I was feeling close to normal.  Then on 4/22 I was brushing my teeth and noticed that I couldn?t spit water like normal.  I called my GP doc and she recommended I head to the ER.   After thinking about it I also remember on 4/21 while drinking something I had some water squirt out of my lips.  At the time I thought I was just being clumsy but in hindsight the muscle weakness in my face started on 4/20.   I checked into the ER on 4/22.  When I checked into the hospital my facial weakness was very difficult to notice.  By the evening of 4/22 it was noticeable if I tried to ?show my teeth? or make a big smile. By the morning of 4/23 it was very noticeable.  The morning of 4/24 I couldn?t move my lips, nose or eyebrows.  My tongue, jaw and throat were not impacted at all.   I was started on plasmapheresis on  4/24. I had another treatment on 4/25. I noticed facial weakness was very slightly recovering the evening of 4/25.  By 4/27 my facial weakness is still healing with noticeable improvement day to day.

During a phone call a few days following his vaccine, he told me that his continues to experience shoulder pain and issues with range of motion following administration of the J&amp;J COVID vaccine.  When he first informed me, I asked him if the discomfort he was feeling was expected  pain and discomfort at the injection site, to which he responded no. He reports that a couple days following administration upon stretching when waking he experienced shooting  left upper arm/shoulder pain and reduced ROM the arm in which he received the vaccine. I am reporting this adverse event as he is still having this issue.

                                                11 days following the single shot I developed severe pain in my right calf muscle that felt like a charlie horse and on my leg from knee to my ankle felt a squeezing sensation like I was wearing a very tight sock that I couldn&#39;t take off.  After a few days the pain subsided and the similar pain began in my left leg however not as severe.  The pain would seemingly move around and come and go.  Some days it was so bad I couldn&#39;t walk or balance.  I believed I had a muscular issue.  I then began having swelling on the top of my left foot and around the ankle of my left foot.  After about a week, my right leg began to swell from the knee to ankle fairly significantly.  New veins appeared on the front of my right leg and other veins on the back of my right leg began to bulge.   Pain on both legs started to subside on the evening of 5/23, however swelling continued.   On the evening of 5/25 I was experiencing severe squeezing sensation and bulging veins in my right leg.

                                                In the beginning, my feet and hands had poor  circulation and became discolored, cold, and painful (like Reynaud&#39;s syndrome). I was able to get the circulation going by exercising. This lasted for a couple of weeks. I had cold sweats and chest discomfort, which I thought were symptoms of WPW. I went to the cardiologist. An EKG was done and I was put on a 2-week halter monitor. Everything checked out as not being a heart issue. Blood tests were done, and the results were normal. After the cold hands symptom, I developed palmar erythema. I also developed a lot of abdominal pain. I became really gassy, and my bowel movements became a light yellow. I had frequent urination. My weight dropped from 191 to 180, and I lost my appetite completely; the appetite loss happened for a week and a half. I had to force myself to eat. My hunger is now back, and I currently weigh 187. The gassiness, yellow stools, abdominal pains, and the frequent have all largely subsided. The stools are now a normal color. The palmar erythema is still present, though.

During the visit they didn&#39;t address my leg issues, released me with diuretics to deal with bloating (which have not helped).  My stomach is generally bloated anywhere from 50-75% and I have pain in my stomach , legs, and shoulders and seem to be losing muscle and a rapid rate.  I&#39;m a healthy eater so all of this is very unusual and extremely concerning.  I cannot work as well.

                                                Was having normal side effects including headache, fever, muscle aches which started about 6 hours after injections.  Roughly 14-16 hours after the injection (8:30-9am) started getting chest pain and slight shortness of breath.  Called my PCP and they told me to go to the ER as the chest pain is not normal.   At the ER they did an EKG which came back abnormal and I was rushed into a procedure to check my heart including a catheter, ultrasound, and a few more I will provide below.  Outcome after all the test was inflammation which I asked if it could have been in other areas of my body but doctor said it was my chest.  My C-Reactive Protein level was double the normal level.  They put me on 3 medications, Ibuprofen, one for Gout and Prilosec.

                                                Had a sudden onset fever which reached 103 the evening of the injection.  There was muscle soreness, fatigue, my pulse was above 80 all night and reached 100 during the peak of the fever.  By the next morning, the fever had dropped to 100, fatigue remained and a slight headache appeared.  The headache was gone by noon, the fatigue remained all day.  The evening after the injection, a slight fever returned and then stopped.  Two days after the injection, there were no further averse reactions other than slight soreness in the injection site.  I am no longer fatigued and feel fine.  Hope this information helps.

                                                I received the shot on 4/10. First 24 hours I had a slight fever and headache. Treated with Acetaninophhen. Since that time, I had relatively mild symptoms 4/11 - 4/13. Mostly fatigue.  On 4/14, I had a sudden increase in heart rate, dizziness, tingling sensation in all arms and legs and weakness in my limbs/grip. This prompted me to visit the ER. They ran numerous blood tests amd scans on me but found no abnormalities. Various unusual symptoms have continued to persist since 4/14.  For brief moments I feel fine.  At other times I have experience fatigue, diziness/vertigo, rapid heart rate, pins and needles feeling in my left hand and left leg.  Left leg numbness/tightness and heaviness. The fingers on my left hand sometimes move involuntarily.  And my anxiety has also gone up during this time. Tonight it has migratee to my left foot, where I have numbness in several of my toes.  I&#39;m looking for advice. Should I be concerned? Should these symptoms still be occurring 11 days after receiving my shot?  It has been very distressing and there seem to be very few people who have knowledge on this subject.  My care providers keep saying to self monitor and contact them if symptoms worsen. The problem is symptoms don&#39;t necessarily worsen, they just migrate from one area of my body to another.  The numbness comes and goes in maybe 1-2 hour intervals.

At approximately 4:46pm I developed a strong pain at the injection site.  At approximately 8pm I began to run a  fever and feel extremely fatigued.  My back and all my joints started to ache, I was sweating but also freezing cold.  I had a dull, throbbing pain in my testes.  I had pain in my scalp, my eyebrows, my ear lobes, my fingernails, my toes and toenails, the soles of my feet hurt.  Least of all I also had a headache.   I took 500mg Ibuprofen for the pain.    Now, almost 48 hours later I still have a low grade fever, still have considerable pain at the injection site, still have a headache.  The remaining symptoms dissipated on 5/2/21 at about 12pm.  Took another 500mg Ibuprofen for breakfast, but otherwise have had no appetite since receiving the vaccine.

                                                Blood clot in superficial vein behind right knee as well as vertigo and nausea.  Currently on 30mg/day of XARELTO blood thinner (I&#39;ve been taking since diagnosis on 5/5/21).  Will continue to take 20mg/day for the next 30 days.  Background: I started to notice my right calf get tight and sore approximately ~3 weeks following my vaccination.  I had been doing a lot of running and hill training so I assumed it was a muscle strain/aggravation.  After approximately 1-2 weeks I noticed the tightness worsen and also noticed significant swelling around my lower calf/ankle.  I went to the doctor on 5/4/21 and was given a D Dimer blood test which came back 1.27 mcg/mL FEU (over the recommended 0.5 mcg/mL).  The next day I had an ultrasound of my right leg where they discovered the SVT clot behind my right knee in a superficial vein (but near a major/deep vein intersection).  I was immediately prescribed XARELTO blood thinner - to be taken for ~51 days.  ~21 days of 30mg/day (15mg twice/day) followed by ~30 days of 20mg/day 1x per day.  The morning of 5/20/21 around 6:30am I started to feel nausea and vertigo after returning home from walking my dog.  I finished a low-intensity exercise routine at my home and around ~7:15am my symptoms worsened.  I went upstairs to my bedroom to lay down on my bed and the room started spinning.  I then went to the bathroom and vomited clear fluid.  I started feeling a little better after vomiting but was still slightly dizzy and light-headed.  I made an appointment and went to the doctor around 10:30am.  The doctor suggested doing further bloodwork and a CT scan of my head.  Both tests came back normal.  The doctor suggested the vertigo and nausea were inner ear related and that I should continue taking XARELTO and to also start wearing a compression sock (especially during exercise/activity).

Developed sore throat later in the day.   Symptoms worsened over the course of the week, sore throat, headache, malaise, extreme sinus congestion, coughing, sneezing, excess saliva production.  It was as if I contracted a sever cold.  Today is June 3&#39;rd and it is the first day I am feeling close back to 100%.  I should note that I have a strong immune system and have not been sick in years.

Vital signs normal including BP 120/90, 100% o2 levels, normal blood sugar and EKG. EMS assisted in getting me back to seated position and monitored for another 10-15 minutes. Declined transport and had family member drive me home where I rested for a few hours and woke up feeling fine. Very minor bruising / bump on head with no lasting sign of concussion or other trauma. 24&#43; hours post vaccine no other notable vaccine reactions aside from sore arm / muscles on injection site.

                                                I felt fine all day and went to bed at 9:30pm. I woke up to my body shaking uncontrollably and I was freezing at 10:30pm. My wife felt my skin and she said I was burning up. Unfortunately our thermometer wasn&#39;t working so I don&#39;t know my temperature, but I have never in my life shaken so badly with a fever. I couldn&#39;t control myself and I was shaking so hard that my muscles were sore from it, but I still couldn&#39;t stop. I then began vomiting every 45 minutes or so. This happened for nearly 4 hours until 2:18am. Then very suddenly everything just stopped. No more feeling cold (actually I then felt very warm and couldn&#39;t cool off. I was sweating quite a bit). No more shaking. No more vomiting. I did get a wicked headache, but I figured it was due to dehydration and took two Advil. The Advil didn&#39;t do anything and I was awake until 5:59am because my head hurt too badly to sleep. Finally I slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I just felt worn out for most of the day on the 10th, and couldn&#39;t shake the headache. Then on the evening if the 10th, I started getting a sore throat and a slightly runny nose. I went to bed that way. When I woke up on the 11th (today) I still had the sore throat and slight runny nose. The headache was gone, but I felt tightness in my chest. As I went throughout the day, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m short of breath with doing most things. I have two young children, so even taking care of them I feel like at times I&#39;m struggling for breath. I&#39;m not in bad shape and am a runner, so my cardio isn&#39;t bad. So I was surprised by this.

Within 1-2 hours had runny nose and felt stuffed up, thought it could be allergies or something and didn?t really attribute to vaccine.  4-5 hours  after injection felt something across the top of my brain ... felt as though something had been stuck in a blood vessel and became unstuck allowing blood to shoot through.  Was certainly freaked out by this, but was at an event and head of the ER department of the local hospital was also attending - so figured I had quicker access to medical care there if needed, than at home.   30-60 minutes later congestion completely cleared up.  9-12 hours after vaccination had extreme chills.  Day after vaccination had pain below the injection site... injection was 2? above pain.  Also neck pain. Day 2-8 since vaccination, on/off muscle pain or injection site pain. Today, day 9, have muscle pain in wrist of injection arm.

                                                The day of the vaccine,  I have the  normal regular arm pain. The following day, I had minor body aches and a lot of joint pain in my knees and legs. Those symptoms lasted a few days and resolved.  My doctor prescribed a new medication called Cymbalta  for my depression on 5/3/2021. I took the medication and developed tinnitus on 5/8/2021 and thought the tinnitus from the medication and stopped the medication. I called my doctor who advised that Cymbalta does not cause that reaction. The tinnitus went away and I was not taking Cymbalta.  Around mid June, I developed tinnitus again.  I consulted my doctor and was prescribed Dramamine. I did not take the medication since the tinnitus have resolve. I had only those 2 episodes of tinnitus and haven&#39;t had any other episode.   I am going to follow up with a specialist ENT doctor.

Did not go to the doctor or hospital, I have no insurance. Even until today I still have a light cough and shortness of breath. All this stopped me from going to work for 2 weeks, and unenployment did not pay.

Moved my arm around, got circulation and feeling back went back to sleep.  Then the next day all day my back was sore and all my joints felt sore including my ankles, wrist, neck, knuckles, elbows, knees. Just soreness - NO FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS - but sorness all over. I left message with Doc&#39;s office. Next day my joints felt better but I awoke with splitting headache. Took aspire and all improved.

                                                On Tuesday, June 8th, I&#39;m driving a car on the highway and a dizzy spell hits me hard with no warning. I got the car pulled off the side of the road but my world was spinning for 2-3 minutes. It scared me enough to go the ER an hour later where I had blood drawn, EKG, CT scan of brain, overnight monitoring, and an echocardiogram. All were normal, but over the course of the next week, I felt the full force of the following symptoms: lightheadedness to the point of almost fainting, brain fog, nausea, neck tightness, headaches, anxiety, and fatigue. I had so many lightheaded moments where I felt I would pass out. My life was affected because I couldn&#39;t do anything without feeling like I would pass out. Driving more than a mile is out of the question. Fortunately, I&#39;m a school teacher and all this started on the 2nd day of summer vacation. I certainly would not be able to teach if school were in session. How bad was my brain fog?  I have kids who love to play board games like monopoly.  I play 5 or more times a week.  My brain fog prevented me from playing monopoly with him. It was too complicated for me to roll the dice, count the dice, move my piece the number of spaces, figure out money amounts, etc. . My family was really worried because they noticed how I couldn&#39;t think. I felt like a 90 year old man with dementia. As far as my lightheadedness, I never actually fainted, but there were many times I had the &#34;sense of doom&#34; feeling where I was going to die. I visited the ER again a week later and they did another EKG with normal readings again and ordered a holter monitor to be worn for 24 hours, which came back normal. When I finally got into my primary care physician on June 17th, he suspected something terminal, so he orders a brain MRA the very next day. That came back clean, so he orders me to see a neurologist. Once I received news that the brain MRA was normal, my anxiety went away for the most part--I was not going to die! The neurologist prescribed gabapentin 100 mg daily (which is anti-migraine/anti-seizure meds) and a carotid artery ultrasound, which came back clean.  (Notice a pattern?) Because of the neck tightness/pain/uncomfortability, I visited a chiropractor thinking neck alignment was off. Chiro realigned me but I didn&#39;t feel any better or worse.  I have had 2 visits at the chiropractor, specifically for the neck pain and seeking relief. Today, I am 6 weeks from the June 8th out-of-the-blue dizzy spell that changed my life. If I gave a percentage of how good I am today, I would give a 75%. During all this time, I&#39;ve never had a fever and my blood pressure has been normal every time it&#39;s been taken. According to all these tests, I&#39;m the healthiest man in the world--my heart, brain, bloodwork is all great. My episodes are less and less frequent, and I drove today for about 5 miles! Yay! I feel like there&#39;s light at the end of the tunnel. In the last week, I&#39;ve been playing board games much better with less brain fog, but I have my moments with brain fog and lightheadedness. My neurologist and my primary care physician feel like there is no correlation to the vaccine, but the chiropractor I visited has said that he&#39;s treated multiple patients like me who are looking for relief from these symptoms in the past 4 months.

                                                Symptoms began immediately.  I felt an aching pain in my left arm immediately after the vaccination. It then moved to my scapula.   It persisted the rest of the day and all day Tuesday.  I also felt soreness of limbs (both arms and legs) intermittently for the 48 hours.  I had shortness of breath for the next day.  I felt extreme fatigue for the next 48 hours.  I felt my heart racing off and on for 24 hours,  I felt a loss of strength in both arms and legs for the next 48 hours.  Monday Night I woke up sweating as I had a fever.  The fever persisted off and on for about 24 hours. I was irritable (probably due to not feeling well) for about 48 hours.  My wife had to drive me home.

My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

His body was shaking slightly and his eyes were open but there was no cognitive awareness. This lasted no more than 90 seconds and then patient came to abruptly and reoriented himself on the chair before I had the opportunity to get him to the floor. Patient then stated that he was lightheaded, warm and sweaty. EMT had been called and upon assessment of the patient transported him to the ER.

                                                3AM woke up with high fever, headache, muscle ache from shoulders up. Treated with Tylenol to reduce fever, symptoms continued through the day. 2PM discovered large patch of hives on back from right shoulder to waist approximately 4 inches wide at the top and narrowing to 1 inch wide at the bottom. Treated with my go-to allergic reaction kit: Xyzal, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. Hives started fading after 1 hour and were mostly gone within 3 hours, followed by 12 hours of sleep.

                                                Had the following events:  muscle &amp; joint pain, persistent tiredness for 4 days following  the shot. On the 3rd day following the shot I started sneezing regularly and having a stuffy head &amp; runny nose. This lasted about 4 days. After  the sneezing started  to subside I started  experiencing a nasty head cold which then traveled to my chest and lasted for about 5 days.  Was coughing all day long.  Once those symptoms started to subside, about 2 and a half weeks after the shot, I broke out in a body rash which I&#39;m still dealing with today and seems to be getting  a little  worse.  I&#39;m currently at a dermatologist in the waiting room filling out this report.  The rash is very itchy &amp; at times a tad painful.

Chills, aches, and fever continued until 8:30pm the same night. My fever would go to 102.8 as a high to 100.2 depending on how close I was to my next timeframe to take Tylenol.  I took 4 extra strength Tylenol (2000 mg) every 4 hours, give or take 30 minutes. Around 8:30 pm my fever broke and I sweated mildly Until around 10:30pm

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often.

Sepsis with unknown source of infection:  This is evidenced by leukopenia, tachycardia and fever. Acute metabolic encephalopathy, likely secondary to possible sepsis versus effects of  COVID vaccine. Encephalitis and meningitis ruled out. Acute nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis: evidenced by elevated CK levels 1700 on admission, likely secondary to sepsis. Acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, transaminitis, elevated troponin likely associated with rhabdo. On sepsis protocol (vancomycin, meropenem and acyclovir)  Disc

                                                On the day after the injection, a severe stiffness in both legs occurred.  It was a soreness and stiffness similar to the day after running a marathon race .  The soreness and stiffness would not change if I was sitting, walking, standing or kneeling.  It was constant discomfort and irritation.  It was not painful and therefore I originally did not go to medical.  There was no discomfort in my left arm at the injection site.  The discomfort increased for the rest of the day.  A headache started in mid afternoon and kept increasing throughout the rest of day.  I have not had a headache in years.  Around 7:00 PM on Thursday, I had to sleep.  I was extremely tired.  My body had chills and I had to wear a sweatshirt and full set of clothes to bed just to stay warm.  That is very unusual.  I am usually throwing off covers every night throughout the entire year.    I did not eat dinner because there was no appetite.  I slept in bed for at least 12 hours.  Typical night sleep = 8 hours.  The next morning was no issue and therefore I did not go seek medical help because there are supposed to be side effects to vaccines.  Now, I am reporting it because headache and the stiff muscles were identified on the news.  However, it was around 24-36 hours and not the 6 days on the news.

                                                On 4/14/2021, right elbow started to hurt.  This was a site of a removed gout-caused mass over a year ago.  That subsided within a day.  On 4/15/2021, left foot started to hurt.  By 4/17/2021, the next to smallest toe and the large toe was swollen and very tender to any sort of touch.  It was not warm.  The pain was almost unbearable on 4/18/2021 and the suspicion that it might be gout was considered.  On 4/19/2021, after a visit with his doctor, gout was confirmed as the likely cause of the pain/swelling.  However, no blood tests were run to confirm.  Treatment for gout was initiated.

                                                About 1 week after vaccination, I noted sensations of fullness or bloatedness.  It felt like gas trapped in my upper abdomen that could not be relieved by burping.  Within 2 days, I began to have pain in lower, left rib cage akin to side cramps/stitch after strenuous running, but persisted the entire day.  About 2-3 days later,  the pain intensified and spread throughout my diaphragm region (left and right sides).   Breathing was somewhat affected, after semi-strenuous activities, such as walking up/down stairs.  So, I avoided physical exercise, and took Advil for a couple days to minimize the pain.  After another 3-4 days, the pain in the diaphragm region subsided.  I have not experienced further discomfort for the past week (today is 4/21/2021).  No treatments were sought during this period.  I self-researched the symptoms and hypothesize the pain stemmed from a swollen spleen, which might have been caused by an overactive immune system due to the vaccine.

                                                Monday, March 29 I was warming up for a chest workout - bench press with 135# (2- 45# plates) on the bar. On my first rep I noticed the muscles in my right arm were not firing properly and I pressed the wt up very unevenly - I repeated two more reps (total of 3) and repacked the bar. I then proceeded to attempt push ups- on my first rep my wt shift over my left arm and my right arm only served to balance me- again no pushing strength. I then proceeded to do a pull up- as I attempted my first pull-up my weight again shift to my left side- no pulling strength in right arm.  The week prior I was showing signs of tennis elbow in my right arm. The week of March 29, the intensity of discomfort was high as I experienced muscle spasms alternating between my right tricep, right lateral muscle and my right pectoral muscle- my tennis elbow pain was intense and I experienced tingling in my right ring finger and pinky.  On April 9 I went to family Dr they gave me a muscle relaxer and pain pills and scheduled an x-ray of right elbow and shoulder. April 16 the pain continued and I went back into the doctor and had an MRI scheduled for Sunday May 2 along with a referral to an ortho doctor. May 17 I went to the ortho doctor who did another X-ray. The ortho doctor first Mentioned that this could be GBS. I started Physical therapy on June 21.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after getting the vaccine, I began shivering uncontrollably for about an hour and felt hot (like a fever) at the same time. I also ached all over. I took 2 Tylenol and was able to fall back asleep. I woke up sweaty, but the chills and fever were gone. I?m now just stiff, with some mild pain at the injection site.

                                                Just before going to bed I started feeling very cold, shivering, I had similar sensation in the past when fever went up extremely quick. I did not measure my body temperature because I immediately ran under the blanket. Icy-cold hands and feet, even after my body temperature seemed to stabilize. I fell asleep but not a restful sleep. I woke up after 2.5 to 3 hours with the feeling that it was morning, but in fact it was between 2am and 3 am. At that point I felt the worst part had gone, I felt weak and with muscle aches but I could drink water and go back to bed. I did not have a restful sleep all night and I woke up may times. By the morning I was tired but no fever.

                                                I started sweating profusely within 30 min of the shot. Was light headed and dizzy for approximately 4-5 hrs. Once the sweating stopped I felt severe pain in both knees and ankles. If felt as if you were trying to snap my knees and ankles in half. That lasted 4-5 hrs. After I slept for a few hrs over night I woke up and felt pretty good. Approximately 3-4 hrs after I woke up I felt light headed and nauseated for approximately 3-4 hrs. I felt pretty much back to normal into the third day after the shot. I was slightly light headed and fatigued for approximately 8 days after the shot. After about the 8th day I felt normal again. I said I will never get that shot again. Approximately 25 years ago I had gotten my first flew shot and I was very sick for a week. Never received another flew shot again. Besides the stress and anxiety issues I am a healthy guy. Every 2 years we get full blood work up and my blood levels have always been spot on of where they should be.

                                                About a month after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I noticed a bump in the top of my left calf, which caused some discomfort and also noticed slight numbness in left foot / toes.  Primary, Dr., sent me for ultrasound, which showed I had several blood clots in my leg.  I have never had any blood clots before.  Dr.  referred me to Hematologist, Dr.  She ran extensive blood tests and found no genetic predisposition for clots.  She stated it was likely the vaccine that caused me to develop blood clots.  I am now on blood thinners to try to dissolve them and may have to take them for life if the clots don&#39;t go away in the new few months.  Follow up ultrasound scheduled 9/7/21.

Pain/Discomfort in back on both sides.  Sometimes upper back, sometimes lower. Pain/Discomfort and sometimes a burning sensation in ribs.  Many times this  presented itself at the lower tips of the ribs. Arms: Pain/Discomfort under armpits. Tingling in arms.  There was a point where my arms would fall asleep when I was  laying down at night. General weakness/fatigue in the arm. Sometimes arms (particularly the forearms) feel tight   Leg Pain/Discomfort in calves.  Many times, the pain would be a sharp, pointed  sensation in both calves.  This discomfort always presents itself in the back of my calves.        *Weakness/Fatigue in thighs.  Many times my thighs will feel weak/fatigued.  Neck: Pain/Discomfort in my neck.  Primarily this occurs on the sides of my neck.  There is also a tightness that occurs on the sides of my neck too. At times, the back of my neck is also tight and uncomfortable.  Spine: General tightness and discomfort running down the middle of my back.  This  occurs primarily in the upper to middle part of my back.  Overall: Along with the different sensations listed, I have battled constant fatigue and a feeling of weakness.  This weakness could be overall throughout the body or sometimes just in certain regions in my body.  For example, some days I might feel like my arms are weak/fatigued, other days it might be my legs, and then sometimes throughout my body.  I have also been dealing with persistent headaches from time to time.

                                                Patient received Johnson&amp;Johnson COVID vaccine in the afternoon on 3/31/21. Patient reported having right arm pain, diaphoresis, chills, nausea, and muscle aches/pain in upper leg/lower back at 5:30am the following morning. Patient took 2 tablets of 500mg naproxen in the morning and in the afternoon. Symptoms did not resolve and patient had to leave work early. Upon getting home patient took 2 tablets of 650mg tylenol and symptoms resolved within 48 hours. On 4/3/21 patient reported mild to severe pain in heel of left foot. The following day the patient went to WellNow urgent care to get his heel examined. During examination provider noticed patient&#39;s lesions and patient stated more lesions have appeared since getting the vaccine.  1 on his stomach, 1 on the dorsum of his left foot, 1 on his back, 1 on his left elbow, in between his toes of his left foot, and in between the fingers of his right hand. Patient stated that these lesions cause a burning sensation and can become itchy. Patient was sent to Hopsital ED as provider at urgent care was concerned patient may have purpura. Patient was seen and discharged on 4/4/21 from the ED. The heel pain was determined to be plantar fascitis which was treated with at home exercises with a heel cup. The patient was given clotrimazole for his lesions. The patient had a follow-up visit with his primary care provider at hospital on 4/6/21 in which he explained the clotrimazole only made his lesions worse. Patient was referred to follow up with dermatology on 4/8/21. Primary care provider believes progression of the lesions since getting the vaccine leads to concern of an underlying autoimmune exacerbated by vaccine.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes and abdominal pain from right him bone down to scrotum. Pain on 4/7 was such that i though i was suffering a hernia.  Couldn&#39;t get out of car or move my right leg across my body. Could put right leg into pants leg.  Hurt to bend over and do much of anything on 4/7.   Initially thought pain was in testicle but doesn&#39;t hurt at all to the touch.  Realized it more a swollen area in the groin between hip bone and scrotum.   Nothing hurts to the touch at all in that area either which lead my to believe it was swollen lymph nodes.  The  Feeling is as if i got hit in the right groin  and my testicle has been hit and discomfort is 8 inches above right testicle in my groin area.    It has been improving every day since then, the more i walk the better it is.  It only hurts when i sit now and it seems to aggravate it pretty well but once i start moving the pain goes away.  It has been 9 days now and the i don&#39;t notice it all day until i come back to the office and sit at my desk and again it gets aggravated and the discomfort feels like my right testicle is near my appendix  Since this all started my legs feel heavier in the calf and have little nerve sensations when i sit too, which concerns me about the blood clot possibility and so i have been emailing with my doctor.  I am going to make appt for Monday 4/19

Now Its been a month and I struggle to dress myself. My shoulder hurts really bad. On a scale from 1-10 its usually a 3-4 during the day and sometimes a 9 at night. The only thing that helps is Aleve and my family doctor told me I can&#39;t take Aleve anymore because I&#39;m on blood thinners. She said take Tylenol. I followed her advice and It doesn&#39;t work. She said if it keeps hurting, to come back in 2 weeks.

                                                The patient is a 49 year old male who has a past medical history significant for bipolar disorder with manic episodes, OSA on CPAP, morbid obesity, HLD, and  relapsing remitting MS.  Per chart review, patient&#39;s MS was initially diagnosed in 2012 on MRI and LP and was on Copaxone for several years but stopped taking in 2017.  Symptoms and imaging remained stable through 2019 then patient was lost to follow up until he was seen by Dr.  on 4/12/21 who ordered an outpt MRI.   Patient had COVID vaccine with Jansen vaccine on 4/10/21.  He developed bilateral upper and lower exremity weakness and urinary retention on 4/21/21 which prompted presentation.  He came into ED 4/21/21 and had foley placed but removed foley and decided to leave AMA. Returned on 4/22/21 with worsening symptoms and was subsequently admitted. Patient was seen by neurology and started on high dose steroid x5d for MS exacerbation. Initial MRI of the brain obtained on 4/22/21 was notably stable without change in previously described white matter disease. No new lesions to suggest active demyelination. New plaques were noted on MRI C and T spine (4/22/21). It is noted that patient received COVID19 vaccination with J&amp;J vaccine on 4/10/21 and temporal relationship between his acute presentation and recent vaccination was questioned.    On 4/30/21, patient developed severe bilateral facial weakness and he additionally was reported to have had an episode of aspiration.  Repeat MRI brain on 4/30/21 showed new bilateral facial nerve enhancement. Etiologies could include: GBS, Lyme disease, botulism, neurosarcoidosis, less likely myasthenia gravis.  LP was pursued on 5/1/21 which was significant for tube 4 with 136 WBC, 88% lymphocytes, glucose 89, protein 632. Meningitis/encephalitis panel was negative.  Lyme CSF was negative, Lyme antibody panel was positive.  MuSK antibody negative.  ACE blood level normal.  Ganglioside antibody panel and myasthenia graivs adult panel pending. He is being treated for Lyme disease with Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily since 5/1/21 with plan for 2-4 week course to cover for Lyme disease.  He is still admitted and is still having symptoms of facial palsy as of today (5/4/21)

                                                I started having a lot of pain in my right leg. I could actually feel and see that my veins were swollen. It progressed and started moving around. I started having chest pain and headaches. I ended up at ER. They gave me pain meds and did a CT Scan and ultrasound, which were both clear. The next day, I was walking around and my hand and arm started hurting and then went numb. My right wrist was swollen to twice its size. I went to care and they told me to go back to the ER. They eventually did another ultrasound, but the swelling had gone down by then. A few hours later, my left arm started to swell and lasted for about 4 hours. From there, I had pain in my arms and legs for a few days after that, but then I was fine.

                                                About 20 hours after injection, I had mild flu-like symptoms, including headache and muscle ache, lasting about 12 hours. But about 5 days after my injection (5 days &#43; 5 hours, actually), I experienced a bewildering all-over rash that freaked me out. It started as itching around my elbows and ankles -- it felt like mosquito bites and sunburn together -- and spread to wrist and knee areas. The rash climbed by legs and arms. I applied coat after coat of Benadryl, which seemed to help. The rash would disappear and move somewhere else. I had it on my left foot, but then that resolved, only to find it on my right foot. After about 3 hours, it had spread to my stomach, the bridge of my nose, and my cheeks. It started to calm down around midnight. I woke up at 6:00 am (12 hours after onset) with extremely itchy hands. At 8:00 am (14 hours after onset), it had mostly disappeared except for patches on my back, and my wrists still itch. I&#39;m hoping it goes away later today! It was crazy!

                                                First, pain around the injection site; it appeared within a few hours after the injection, but it was bearable.  Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

My shoulder is still stiff on the opposite side of the injection site at this time.  My doctor told me it might be sinus pressure and he put me on some steroids - had a five day dose and I finished them.

After going to the chiropractor two times the knot and pain ended up in my right leg. I then went to Urgent Care where they diagnosed me with a large blood clot. They sent me to imaging and after scanning the area confirmed that there was a blood clot in my right leg. Urgent Care then set me up with a specialist.

Saturday April 23rd Went to er was treated for kidney stones but they could only find one small one,  Was sent home with pain medication.  Shortness of breath persisted as did bloody cough and pain in chest and all over. Went back to the er on 4/28 as pain was unbearable (chest pain)  once given a cat scan and diagnosed with blood clots in my lungs and then an ultra sound and found a blood clot in my leg (just above knee).  It is thought that I was mis-diagnosed on the original trip to the er with kidney stones.  I have been put on blood thinners and pain medication and will be following up with my doctor.

                                                I experienced pain in my left shoulder after my J&amp;J vaccine, have trouble any pushups. My pain is constant in my left arm above my head. The day I went to the doctor, a guy crashed into me and the pain I experienced was more. I can put my fingers into my shoulder region and it is very painful.  I saw a doctor 04-23-2021 ad he advised me if my symptoms persists I should come back for a re-evaluation. I can not put my left arm first, my left arm is unstable.  Before the J&amp;J vaccine, I did not have this pain to my left shoulder.  I have also taken OTC Tylenol but it does not help with my pain.

Ongoing: extra gas (intestinal); cold flashes that course quickly through body; tingling in arms, hands (like a buzz or very fine pins and needles); irritability; itchiness (upper body, face and head); numbness on front of tongue; stiff finger joints; brain fog; quick onset of fatigue; sudden faint feeling; feeling of weakness in muscles; bruise on right upper arm which remained for a couple weeks; apparent reduced allergen/pollen resistance.  Also, it seems I may now be having novel allergic reactions to peanuts. I had long consumed peanuts and peanut butter without incident before taking the vaccine.

SATURDAY MORNING I ALSO NOTICED MY LEFT LEG WAS SWOLLEN AND HAD A BLUEISH/REDDISH COLOR AND WAS THROBBING. FROM TIME TO TIME i WOULD EXPERIENCE A SHARP PAIN BEHIND MY KNEE AND THIGH. AFTER A WEEK THE SYMPTOMS DID NOT GO AWAY SO I WENT TO THE DOCTOR. HE ORDERED AN ULTRASOUND ON MY LEG. THAT SAME DAY I HAD THE ULTRASOUND WHERE THEY FOUND MULTIPLE BLOOD CLOTS IN MY LEFT LEG. DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY PUT ME ON ELIQUIS. THE DOSE FOR THE FIRST 2 WEEKS WAS 10MG TWICE A DAY (10 MG MORNING AROUND 8AM AND 10 MG AROUND 8 PM). AFTER 14 DAYS HE REDUCED MY DOSE TO 5 MG AM AND 5 MG PM.

                                                Sore arm.  About 3 hours after getting the shot, I started getting aches, feeling cold, and tired.  The next morning my joints ached and I had a sore throat.  I took a couple of Ibuprofen (200 mg each) and about an hour later, my aches started going away.  By 8 pm the next day, I didn&#39;t have many side effects.

Went to bed at my usual time and woke up at 2:00 am with the chills I could not get warm late that night around 5:00 am I started having joint pain and fatigue with a headache and hot skin. I had taken my temperature and it was 100.7. I tried to wait out symptoms but I seem to bee get worse throughout the morning. Around 10:00 am I was in terrible pain and my body hurt all over. I once again took my temperature and it had gone up to 101.9. I had to call of work because I was so ?out of it?.  I started taking Tylenol ever 4 hrs for my fever and I was trying to hydrate.  My temperature slowly went down but still had body pain. I then started thank ibuprofen to help. Later that night around 9:00 pm my temperature was 99. The next day I called off work for fatigue and body pain. Today my temperature is normal and I?m starting to feel like my self again

Pt was quite anxious &amp; nervous (but already has severe anxiety). Pharmacist called patient following afternoon, the 11th and patient noted he was doing marginally better but still sounded anxious. Pharmacist called patient on Fri the 12th 5:16p and this was when the patient explained the following: Muscle stiffness on left side &amp; pain down left leg; cranial pain; shoulder stiffness; nasal congestion; some shortness of breath; soreness &amp; fatigue.  Patient called back and said he had partial shortness of breath at 7:34p on the 12th.  On Sat the 13th at 11am, pharmacist called to check on pt; found him quite agitated &amp; saying, &#34;He feels the shot was botched&#34;, noted he had called Janssen to report his issues.  At 4:30pm, pt came to pharmacy, looked fine, arm showed no redness, was more subdued in person than on the phone earlier. He said he was feeling better but was not happy with Janssen and wanted the Moderna 2 series shot because he feels Janssen&#39;s vaccine wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to.

                                                Starting 96 hours after vaccination: extreme stabbing pain in left deltoid (injection site).  Soon, this was accompanied by dull but severe pain in left shoulder and upper left back (top of scapula and around collar bone), extending to base of neck. This pain lasted 2 weeks, and was severe enough to prevent patient from sitting or standing for more than a few minutes at a time, especially during the first week of pain. Painkillers (Acetaminophen or NSAIDs) or muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine) did not help alleviate the pain. The pain started on March 17, and finally eased up on April 2 (the vaccination was on March 13). There is still some pain and stiffness in the left arm (currently in the biceps), but it is no longer severe. By the way, in addition to the above symptoms starting at 96 hours, there were the usual expected systemic symptoms immediately after the vaccination (starting at 6 hours and ending at 36 hours): light fever, mild body ache, fatigue and mild local pain at injection site.

On 4/6/21 I came home from work about 7:00 am due to an extreme headache and muscle weakness. By the afternoon my fever was up to 101. On 4/7 my fever went up to 102.7 and I was shaking uncontrollably, sweating , dizzy, headache, and had heaviness in my chest. I felt as if I were going to have a stroke. The headache was excruciating. I took acetaminophen 500 x 2 and 400 mg of ibuprofen, and Theraflu to try and alleviate the symptoms. On 4/9/21 my fever broke, but the weakness, dizziness and headaches have continued. I currently have ongoing headaches and dizziness. I have not gone to the doctor because I do not have a PCP. I am looking for one now.

After those injections I have led a normal life.  NO issues whatsoever.  No discomfort, no leg pain, no back pain.  Within about an hour after receiving the COVID-19 injection, I started to have discomfort and pain in my lower back.  Within a few days my sciatic pain had returned.  I am now scheduled for another injection in my back for 4-23-21 to get rid of the sciatic pain.

                                                Intense headaches, back and hip pain and right arm pain.  The pain got so bad and lasted for a few months ultimately landing me in the Emergency Room for 3 visits in 2 days.  I also had Bells Palsy.  They were pumping me full of morphine and it did not take away the pain.  Treatment was pain management - vicodin and prednisone for the bells palsy.  Severe pain is gone , but now have joint pain, weird skin sensations and dealing with fatigue and some depression.  This is vaccine related - I had no issues with any of this prior to the shot.

                                                Had the expected fever within 24hrs which okay.  But 5 days later out of the blue I felt shaky, disoriented, sweats, fatigued hardly had the energy to stand or even speak, I was fearing I was having some kind of heart attack or stroke.  Something in my body was telling me something was very wrong, I have never had a feeling like this before in my life it was pretty scary.  I went to a place to be alone and sit since I could hardly stand, I sat for an hour and started to feel some relief.  It took almost 4 hours until some sense of normal was back.  I came home and went to sleep for the event tired me out immensely.  Since that days event and still ongoing I have been having random dizzy spells, I have days with absolutely not enough energy to walk out of bed and have called out of work because of it.  I get the feeling I am unplugged and then plugged back in as far as energy goes almost every day.  I have worse and better days with that.  About 2 to 3 times a week I experience  sudden pains and tingling that can go anywhere on my body but seems to focus more on all my extremities and back.  Feels like fire/pins/needles and it stays with me for a few hours to an entire day the pain ranges from a 5 to an 8.  My legs feel stiff every day now and at times sore yet I have done nothing exertive to cause that.  With the stiffness I have trouble getting my shoes and socks on, and getting up from sitting.  All these symptoms I didnt have until I took the shot.

                                                After the initial injection site pain, I have experienced constant intramuscular pain at the site and adjacent areas in the muscle upon movement or use. Something as simple as flexion or extension causes a sharp pain in that area. I initially put that off to the trauma of the injection itself, but now four months later with no improvement, I can only conclude that the injection caused more than normal injection trauma. I am also experiencing numbness and tingling in the whole arm after periods of immobility (such as sleeping). Getting up in the morning, that arm is moderately sore, and I experience particular pain around the injection site. There has been no injury to that arm or that muscle group. I have no pre-existing injuries or conditions that would have a bearing on this pain. I have not sought medical attention, as I feel certain that there is not enough known about this vaccine to reliably come up with a treatment plan.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. No past medical history or concurrent conditions were reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 205A21A expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 11-APR-2021 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. After several weeks of vaccination on an unspecified date, the patient developed muscle pain and muscle weakness in his thighs and lower back, and the pain extended to his back. Patient experienced tingling sensation over the body but more in the extremities. He experienced perception of heat and cold reversed or delayed. The development migraine headaches increased dramatically, but as per reporter it was possible to had consequence of exhaustion from being sleep deprived.

Patient went to emergency room and where he had been told that he had Bell&#39;s palsy, but they did not know what to think about the non-facial symptoms and asked him to see a neurologist. The patient was prescribed with prednisone and an antiviral. By the end of the same day, he lost most sense of taste. Patient later saw a neurologist who ordered Magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of brain, sinuses, and upper spine to look for signs of neuronal demyelination, but there were not any significant findings. During follow up appointment on 15-JUL-2021 with the neurologist, they discussed potential association between vaccine and Guillain barre syndrome. He ordered patient to do nerve conduction test to look for evidence of peripheral nerve damage. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from pain in the back, and muscles pain in the thighs and lower back, had not recovered from deprivation of sleep, tingling sensation over the body but more in the extremities, bell&#39;s palsy, lost most sense of taste, continuously exhausted which was affecting ability to think clearly, and muscle weakness in thighs and lower back, and the outcome of perception of heat and cold reversed or delayed and migraine headaches was not reported.

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

                                                Approximately three weeks after receiving Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, I began to get pains in legs. Calves were aching and throbbing. Didn&#39;t think anything of it at first....just thought achy muscles and such. The day before Easter (April 3rd 2021) decided since the pain was continuing and the internet will scare you to death - I went to a local Emergency Room in advance,  I had an ultrasound on my left leg and it was noted I had DVT. (blood clot in left calf)  To briefly explain: I had an achilles issue back in Nov. 2020 (slight micro tear - achilles tendonitis) I thought maybe this was related to that, as I had not been to the doctor to get it checked until early March 2021. and it bothered me off and on for a few months. I thought the calf pain may have been related to that?  I explained to the emergency room doctor about my achilles and thought it was an issue related to that. They decided to perform an ultrasound on my left leg. Which noted the DVT/Blood Clot. They put me on a starter pack of Xarelto and I am to follow up with my normal doctor on April 22, 2021.

                                                Had very cold chill starting about 6:30 pm, about 1:15 am starting to feel better, but arm was still sore and the injection site. soreness site stayed sore  for about another 3 to 4 days, but total top arm around site still sore and aching. Arm is hard to lift up at some times and weak to lift anything up sometimes. Arm feels week for about 2 to 3 days and then starts to fill better. Then after a day of the soreness or no weakness in the arm, it starts back hurting again. It now getting worse at night time and sometimes during the day. Some days it hurts so bad that I can&#39;t even move it. I don&#39;t bother to tell my wife, because it just last for about a 2 to 3 hours. I have been to my doctor yet. But if it keeps bothering me I will make an appointment to see him.  It just my arm and hand be very weak to use at sometimes every other day.

Temperature started to decrease over the next two days so did the cramping. Then starting on 4/5 I started to experience pain in the back of my head along with the sensation of heat/burning. This was accompanied by a stiff neck. This pain and stiffness persists to today. Medication prescribed by my doctor lessens the discomfort but has not rid me of the issue.

                                                We were vaccinated on April 2 in the morning. On April 12, 2021 we came home from work in the morning and he complained of numbness in his left. We thought it was related to the weather getting warm and we work the night shift, so he rested and increased his water intake. He was able to go to work on Monday night and return home and continued to rest on Tuesday. On Tuesday, there was no numbness, but there was weakness in both his legs. On Wednesday, he felt weakness throughout his body, especially in his legs. On Thursday, he collapsed. He did not lose consciences but his legs gave out under him and he was not able to get up up. He was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a stroke, increased sugars (diabetes he has never had before), acute kidney injury, and uncontrolled increased blood pressure. He was hospitalized and discharged April 19, 2021. He was readmitted 04/24/2021 for another stroke.

After about a week, I had an appointment at 4:30 and was scheduled for the next morning at 8:30 to meet with a back and spine doctor for xrays.  Xrays were negative.  I was then schedule with a neck and hand specialist a few days later. This appointment could not provide a diagnosis.  Back and abdominal pain increase and soreness had spread to the stomach and groin.  After the news broke of the cerebral blood clots in 6 women.  See attached Continuation Page.

By late Monday 4/5 I experienced fatigue, dizziness, upper respiratory scratchiness and increased post-nasal drip, tightness in my chest, muscle soreness and headache. By Tuesday, 4/6 around 10 a.m. in addition to the above symptoms I had a severe headache and lost feeling in my right arm for half an hour, with severe muscle cramps and loss of use in that arm. The muscle issues subsided by early afternoon leaving only fatigue, headache, dizziness and a lingering respiratory tightness and sinus issues. Concerned about vaccine side-effects I was reading about, I made a doctor&#39;s appointment for the following week (earliest available), met with a physician&#39;s assistant who prescribed an antibiotic (Doxycycline Mono 100 Mg) for the sinus issues but did not address the other issues.

I also had numbness sensation to my face, right side and lips and also to my head. I went to Urgent Care where lab work was performed as well as a CT scan of the head to check for blood clots and results came back normal. Also an U/S of the right leg to check for any blood clots was performed which came back normal. I then went to see my PCP who performed more tests and exams, again did lab work to check for blood coagulation and still continued with the numbness sensation to my hands and all to my body. After about 10 days of my vaccine, I noticed that my oxygen level was 87, 96, 86, 92 and where my oxygen level has always been around 98 or 99.  I will be also having heart studies in a few weeks. I have not recovered from my symptoms and feel very fatigued and tired all the days.

Wife looked a day later after my complaints and saw tiny red bump clusters. Some were on my back, shoulder, buttocks and the itching was also spread out; on the head, foot, wrist, and groin region. She found no dots there. I did not contact my primary yet. Cortisone cream and antihistamine pill today are what I took.

When  he tried to walk, his legs buckled, but customer was slowly assisted to the floor.  While on the floor,  my technician heard grunting noises coming from him and his left arm was rigid and bent at the elbow.  But within 5-10 seconds, he slowly sat up and said that he &#34;doesn&#39;t remember being on the fall&#34; and complained of being sweaty and &#34;seeing dots&#34;.  Paramedics were contacted and took him the hospital. Contacted the customer later in the evening and was informed that he was resting at home after spending half of the day in the hospital.  He mentioned that the paramedics treated him with Epipen and bendadryl and then he felt better.  He was treated &#34;other things&#34; but don&#39;t recall.

First he prescribed steroid which I took for 10 days, It didn&#39;t work. I went to see him again - he told me to take magnesium malate and referred to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist did blood tests and he said that I don&#39;t have any inflammatory disease. He didn&#39;t find anything wrong but he said that my symptoms are similar to those of fibromyalgia. he referred me to a physical therapy. I have been going to a physical therapy 3 times a week for the last two months. Nothing works so far. The pain and numbness in my back, legs and arms are as strong as before.

                                                Lightheaded about 5 minutes after injection. Medical team took HR and BP and was normal Took about 20 minutes and light headedness went away  Later that night at around 12:30 am, felt very cold and shivering with severe headache Did not take temperature Had a hard time going back to sleep Got up around 1:00 am to take 800 mg of OTC Advil When walking back up stairs had severe muscle pain in arms and legs Was fine after that Seemed to get better by 2 am No issues next day  About 7-10 days later developed severe frontal headaches/sinus pressure No other symptoms Used Neti Pot with saline solution and did nothing Took OTC allergy meds and Advil and did nothing  Say my primary care Dr and he prescribed Flonase, Singular and Allegra &#43; continue Neti Pot and Advil as needed Not much improvement on this regime after 3-5 days of use  About a week later developed severe pain in bottom right jaw Took OTC Advil and again no improvement Went to Dentist and said not tooth related but probably TMJD Recommend dental appliance to help with grinding  About a few days later after this jaw pain developed, developed sharp stabbing pain in bottom of left knee cap. No recollection of any insult that would cause this  All three of these pain sites were perfectly fine prior to getting J&amp;J vaccine.  No history of pain or injury to these areas prior  All of these incidents to me seem to be inflammatory/immune in nature and could be related to J&amp;J vaccine based upon how I reacted to injection.  Curious if others are seeing the same thing and if so what should be done or how long should this last?

                                                After getting the shot on Friday at 6:00 pm. I did not have any issues with the shoulder.   Sunday evening around 11pm I have started to have shoulder pain.  The pain is around the area of the injection.  The pain  is generally in the deltoid muscle  and has spread some to the bicep muscle as well.   Uncertain if this is common to the injection process but it caused concern as its onset had been  over 48 hours post injection.

                                                Lost his vaccine card would not give him a new one.  He got his vaccine, had burning sensation immediately after the needle was pulled out.  About 5-10 minutes later he started sweating, and seemed to have calmed down and felt OK.  He was observed for 30 minutes there and went for observation for another 30  minutes.  He went to another doctors office and at about 15:00 started feeling light headed and weak.  He drove back home, picked up some stuff at a grocery store, and outside the grocery store in 80 degree heat he felt the need to put on a jacket as he had the chills.  he went home, went to bed feeling bad, his shoulder was still burning where he got hte vaccin.e  He had a little bit of site pain, applied topical and the pain went away.  He woke up the next morning feeling really bad, felt like a major flu, his head felt like it was going to explode, but no problem with sinuses, no cough, no sneezing.  His eyes were watering from the pain, and chills on and off.  He had to change his sheets a couple of times due to sweating.  He then developed a fever of 99 degrees at about 18:00 that night, and about 19:00 he went to 102 when he checked it.  After that it went to 103, and about 15 minutes after that it was 104, and then higher at 104.&#43;.  He took some vodka, honey and lemon juice and took an alcohol bath and the fever had not broken yet.  He called the clinic and they told him to call 9-1- 1 and to go to the ER.  He went to the ER at about 10:00, gave him fluids, did a chest x-ray and released him about midnight.  He apparently disoriented and tried to walk off and didn&#39;t remember this.  They took him back to the gate and called his son.  He went home, took another bath and woke up in sweat and was in bed for the entire weekend.  He got up Monday morning, 4/13/21 feeling a little bit better and went to see his doctor, who does not believe he was having any side effects and that the information that is being reported is true.   He is still feeling a little weak and still fatigued and on bedrest.  He was taking Advil besides his regular medicines every 6 hours with 500 mg of Tylenol for the intense pain as every joint in his body ached, and the worst headache he had ever had, as well as the high fevers.  His fever subsided on Saturday morning, and still had some sweats following that.  Did have hot/cold flashes on Saturday and Sunday.   He was given a COVID test in the ER and he was negative, but did not give him any other information regarding his lab work.

The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from headache, tiredness, neck ache, rash from knee to feet (red dots), muscle ache, and possible thrombocytopenia, and the outcome of sleepiness was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old male patient was found to have petechiae-like rash on his knees to feet, that according to attending physician could be caused by thrombocytopenia, 2 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient underwent laboratory procedure including platelet count (results not reported).  The patient complained of neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness that he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium) on the day the petechiae-like rash appeared.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information as requested.

Patient reported that he received the Jannsen COVID-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior to admission and symptoms began 8 days later. On the morning of admission the patient also developed pressure-like and pleuritic chest pain.  EKG findings showed ST elevations in V5-V6 with depression in aVL.  D-dimer was found to be elevated however PE evaluation was negative.  Troponins were also found to be elevated. The patient was diagnosed with acute pericarditis and underwent left heart catheterization, selective coronary angiography and left ventriculography. The coronary angiography revealed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease, and left ventriculography revealed normal LV size and function.  Patient was subsequently initiated on colchicine therapy for acute pericarditis. He remains admitted at hospital.

Rush to the hospital and right away the found blood clots on my left leg,  The ER did not check my right leg and two weeks later they found clots on the bottom part of my right leg.  They gave me blood thinner and now Im taking Eliquis twice a day.  Symptoms continue, I have the same pain, I dont see any improvent.  I did went to work yesterday and I realize that I can do any lifting or be sitting down for at least one hour.

He could barely flex the knee, and it became discolored initially dark blue and then yellow which extended halfway up the posterior thigh.  HE was evaluated by various physicians.  Ultimately was diagnosed with hematoma that was aspirated - described as old blood.  Cultures were negative.  Was feeling better afterwards, but noticed more pain in L-calf.  Venous duplex ultrasounds showed no evidence of blood clots.  Patient was referred to infectious diseases to evaluate possible ADE secondary to vaccination.

                                                Starting 10 hours after the injection at 2AM Local ET on Thursday, June 24th,  I began feeling a severe headache, feverish, and fatigue.  I was working a midnight shift so I was awake the whole time.  At about 4AM local (12 hours after injection), I began feeling severe stomach and groin cramps as well. All of these symptoms got worse of the next 24 hours. the fever, headaches, and cramps were at their worse about 18-30 hours after the injection. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep but did not sleep long as the fever was very high in this period. I nearly went into the Emergency room on 25 June.  At this time, I felt a little better, but still very fatigued and having some stomach/groin cramps still at 9PM on Saturday, June 26th.

I have experienced ongoing periodic feelings of sharp needle-type sensations in lower legs.  Starting ~mid-June I have a pain in my right index finger between first and second joint, similar to as though a piece of glass is in my finger.  But when i push on it, i sense there is no foreign object in there.  I sometimes have experienced tingling in my right hand and up my right arm.  I have had intermittent slight headaches.

                                                About 2 days after he received the vaccine he had really bad headaches, which he never gets.  They lasted for about 2 weeks off and on.  Around two or two in a half weeks later he started having adverse pain in his  middle back left side area.  Stated it was a sharp stabbing like pain then it started radiating from his back around his left side up into his chest left side.  Being concerned his doctor ordered a Cath test but everything was  normal. We have been to GI, Cardiologist, his regular doctor, pulumonary and ER and they have done blood work, CT Scans and x-rays and can&#39;t find out why my husband is still having severe sharp pains throughout.  They just keep telling him to try another type of doctor.  He stays in constant pain and states his chest hurts and he has difficulty in breathing from the sharp pains in his chest.  He never had this type of pain until he got that J &amp; J vaccine.  I am wondering if he has developed Guillain-Barre Syndrome because it sounds like some of the same symptoms.  I just want him to stop hurting.

Then my temperature went up to 101.9 degrees F, taken by an electronic touchless digital thermometer. Then, the L Deltoid vaccination site began to feel very sore. As the day went on, I felt increasingly fatigued and exhausted,  and had trouble concentrating.   I felt better the 2nd day after vaccination, but felt intermittent myalgias, increasing L Deltoid soreness, and hot and chilled at the end of the day.  Today, I felt better in the morning, exceptfor persistent L deltoid soreness, and fatigue. This evening, I am feeling cold, tired, and myalgias again.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination I started to experience chronic exhaustion, leg cramping and pain in my lower back right side, upper right thigh, behind my right knee and down into my right calf. I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

                                                I had a small lump appear at or near the site of injection past the 2 week period. My arm was stiff and sore. My spouse massaged my shoulder and the lump seemed to disappear. Arm felt better. The next day the same thing happened. My spouse massaged my arm and it went away again. I haven&#39;t had any other issues beyond that. I&#39;m not completely sure it is related to the vaccine. I was also in the hospital during this time for an unrelated health issue. I had an obstructed bowel that required surgery. My surgeon assured me that they did nothing to my left arm during the surgery and treatment of the bowel obstruction. After a few conversations with the medical staff and my spouse we thought that the arm issue may have been a side effect of the vaccine shot. That&#39;s why I&#39;m submitting this to you now. So far I haven&#39;t experienced anything else at the injection site. My spouse also had the same vaccine at the same time as me. He hasn&#39;t experienced any of the same effects as I have.

                                                DIAGNOSIS: 1. Superficial thrombophlebitis MEDICAL DECISION MAKING/DIFFERENTIAL DX: Differential diagnosis includes DVT, superficial thrombophlebitis, muscle strain, tendinitis. The patient presented to the emergency department with atraumatic left leg pain. An ultrasound reveals a fairly large blood clot in the greater saphenous vein. Although this is a superficial clot, given its extent, I think it warrants anticoagulation. Per the trial, the patient would benefit from 45 days of 10 mg Xarelto treatment. The patient was given good precautions regarding bleeding risk while on a blood thinner. He will schedule follow-up appoint with his primary care doctor. He will also use Tylenol and warm packs to help with the discomfort from the superficial thrombophlebitis. He was discharged in satisfactory condition.

                                                To begin, I have always been a healthy, middle-aged male, with no history at all of neurological problems. What follows is a comprehensive summary of all that happened to me shortly (7 days) after getting the Janssen COVID vaccine and the supporting documentation to support the diagnosis of my having developed Guillian-Barre&#39; Syndrome (GBS) as a direct and obvious consequence of the vaccine.    THURSDAY, 5/13/21: Received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00 AM (LOT NUMBER 205A21A).   FRIDAY - THURSDAY, 5/13 - 5/20/21: No obvious reaction to the vaccine, at all.   FRIDAY, 5/21/21: During the day, I noticed deep-muscle pain/soreness in both shoulders (deltoid muscles) that increased throughout the day. It felt as if I had been doing heavy-weight presses with the resulting soreness.  I attributed it to a delayed reaction from the vaccine (as I&#39;d heard muscle pain, particularly in the shoulders, is a common reaction symptom), as I had no injury or other possible cause and chose to ignore it.  It may have even started a day or two before Friday, but wasn&#39;t of such consequence as for me to recall it; the only vivid memory I have is the discomfort on Friday, 5/21/21.   SATURDAY - SUNDAY, 5/22 - 5/23/21: I had continued shoulder pains, but ignored them because they were not acute and just attributed them to a short-term vaccine reaction.   MONDAY, 5/24/21: In the evening, while sitting in the bleachers attending a sporting event, I noticed my buttocks was pretty sore. The bleachers are not normally comfortable, but this was a dull, serious ache across my entire buttocks. I didn&#39;t know to what to attribute it (not yet at that time associating it with the shoulder pain), so ignored it. In retrospect, I realized later that the soreness I was feeling at that time was similar to the shoulder pain and was the pain felt from a deep numbness across the buttocks, akin to when a body part (hand, foot, etc) &#34;falls asleep&#34; so deeply that it&#39;s numb, but is still very, very sore.  Later that night, my upper back began to feel sore, from shoulder to shoulder, down to my mid-back. As the night progressed, this pain increased exponentially to a &#34;Level 10&#34;, leaving me unable to sleep but in 15-minute increments, wandering the house to find a spot -- sofa, chair, floor, anywhere -- to give me some comfort to sleep; I slept 2 hours, total, that night.  The pain across my back felt equivalent to someone beating me with a baseball bat all over my upper back -- it wasn&#39;t an acute, localized pain, but very deep and broad across the area.  Normally, Aleve quickly resolves any pain issues I have, but overnight, it did nothing to reduce the pain.   TUESDAY, 5/25/21: I began to piggyback Aleve and Extra Strength Tylenol, and that seemed to help abate a little of the most intense pain, but it was still painful and precluded sleep and much of my working.  I think it was at this time that I began to notice the pain and numbness going beyond my buttocks, down the backs of my legs, and into my feet, leaving my feet (and toes, in particular) numb and tingling.  I also began to notice a problem with balance and gross motor controls (stumbling when walking, nearly falling several times in the shower) -- all symptoms I have never experienced in any capacity.  Additionally, I had considerable pain down the backs of my legs, leading me to feel as if my calves and hamstrings had been through a heavy workout the day before and desperately needed stretching -- however, any attempts to do so led to excruciating, stabbing pains in those muscles.  I also noticed that the pain in my upper back was becoming more acute and localized in my cervical vertebrae area. Having taken care of a father who has had many back surgeries and suspecting I have my own degenerative cervical disc issues (I&#39;ve had past neck pains), I began to believe that all the pain and numbness throughout my body might be due to a cervical issue (e.g., bulging disc, stenosis, etc), and so tried to treat the area as such, with hot shower, heating pad, better neck support, etc.  I continued to piggyback the two pain meds that day, but the upper back and neck pain and numbness and gross motor issues came back in full that night, again leaving me no relief for sleep -- I could only doze in 15-minute increments and found no position or place to sleep that was comfortable; I was in tremendous pain  10) across my entire back and down my legs. By 2:00 AM, I knew there was going to be no relief, and I couldn&#39;t wait until the morning; I drove myself to the nearby ER, again still believing/expecting at the time that this was a spinal issue.  In the ER, I was met by a PA who reviewed my situation, determined that cervical imaging was unnecessary, and prescribed Percocet.  My blood pressure was recorded at 160/94. I was released after two hours and returned home.  Despite the meds, I was still in considerable pain that night and found myself unable to sleep in more than 10- to 15-minute increments.   WEDNESDAY, 5/26/21: During the day, the Percocet seemed to abate the pain, somewhat, although it tended to flare up much more at night during the prior 2 nights, anyway.  However, I noticed I had an upset stomach by midday, and as the day progressed, the pain in my abdomen grew considerably. By the evening, the pain across my abdomen was unbearable, as bad as it was in my back and legs. Late in the evening, I researched Percocet and saw that abdominal pain and nausea are two prominent side effects.  I stopped taking the pain medication immediately, knowing that my back pain would return in full through the night; again, I slept in 15-minute increments in considerable back and abdominal pain for a total of about 3 hours.  It was also during the day Wednesday that I noticed considerably worse gross motor skills (e.g., walking, ascending/descending stairs, standing up straight, writing), balance, and increased numbness and tingling in my legs, feet, and hands. At one point, I tried to walk by my daughter in a hallway in the house, and in trying to go around her, I fell against the wall. She thought I was joking; I wasn&#39;t. It happened several more times that week.  Also, this day or the next, I started noticing additional problems with urinating and defecating. It felt as though I had no control over my abdominal muscles, so could not strain or push when going to the bathroom. When trying to have a bowel movement -- and I knew needed to -- I felt as though I had no control to push; when urinating, I had no muscle support for pushing out the urine.   THURSDAY, 5/27/21: Still believing these pain, numbness, and other neurological, problems to be related to cervical vertebrae/disc issues, I had an appointment with a spine orthopedist. He ordered cervical X-Rays and confirmed that I do have disc compression/degeneration, but not excessive and nothing that could explain the pain and numbness persisting all over my back, down to my hands, across my buttocks, and down my legs to my feet. The message: the cervical discs were not the problem.  This is when I reconsidered all I had been through, tying back to the initial pain I felt in my shoulders the prior Friday. This is when I realized that my body had been reacting to the vaccine. Never before in my life had I had neurological problem. Never before had I experienced pain, numbness, and tingling across my entire body that way, so until that moment, I hadn&#39;t considered the vaccine to be a possible vector for all that was going on with me.  The coincidence of these events was FAR too great to be anything but a causal relationship. The likelihood of these symptoms arising on their own is infinitesimal in comparison to a causal effect. The vaccine had triggered a serious and painful neurological response in my body.  The orthopedist, knowing I had responded poorly to the Percocet, prescribed oxycodone. I took that pain medicine that day and into the evening, but once again, my stomach and abdomen began to bother me and the abdominal pain returned. Once again, I looked at the side effects of the medicine, and the first two I saw were stomach pain and nausea. I stopped taking the pain medicine immediately. That night, I slept a total of 2.5 hours.   FRIDAY, 5/28/21: I was still in considerable pain, and that combined with very little sleep (and none of it good) for 4 days led me to having trouble thinking clearly. My wife insisted I needed to go back to the ER in the morning to see what could be going on. My blood pressure upon being seen was initially approximately 185/140, but what was finally recorded after a second test was 191/112. I waited to be seen for about 2 hours, but I finally met with the ER physician and described my history of problems that week, including my then-belief that this was a vaccine reaction. She ordered full bloodwork, chest X-Ray and CT scans (without contrast) of lumbar and thoracic spine and CT scan with contrast of chest/abdomen. Nothing strikingly abnormal was found in these scans, but doctors (ER physician and neurologist) noted bliteral weakness in lower and upper body. The doctors wanted to order MRIs, but I am unable to have an MRI due to a piece of metal in my left eye. The morphine I was administered helped reduce my pain and my blood pressure upon leaving had abated, somewhat (don&#39;t recall my final BP). Both doctors seemed not to believe that these symptoms could be the result of an adverse vaccine reaction, but they were unable to explain a cause. On my inquiry, at my friend&#39;s recommendation I ask to verify, the neurologist disagreed that these were symptoms of a presentation of Guillian-Barre&#39; Syndrome (GBS). The ER doctor asked if I was interested in being admitted, but I felt some of my more extreme symptoms (blood pressure and pain -- thanks to the morphine) had abated sufficiently to allow me to leave. After 8 hours in the ER, I left and returned home.  My numbness, tingling, some pain, balance, and motor skills issues persisted, but were blunted somewhat (probably from the morphine?). It was either this day or the next, that I was standing outside, and knowing I had problems walking and with balance, I decided to try to run a few steps to see how weak my legs were and bad my motor skills and balance were. Immediately, it was clear that things were worse than I had considered. I had very poor control of my legs -- they flew off to the sides, out of control, as I tried to step; I stumbled a couple times and almost fell; and I couldn&#39;t proceed in a straight line, veering off at an angle. I earnestly tried several times, with the same results each time.  That night, while the pain was still there, it was tolerable enough that I was able to sleep for a total of about 5 hours.   SATURDAY, 5/29/21: Early in the AM, I noticed I was unable to smile. Having a friend who had had Bell&#39;s Palsy, I recognized the signs immediately. The left side of my face sagged, I was unable to smile (left side of my mouth sagged), and I was unable to close my left eye. My wife took me to the ER, and we were met by the same ER physician who had seen me the day before. She was shocked about my return so soon after my prior visit. My blood pressure, on being admitted, was 151/102, but as with my other visits, asymptomatic other than the problems described before (pain, numbness, and tingling, in my back, arms, legs, and abdomen; gross motor movement; lack of coordination; and lack of clarity in thinking); no other signs of infection or illness. The Dr ordered a CT scan (without contrast) of my head and other bloodwork. Of note, the CK came back at 712 U/L. The CT scan came back normal. Again, I was administered morphine, which abated my pain and allowed me to relax. After 3 hours, I was released, with prescriptions for Amlodipine for the high blood pressure and Prednisone and Valtrex (Valacyclovir) for the Bell&#39;s Palsy.  The morphine helped reduce my back and abdominal pain and give me some comfort, such that I could sleep another 5 hours that night, although all other symptoms persisted.   SUNDAY - WEDNESDAY, 5/30/21 - 6/2/21: I continued to experience the numbness and tingling in my back (primarily), abdomen, legs/feet, and arms/hands, but my severe pain began to abate, such that I could sleep a bit more easily. I taped my eye shut at night, as my Bell&#39;s Palsy eyelid would not close fully, and it teared constantly.   WEDNESDAY, 6/2/21: Not having a GP, I finally found an Internist to review my case and symptoms, but primarily to extend my meds (Blood Pressure and antiviral and steroid for the Bell&#39;s Palsy), as the ER doctor had only given me a 5-day prescription. The doctor review my situation and continued the meds. Having been prompted regularly by my friend to confirm a GBS diagnosis, I asked this doctor about a possible GBS-vaccine link and after a cursory review, he said he did not think so.   THURSDAY, 6/3/21: With the weakness in my left eyelid, my desire to find a resolution to it, and my concerns about its effect on my vision, I had an appointment with my opthamologist, who recommended eye drops until the eye improved and instructed me to stop taping the eye shut. She noted no other problems with my vision.   FRIDAY - MONDAY, 6/4/21 - 6/7/21: During this time, the medicines for my Bell&#39;s Palsy seemed to take effect, and the paralysis symptoms abated mostly (with some residual weakness in my left eyelid).  I continued to experience the other neurological symptoms, however.   TUESDAY, 6/8/21: Having been unable to get a timely appointment with a trusted neurologist, a friend with a contact at medical school head of neurology was able to get me an appointment with a neurology faculty member. I met with Dr. that afternoon, and he was the first to really listen to the symptoms I had and understand some of the possible triggers and consequences of them. I started the conversation explaining that I&#39;m a reasonable, rational, and science-based person, an engineer by training and career, and that I firmly believed all the symptoms I was presenting were a direct consequence of my getting the vaccine.  Additionally, at my friend&#39;s continued urging, I asked if these symptoms could point to a Guillian-Barre&#39; diagnosis.  He was at first skeptical of my proposition of the vaccine cause, but was quick to say he was glad I had raised the question of GBS, because he had that diagnosis in mind, as I discussed my symptoms.  He believed that the symptoms I had and the way and speed with which they had progressed pointed to a likely GBS diagnosis.  He scheduled a follow-on appointment to have an Electromyogram (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Study to assess the extent of the neurological damage and prognosis for resolution, as I am unable to get an MRI and he seemed to feel a lumbar puncture was unnecessary.    FRIDAY, 6/11/21: I had my scheduled EMG and Nerve Conduction Study with Dr. The results showed some abnormal neuropathy, but mostly normal in my extremities and indicative of some recovery from symptoms. Although I still had considerable numbness, tingling, and some pain down my legs into my feet and down my arms into my hands, my most prevalent issues at that point were numbness and tingling across my entire upper back and abdomen, but the doctor indicated these tests don&#39;t identify issues very well, that they are better designed for testing neurological issues in the extremities. We agreed to reconvene over the phone in several weeks, unless problems worsened.   TUESDAY, 6/29/21:   During a follow-up appointment with the doctor, I indicated that some of my neurological issues were abating and that my blood pressure had returned to near-normal range.  My energy was returning to a degree and my motor skills and balance and control had improved.  However, I continued to have significant numbness and tingling across my back and abdomen, and of greater concern, I had increasing tingling and pain going down my left arm to my index finger when I stretched out my arm.  This was a new symptom and increased in pain in frequency in the following days and raises the question of what other symptoms might arise.    AS OF 7/8/21:  CURRENT STATUS: I have continued numbness and tingling in my feet and hands and back and abdomen, although they are reduced from their earlier state. However, I have increased shooting pain in my left index finger when stretching out my left arm. Additionally, I have a mild increase in weakness in my left eyelid, after prior improvement from the Bell&#39;s Palsy. My dangerously high blood pressure at the early onset of these symptoms has returned to near-normal levels, although my GP continues to keep on blood pressure medicine (Amlodopine) for now. Finally, a lot of the issues I had thinking clearly and regularly making mental mistakes, all noticeable and commented on by my family, have lessened, although I still find myself making mental mistakes and forgetting information that would have been MUCH less likely prior to this adverse GBS event caused by the J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                in mid-June 2021 I started experiencing pain in my feet.  They started swelling and feeling tingly... almost like they had fallen asleep.  Minor tingling also started occurring in my hands.  On certain days the discomfort in my feet was enough to limit my walking.  I noticed on certain days my shoes fit tightly and my calfs were very tight with the ankles showing signs of swelling.  The symptoms continue through the date of this filing...sometimes better/sometimes worse.

I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

At night I had a mild fever, chills, body aches (everywhere) unbearable headache (still going on 24 hours after the shot), pain at the vaccination site (left shoulder, still strong after 24 hours), pain in the lungs (I sneezed a couple of times).  I took Tylenol every 4 hours, but did not improve, only brought the fever down a bit.  Today after 24 hours, I still have headache, muscular aches, and fatigue.

                                                I shortly after the shot I having had random pains in arm, including joints [like when the pressure changes ... don&#39;t think I have arthritis]) but they only lasted a few minutes and then would go away.  About 10 hours later I started feeling sick.  One of the first things I noticed besides a headache was my heart rate jumped up to over 100 beats per minute (it is normally below 84).  I started getting chills and fever.  It was worse than any flu fever I ever had and I could not sleep.  Worst part was my heart rate would not go down, remaining above 100 but below 110-115 beats per minute.  I considered calling 911 but after looking online decided not to as long as it remained below 120 bpm.  I don&#39;t know my maximum temperature - I did not think to take it until after the peak had passed by 20 minutes or so (was 99.4 at that point - normal temperature runs 97.2 (low 96.8, high 98.2)).  Heart rate finally started to drop around 3:30 am.

                                                Day one was headache as expected and right arm pain. Day two I had bad headache (9) joint pain in my shoulder and hips, loud ringing ears. shortness of breathe, left lung pain. This repeated for three days so I tested by BP and found it to be 160/130. Past day 3 I started with adrenaline spikes where heart would race up and I felt like hulk and blood pressure spikes out of the random. 5/24/21, I saw my family doctor and since my BP was so random high and then low she did not want to give me meds since it could drops too low at time. For my difficulty breathing and lung pain she gave me an prescription inhaler. As of today I still have the ringing left ear, shoulder joint pain like a pin stuck in it and unable to raise over my head without using my left arm to support, high BP on average 140/132. 167/151, 126/89, 122/91,110/87, 126/84 are some examples. These at the lowest is 10&#43; point higher than my normal range of 120s over 70s. Headache continues but may be due to the higher than normal BP.

                                                I started to suffer from a numbness in my left hand that radiated into a deep pain and increasingly became intense. That pain radiated up to my shoulder and into the left quadrant of my chest. I started experiencing shortness of breath and a hypersensitivity to the heat. I went to Hospital ER and they ran a bunch of tests. I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my arm. I was given Eliquis. I was on that medication for about 2 weeks and after my second week of being on Eliquis, I started to suffer from the same symptoms. I decided to go to the Hospital. When I went there they admitted me and ran through blood tests to check for a heart attack or stroke or anything relating to the pain I was experiencing. Now I am back home and I am still taking Eliquis. As of today, I am still experiencing the symptoms. The symptoms are mild, but it&#39;s still scary. I would like to add that I have had an increase in dietary intolerance.

                                                woke up on June 29, 2021, with the worst back pain ever. email the doctor but he was not there this week. Emailed back on 6.30.2021 and still waiting on the doctor to return. The VA sent me to urgent care for help. They gave me a shot for the pain and prednisone for the inflation on the nerve. They said it was the sciatic nerve going the Peroneal nerve. This didn&#39;t help.  I contacted the VA on July 2 2021 and they mail out more prednisone. Emailed VA July 7 2021 Told them the perinsone wasn&#39;t working and they moved me to tramadol 10mg and lidoderm patches. Contact Va on July8 July 12 July13 still the same

                                                two weeks after shot I starting having pain in my right shoulder.  thought I over worked it, but week by week it continue to get worse.  To the point that it wakes me up 4-5 times a night.  While on vacation it hit a tipping point in pain and my pinky finger and ring finger started going numb on my hand.  I started to research and thought it might be a nerve issue... from top of shoulder blade to my fingers I get pain.  Pain to the point I have a hard time moving my arm in certain directions.  two day prior to returning from vacation I called the doctor to have it checked out. On July 12th I saw my doctor (knowing nothing about J&amp;J) and he thought I just needed a steroid shot for inflammation and was given the shot.  watching news  I heard about these nerve issue with J&amp;J, men over 50 and everything they were saying fit me perfect.  The next day I followed up with my doctor (Put a call into him) and a nurse called me back and informed me it probably had nothing to do with the J&amp;J shot.    I called the location that gave me the shot and they recommend that I complete this from.  Today, 7/17/21 I am still in pain with numbness in my fingers.

                                                I developed a high pitch ringing in the ears the morning after the vaccine.  It was noticed when I woke up.  I did have a low fever, high chills, and significant neck muscle &#34;cramping&#34; during the night when this reaction developed.  The ringing (Tinnitus) is pretty loud and bothersome.  The volume has not changed since the day after my vaccine shot (two weeks now).

She said my face was drooping, I couldn&#39;t smile or stand.  She called Ambulance.  Ambulance arrived and decided symptoms of stroke and called for helicopter to take me to medical center.   When I arrived they did CT and I was later told it showed possible areas of no oxygen to brain.  They gave me TPA drug and almost immediately  I could see improvement - my headache cleared.  Throughout the next couple hours I regained movement on right side and all functionality returned except weakness in right arm.  I stayed in ICU for 24 hours as required after receiving TPA and while additional tests were ran then was discharged on Friday, April 16, 2021

The joint of my big toe became very swollen and red, painful to the touch and the rest of the front part of my foot also became swollen.  It was difficult to walk or even put pressure on it for 5 days and I treated it with ice, elevation and 600 mg ibuprofen 3X/day.  Symptoms are starting to resolve , but the joint is still swollen and red, though the pain is subsiding.  I am able to walk with a normal gait, though there is still stiffness and some pain.

Yesterday, however, I started to have a bad headache at 4 a.m., then felt generally more ill to a level of almost incapacity by evening - bad headache, general weakness, dizziness, some muscle pain, bad nausea. Used Aleve and Ibuprofen and by 11pm started to feel normal again.  By the next morning, I felt fine - tired like I just got over something, but fine.  Not sure it was injection related, but wanted to share.

                                                Fevers started on Wednesday evening, April 14th. Over the next three to four days, the fevers and chills continuously got worse. Patient experienced fatigue, congestion, headaches, sore throat, body aches, neck pain. Conducted a televisit on Sunday, April 18th, and then went into the doctor on Monday, April 19th. The day of the doctor appointment, the patient could not get out of bed and could not stand for longer than 15 minutes at a time before extreme fatigue set in. Blood tests were taken at the doctor, a Z-pack was prescribed. The evening of the 19th, the doctor called after hour to send patient to emergency room to be admitted to hospital. Patient went immediately to Medical Center at which point, the patient was admitted for the next 19 days. The patient was released from the hospital on Saturday, May 8th. While in the hospital, the patient saw almost every &#34;category&#34; of doctor possible. Patient experienced fevers every night for 15 days straight, and after release from the hospital and &#34;fever free for 4-5 days, experienced fevers again for the next week. Doctors were unable for the first two and a half weeks of hospitalization to draw a conclusion about what was the cause of the sepsis (systemic). Patient received daily blood tests, MRIs, CAT scans, spinal tap, bone marrow biopsy, echocardiogram, etc. Patient spent the first two and a half weeks on an antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral.  The &#34;final&#34; diagnosis, which is still not confirmed, as histoplasmosis, which per the doctor would not have placed the patient in the hospital. Determined the fevers were officially &#34;fevers of unknown origin&#34; with a diagnosis of MIS-A and a vaccine contributing factor. Medication put patient in kidney failure and did not address the fevers (patient had fevers of 103&#43; for 25&#43; days in a row).  On May 27th, doctors are conducing new fungal tests and patient is discontinuing antifungal medication because of severe liver damage.  Patient was not and is not in a situation where histoplasmosis is a logical conclusion based on the patient&#39;s daily activities.

He had noted BLE weakness during his admission and noted worsening of his weakness following his discharge. He returned to the ER on 7/8 but left AMA. He presented to ER on 7/9 with right arm and BLE weakness and MRI showed numerous small acute ischemic foci bilaterally. CTA was negative for significant stenosis or occlusion. He was evaluated by Neurology and felt that there was a high likelihood of cardioembolism as the etiology of his strokes vs cocaine. They recommended cardiac monitoring for evidence of afib as well as DAPT x 21 days followed by ASA monotherapy. He was noted to have an elevated troponin on admission and was placed on a Heparin drip. Cardiology did not feel that repeat cardiac cath was warranted. An Echo with bubble study was performed and showed EF 45-50%, diffuse hypokinesia, mild DD and no evidence of shunting. He has been accepted at hospital with plan for transfer there today.

After 48 hours from injection, headache is 90% improved. Took Advil, but that did nothing for headache.  It was the worst headache that I can ever remember having.  Extreme muscle pain in various parts of the body started at same time as onset of headache. This, too, died out as the headache got better.  Slight nausea on day #2.  No fever. Was steady at 96.6 throughout these adverse reactions.

                                                Patient started complaining of extreme back pain and trouble walking within days after receiving the vaccine. His pain got increasingly worse. On the 23rd he had to be taken into the hospital in an ambulance. He said he felt as if his lower body was separated from his torso, and visible was having trouble walking. They prescribed him Valium, preformed an x-ray, and sent him home.  On the 27th he was taken back to the hospital due to leg weakness, tingling in his hands and feet, and extreme pain. He was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. He passed away April 6, 2021 after spending 11 days in the hospital, and 6 days on a ventilator.

                                                First 4 hours post injection no serious side effects, slight headache was settling in.  At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

                                                Five weeks (05/16/2021) after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, my left leg just started feeling numb. I went into my kitchen and all of a sudden I started feeling dizzy. I lost all strength in my legs and in my left arm. I really couldn&#39;t move my arms or my legs and I felt really light headed. I had to have my 5 year old boys get me some water to drink. My son noticed that my heart was beating really strong and really fast. I saw water boiling over in the pot on the stove and I couldn&#39;t even get out of a chair to turn it off. I couldn&#39;t stand up. I finally managed to go back by my bed from the chair and slowly moved around. I tried holding my phone and it dropped out of my hands a couple of times because I couldn&#39;t hold it. A couple hours later, I felt a little better, but I had to fight to get around. We fell asleep and when I woke up, I still felt bad. I took my children to school and told them that I was going to the hospital to get checked out. At the hospital they performed multiple tests and they back showing I had stroke. I was treated for suffering from a stroke.

                                                My joints started to hurt and I became less flexible/mobile to the extend that I started walking with my cane and experienced difficulty getting up from a seated position. My Doctor did a a steroid injection in my back but it did not work. I took a couple of pain killers and some muscles relaxers when I could not bare the pain which also did not work (even tried using my conversion table and that did not work and then the pain went away on its own). My doctor passively agreed with me that my pain could have been caused by the vaccine since I suffer from chronic pain and it may have been an autoimmune surge in my system.

                                                24 hours after getting the vaccine I started feeling sleepy and groggy. 48 hours after the vaccine I felt very groggy and off balance, like I was half asleep or had been drugged with a sedative. I also had low energy and exerting myself (with long walks, etc) made me feel wiped out and exhausted . After one week I started to feel better, but still felt slightly groggy and off balance, like I was drugged with a mild sedative. Now on July 1 -- one full month since getting the vaccine -- I still feel slightly groggy and off balance, no matter how much sleep or rest I get. I also still have lower than normal energy and muscle soreness. The grogginess and off balance is most noticeable when walking or moving my head quickly.

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after the injection, while sitting down, I felt light headed, sweating, weak, face turned white. I was close to passing out but didn&#39;t. I requested attention after about 10 minutes. While being treated by medics they mentioned color had returned to my face. I felt better enough so I refused to go to hospital and was driven home. Later that morning, 03/08/2021 about 10 AM, I developed a fever and body aches with sharp pains thru out my body and joints. First temperature check was 100.5. My fever, pains/weakness increased thru out that day and overnight with chills. Highest temp check was 102.8 that evening prior to bedtime. I don&#39;t know if it could have been higher at some point overnight. It felt like I had a moderate to bad case of the FLU. The next morning, 03/09/2021 the fever broke down to about 101. By 03/11/2021, aside from a little residual weakness I felt more like myself. However, as of the writing of this report my temp seems to fluctuate between normal and 99.8. Will report this to my Doctor on next visit. Worth noting that I haven&#39;t had any Flu like symptoms to that degree in many years.

Around 9:00pm started to feel chills and tired with low grade fever (100 C). Around 1:30am started feeling right side back pain in my kidney area that woke me up. By 2:15am the pain was almost unbearable, and I could no longer lay in bed. At 3:00am I took 2x 500mg Tylenol as I debated whether to call my doctor or go straight to ER. By the 3:45am pain was subsiding and was I able to get back in bed by 4am. Today no pain.

Intense muscle aches were later (approx 6-8 hrs after shot) along with overall fatigue.  A medium grade headache began 8-10 hrs after shot and continued throughout night - lowering to a slight headache within 24 hrs after shot.  Headache ended 28-30 hrs after shot.  Developed a post nasal drip and mild congestion in sinuses about 1.5 days after shot (and continues).  Numbness in toes appears to have returned with some stiffness felt in my calf muscles.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced left hip and joint pain. I could not lift my left leg up. The next morning after my J&amp;J vaccine, my left leg started hurting more and I could not ambulate. My left hip was hurting so bad I could not sleep at night. I went to the doctor 03-17-2021 to get monitored and he said it could be arthritis. I was prescribed by Dr.  cyclobenzaprine 10mg and naproxen 500mg. I feel that my pain is inside the joint, hip pain region and to this day, I still have sleeping problems due to my pain in my left leg and left hip pain since the J&amp;J vaccine. I will have a  follow up with Dr. in the coming weeks.

Approximately 36 hours after injection dizziness. 48 hours after injection neck and head pain on left side, arm soreness, and swollen lymph node on left side of throat. Minor pain in mouth and throat with fatigue and dizziness. Neck and head pain decreasing on day 3 with all other effects resolving but injection site is still fairly sore. Overall, I would say this was probably a normal response associated with my immune system reacting to the injection. I had the virus the first week of December 2020. I would classify my infection as moderate. I was sick with fever, chills and severe body aches and it lasted for 10-14 days.

                                                Pain in left upper arm about 10 days after injection, shooting down arm to hand, reduced mobility of the arm, didn&#39;t improve for 3 weeks thus saw my own doctor. She referred to orthopaedic doctor. Saw him on 5/12/2021, he diagnosed adhesive capsulitis in left shoulder possibly caused or exacerbated by the swelling due to the vaccination in that same area. Revisit in 3 weeks after dr. visit. Taking ibuprofen to reduce inflammation.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included pollen allergy, alcohol user (not often), and non-smoker, and he had no chronic medical history. He did not have any drug abuse/illicit drug use.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 203A21A, and expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 09-APR-2021 on left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. After vaccination on 10-APR-2021 (Saturday), he was feeling bad and 11-APR-2021 (Sunday) and 8 days later went to the hospital. He did a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) covid-19 test at the hospital on 16-April-2021 and result was positive. He went back home but on 28-APR-2021, because his oxygen levels dropped and had trouble breathing. He was ventilated for 18 days. He was hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia (pneumonia, feeling bad and lost 45 pounds) for 36 days. He was discharged from hospital on 03-JUN-2021. On an unspecified date, he was not able to walk. He had home therapy and nursing therapy to be able to walk again and he lost 45 pounds. Since unspecified date, he could not work for 3 months.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from covid-19 pneumonia on 03-JUN-2021, and dependence on ventilator, and could not work, and had not recovered from not able to walk. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening). This report was associated with product quality complaint: 90000182426. The suspected product quality complaint has been confirmed to be not voided. The patient received the vaccine on 09-APR-2021 and had a positive Covid-19 test on 16-APR-2021 with 7 days elapsed between vaccination and test. There was not sufficient time elapsed for the patient to achieve immunity; therefore this report was not considered a lack of effect for Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: 20210622074-covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2. s-Covid 19 Pneumonia, Dependence on Ventilator.

                                                This is a 59 year old male that presented to the emergency department at approximately 1447 on 04/27/2021 with sudden onset of left upper and lower extremity weakness and left-sided numbness of his face. The patient stated he may have had some weakness the previous night (04/26/2021), but mostly noticed it when he woke up around 0900 on 04/27/2021. The patient stated he may have also had some transient speech changes which he felt were improved upon emergency department presentation. The patient stated he took an 81 mg aspirin prior to hospital arrival. The patient was overall hemodynamically stable in the emergency department. Past medical history is only significant for benign prostatic hyperplasia. This patient has no history of previous CVA or TIA, no smoking history, no history of clotting disorders, no recent trauma or other injury. CT head revealed a small right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage with no midline shift and concern for clot. CTA head and neck perfusion study was significant for ?perfusion abnormality involving the right frontal lobe in the region of known subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely related to dural venous sinus thrombosis involving the posterior aspect of the superior sagittal sinus, left greater than right transverse sinus, and left sigmoid sinus.? This patient is noted to have recently received his Johnson and Johnson vaccine on 03/20/2021. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Neurology and hematology were consulted.

                                                Without having taken any pain relievers directly before or after the vaccination, my temperature began to rise yesterday morning into afternoon from 97.1 up to 101.1.  At 3:00 p.m. it began descending to 100.3.  However, at 6:00 p.m. it quickly jumped up to 101.7.  At this time, I took two Tylenol 500 mg caplets, which broke the fever.  It was at 101.0 when I went to bed last night at 9:30 p.m. and was at 98.5 when I awoke at 5:00 a.m.  Also, since I have had Covid-19 (beginning the morning of November 19th), I have had significant shoulder and knee pain; acupuncture helped alleviate the shoulder pain and shots from a doctor last week helped the knee pain.  However, yesterday the pains returned in full force until I took the Tylenol; they are back to being detectable (and mild) as of this morning.

Prostate bx reveals benign nodular hyperplasia, bladder bx revealed urothelial dysplasia felt to be pre neoplastic. Urine Cytology from 4/14/21 negative for high grade urothelial cardinoma. with pamidronate treatment, lasix and ivf and calcitonin his hypercalcemia improved and he was discharged to follow up with oncology and urology as out pt.  He has since been readmitted on 6/22/21 with recurrent hypercalcemia and progressive decline.   biopsy with I.R. of left renal mass confirmed RCC, biopsy of LN was non-diagnostic.  per urology: Given the small size of the renal mass, it would be surprising if this was truly metastatic RCC,   this could be metastatic urothelial carcinoma given his history of high grade T1 disease, although the primary site and the urinary tract has presumably been eradicated of disease, metastatic disease prior to initial tumor eradication in the bladder remains a possibility.

Hands &#34;fall asleep&#34; occasionally, but this time it did not resolve, resulting in weakness in hand and arm that have only partially recovered in the weeks following.  Unable to use left hand since onset to use most tools, turn a valve, etc.  Uncertain at this point whether full recovery is possible, but progress seems to be stalled at perhaps 50%-75% capacity.  Icing helps with pain, along with regular acetaminophen and occasional ibuprofen.  Exercise (including ulnar nerve &#34;flossing&#34;) helps with recovery but has plateaued.
