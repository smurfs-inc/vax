                                                Experienced moderate debilitating flu symptoms day after vaccination and recovered the following day.  Over one week later (3/25) developed skin sensitivity on the neck which later spread to back, torso, and legs.  Skin sensitivity persists still one week after onset, is a severe chafing feeling when skin comes into contact with clothing.  No rash or any visual signs.  Along with the skin sensitivity, mild to moderate chills from day to day as well as muscle fatigue and upper/lower back pain.  Symptoms varied in severity day to day; used ibuprofen and it seemed to offer limited, temporary relief.  Concurrent with second onset of symptoms, noticed gradual abdominal inflammation and developed sensation similar to UTI but urine dip and lab test results were all normal.  Doctor concluded immune reaction to vaccine as no other allergies or changes in routine as well as no prior medical history of any of these symptoms. Prescribed daily prednisone for three days to calm immune response; after one day symptoms were greatly improved.  Abdominal inflammation has improved and UTI sensation improved.  Still experiencing slight chills and skin sensitivity unchanged.

                                                I got a cough two weeks after my vaccine. It&#39;s a dry cough that is constant and hard to control. I tried taking cold and flu medicine before bed so that I could sleep. I developed a cough and I damaged my ribs as a result of the coughing. My ribs on the right side hurt when I cough. I was prescribed a cough suppressant Benzonatate 100. I also got a steroid and the cough has gotten better after six weeks. It is still present but seems to be happening less often.

                                                Pain in chest and back began on Wednesday 4/14.  What started out feeling like an uncomfortable pulled muscle in my back/chest area on Wednesday escalated rapidly to very sharp stabbing pains in my chest and back by Thursday afternoon 4/15.  After discussing my symptoms with the office of my PCP Thursday afternoon, I was told to go to the Emergency Room for evaluation.  I checked into the ER at approx 6pm that Thursday evening on 4/15.  While there I underwent a blood test, EKG and a chest Xray.  Upon evaluating the results of each test the Dr on assignment stated that there were no problems with major organs but could not diagnose.    Small red marks began developing on the right side of my chest that same day and progressively expanded in quantity across the right side of my chest and back.  A follow-up visit with my PCP was completed on Tuesday 4/20 and the diagnosis of Shingles was confirmed.  Pain has not subsided and has only gotten worse as of 4/21.  Prescription treatments began the evening of 4/20.

At about 10:30pm I started feeling sick, fever of 99.6, muscle and joint pain, chills, dizziness, weakness. Left arm where I got injected also felt like it was falling asleep at some point when it shouldn&#39;t have been based on how I was positioned. I finally took an ibuprofen so I could sleep around 2:30am, and felt better a couple hours later or so. Today so far I feel fine but my resting heart rate is about 30 beats higher than normal so I&#39;m still responding to vaccine.  I think overall my symptoms aren&#39;t out of the ordinary, just way stronger than I was expecting. I felt miserable.

About ten minutes after getting the vaccine, while sitting in a chair, I began to get tunnel vision and felt extremely tired. I broke out in a cold sweat all over my body. I began to lose my vision like I was fainting and I momentarily blacked out or dozed off, then came back awake. I started to get tunnel vision again for a minute, then it faded away. Then I continued sweating for a minute and then it faded away. After a couple minutes I felt fine again. I sat for another several minutes then left at 1:15 feeling ok with just a sore shoulder.

I woke up again in a few hours with worse chills, minor headache, and minor joint pain. I took over the counter medication, felt a little better and went back to sleep after a few hours. I woke up around 4am to use the bathroom and still had the worse chills, sweats, minor headache and was very dizzy. I decided to lay down on a rug rather than try to make it back to my bed and laid awake for a few hours again I woke up again in a few hours a little better and repeated everything until Sunday night when all my symptoms were very mild. I eat and drank water regularly and took over the counter acetaminophen a few times.

                                                Around 8pm I became very cold and tired. I took a bath, which is out of character, and tried to sleep. By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

                                                After the initial 12 hour period, I experienced night-time chills followed then by being too warm and night sweats.  This happened both the first and second night.  During the day I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours for aches and pain.  Mainly my neck and back have been what hurts, although my knees, elbows, hips, etc. also were achy.  The third and fourth days I still continued to have chills, no fever throughout as far as I am aware (took my temp 2-3 times).  The fourth day I was very faint and somewhat unbalanced, felt shaky and light headed and I ended up having an anxiety attack.  I mention the last symptom as I have never had an episode like this previously in my life.  Today is day 5, still feel tired, slightly nauseous, neck and back pain, headache, difficulty focusing.

Shortly after these symptoms I begin to have uncontrollable chills followed by a fever and Nausea. The whole time starting around 8pm I had pretty bad muscle aches as well. I took a warm shower and bundled up the whole night because I had a fever, aches, chills, and nausea. It was impossible to sleep because of this and sometimes my heart was beating fast as well. The next morning I had a headache that would not go away until I took Tylenol. The whole next day I felt exhausted as well and very weak. I began to feel better on day 3 but still feel somewhat foggy from the shot. I would not recommend this vaccine to anyone and would never get it again and hopefully the foggy sensation goes away.

                                                On 4/10 I started feeling tired with muscle aches.  A few days later my skin started to hurt.  Clothing was uncomfortable when it moved across my skin. Those symptoms lasted about a week. Then as they started to lessen I had some back pain (Sciatic) and a sore throat.  Also the muscles behind my eyes were slightly painful and bright lights were uncomfortable.  Then about  4/21 most of the symptoms reduced and I was feeling close to normal.  Then on 4/22 I was brushing my teeth and noticed that I couldn?t spit water like normal.  I called my GP doc and she recommended I head to the ER.   After thinking about it I also remember on 4/21 while drinking something I had some water squirt out of my lips.  At the time I thought I was just being clumsy but in hindsight the muscle weakness in my face started on 4/20.   I checked into the ER on 4/22.  When I checked into the hospital my facial weakness was very difficult to notice.  By the evening of 4/22 it was noticeable if I tried to ?show my teeth? or make a big smile. By the morning of 4/23 it was very noticeable.  The morning of 4/24 I couldn?t move my lips, nose or eyebrows.  My tongue, jaw and throat were not impacted at all.   I was started on plasmapheresis on  4/24. I had another treatment on 4/25. I noticed facial weakness was very slightly recovering the evening of 4/25.  By 4/27 my facial weakness is still healing with noticeable improvement day to day.

There was muscle soreness, fatigue, my pulse was above 80 all night and reached 100 during the peak of the fever.  By the next morning, the fever had dropped to 100, fatigue remained and a slight headache appeared.  The headache was gone by noon, the fatigue remained all day.  The evening after the injection, a slight fever returned and then stopped.  Two days after the injection, there were no further averse reactions other than slight soreness in the injection site.  I am no longer fatigued and feel fine.  Hope this information helps.

(4) Muscle aches 2 days (previously injured muscles/joints became very sore 1-2 day after injection [left hip, right foot, left quad, lower back] - believe tylenol reduced inflammation) --symptoms ended 3-4 days after injection; slight fatigue remains 7 days later.

                                                I received the shot on 4/10. First 24 hours I had a slight fever and headache. Treated with Acetaninophhen. Since that time, I had relatively mild symptoms 4/11 - 4/13. Mostly fatigue.  On 4/14, I had a sudden increase in heart rate, dizziness, tingling sensation in all arms and legs and weakness in my limbs/grip. This prompted me to visit the ER. They ran numerous blood tests amd scans on me but found no abnormalities. Various unusual symptoms have continued to persist since 4/14.  For brief moments I feel fine.  At other times I have experience fatigue, diziness/vertigo, rapid heart rate, pins and needles feeling in my left hand and left leg.  Left leg numbness/tightness and heaviness. The fingers on my left hand sometimes move involuntarily.  And my anxiety has also gone up during this time. Tonight it has migratee to my left foot, where I have numbness in several of my toes.  I&#39;m looking for advice. Should I be concerned? Should these symptoms still be occurring 11 days after receiving my shot?  It has been very distressing and there seem to be very few people who have knowledge on this subject.  My care providers keep saying to self monitor and contact them if symptoms worsen. The problem is symptoms don&#39;t necessarily worsen, they just migrate from one area of my body to another.  The numbness comes and goes in maybe 1-2 hour intervals.

Immediately sat back down to place my head between my knees, and completely blacked out, fallout out of the chair and hitting my head and knee on the floor and  nearby fixtures. Regained consciousness on floor about 30 seconds after fainting and immediately felt much better. Pharmacy staff were on hand and promptly called 911, instructed me not to move and took my pulse and monitored me until EMS arrived within 5-10 minutes. Vital signs normal including BP 120/90, 100% o2 levels, normal blood sugar and EKG. EMS assisted in getting me back to seated position and monitored for another 10-15 minutes. Declined transport and had family member drive me home where I rested for a few hours and woke up feeling fine. Very minor bruising / bump on head with no lasting sign of concussion or other trauma. 24&#43; hours post vaccine no other notable vaccine reactions aside from sore arm / muscles on injection site.

                                                I felt fine all day and went to bed at 9:30pm. I woke up to my body shaking uncontrollably and I was freezing at 10:30pm. My wife felt my skin and she said I was burning up. Unfortunately our thermometer wasn&#39;t working so I don&#39;t know my temperature, but I have never in my life shaken so badly with a fever. I couldn&#39;t control myself and I was shaking so hard that my muscles were sore from it, but I still couldn&#39;t stop. I then began vomiting every 45 minutes or so. This happened for nearly 4 hours until 2:18am. Then very suddenly everything just stopped. No more feeling cold (actually I then felt very warm and couldn&#39;t cool off. I was sweating quite a bit). No more shaking. No more vomiting. I did get a wicked headache, but I figured it was due to dehydration and took two Advil. The Advil didn&#39;t do anything and I was awake until 5:59am because my head hurt too badly to sleep. Finally I slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I just felt worn out for most of the day on the 10th, and couldn&#39;t shake the headache. Then on the evening if the 10th, I started getting a sore throat and a slightly runny nose. I went to bed that way. When I woke up on the 11th (today) I still had the sore throat and slight runny nose. The headache was gone, but I felt tightness in my chest. As I went throughout the day, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m short of breath with doing most things. I have two young children, so even taking care of them I feel like at times I&#39;m struggling for breath. I&#39;m not in bad shape and am a runner, so my cardio isn&#39;t bad. So I was surprised by this.

Within 1-2 hours had runny nose and felt stuffed up, thought it could be allergies or something and didn?t really attribute to vaccine.  4-5 hours  after injection felt something across the top of my brain ... felt as though something had been stuck in a blood vessel and became unstuck allowing blood to shoot through.  Was certainly freaked out by this, but was at an event and head of the ER department of the local hospital was also attending - so figured I had quicker access to medical care there if needed, than at home.   30-60 minutes later congestion completely cleared up.  9-12 hours after vaccination had extreme chills.  Day after vaccination had pain below the injection site... injection was 2? above pain.  Also neck pain. Day 2-8 since vaccination, on/off muscle pain or injection site pain. Today, day 9, have muscle pain in wrist of injection arm.

                                                I had mild pain radiating in my arm within 2 minutes of the vaccine.  1-2 hours later I developed unusual and intermittent pain on the volar surface of my wrist.  8 hours after the vaccine I developed chills, severe fatigue, myalgias, loss of appetite, and a fever up to 101.  I was bedridden for 36 hours and then the symptoms gradually subsided by day 3.  I then developed a sense of chest tightness intermittently for the next 4 days usually at night.  I did not have chest pain, but had tachypnea at times with a respiratory rate up to 22/min. At day 7 this resolved.

I felt extreme fatigue for the next 48 hours.  I felt my heart racing off and on for 24 hours,  I felt a loss of strength in both arms and legs for the next 48 hours.  Monday Night I woke up sweating as I had a fever.  The fever persisted off and on for about 24 hours. I was irritable (probably due to not feeling well) for about 48 hours.  My wife had to drive me home.

                                                I received the J&amp;J shot after work on Friday around 5:30 p.m.. Around 3 a.m. Saturday morning, I woke up with a fever and chills. My head was hot. My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

Head was insanely stuffy when I woke up around 8:30, my ears hurt on the inside and I couldn?t hear well. My lungs felt kind of funny, as if I?d taken too much asthma medication. By noon my lungs were burning with every breath, my eyes were hot and weepy, the fever and muscle/joint aches had gotten really bad, and I had pain in my neck under my jaw between chin and ears.

Chills, aches, and fever continued until 8:30pm the same night. My fever would go to 102.8 as a high to 100.2 depending on how close I was to my next timeframe to take Tylenol.  I took 4 extra strength Tylenol (2000 mg) every 4 hours, give or take 30 minutes. Around 8:30 pm my fever broke and I sweated mildly Until around 10:30pm

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often.

                                                On the day after the injection, a severe stiffness in both legs occurred.  It was a soreness and stiffness similar to the day after running a marathon race .  The soreness and stiffness would not change if I was sitting, walking, standing or kneeling.  It was constant discomfort and irritation.  It was not painful and therefore I originally did not go to medical.  There was no discomfort in my left arm at the injection site.  The discomfort increased for the rest of the day.  A headache started in mid afternoon and kept increasing throughout the rest of day.  I have not had a headache in years.  Around 7:00 PM on Thursday, I had to sleep.  I was extremely tired.  My body had chills and I had to wear a sweatshirt and full set of clothes to bed just to stay warm.  That is very unusual.  I am usually throwing off covers every night throughout the entire year.    I did not eat dinner because there was no appetite.  I slept in bed for at least 12 hours.  Typical night sleep = 8 hours.  The next morning was no issue and therefore I did not go seek medical help because there are supposed to be side effects to vaccines.  Now, I am reporting it because headache and the stiff muscles were identified on the news.  However, it was around 24-36 hours and not the 6 days on the news.

                                                On 4/14/2021, right elbow started to hurt.  This was a site of a removed gout-caused mass over a year ago.  That subsided within a day.  On 4/15/2021, left foot started to hurt.  By 4/17/2021, the next to smallest toe and the large toe was swollen and very tender to any sort of touch.  It was not warm.  The pain was almost unbearable on 4/18/2021 and the suspicion that it might be gout was considered.  On 4/19/2021, after a visit with his doctor, gout was confirmed as the likely cause of the pain/swelling.  However, no blood tests were run to confirm.  Treatment for gout was initiated.

                                                About 1 week after vaccination, I noted sensations of fullness or bloatedness.  It felt like gas trapped in my upper abdomen that could not be relieved by burping.  Within 2 days, I began to have pain in lower, left rib cage akin to side cramps/stitch after strenuous running, but persisted the entire day.  About 2-3 days later,  the pain intensified and spread throughout my diaphragm region (left and right sides).   Breathing was somewhat affected, after semi-strenuous activities, such as walking up/down stairs.  So, I avoided physical exercise, and took Advil for a couple days to minimize the pain.  After another 3-4 days, the pain in the diaphragm region subsided.  I have not experienced further discomfort for the past week (today is 4/21/2021).  No treatments were sought during this period.  I self-researched the symptoms and hypothesize the pain stemmed from a swollen spleen, which might have been caused by an overactive immune system due to the vaccine.

I did not measure my body temperature because I immediately ran under the blanket. Icy-cold hands and feet, even after my body temperature seemed to stabilize. I fell asleep but not a restful sleep. I woke up after 2.5 to 3 hours with the feeling that it was morning, but in fact it was between 2am and 3 am. At that point I felt the worst part had gone, I felt weak and with muscle aches but I could drink water and go back to bed. I did not have a restful sleep all night and I woke up may times. By the morning I was tired but no fever.

                                                I started sweating profusely within 30 min of the shot. Was light headed and dizzy for approximately 4-5 hrs. Once the sweating stopped I felt severe pain in both knees and ankles. If felt as if you were trying to snap my knees and ankles in half. That lasted 4-5 hrs. After I slept for a few hrs over night I woke up and felt pretty good. Approximately 3-4 hrs after I woke up I felt light headed and nauseated for approximately 3-4 hrs. I felt pretty much back to normal into the third day after the shot. I was slightly light headed and fatigued for approximately 8 days after the shot. After about the 8th day I felt normal again. I said I will never get that shot again. Approximately 25 years ago I had gotten my first flew shot and I was very sick for a week. Never received another flew shot again. Besides the stress and anxiety issues I am a healthy guy. Every 2 years we get full blood work up and my blood levels have always been spot on of where they should be.

                                                Patient received Johnson&amp;Johnson COVID vaccine in the afternoon on 3/31/21. Patient reported having right arm pain, diaphoresis, chills, nausea, and muscle aches/pain in upper leg/lower back at 5:30am the following morning. Patient took 2 tablets of 500mg naproxen in the morning and in the afternoon. Symptoms did not resolve and patient had to leave work early. Upon getting home patient took 2 tablets of 650mg tylenol and symptoms resolved within 48 hours. On 4/3/21 patient reported mild to severe pain in heel of left foot. The following day the patient went to WellNow urgent care to get his heel examined. During examination provider noticed patient&#39;s lesions and patient stated more lesions have appeared since getting the vaccine.  1 on his stomach, 1 on the dorsum of his left foot, 1 on his back, 1 on his left elbow, in between his toes of his left foot, and in between the fingers of his right hand. Patient stated that these lesions cause a burning sensation and can become itchy. Patient was sent to Hopsital ED as provider at urgent care was concerned patient may have purpura. Patient was seen and discharged on 4/4/21 from the ED. The heel pain was determined to be plantar fascitis which was treated with at home exercises with a heel cup. The patient was given clotrimazole for his lesions. The patient had a follow-up visit with his primary care provider at hospital on 4/6/21 in which he explained the clotrimazole only made his lesions worse. Patient was referred to follow up with dermatology on 4/8/21. Primary care provider believes progression of the lesions since getting the vaccine leads to concern of an underlying autoimmune exacerbated by vaccine.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes and abdominal pain from right him bone down to scrotum. Pain on 4/7 was such that i though i was suffering a hernia.  Couldn&#39;t get out of car or move my right leg across my body. Could put right leg into pants leg.  Hurt to bend over and do much of anything on 4/7.   Initially thought pain was in testicle but doesn&#39;t hurt at all to the touch.  Realized it more a swollen area in the groin between hip bone and scrotum.   Nothing hurts to the touch at all in that area either which lead my to believe it was swollen lymph nodes.  The  Feeling is as if i got hit in the right groin  and my testicle has been hit and discomfort is 8 inches above right testicle in my groin area.    It has been improving every day since then, the more i walk the better it is.  It only hurts when i sit now and it seems to aggravate it pretty well but once i start moving the pain goes away.  It has been 9 days now and the i don&#39;t notice it all day until i come back to the office and sit at my desk and again it gets aggravated and the discomfort feels like my right testicle is near my appendix  Since this all started my legs feel heavier in the calf and have little nerve sensations when i sit too, which concerns me about the blood clot possibility and so i have been emailing with my doctor.  I am going to make appt for Monday 4/19

                                                About 20 hours after injection, I had mild flu-like symptoms, including headache and muscle ache, lasting about 12 hours. But about 5 days after my injection (5 days &#43; 5 hours, actually), I experienced a bewildering all-over rash that freaked me out. It started as itching around my elbows and ankles -- it felt like mosquito bites and sunburn together -- and spread to wrist and knee areas. The rash climbed by legs and arms. I applied coat after coat of Benadryl, which seemed to help. The rash would disappear and move somewhere else. I had it on my left foot, but then that resolved, only to find it on my right foot. After about 3 hours, it had spread to my stomach, the bridge of my nose, and my cheeks. It started to calm down around midnight. I woke up at 6:00 am (12 hours after onset) with extremely itchy hands. At 8:00 am (14 hours after onset), it had mostly disappeared except for patches on my back, and my wrists still itch. I&#39;m hoping it goes away later today! It was crazy!

Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

My shoulder is still stiff on the opposite side of the injection site at this time.  My doctor told me it might be sinus pressure and he put me on some steroids - had a five day dose and I finished them.

                                                A week and a half after taking the Janssen COVID shot I had a knot and pain come up in my lower back. After going to the chiropractor two times the knot and pain ended up in my right leg. I then went to Urgent Care where they diagnosed me with a large blood clot. They sent me to imaging and after scanning the area confirmed that there was a blood clot in my right leg. Urgent Care then set me up with a specialist.

                                                About a week after receiving vaccine, both my shoulders and both hips started experiencing pain and weakness that is still ongoing, though improving. Until recently, it was difficult to raise my hands over my head, and it would be difficult to stand up from a sitting position. I have regularly exercised and done resistance training for several years. I&#39;m not sure if this is coincidental nor am I concerned, but a pharmacist encouraged me to report it here.

                                                2 hours after vaccination I noticed left arm started hurting . Went to bed at my usual time and woke up at 2:00 am with the chills I could not get warm late that night around 5:00 am I started having joint pain and fatigue with a headache and hot skin. I had taken my temperature and it was 100.7. I tried to wait out symptoms but I seem to bee get worse throughout the morning. Around 10:00 am I was in terrible pain and my body hurt all over. I once again took my temperature and it had gone up to 101.9. I had to call of work because I was so ?out of it?.  I started taking Tylenol ever 4 hrs for my fever and I was trying to hydrate.  My temperature slowly went down but still had body pain. I then started thank ibuprofen to help. Later that night around 9:00 pm my temperature was 99. The next day I called off work for fatigue and body pain. Today my temperature is normal and I?m starting to feel like my self again

By 8 pm the next day, I didn&#39;t have many side effects.

About 1 hour later I started getting the cold chills, a headache and shaking.  About 1 more hour later I had a fever, achy joints and muscle aches.  The symptoms lasted through the night until about 8:30 the next morning when I started sweating.  I decided then to take aceteminiphen and Naproxen.  This helped me to feel a little better.  Side effects were resolved after 24 hours

                                                Patient had arm tingling shortly after injection. Pt stayed in store for about 4 hours after 2pm injection, no redness or swelling noticed. Pt was quite anxious &amp; nervous (but already has severe anxiety). Pharmacist called patient following afternoon, the 11th and patient noted he was doing marginally better but still sounded anxious. Pharmacist called patient on Fri the 12th 5:16p and this was when the patient explained the following: Muscle stiffness on left side &amp; pain down left leg; cranial pain; shoulder stiffness; nasal congestion; some shortness of breath; soreness &amp; fatigue.  Patient called back and said he had partial shortness of breath at 7:34p on the 12th.  On Sat the 13th at 11am, pharmacist called to check on pt; found him quite agitated &amp; saying, &#34;He feels the shot was botched&#34;, noted he had called Janssen to report his issues.  At 4:30pm, pt came to pharmacy, looked fine, arm showed no redness, was more subdued in person than on the phone earlier. He said he was feeling better but was not happy with Janssen and wanted the Moderna 2 series shot because he feels Janssen&#39;s vaccine wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to.

I basically stayed in bed most of the day, I took Tylenol throughout the day as indicated on the container. I took my last dose of Tylenol at approximately 9pm.

                                                Starting 96 hours after vaccination: extreme stabbing pain in left deltoid (injection site).  Soon, this was accompanied by dull but severe pain in left shoulder and upper left back (top of scapula and around collar bone), extending to base of neck. This pain lasted 2 weeks, and was severe enough to prevent patient from sitting or standing for more than a few minutes at a time, especially during the first week of pain. Painkillers (Acetaminophen or NSAIDs) or muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine) did not help alleviate the pain. The pain started on March 17, and finally eased up on April 2 (the vaccination was on March 13). There is still some pain and stiffness in the left arm (currently in the biceps), but it is no longer severe. By the way, in addition to the above symptoms starting at 96 hours, there were the usual expected systemic symptoms immediately after the vaccination (starting at 6 hours and ending at 36 hours): light fever, mild body ache, fatigue and mild local pain at injection site.

On 4/6/21 I came home from work about 7:00 am due to an extreme headache and muscle weakness. By the afternoon my fever was up to 101. On 4/7 my fever went up to 102.7 and I was shaking uncontrollably, sweating , dizzy, headache, and had heaviness in my chest. I felt as if I were going to have a stroke. The headache was excruciating. I took acetaminophen 500 x 2 and 400 mg of ibuprofen, and Theraflu to try and alleviate the symptoms. On 4/9/21 my fever broke, but the weakness, dizziness and headaches have continued. I currently have ongoing headaches and dizziness. I have not gone to the doctor because I do not have a PCP. I am looking for one now.

After those injections I have led a normal life.  NO issues whatsoever.  No discomfort, no leg pain, no back pain.  Within about an hour after receiving the COVID-19 injection, I started to have discomfort and pain in my lower back.  Within a few days my sciatic pain had returned.  I am now scheduled for another injection in my back for 4-23-21 to get rid of the sciatic pain.

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

                                                Approximately three weeks after receiving Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, I began to get pains in legs. Calves were aching and throbbing. Didn&#39;t think anything of it at first....just thought achy muscles and such. The day before Easter (April 3rd 2021) decided since the pain was continuing and the internet will scare you to death - I went to a local Emergency Room in advance,  I had an ultrasound on my left leg and it was noted I had DVT. (blood clot in left calf)  To briefly explain: I had an achilles issue back in Nov. 2020 (slight micro tear - achilles tendonitis) I thought maybe this was related to that, as I had not been to the doctor to get it checked until early March 2021. and it bothered me off and on for a few months. I thought the calf pain may have been related to that?  I explained to the emergency room doctor about my achilles and thought it was an issue related to that. They decided to perform an ultrasound on my left leg. Which noted the DVT/Blood Clot. They put me on a starter pack of Xarelto and I am to follow up with my normal doctor on April 22, 2021.

Arm is hard to lift up at some times and weak to lift anything up sometimes. Arm feels week for about 2 to 3 days and then starts to fill better. Then after a day of the soreness or no weakness in the arm, it starts back hurting again. It now getting worse at night time and sometimes during the day. Some days it hurts so bad that I can&#39;t even move it. I don&#39;t bother to tell my wife, because it just last for about a 2 to 3 hours. I have been to my doctor yet. But if it keeps bothering me I will make an appointment to see him.  It just my arm and hand be very weak to use at sometimes every other day.

                                                High temperature (104-105), muscle and joint cramping. This occurred the night of the 30th. Temperature started to decrease over the next two days so did the cramping. Then starting on 4/5 I started to experience pain in the back of my head along with the sensation of heat/burning. This was accompanied by a stiff neck. This pain and stiffness persists to today. Medication prescribed by my doctor lessens the discomfort but has not rid me of the issue.

We thought it was related to the weather getting warm and we work the night shift, so he rested and increased his water intake. He was able to go to work on Monday night and return home and continued to rest on Tuesday. On Tuesday, there was no numbness, but there was weakness in both his legs. On Wednesday, he felt weakness throughout his body, especially in his legs. On Thursday, he collapsed. He did not lose consciences but his legs gave out under him and he was not able to get up up. He was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a stroke, increased sugars (diabetes he has never had before), acute kidney injury, and uncontrolled increased blood pressure. He was hospitalized and discharged April 19, 2021. He was readmitted 04/24/2021 for another stroke.

                                                After getting the shot on Friday at 6:00 pm. I did not have any issues with the shoulder.   Sunday evening around 11pm I have started to have shoulder pain.  The pain is around the area of the injection.  The pain  is generally in the deltoid muscle  and has spread some to the bicep muscle as well.   Uncertain if this is common to the injection process but it caused concern as its onset had been  over 48 hours post injection.

                                                Lightheaded about 5 minutes after injection. Medical team took HR and BP and was normal Took about 20 minutes and light headedness went away  Later that night at around 12:30 am, felt very cold and shivering with severe headache Did not take temperature Had a hard time going back to sleep Got up around 1:00 am to take 800 mg of OTC Advil When walking back up stairs had severe muscle pain in arms and legs Was fine after that Seemed to get better by 2 am No issues next day  About 7-10 days later developed severe frontal headaches/sinus pressure No other symptoms Used Neti Pot with saline solution and did nothing Took OTC allergy meds and Advil and did nothing  Say my primary care Dr and he prescribed Flonase, Singular and Allegra &#43; continue Neti Pot and Advil as needed Not much improvement on this regime after 3-5 days of use  About a week later developed severe pain in bottom right jaw Took OTC Advil and again no improvement Went to Dentist and said not tooth related but probably TMJD Recommend dental appliance to help with grinding  About a few days later after this jaw pain developed, developed sharp stabbing pain in bottom of left knee cap. No recollection of any insult that would cause this  All three of these pain sites were perfectly fine prior to getting J&amp;J vaccine.  No history of pain or injury to these areas prior  All of these incidents to me seem to be inflammatory/immune in nature and could be related to J&amp;J vaccine based upon how I reacted to injection.  Curious if others are seeing the same thing and if so what should be done or how long should this last?

He went to another doctors office and at about 15:00 started feeling light headed and weak.  He drove back home, picked up some stuff at a grocery store, and outside the grocery store in 80 degree heat he felt the need to put on a jacket as he had the chills.  he went home, went to bed feeling bad, his shoulder was still burning where he got hte vaccin.e  He had a little bit of site pain, applied topical and the pain went away.  He woke up the next morning feeling really bad, felt like a major flu, his head felt like it was going to explode, but no problem with sinuses, no cough, no sneezing.  His eyes were watering from the pain, and chills on and off.  He had to change his sheets a couple of times due to sweating.  He then developed a fever of 99 degrees at about 18:00 that night, and about 19:00 he went to 102 when he checked it.  After that it went to 103, and about 15 minutes after that it was 104, and then higher at 104.&#43;.  He took some vodka, honey and lemon juice and took an alcohol bath and the fever had not broken yet.  He called the clinic and they told him to call 9-1- 1 and to go to the ER.  He went to the ER at about 10:00, gave him fluids, did a chest x-ray and released him about midnight.  He apparently disoriented and tried to walk off and didn&#39;t remember this.  They took him back to the gate and called his son.  He went home, took another bath and woke up in sweat and was in bed for the entire weekend.  He got up Monday morning, 4/13/21 feeling a little bit better and went to see his doctor, who does not believe he was having any side effects and that the information that is being reported is true.   He is still feeling a little weak and still fatigued and on bedrest.  He was taking Advil besides his regular medicines every 6 hours with 500 mg of Tylenol for the intense pain as every joint in his body ached, and the worst headache he had ever had, as well as the high fevers.  His fever subsided on Saturday morning, and still had some sweats following that.  Did have hot/cold flashes on Saturday and Sunday.   He was given a COVID test in the ER and he was negative, but did not give him any other information regarding his lab work.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 15-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. On 15-MAR-2021, the patient received the vaccine, waited at facility for 15 minutes, and everything was okay.  On 17-APR-2021, the patient experienced neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness, which he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium). He also noticed his feet had a rash from his knee to feet, and according to his sister (who is a healthcare professional) it looked like small micro-embolisms (thrombocytopenia). The patient went to his physician who said the spotty red dots could be petechiae caused by thrombocytopenia.  As recommended by his primary care physician, the patient has an appointment for lab work, including platelet counts, on 20-APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from headache, tiredness, neck ache, rash from knee to feet (red dots), muscle ache, and possible thrombocytopenia, and the outcome of sleepiness was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old male patient was found to have petechiae-like rash on his knees to feet, that according to attending physician could be caused by thrombocytopenia, 2 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient underwent laboratory procedure including platelet count (results not reported).  The patient complained of neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness that he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium) on the day the petechiae-like rash appeared.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information as requested.

Then my temperature went up to 101.9 degrees F, taken by an electronic touchless digital thermometer. Then, the L Deltoid vaccination site began to feel very sore. As the day went on, I felt increasingly fatigued and exhausted,  and had trouble concentrating.   I felt better the 2nd day after vaccination, but felt intermittent myalgias, increasing L Deltoid soreness, and hot and chilled at the end of the day.  Today, I felt better in the morning, exceptfor persistent L deltoid soreness, and fatigue. This evening, I am feeling cold, tired, and myalgias again.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination I started to experience chronic exhaustion, leg cramping and pain in my lower back right side, upper right thigh, behind my right knee and down into my right calf. I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

                                                I had a small lump appear at or near the site of injection past the 2 week period. My arm was stiff and sore. My spouse massaged my shoulder and the lump seemed to disappear. Arm felt better. The next day the same thing happened. My spouse massaged my arm and it went away again. I haven&#39;t had any other issues beyond that. I&#39;m not completely sure it is related to the vaccine. I was also in the hospital during this time for an unrelated health issue. I had an obstructed bowel that required surgery. My surgeon assured me that they did nothing to my left arm during the surgery and treatment of the bowel obstruction. After a few conversations with the medical staff and my spouse we thought that the arm issue may have been a side effect of the vaccine shot. That&#39;s why I&#39;m submitting this to you now. So far I haven&#39;t experienced anything else at the injection site. My spouse also had the same vaccine at the same time as me. He hasn&#39;t experienced any of the same effects as I have.

About a day later, I was fine but tired. Approximately 3 weeks later on April 9th, I had sharp pain in my lower back when I breathed in and my neck lympth nodes were swollen and sore. I am fine now and the only reason I am reporting this is to document symptoms for your research efforts. Thank you.

I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

                                                I took the shot at 10:50, first early side effects where mild burning sensation in the legs couple of hours after the vaccine, later pain in the legs in the afternoon. At night I had a mild fever, chills, body aches (everywhere) unbearable headache (still going on 24 hours after the shot), pain at the vaccination site (left shoulder, still strong after 24 hours), pain in the lungs (I sneezed a couple of times).  I took Tylenol every 4 hours, but did not improve, only brought the fever down a bit.  Today after 24 hours, I still have headache, muscular aches, and fatigue.

                                                I shortly after the shot I having had random pains in arm, including joints [like when the pressure changes ... don&#39;t think I have arthritis]) but they only lasted a few minutes and then would go away.  About 10 hours later I started feeling sick.  One of the first things I noticed besides a headache was my heart rate jumped up to over 100 beats per minute (it is normally below 84).  I started getting chills and fever.  It was worse than any flu fever I ever had and I could not sleep.  Worst part was my heart rate would not go down, remaining above 100 but below 110-115 beats per minute.  I considered calling 911 but after looking online decided not to as long as it remained below 120 bpm.  I don&#39;t know my maximum temperature - I did not think to take it until after the peak had passed by 20 minutes or so (was 99.4 at that point - normal temperature runs 97.2 (low 96.8, high 98.2)).  Heart rate finally started to drop around 3:30 am.

                                                I developed a high pitch ringing in the ears the morning after the vaccine.  It was noticed when I woke up.  I did have a low fever, high chills, and significant neck muscle &#34;cramping&#34; during the night when this reaction developed.  The ringing (Tinnitus) is pretty loud and bothersome.  The volume has not changed since the day after my vaccine shot (two weeks now).

She said my face was drooping, I couldn&#39;t smile or stand.  She called Ambulance.  Ambulance arrived and decided symptoms of stroke and called for helicopter to take me to medical center.   When I arrived they did CT and I was later told it showed possible areas of no oxygen to brain.  They gave me TPA drug and almost immediately  I could see improvement - my headache cleared.  Throughout the next couple hours I regained movement on right side and all functionality returned except weakness in right arm.  I stayed in ICU for 24 hours as required after receiving TPA and while additional tests were ran then was discharged on Friday, April 16, 2021

                                                1 week after receiving the vaccine, what I believe to be a gout flare started in my right foot.  The joint of my big toe became very swollen and red, painful to the touch and the rest of the front part of my foot also became swollen.  It was difficult to walk or even put pressure on it for 5 days and I treated it with ice, elevation and 600 mg ibuprofen 3X/day.  Symptoms are starting to resolve , but the joint is still swollen and red, though the pain is subsiding.  I am able to walk with a normal gait, though there is still stiffness and some pain.

Yesterday, however, I started to have a bad headache at 4 a.m., then felt generally more ill to a level of almost incapacity by evening - bad headache, general weakness, dizziness, some muscle pain, bad nausea. Used Aleve and Ibuprofen and by 11pm started to feel normal again.  By the next morning, I felt fine - tired like I just got over something, but fine.  Not sure it was injection related, but wanted to share.

                                                Skull crushing headache that started about 12 hours after injection and lasted for about 18 hours. After 48 hours from injection, headache is 90% improved. Took Advil, but that did nothing for headache.  It was the worst headache that I can ever remember having.  Extreme muscle pain in various parts of the body started at same time as onset of headache. This, too, died out as the headache got better.  Slight nausea on day #2.  No fever. Was steady at 96.6 throughout these adverse reactions.

At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

On the 23rd he had to be taken into the hospital in an ambulance. He said he felt as if his lower body was separated from his torso, and visible was having trouble walking. They prescribed him Valium, preformed an x-ray, and sent him home.  On the 27th he was taken back to the hospital due to leg weakness, tingling in his hands and feet, and extreme pain. He was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. He passed away April 6, 2021 after spending 11 days in the hospital, and 6 days on a ventilator.

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after the injection, while sitting down, I felt light headed, sweating, weak, face turned white. I was close to passing out but didn&#39;t. I requested attention after about 10 minutes. While being treated by medics they mentioned color had returned to my face. I felt better enough so I refused to go to hospital and was driven home. Later that morning, 03/08/2021 about 10 AM, I developed a fever and body aches with sharp pains thru out my body and joints. First temperature check was 100.5. My fever, pains/weakness increased thru out that day and overnight with chills. Highest temp check was 102.8 that evening prior to bedtime. I don&#39;t know if it could have been higher at some point overnight. It felt like I had a moderate to bad case of the FLU. The next morning, 03/09/2021 the fever broke down to about 101. By 03/11/2021, aside from a little residual weakness I felt more like myself. However, as of the writing of this report my temp seems to fluctuate between normal and 99.8. Will report this to my Doctor on next visit. Worth noting that I haven&#39;t had any Flu like symptoms to that degree in many years.

                                                Initially (20 minutes after shot) felt numbness in toes on both feet.  Chills were next felt within approx an hour.  Intense muscle aches were later (approx 6-8 hrs after shot) along with overall fatigue.  A medium grade headache began 8-10 hrs after shot and continued throughout night - lowering to a slight headache within 24 hrs after shot.  Headache ended 28-30 hrs after shot.  Developed a post nasal drip and mild congestion in sinuses about 1.5 days after shot (and continues).  Numbness in toes appears to have returned with some stiffness felt in my calf muscles.

Around 9:00pm started to feel chills and tired with low grade fever (100 C). Around 1:30am started feeling right side back pain in my kidney area that woke me up. By 2:15am the pain was almost unbearable, and I could no longer lay in bed. At 3:00am I took 2x 500mg Tylenol as I debated whether to call my doctor or go straight to ER. By the 3:45am pain was subsiding and was I able to get back in bed by 4am. Today no pain.

The next morning after my J&amp;J vaccine, my left leg started hurting more and I could not ambulate. My left hip was hurting so bad I could not sleep at night. I went to the doctor 03-17-2021 to get monitored and he said it could be arthritis. I was prescribed by Dr.  cyclobenzaprine 10mg and naproxen 500mg. I feel that my pain is inside the joint, hip pain region and to this day, I still have sleeping problems due to my pain in my left leg and left hip pain since the J&amp;J vaccine. I will have a  follow up with Dr. in the coming weeks.

                                                This is a 59 year old male that presented to the emergency department at approximately 1447 on 04/27/2021 with sudden onset of left upper and lower extremity weakness and left-sided numbness of his face. The patient stated he may have had some weakness the previous night (04/26/2021), but mostly noticed it when he woke up around 0900 on 04/27/2021. The patient stated he may have also had some transient speech changes which he felt were improved upon emergency department presentation. The patient stated he took an 81 mg aspirin prior to hospital arrival. The patient was overall hemodynamically stable in the emergency department. Past medical history is only significant for benign prostatic hyperplasia. This patient has no history of previous CVA or TIA, no smoking history, no history of clotting disorders, no recent trauma or other injury. CT head revealed a small right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage with no midline shift and concern for clot. CTA head and neck perfusion study was significant for ?perfusion abnormality involving the right frontal lobe in the region of known subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely related to dural venous sinus thrombosis involving the posterior aspect of the superior sagittal sinus, left greater than right transverse sinus, and left sigmoid sinus.? This patient is noted to have recently received his Johnson and Johnson vaccine on 03/20/2021. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Neurology and hematology were consulted.
