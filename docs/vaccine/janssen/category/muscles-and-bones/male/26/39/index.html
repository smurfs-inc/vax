                                                Friday night at about 10ish I suddenly got a terrible migraine, shaking uncontrollably, and my body have stiff. I tried going to bed at 11pm, but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. I got up sometime around 2am and I still had all of these along with extreme nausea. Check my temperature, it was 101.4 F. Got more blankets and tried to get some sleep, but took a while due to the migraine.   At 7:30am, the shaking was gone and the migraine was not as bad, but I still had a temperature of 99.1 F and nausea. After calling my boss and mother, I went back to sleep. Stayed in bed until about 1:45pm Saturday. By then, the migraine was manageable and nausea was not as bad, though still had a temperature of 99.9 F. Took a shower and took 2 pills of  ibuprofen.

                                                Patient came in for vaccine. After vaccination, I had patient sit in a chair in case of any adverse reactions. About 5 minutes after vaccination, another patient came over and said that was not feeling well. When going out to patient I noticed he was very pale and sweating.  The patient then proceeded to pass out. I was able to hold the patients head and the other customer was able to hold his shoulders to make sure he did not fall out of the chair. The patient then got very stiff and proceeded to push back in his chair, after about 10 seconds he relaxed. The patient was passed out for about 3 mins, during that time I was able to remove his mask and hold his head. After gaining consciousness, I was able to make sure he was ok. We were able to give him some water and he stated he felt better. I asked the patient to stay for another half hour to monitor. After giving the patient another bottle of water, and having him sit he was able to get up and leave.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

Throughout all of these events, there was stiffness in the upper arm where the vaccine was injected.

                                                Woke up at 12:00am today with headache, lots of discomfort (especially in stomach), and for the most part could only fall back asleep for short intervals while being awake most of the night.   At around 2:30am, could barely walk into the front room. Just very slowly and painfully. Ended up in such a state that I absentmindedly urinated onnthe bathroom floor while pulling pant leg up to scratch an itch while urinating in toilet. Laying on back caused butt and thighs to hurt significantly more. Same for stomach. Getting up from and laying down on my floor mattress was and still is difficult.   Later into the morning at around 6:40am, had to crawl slowly on hands and knees to get back in the front room. By around 8am, I could walk around without it being unbearable. Just slow-ish. Ate breakfast, so stomach is more uncomfortable than in pain. Can lay on it without too much problem, but butt is still hurting. Stretching legs forward caused some pain.  Possible fever.

I collapsed twice, but never went unconscious. My arm was very sore, and I was very weak and dizzy and clammy. I got only a little better as the night went on. Today, I have had flu-like symptoms and my body aches very much. I hadn?t seen a lot symptoms involving nearly immediately passing out, so I thought I should report my side effects.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

                                                At 10 pm I started to experience some moderate body aches. By 1 am, I was in so much pain I could not sleep and started to develop a fever. I drank a ton of fluids, used OTC treatments (Ibuprofen and Motrin) but nothing alleviated the pain. By 10 am I had a sustained fever over 100 degrees. I was in so much pain I was crying in bed. By 3 pm my fever reached 102 degrees. I had to go to the emergency room for IV drip and medication because I couldn&#39;t drink enough water to stay hydrated. Once given IV, my temperature plummeted. When the medication they administered wore off, my body started experiencing mild to moderate pains again. Body aches and soreness all over- my muscles feel like they are being squeezed from the inside. I am still feeling a lot of fatigue and pain but it is random and comes and goes along with &#34;hot flashes&#34;.

                                                Immediately after shot I felt a slightly elevated heart beat and 5 minutes later I blacked out and tensed up according to a witness. My back was also sore from whatever happened while unconscious. I never had an adverse effect with a vaccine before. After I came around I felt tingling in my arms and hands for 5-10 minutes. Back pain subsided shortly after. No other side effects

                                                Patient received Janssen Covid-19 vaccination today at approximately 6:20pm.  At 6:35, he said he had left arm weakness (arm he received vaccine in), fatigue, was dizzy, and felt &#34;off&#34;.  Patient did not lose consciousness and refused an ice pack.  BP checked at 6:38pm (170/98, pulse 105).  Patient stated his blood pressure usually runs high. I offered him an ice pack a second time, but he said there was no need and he felt better.  BP checked again 6:52pm (152/101, pulse 99).  I recommended that since his blood pressure is usually this high, he should follow up with his primary doctor regarding blood pressure as he may need some medication to assist in lowering it.  He said ok.  He left the pharmacy area at 7:02pm and said he was fine to leave, he did not want to remain any longer.

I was monitoring his temperature and he did not have a fever. I was massaging his hands and legs, this went on for 45 minutes to 1 hour. When the shaking subsided, the fever started, at this point I gave him Tylenol and continued to monitor his temperature.  He is better this morning.

                                                At 6:00 PM 3/12 I began to feel slightly dizzy. It did not effect my ability to stand or move around very much, but my head did feel strange and if I turned to quickly I would need a second to gather myself. However, it was not severe enough to force me to sit or lay down. By 7:00-7:30 I began to feel hot and uncomfortable and I took my temperature at 7:30 and I was running a low grade fever at 99.8 degrees F. I began to feel very fatigued and was in bed by 9:00 PM. I woke up feeling fine and my temperature at 7:00 AM 3/13 is 97.8 degrees F. My only possible side effect this morning (3/12 as I write this) is that I am mildly stiff, mostly in my left arm, neck, and back (the side of the injection site). Despite the mild fever I did not feel any nausea, nor did I have difficulty breathing. Overall the side effects were mild but uncomfortable.

Slept until 11:15pm and woke up to violent shivering, pounding headache, full body aches, sore skin, achey joints, nausea, swelling tongue and throat. Took 1 dose of nyquil and then tossed and turned all night, very little sleep, symptoms persisted into the next day, but shivering stopped in the night.

                                                6 hours after injection, I began feeling muscle pain and chills, 8 hours after, these symptoms worsened, 11.5 hours after I had a fever and more intense symptoms with a max recorded fever of 102°F and intense cold sweats. This lasted for about 12 hours and I woke up with a slight fever which then subsided. Later the following day I felt fine again.   Essentially, when the symptoms were most intense, I felt like I did when I contracted Covid in March of 2020

                                                Towards the evening of the same day as receipt of the vaccine, I began to experience a growing fever, aches, and headache. By the time 11pm came around I was in a full blown fever which lasted until around 5:30 am the next day. The fever was reduced through the taking of two Acetaminophen pills. Throughout the night, I was unable to sleep due to intense headache pain, I felt exhausted and couldn?t move. I had a fever around 102 degrees Fahrenheit at its peak and maintaining usually around 101.4 degrees. I was nauseous and experienced emotional instability. The adverse affects lasted until the morning with some affects such as the headaches and nausea still currently lingering on to present time (10:48am).

                                                Joints began feeling achy and body felt tired within a few hours of vaccination. About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

                                                Patient was talking to a friend about five minutes after receiving the vaccine and suddenly passed out and fell to the floor.  He was awake again in about a minute.  The patient was sweating, pale and a little disoriented for a couple minutes but started improving steadily until he was feeling his normal self again.  The EMS was called but the patient declined being taken to the hospital as he felt much better by the time they arrived.

                                                Woke up in middle of night with headache. Thought maybe tired from getting up early but have had fatigue and muscle aches (lower back, arms, ankles, head, chest). Been tired through the day...not so bad that I was unable to work. Took Tylenol and that helped lower the body aches...but only lasted 4-6 hours.

                                                I first felt the usual dead arm feeling and then that quickly progressed into a full-blown hot flash/feverish feeling accompanied by a splitting headache that I had last all of last night. Now I still have a minor headache and a dead arm after taking Tylenol (Rapid Release).    I also felt very weak and fatigued all night with a dry mouth and  plugged up sinus. Felt like I was going to be knocked out for 24 hours. I can hardly do these basic task on my work laptop.

The patient then fell out of the chair onto his face. I ran to the patient with an epipen, but fortunately it did not have to be used because the patient got up before administration. The patient had a cut on his life from falling. He was given water, and the paramedics came within 5 minutes. The patient was able to walk out of the store with the paramedic team.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First day after getting the shot I got a feeling of being very tired throughout the day I did not feel like to do anything. Also my arm was very very sore. Even moving it slightly a bit would hurt. The second day is when things got way worse I could not really sleep that well throughout the night because I noticed I had  body aches in my legs and my back. Throughout that day I also felt like I had a fever in the morning I took my temperature and had a 100 fever. At night time I took my temperature and it went up to 102, with  still a bad headache, chills, and body aches throughout my legs mostly. I also felt some palpitations. When I went to bed I was sweating very prefusively all night that I had to change my shirt. On the third day I felt a lot better, still with a slight headache no fever, and still feeling like im sweating on and off.

I took 600 mg of Tylenol as mentioned by the pharmacist for those that are feel side effects. Around 1:00 am, I woke up shivering with a 104.5 fever and nausea. I took another 600 mg of Tylenol, which brought the fever down to 100.5 for the six hours. I also threw-up around 2:00 .

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to feel hot and cold flashes and a flush feeling as if I was going to faint. I went to the emergency room. The ER doctor did blood work, took my blood pressure (a little high at first) and EKG. Doctor said everything appeared to be fine. After I left the hospital I started feeling mild shortness of breath and tightness in my chest which has not stopped as of this writing. I also have moderate pain in the upper middle part of my back by the vertebrate.

Around 1700, fatigue returned. Took a 3 mile walk between 1700-1800. Consumed two beers @ 7% ABV between 1800-1845. Around 1830 began feeling tingling, chills and muscle and joint pain which continues. The pain is similar to DOMS that occurs after a robust workout; did not have a robust workout today. I&#39;m fully functional, able to eat and able to otherwise function, so the symptoms are manageable.

                                                About 6/7 hours after the vaccination, I experienced fairly violent chills/shakes and the beginnings of a headache. I went to bed and woke some hours later with a 101-102-degree fever and muscle/joint aches (at the injection site on my left arm and throughout my body; I especially thought the joint aches in my legs and hands).  Now, about 27 hours after the vaccination, my fever has reduced to 99 degrees, my chills/shakes are gone, and my headache is mostly gone. The primary symptoms I have are the remaining sight fever, continued joint/muscle aches (mostly in my legs) and fatigue.

One nurse raised his legs &amp; another put a pulse oximeter on patient &amp; took his BP. Patient started responding to verbal cues. A nurse gave him Gatorade to start drinking. He was drenched in sweat from head to feet. The nurse continued to take his BP, which did hit 120/~70, but then dipped again. Once his BP &amp; pulse stabilized, he was able to go home. Patient ate a full meal &amp; a non-diet soda. He reported being exhausted ~4 pm. He fell asleep &amp; rose once to urinate.  Dr. at a Family Medicine practice checked his heart and lungs, and confirmed this did not appear to be an allergic reaction, but more likely was a vagovasal reaction. Patient started reacting ~10 minutes after the injection.

Slept poorly all night due to body pains. Woke to muscle aches and slight join pains, which worsened throughout the day. Low grade temperature appeared at noon the day after the shot, and stayed into the night. Headache began around 5PM and got worse. Tylenol helped at 7PM. Slept from 7:30PM to 7:30AM. Felt back to normal by morning.

I got extremely teeth chattering cold and could not get warm and began to have a small headache. I awoke about 2:30 A.M. and was extremely hot. I went downstairs to bathroom and the next thing I know my wife is shaking me to wake me up laying on the floor. My wife said she heard me fall and discovered me in the bathroom floor. She woke me up and I stood up and exited the bathroom and collapsed in the hallway. My wife awoke me again and I didn&#39;t know what occurred. My wife called 911 and EMS responded and assessed my condition. I explained everything that occurred and that I had my J&amp;J vaccine hours earlier.  My vitals were taken and my condition was evaluated. I had a bad headache that felt like my head was in a vise and my knees and chins hurting a bit from the fall I was fine. I just did not recall collapsing either time and I was distraught when my wife woke me both times. That&#39;s what I was informed by my wife. I don&#39;t recall anything after urinating to being woken up by my wife and I was on laying on the hallway floor and my wife was on the phone with 911.

Both symptoms are becoming more regular.

Went to get something to eat, walked half way and felt like I would fall on the ground, and returned to my room.  Called my parents because I wasn&#39;t sure if I would wake up the next morning. My team leader gave me a ride to the emergency room. They drew my blood and it was dark and thick.  They sent me home.  Still feel fatigue.

Myalgia in legs happened immediately. No fever at this time.  Woke in morning with no fever, but muscle aches, malaise, lethargy, parasthesia were all present. Spent entire day in bed napping occasionally.  Measured temperature in evening at 100.7F.  Painful stomach pain happened in evening. Patient never gets acid pain or similar so this was very abnormal. Antacid helped but stomach pain continued all evening at a lesser degree.  When going to bed most symptoms had subsided. Still some parasthesia and Myalgia. Woke up on 4/9 feeling much better after lots of sleep.  No fever or other symptoms on morning of 4/9.

                                                I started to feel extreme fatigue around noon the day after but what I found very concerning is I lost probably 80-90% of the strength in my arms.  I couldn&#39;t palm a ball i had for the kids which i normally can easily.  I had chills and nausea as well.    I can&#39;t really remember much from that day and it feels like a big blur.  I woke up the next day feeling very irritable with brain fog.  Today its gotten better and I am hoping tomorrow I will be back to normal.

                                                Got the vaccine around 10:30am, felt ok until around 7:30pm, when I started feeling some nausea and dizziness and weakness. Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

One week ago, on Friday, March 26, he received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for Covid 19. That day he felt fine. The following day he had some muscle aches. Sunday he states he had some slight shortness of breath, only for that day. Then he had some fever and chills feeling. That resolved. The only symptoms that persisted was his muscle aching and tightness. Then yesterday, the day of his presentation to the ER, he noted some bilateral lower extremity edema which prompted his visit. He is feeling mostly fine except a bit of muscle tightness. BNP was 154. Chest x-ray showed pneumonitis. He received antibiotics. Echocardiogram was completed showing preliminary findings of small to moderate pericardial effusion and trace aortic insufficiency.  Will treat with colchicine and ibuprofen.

I told him, yes the shot may cause some discomfort after injection and he was standing at this point.  He was about to say something and he fell backwards and hit a mobile laptop cart and the wall.  The patient went unconscious not talking but breathing was given an epipen and 911 called vaccine given a few minutes before 12:30 and 911 called at 12:29.  He regained consciousness fairly quickly and was assessed by the pharmacist and then EMT and transported to the hospital for monitoring.

Went away after 24 hours. The second began with profound feelings of mania 2 days later (Monday, March 8). This subsided in 24 hours. 4 days later- (Wednesday March 10) I began having difficulty standing upright.  This steadily became worse over the next several days until one week after the vaccination, where I was hugging walls and crawling on the floor to move from place to place.   This continued until Monday, March 15, when I was hospitalized.  Everything cleared up after 3 days in the hospital.
