                                                Friday night at about 10ish I suddenly got a terrible migraine, shaking uncontrollably, and my body have stiff. I tried going to bed at 11pm, but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. I got up sometime around 2am and I still had all of these along with extreme nausea. Check my temperature, it was 101.4 F. Got more blankets and tried to get some sleep, but took a while due to the migraine.   At 7:30am, the shaking was gone and the migraine was not as bad, but I still had a temperature of 99.1 F and nausea. After calling my boss and mother, I went back to sleep. Stayed in bed until about 1:45pm Saturday. By then, the migraine was manageable and nausea was not as bad, though still had a temperature of 99.9 F. Took a shower and took 2 pills of  ibuprofen.

About 5 minutes after vaccination, another patient came over and said that was not feeling well. When going out to patient I noticed he was very pale and sweating.  The patient then proceeded to pass out. I was able to hold the patients head and the other customer was able to hold his shoulders to make sure he did not fall out of the chair. The patient then got very stiff and proceeded to push back in his chair, after about 10 seconds he relaxed. The patient was passed out for about 3 mins, during that time I was able to remove his mask and hold his head. After gaining consciousness, I was able to make sure he was ok. We were able to give him some water and he stated he felt better. I asked the patient to stay for another half hour to monitor. After giving the patient another bottle of water, and having him sit he was able to get up and leave.

                                                Only minor chills before bed, 11pm. Muscle aches, felt as tightness in IT bands, made remaining asleep difficult. Got up to use the bathroom around 5am. Upon finishing peeing while standing, I lost consciousness, falling. As a result of the fall, I fractured my cheek bone, cut open my ear, later requiring three stitches, and was concussed, resulting in a loss of memory. I was nonresponsive when my fiance found me immediately following the crash, and was rushed to the hospital  via ambulance. Upon arrival to the hospital, my fever was found to be 102 F. As a result of the fall, I have a cheek bone fracture, three stiches in my ear, and a concussion.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the Janssen vaccine in my upper-left arm at 3:00 PM on April 5, 2021, at a public health clinic (I think that&#39;s the proper term for the site) established in a mall. After about ten minutes, during the scheduled waiting period, I began to feel lightheaded; I can best compare the feeling to that of being tipsy after a glass or two of wine. I waited another twenty minutes at the site to see if the feeling worsened, and when it didn&#39;t, I left without telling anyone how I felt. During the drive home, however, I continued to feel lightheaded during the drive home and worried that it might be affecting my driving. After I got home without incident, the feeling persisted for a few hours and ceased that evening.  Since then, I have experienced nothing but what I think are standard post-vaccination symptoms (fatigue, muscle aches, slight brain fog, swollen lymph nodes?not unlike the sensations of recovering from a modest cold). I nevertheless want to report the lightheadedness because it appears (based on news reports) that it is an unusual reaction to the vaccine. I want to make sure that my experience is recorded, even though I do not believe that I require further medical attention.

                                                Woke up at 12:00am today with headache, lots of discomfort (especially in stomach), and for the most part could only fall back asleep for short intervals while being awake most of the night.   At around 2:30am, could barely walk into the front room. Just very slowly and painfully. Ended up in such a state that I absentmindedly urinated onnthe bathroom floor while pulling pant leg up to scratch an itch while urinating in toilet. Laying on back caused butt and thighs to hurt significantly more. Same for stomach. Getting up from and laying down on my floor mattress was and still is difficult.   Later into the morning at around 6:40am, had to crawl slowly on hands and knees to get back in the front room. By around 8am, I could walk around without it being unbearable. Just slow-ish. Ate breakfast, so stomach is more uncomfortable than in pain. Can lay on it without too much problem, but butt is still hurting. Stretching legs forward caused some pain.  Possible fever.

                                                Around 6 pm the same day I received the J&amp;J shot I started to feel chilly and a little nausea. I went for a walk for about 40 mins started to feel worse. I had body aches throughout my back and chest and in both arms, was freezing. Tried to eat dinner but couldn?t, too much pain and increased nausea. Tried to lay down, but began having a fast heartbeat and fast/some difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. Continued feeling horrible with a fever of 100.7, nausea, headache pains throughout chest back and arms, freezing, and my arms and legs felt like they were becoming numb. Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

                                                At 10 pm I started to experience some moderate body aches. By 1 am, I was in so much pain I could not sleep and started to develop a fever. I drank a ton of fluids, used OTC treatments (Ibuprofen and Motrin) but nothing alleviated the pain. By 10 am I had a sustained fever over 100 degrees. I was in so much pain I was crying in bed. By 3 pm my fever reached 102 degrees. I had to go to the emergency room for IV drip and medication because I couldn&#39;t drink enough water to stay hydrated. Once given IV, my temperature plummeted. When the medication they administered wore off, my body started experiencing mild to moderate pains again. Body aches and soreness all over- my muscles feel like they are being squeezed from the inside. I am still feeling a lot of fatigue and pain but it is random and comes and goes along with &#34;hot flashes&#34;.

At 6:35, he said he had left arm weakness (arm he received vaccine in), fatigue, was dizzy, and felt &#34;off&#34;.  Patient did not lose consciousness and refused an ice pack.  BP checked at 6:38pm (170/98, pulse 105).  Patient stated his blood pressure usually runs high. I offered him an ice pack a second time, but he said there was no need and he felt better.  BP checked again 6:52pm (152/101, pulse 99).  I recommended that since his blood pressure is usually this high, he should follow up with his primary doctor regarding blood pressure as he may need some medication to assist in lowering it.  He said ok.  He left the pharmacy area at 7:02pm and said he was fine to leave, he did not want to remain any longer.

                                                Approximately 7 hours after the shot, Patient started shaking, mild shakes at first but then the shaking became more violent, I helped him lay down in bed as he was not able to control the shaking and his legs became stiff. I was monitoring his temperature and he did not have a fever. I was massaging his hands and legs, this went on for 45 minutes to 1 hour. When the shaking subsided, the fever started, at this point I gave him Tylenol and continued to monitor his temperature.  He is better this morning.

My adverse effects were the following throwing up, pain in the upper Portion of my neck and slight pain in my chest , and fever with chills  grandually getting worse throughout the day.  By 9:00pm - midnight I couldn?t even sleep or close my eyes to sleep because the pain was unbarring that I had to call my family for mental support.  I eventually fell asleep because of exhaustion, and Sunday I couldn?t even get out of bed my body was so worn out from the shot and the night. I stayed home all day and slept . I still  have pains in my neck and coughing becomes my issue.

The fourth and fifth day my lips and face would become tingly/numb and my left arm would get weak and I would feel a little disoriented, my sleep has been pretty disturbed. It felt like I was having a stroke. I did not have a stroke,  I continue to occasionally feel the above symptoms, a little less potent than they were, they might be going away, I can&#39;t tell. I will be calling my doctor if it continues.

                                                At 6:00 PM 3/12 I began to feel slightly dizzy. It did not effect my ability to stand or move around very much, but my head did feel strange and if I turned to quickly I would need a second to gather myself. However, it was not severe enough to force me to sit or lay down. By 7:00-7:30 I began to feel hot and uncomfortable and I took my temperature at 7:30 and I was running a low grade fever at 99.8 degrees F. I began to feel very fatigued and was in bed by 9:00 PM. I woke up feeling fine and my temperature at 7:00 AM 3/13 is 97.8 degrees F. My only possible side effect this morning (3/12 as I write this) is that I am mildly stiff, mostly in my left arm, neck, and back (the side of the injection site). Despite the mild fever I did not feel any nausea, nor did I have difficulty breathing. Overall the side effects were mild but uncomfortable.

Slept until 11:15pm and woke up to violent shivering, pounding headache, full body aches, sore skin, achey joints, nausea, swelling tongue and throat. Took 1 dose of nyquil and then tossed and turned all night, very little sleep, symptoms persisted into the next day, but shivering stopped in the night. By morning (3-14) registered a fever of 100.3 which persisted most of the day along with remaining lessening symptoms. By evening I was still very sore, bad headache, and very lethargic/fatigued. Next morning (3-15) low temp of 97.1 degrees, headache, fatigue, lightheaded. Still feel headachy and tired.

This lasted for about 12 hours and I woke up with a slight fever which then subsided. Later the following day I felt fine again.   Essentially, when the symptoms were most intense, I felt like I did when I contracted Covid in March of 2020

The severe headache continued throughout the rest of the week 5-6 days. During days 5 &amp; 6 I noticed new symptoms- a feeling pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists. In addition, I noticed (2) bloody stools over days 5 &amp; 6 - 1 each day in the morning.  Both symptoms seemed to have gone away after day 6. However, pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists and headaches has been noticeable intermitately since. No distinct or identified activities or food-related timing during or causing the onset of the pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists or headaches symptoms thus far.

                                                I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at roughly 2:15pm on Sunday 4/11/21. I waited at the vaccination site for 30 minutes and did not have any adverse effects. I went through the rest of my day without any adverse effects. I went to bed at 9:00pm. I woke up at 11:00pm with body aches and chills. I could not stop shivering. I then became very warm. I alternated between freezing/shivering and burning up all night. I felt very sore and my muscles hurt. It was primarily my upper body that hurt, not my lower body. My arms, torso, back, and neck hurt to move. I was very sensitive to everything I touched. It felt uncomfortable to touch the blankets in my bed or the water when I washed my hands. It did not hurt to do that, it just felt sensitive and uncomfortable. Around 5:00am I got a terrible headache. It felt like my head was made out of a lead ball. It hurt to move lift my head. My face hurt and felt like I had pressure. This lasted all day for Monday 4/12/21. After 5:00pm I slowly started to feel better. My body aches went away. I still had a headache, but it was far less severe. It is approximately 7:00am on 4/13/21 as I am filling this out. I still have a minor but persisting headache. My left arm is sore at the injection site. I am feeling much better than I was.

At day 7 I started to feel sharp, cramps, tingly sensation and numbness in different parts of my legs, arms feet and hands. I also had headaches and felt dizzy. Headaches went away by day 15, but the pain, tingly sensation and fatigue in my arms and legs still remain (tomorrow it?s going to be a month since I got my shot). It gets significantly worse when I walk and I feel very fatigued after walking for about 30 minutes.  The pin has also appeared less frequently on other parts of my body, like my heart, my neck and around my rib area. Over the last two weeks my legs have also been getting itchy.

Mostly fatigued but didn&#39;t limit my ability to do normal activity things. Around 10:30pm that night, I got a 100.3 degree F fever, aggressive chills, and a headache. Woke up around 11:30 and the fever had broken (due to taking a Tylenol before bed).   Day after vaccine, heaviness in left arm (injection arm). General fatigue and headache. Most prevalent symptom was achy body.

                                                Joints began feeling achy and body felt tired within a few hours of vaccination. About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

My eyes felt like they were being pushed out of their sockets. My body hurt. It hurt to move. My neck , knees, ankles and back were in shooting dull pain. It took everything I had to stand up. I couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I had a fever. I started to shiver. My thought raced. It began to hurt to breath. My lower chest is sore on the inside where the lungs meets the rib cage.   I could not to go class or do any work. Was easily one of the worst nights of my life.

Then within a week of shot began to develop mild tingling and/or squeezing sensation primarily in arms/hands. Comes and goes throughout the day and has appeared daily since within a week of the shot. Occasionally the same feeling is felt in feet, but primarily/regularly felt in arms. Not overly painful, but noticeable.

                                                The day of the vaccine I had full body aches which went away. Three days after the vaccine I started to get soreness in my upper back, the left side of neck stretching to the left shoulder and down my  left arm.  It feels like a muscle pain it is on a 5-6 on the pain scale. The pain is worse about midday and in the afternoon and early evening. I have tried Tylenol and I was prescribed some Muscle Relaxants which I haven&#39;t tried yet. I have had a couple of occasions of pain on the right side but not much. I have been referred to PT and Massage Therapy. It has been there now for four weeks and the pain is still the same and happening daily.

Took Tylenol and that helped lower the body aches...but only lasted 4-6 hours.

                                                I typically faint when getting shots or blood drawn. I did faint about 10 seconds after the initial shot injection. I was conscious throughout but was not able to speak clearly or control my body even though I could hear everything going on around me. After 30 minutes, I was feeling back to normal. The remainder of the day I felt drowsy and a little out of it. At 12:15am I began to get severe chills and shakes. This lasted throughout the night but was the worst from about 12:15-1:00am. I woke up at 4am with a fever and sweating. My entire body was stiff and in pain with aches specifically in my arms and legs. Very sore pain in my left deltoid where the shot was injected and is still slightly sensitive. It felt like my veins were stiff and in pain and it hurt to move. I had what I can describe as flu like symptoms (i.e. my teeth hurt, my body ached, fever, shakes, body stiffness and overall tiredness and weakness). These all lasted until about 6:30am at the worst and were relieved over the next few hours. I started to feel back to normal around 3pm later that day. That was April 11th. Last night, April 12th, I had trouble sleeping because my left arm was in pain from my elbow to fingers. It was a lingering pain that went away by this morning and  is mostly gone now (morning April 13th).

                                                About 15 minutes after the injection I felt light headed and my chronic back pain was completely gone. Around 5 hours after injection I was overcome with extreme lethargy and had to sleep. 8 hours after injection I woke up very nauseous and could not stop salivating, however I never puked. I woke up again 18 hours after injection and felt nauseous and my chronic back pain had returned. I also had a weird throbbing pain in the right side of my neck and in the lower left side of my left leg. All symptoms were gone by ~36 hours after the injection.

                                                I opted for the J&amp;J variant and received it on Monday at 1:00 PM, mere hours before they pulled distribution of it on the national level.  I started feeling flu like fatigue, body aches, and a headache 8 hours post injection. I ran a 101&#43; fever Monday night and got less than 4 hours sleep due to fever and fairly intense muscle aches. On Tuesday morning the headache, fever and muscle aches persisted till the late evening accompanied by general fatigue. By 9:00 on Tuesday night I was feeling significant improvement and slept well Tuesday night with minor night sweats on and off. Wednesday morning I felt 80% back to normal. No fever, minor headache only evident when standing up quickly or sudden head movement, and continued muscles aches body wide specifically in the neck and chest as well as injection site muscle soreness. These symptoms continue to persist into Thursday at the same or perhaps slightly elevated levels. Friday 4/15 symptoms persist with generalized soreness, fatigue, headache,  injection site soreness. Not his typical self.

                                                I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 7 hours post-vaccination. Symptoms started with severe chills, elevated heart rate, fever (~102), and progressed into muscle and joint soreness, severe migraine with sensitivity to light, and strong fatigue, coupled with insomnia. The symptoms were severe enough that I considered going to the hospital, but ultimately did not. Fever, chills, and elevated heart rate subsided by the next morning (~12 hours after onset), but muscle soreness, migraine, and fatigue lasted for another 12-24 hours, along with a loss of appetite.  I am an otherwise healthy, male adult with no outstanding medical conditions whatsoever. This was one of the most severe immune responses I have ever had, including actual illnesses. I have received other vaccinations in the past and never had any response nearly as severe. I was significantly concerned for my overall health during the height of the vaccine response, and I wanted to report this to ensure that is aware of these types of responses, and can help prepare others by informing them adequately of the types of responses to expect from the vaccine. This response very much took me by surprise in terms of severity -- I had to call out of work at a critical time.

                                                This is a comprehensive neurological evaluation for a very pleasant right handed 32 year old gentleman who denies any past medical history who presents to the hospital with several day progressive visual changes and facial weakness. Patient reports he noted on Saturday that he had somewhat of a headache, he does get headaches from time to time in particular while looking at screens the television, he did have some associated blurring of his vision as well. This was not the worst headache of his life. He had no other associated symptoms. He went to bed on Saturday, he awoke on Sunday and went out to eat and noted that he couldn&#39;t form his mouth around the utensil, his face and lips and mouth felt weak. He still did have an intermittent headache and perhaps some neck pain as well at this point. His vision was still blurry. He denies any recent trauma, no car accident no whiplash no falls. He did go to an outside facility where a CT brain was performed and was normal he was told. He has noted yesterday that he could not close his eyes unless he did it manually, also he notes the way his voice sounds is different to him. He has not appreciated any weakness of his arms or legs. He is able to lift up his head off the bed without trouble. He does not think he has a hard time swallowing or breathing per se however he does describe that he is more &#34;aware&#34; of his breathing. He describes paresthesias of his face and around his mouth. No recent URI or diarrheal/GI illness, he did receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID -19 vaccine March 31st. Seen and evaluated in the ED with ed staff. He does report he recently ran a virtual type marathon over the course of 16 days. Clinical context and exam most consistent with that of GBS type variant (?Miller Fisher).  Treated with IVIG.  Symptoms improved after 1 dose.  4 more doses pending.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine JJ: 32 y.o. male w/ no PMH presenting 2 weeks after receiving his Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine after having severe L calf pain found to have thrombocytopenia.    From H&amp;P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&amp;J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation. As he has had 2 negative US for DVT, unlikely that he has an unresolved DVT. abdominal and head CT are neg for thrombosis.

Starting approx. 3 days after vaccination, patient started noticing altered smell and taste, which has gotten worse in the 14 days since vaccination. Patient also has fatigue and has been experiencing weakness since vaccination. These symptoms are identical to the symptoms the patient had with COVID (starting ~3 weeks after contracting COVID and lasting over a month). The patient contracted COVID in December 2020 and had fully recovered prior to vaccination. Recrudescence of symptoms appears to be due to immunological response to the vaccine.

Took acetaminophen day of vaccination, which helped, and soreness has lessened over time, but still lingers. Morning after vaccination:  Muscle aches, chills, feverish.

                                                I first felt the usual dead arm feeling and then that quickly progressed into a full-blown hot flash/feverish feeling accompanied by a splitting headache that I had last all of last night. Now I still have a minor headache and a dead arm after taking Tylenol (Rapid Release).    I also felt very weak and fatigued all night with a dry mouth and  plugged up sinus. Felt like I was going to be knocked out for 24 hours. I can hardly do these basic task on my work laptop.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First day after getting the shot I got a feeling of being very tired throughout the day I did not feel like to do anything. Also my arm was very very sore. Even moving it slightly a bit would hurt. The second day is when things got way worse I could not really sleep that well throughout the night because I noticed I had  body aches in my legs and my back. Throughout that day I also felt like I had a fever in the morning I took my temperature and had a 100 fever. At night time I took my temperature and it went up to 102, with  still a bad headache, chills, and body aches throughout my legs mostly. I also felt some palpitations. When I went to bed I was sweating very prefusively all night that I had to change my shirt. On the third day I felt a lot better, still with a slight headache no fever, and still feeling like im sweating on and off.

                                                As soon as I woke up, I read the Janssen pause news from my bed. I got up to go to the bathroom and upon finishing, I felt my heart rate skyrocket and felt faint. I immediately went back to the bed where I lost consciousness. My wife said my eyes were open and my body was rigid. I came too within a minute of that and was breathing heavy and sweating and very fatigued. My wife had called 911 as I was coming back to consciousness. The EMTs checked my vitals and all was normal. They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and I said no. My back was extremely sore all day, and I developed small red spots around my eyes. I went to my doctor later that day and told them about it. They took my blood for tests, which I have not heard back about, and they did not conclude anything, but did set me up with an appointment for an MRI of my head, given my past history.

On 5/4/21 the pain was unbearable and there was swelling in my calf/ankle.  On 5/5/21 I got an ultrasound that confirmed I have a DVT blood clot in my right calf and I got blood work done that confirmed everything was normal with my health (liver function, platelet counts...).  I was prescribed Xarelto 15mg and began taking Xarelto on 5/8/21.

I recovered well enough to drive home within 15 minutes afterwards. That night (10pm) I began shivering, which escalated to periods of convulsions, to which a mouth guard was needed to prevent chipping teeth and/or biting my tongue. There was no fever present, and to subside the uncontrollable shivering I sat in a very hot shower until motor functions gradually returned.

Around 1700, fatigue returned. Took a 3 mile walk between 1700-1800. Consumed two beers @ 7% ABV between 1800-1845. Around 1830 began feeling tingling, chills and muscle and joint pain which continues. The pain is similar to DOMS that occurs after a robust workout; did not have a robust workout today. I&#39;m fully functional, able to eat and able to otherwise function, so the symptoms are manageable.

                                                High fever (101.8 degrees F) in evening on the day of vaccination. Severe chills leading to difficult to control teeth chattering. Muscle weakness. Nausea &amp; vomiting. Symptoms felt very similar to flu.  Slept for ~11 hours, and was largely recovered in the morning (mild headache &amp; tiredness remains the next day)

Slept poorly all night due to body pains. Woke to muscle aches and slight join pains, which worsened throughout the day. Low grade temperature appeared at noon the day after the shot, and stayed into the night. Headache began around 5PM and got worse. Tylenol helped at 7PM. Slept from 7:30PM to 7:30AM. Felt back to normal by morning.

                                                About 6/7 hours after the vaccination, I experienced fairly violent chills/shakes and the beginnings of a headache. I went to bed and woke some hours later with a 101-102-degree fever and muscle/joint aches (at the injection site on my left arm and throughout my body; I especially thought the joint aches in my legs and hands).  Now, about 27 hours after the vaccination, my fever has reduced to 99 degrees, my chills/shakes are gone, and my headache is mostly gone. The primary symptoms I have are the remaining sight fever, continued joint/muscle aches (mostly in my legs) and fatigue.

                                                I received vaccine about 4:00 PM. I felt fine until I went to bed about 10:30 P.M. I got extremely teeth chattering cold and could not get warm and began to have a small headache. I awoke about 2:30 A.M. and was extremely hot. I went downstairs to bathroom and the next thing I know my wife is shaking me to wake me up laying on the floor. My wife said she heard me fall and discovered me in the bathroom floor. She woke me up and I stood up and exited the bathroom and collapsed in the hallway. My wife awoke me again and I didn&#39;t know what occurred. My wife called 911 and EMS responded and assessed my condition. I explained everything that occurred and that I had my J&amp;J vaccine hours earlier.  My vitals were taken and my condition was evaluated. I had a bad headache that felt like my head was in a vise and my knees and chins hurting a bit from the fall I was fine. I just did not recall collapsing either time and I was distraught when my wife woke me both times. That&#39;s what I was informed by my wife. I don&#39;t recall anything after urinating to being woken up by my wife and I was on laying on the hallway floor and my wife was on the phone with 911.

My left arm is extremely tingly, almost as if it?s asleep. As of this evening (4/18/21 around 7:30 PM), I am also experiencing this tingly sensation on the left of my face as well. It feels like pins and needles, and is very bizarre.  I?m extremely confident in saying it?s in direct correlation to the shot.  Please advise.

He both of them and regarding his transplant management.  He is on immunosuppressive medications.  He is here today out of concern for exposure to COVID.  He was vaccinated with Johnson Johnson vaccine on  3/4.  He is here cause overnight he started developed fever headache sore throat muscle aches.  If continued through today.  He was test in the outpatient setting but the results have not yet returned.  He is here today with continued symptoms.  He is well-appearing on exam but mildly tachycardic, low-grade temperature here no significant increased work of breathing no conversational dyspnea lungs are clear heart is regular but tachycardic without murmur he has no signs or symptoms of DVT currently.  His chest x-ray shows all isolated left lower lobe infiltrate.  His labs are unremarkable with normal renal function, normal electrolytes but is rapid COVID test is positive.  Given his immunosuppressive status in infiltrate seen on x-ray initially recommended admission for observation even though he is not initially on any supplemental oxygen is work of breathing is quite comfortable.  I was able to discuss with his transplant surgeon In addition I talked to admitting physician who then discussed with pulmonology here .  In their opinion the best management for the patient would be to provide him with the monoclonal antibody treatment but this can only be performed in the outpatient setting given he has no increased work of breathing no supple ox requirement currently that he is stable for discharge.  He has a pulse monitor at home will also enroll him in a COVID home program.  Pulmonology will call him for follow-up tomorrow.  When I discussed with  they currently do not have any beds available at the hospital for transport.  The patient does not want to go to an outside facility that has a transplant team other than the risks of.  Ultimately the patient would like to go home.  I will add doxycycline for bacterial possibility of his pneumonia seen on x-ray today.  He also had very strict return precautions.  He understands likely had a possibility of worsening symptoms understands to return immediately if any new or worsening symptoms or no improvement.  Patient was given the monoclonal antibody treatment in the ER after ordered by Dr..  He will ultimately be discharged with very close follow-up.

                                                During the evening around 6pm after I started developing symptoms consistent with the flu.    Fever reached 104 around 8pm.  Uncontrollable chills also were present.  A severe headache followed.  I took fever reducing meds immediately. Confusion and trouble breathing happened during the fever and chills period.  An attempt to go to the hospital was unsuccessful because I lost consciousness while attempting to find phone/car keys.   After I woke up, I felt less confused and could catch my breath, so I decided to take more fever reducing meds and see how I felt in a few hours - this was around 11pm.  Around midnight my fever broke and the chills stopped, but the headache was at the worst it&#39;s been. The headache lasted the entire next day as well.      I wanted to go to the doctor, but was physically unable to and had no one to alert.  I do feel better today.  I have some weak headaches that come and go, along with muscle aches, but I feel that they are minor enough.

I went to the the emergency room and they did some tests and the results were normal. I have been taking some Tylenol and it helped a little. It has been four weeks and I still get the pain intermittently for a couple of hours every day and it is mostly in my back. It is a little less frequent but not much better.

                                                Beginning the evening of the vaccine pt spiked a fever, experienced migraine-like symptoms and excessive joint pain in the hips. That evening sleep was irregular with waves of chills and excessive sweating.  The following day a headache continued until about 12pm and then the body seemed to go back to normal.  Two days after the initial vaccine there has remained consistent muscle weakness in OS (left) knee and numbness in OS leg from the knee down. There is also infrequent dizziness. Both symptoms are becoming more regular.

                                                Violent chills happened while working on computer. Laid on heat pad to assist in bed. Chills lasted about 20 minutes. Parasthesia happened immediately. Myalgia in legs happened immediately. No fever at this time.  Woke in morning with no fever, but muscle aches, malaise, lethargy, parasthesia were all present. Spent entire day in bed napping occasionally.  Measured temperature in evening at 100.7F.  Painful stomach pain happened in evening. Patient never gets acid pain or similar so this was very abnormal. Antacid helped but stomach pain continued all evening at a lesser degree.  When going to bed most symptoms had subsided. Still some parasthesia and Myalgia. Woke up on 4/9 feeling much better after lots of sleep.  No fever or other symptoms on morning of 4/9.

                                                While exercising on the morning of 4/11, received a sudden, severe headache on the left side of my head. It started in my neck, moved up through my skull, and ended above my left eye. The feeling gradually improved with time, stretching, and acetaminophen. For more than 24 hours, a mild feeling persisted. On 4/13, the left side of my neck is still stiff and my left eye has a light throbbing.

                                                On the evening of 4/8/2021 at around 8 pm I began experiencing an upset stomach (felt like I might throw up) and then shaking in my stomach started and I got a lot of chills and a headache.  Then I spiked a very high fever and sweat like crazy.  I was shaking like crazy and had to call a doctor on call twice.  I had full body pain and was very sleepy.  The fever and chills lasted a bit over 2 days but unfortunately the pain  in my body had not gone away.  Currently (4/14/2021) I have pain in all my joints and my neck and back and I noticed a rash around my right knee. I have felt very tired. I have felt some mild shortness of breath, which may be seasonal allergies (discussed with a nurse earlier, my oxygen levels are 98 percent today, so I am breathing fine, but there is a sensation of shortness of breath) . I have consulted my primary care office about the above and they are speaking to the doctor.  I am trying to limit my exposure to any hospital setting until the 14 days (2 weeks) is up from the vaccine.  Hopefully these symptoms will go away soon and hopefully none are related to a blood clot issue.  We&#39;ll see if my doctor or you guys may recommend a future platelet test?

                                                Two days following vaccination I started having tingling in my feet.  Often it felt like pins and needles, and eventually more like a burning sensation.  My understanding is generally we would refer to this as neuropathy.  It comes and goes in my hands as well.  I&#39;ve had some significant leg pain in my hip off and on, and a couple of headaches, but the consistent for more than  two weeks has been the neuropathy issue and it is not going away.

The top half of my spine has discomfort at its best and mild/modern pain the rest of the time. It&#39;s constant. At times my spine feels cold and tingly. Then my entire core gets cold and tingly. I&#39;ve never had back pain or injured my back. This pain is directly related to the vaccine and my experience seems to be outside the norm of side effects subsiding after a couple days.

                                                For 2 days, typical arm soreness, flu-like symptoms with significant muscle pain and general weakness and malaise. However, on the 5th day, EXTREME abdominal pain, left side. Pain level up to 9. Incapacitating. Two visits to urgent care. This was in March before any info came out about adverse blood clot events for the J&amp;J vaccine, so the doctors were not really interested at the time that I had just gotten my shot. They gave me antibiotics, thinking it may be diverticulitis (diagnosis based on symptoms only - no diagnostics - it was the doctor&#39;s &#34;best guess&#34;). Pain did not subside, only got worse. 4 days later I could barely move, abdominal pain was extreme. Went back to clinic and they did a PET scan to check for diverticulitis. There was none; PET scan revealed nothing out of the ordinary. So they told me they had no idea what it was and sent me home. PET scan reading by the doctor notes specifically that blood/vascular was not able to be observed because no contrast or dyes were used. Bottom line was over 10 days of extreme abdominal pain 5 days after receiving the shot. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like that before.

                                                I started to feel extreme fatigue around noon the day after but what I found very concerning is I lost probably 80-90% of the strength in my arms.  I couldn&#39;t palm a ball i had for the kids which i normally can easily.  I had chills and nausea as well.    I can&#39;t really remember much from that day and it feels like a big blur.  I woke up the next day feeling very irritable with brain fog.  Today its gotten better and I am hoping tomorrow I will be back to normal.

                                                Got the vaccine around 10:30am, felt ok until around 7:30pm, when I started feeling some nausea and dizziness and weakness. Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

One week ago, on Friday, March 26, he received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for Covid 19. That day he felt fine. The following day he had some muscle aches. Sunday he states he had some slight shortness of breath, only for that day. Then he had some fever and chills feeling. That resolved. The only symptoms that persisted was his muscle aching and tightness. Then yesterday, the day of his presentation to the ER, he noted some bilateral lower extremity edema which prompted his visit. He is feeling mostly fine except a bit of muscle tightness. BNP was 154. Chest x-ray showed pneumonitis. He received antibiotics. Echocardiogram was completed showing preliminary findings of small to moderate pericardial effusion and trace aortic insufficiency.  Will treat with colchicine and ibuprofen.

By about 10am the shivering/chills had subsided enough to be able to get out of bed and get Tylenol for the headache. This helped get some sleep. At about 1pm was the first time I checked my temperature and it read 102 orally. By this point the sore muscles had mostly subsided, but the headache and fever persisted until almost 11pm on the dot. The fever dropped from 102 to normal in under an hour.

I felt nauseous and thought I would vomit, but didn&#39;t and believe I lost consciousness again. I was able to make it to the sink to try to wash my hands, and I fell down on my knees. I knew I was bleeding somewhere but didn&#39;t know from where (my right pinky was cut on an item in the bathroom when I fell). My wife made it to me, and I lost consciousness a couple more times while talking with her. I laid on the bathroom floor for a

                                                4/1 pt complained of not feeling well after Janssen vaccine. Patient had a syncopal episode while at monitoring tent, patient was trying to lay down on medical bay cot but ended up falling back and passing out. Pt was clammy and pale. Heart rate 42, spO2 99%. Pt oriented to self but not time or place. EMT arrive to further evaluate patient, BP 90/60. heart-rate 55, respirations 18. Patient refused to go to hospital, felt well enough to go back to work. Charge nurse followed up with patient later that day, patient was still at work and said he felt a lot better.   One week later pt reached out on 4/8/2021 to inform on potential side effects. On the night of 4/7/2021 he began to develop hives/rash, and itchiness around the neck and legs. Next morning 4/8/2021 rash had worsened and pt had also developed swelling in the face and wrists. Pt was brought to urgent care where he was treated with prednisone. Pt was prescribed 20mg prednisone tablet twice a day. Charge nurse from day of vaccine followed up with patient, he will continue to take prednisone as prescribed and will follow up with allergist. Pt claims the itchiness is less, as well as, the swelling. Appreciates the follow-up phone-call and claims to feel better, will update us if any changes.

The house was 68 F, and I bundled up with thermal underwear, fleece pajamas, a robe, and two extra blankets, but I couldn&#39;t stop feeling cold.  My body was painfully sore the rest of the night; this may have been a reaction from shivering so hard and wearing my muscles out.  Later that night, I woke up in a sweat (maybe 11:30pm) and had to strip out of my clothes down to my underwear, and I couldn&#39;t stop feeling warm.  I slept the rest of the night on top of the covers, and woke up very frequently, probably every half hour.  Each time I woke, I drank half a glass of water (about 6 oz).  The next day my fever was gone and I felt normal temperature wise, but my muscles were all very sore.  I had flu-like symptoms for about a week, a little bit less each day.  It was probably a full week later until I felt normal.

                                                Hi I was vaccinated Thursday April 8th 2021 at approximately 9:15am. I kept a log so I could share my experience with my friends and family. After vaccination I was fine for a few hours but I randomly got a case of  watery eyes that would last about 15 minutes and then clear up. This happened 4 times over a 9 hour period. Around 9 hours after vaccination I started to feel like I had a cold and my skin all over my body ached to touch and my heart started racing. I felt sunburned and nauseous and went to bed. 13 hours exactly after vaccination I was hit hard with intense chills to the point of teeth chattering and full body shivering. 15 hours after injection I woke up intensely hot and I had a massive headache, full body pain, a tickle deep in my lungs that made me cough, nausea, and a fever of 101. I also was having extreme heart palpitations. I have a laser thermometer and I discovered my fever was 101.5 at my forehead but my neck and chest were 103. I took ibuprofen and kept patting myself with cold wet wash cloths to combat the fever. At this point I debated going to the hospital. I had intense fatigue and I was too weak to move but too sick to sleep. This level of fever and symptoms went on for about a day and a half. Since my vaccination I am still fatigued, I get winded very easily, something small like feeding my dog makes me break out in a sweat, and I need to lay down. I am still weak and fatigued but not to the same level as before and it changes every day. I have a sore throat, headaches, occasionally my body will twitch in random places, fever will pop up and go away, I cough gag and get very weak under any physical stress. I did not have injection site pain out of the ordinary until 48 hours after injection and it felt like a shotgun blast to the arm.. I did have very unusual joint pain from the start. I was injected in my upper left arm, but my lower right ankle was painful and my left wrist...    I am a 38 year old male with treated hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea. My mother who is 65 was vaccinated at the same time as myself and her symptoms were slow onset and much milder than mine but she too has headaches, upset stomach, fatigue, watery eyes, fever, chills, twitches, injection pain, etc.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, about 12:30am on 03/28/21 I felt a chills, shaky muscles around my neck/shoulders..the room temperature was at 80F but I felt cold like 35F. The next morning, I felt very tired walking up stairs from the basement to my room on the 2nd floor..barely made it to the 2nd floor, felt like my body hitting a wall/ no energy to lift my legs up. I made to my bedroom but felt very dizzy, using my hands holding myself up on my desk and realized I might faint any seconds..my vision was bright and blurry. I slowly moved myself to a bed and laid down for a while. Later that day in the late afternoon, my muscles were sore (legs, thighs, back) I could not walk more than 10-15 steps which I needed rest. These conditions lasted me for 6 days since receiving the vaccine and felt better on the 7th day. Currently I&#39;m ok.

On Sat, May 1, I had an afib episode in the morning. Reset to sinus rhythm the next morning around 2:30am. I spoke with you during the episode.   3. On Mon, May 3, I had brain fog. I?m usually tired after an afib episode. But this seemed different. I?ve never experienced something like this before. But I chalked it out to the after effects of the afib and moved on. 4. On Fri, May 7, I started having the stiffness in my right calf. I checked in with you that weekend to make sure it wasn?t a clot. After we spoke I think we ruled out a clot.  5. In addition, I?ve developed some added symptoms since then: (i) Sweaty feet. (ii) Pins and needles sensation in feet.  (iii) Tightness in the arch of the right foot. (iv) Feet and hands feel sensitive to cold.  (v) Burning sensation in feet and left hand.  (vi) Mild headache mostly felt in the left temple.  (vii) A pulling feeling on the left side of the face. (viii) A feeling that if I close my eyes, I may faint.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.

                                                10 hours after my shot I had moderate to severe chills with pains that moved around my body. Pain would go from deep pain in my leg, to hands, to feet.  Not ache like the flu, but piercing pain.  Head ache as well. This first round lasted for 1 hour and 36 minutes.  Then, a break for almost two hours. Following that break, the next 12 hours i was achy throughout my body, headache that would come and go and very fatigued.  I was only able to get out of bed for roughly 2 hours during that 12 hour stretch. Following this I ended up getting a fever later that night that lasted for about 2 hours (100.5 at the highest).    Since that night I have had pain daily throughout my body.  They are quick, sometime sharp pains in my head, and various muscles throughout my body. I have also had deep pains as well that have come and go in random muscles in my body.
