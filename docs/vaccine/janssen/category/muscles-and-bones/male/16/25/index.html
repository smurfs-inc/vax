For a point of reference, I can barely taste anything when I swish mouthwash around in my mouth.  Pre-existing minimal chest pain (related to history of vaping) flared up to an extreme extent the night of the day I was vaccinated. Hurt more than the joint pain or headache I also have (but those are common side effects).

                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

About 7:00 pm started to shake.  This continued to get worse with severe jerking along with the uncontrollable shaking.  Had a rapid resting heart rate over 142 and a fever at 102.4.  Was incoherent, mumbling his words and not making any sense. Went to ER at 8:48 pm they did blood work, urine test and started an IV.  They weren&#39;t sure what was going on and first accused of doing drugs then wanted to do a spinal tap. His father stopped that and again told them it was from the covid vaccine. They finally gave him a shot of Ketorolac 30mg and LORazepan 1 mg. They sent him home and told him to take tylenol for his fever. spontaneous shaking kept on until late 3/11, along with a fever.  Friday 3/12 he is feeling better, fever has broke but not quite 100%.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the vaccine (around 2am) I had a fever, chills, headache, sore arm, and muscle soreness. I fell back asleep and when I woke up the fever had broken and the chills had improved but the soreness and headache remained. I took Tylenol in the afternoon and that helped the symptoms but by the time I had gone to bed the chills had returned but not a fever. When I woke up in the middle of the night (night 2) the chills had stopped and I woke up with a moderate headache and sweating profusely. After falling asleep and awaking in the morning I felt much better with the exception of a minor headache.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

Almost immediately he collapsed to the floor before we could grab him. He fell face first onto the floor. He moaned and shook. With the assistance of a medic and police office, he was rolled onto his back and his feet were elevated. He started to regain consciousness. EMTs were called to assess him after his head hit the floor. He was monitored by EMTs for 30 minutes. He refused to go to the hospital and was instructed to call 911 if he had additional symptoms.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Roughly 1 hour after vaccination I started to experience nausea and fatigue. The fatigue continued for several hours until about 6-8 hours after vaccination. At that point I started to experience chills, muscle aches, and rash on my left arm (at injection site region) and over other parts of my body. Temperature at that time was still within normal range but close to 10 hours after I began to run a fever. Highest temperature at its peak was 100.3F. These symptoms continued into the night but began to considerably subside in the morning, close to 24 hours after vaccination. At this point, 26 hours after, I still feel mild muscle aches and a mild headache.
