                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

I took Tylenol and used an ice pack on my head to help the fever subside. After about 20 minutes I began to feel better and was able to then lay down and rest a little more comfortably.

                                                It is now the next day, and I feel significantly better. I have pain at the injection site, some muscle fatigue, a little bit of a depleted appetite, tiredness in my eyes and head (likely due to lack of quality sleep), and a bit of sweating, but my pain has reduced to maybe a 2/10 or 1/10 (i.e., not even uncomfortable). I did end up getting decent sleep between 2 AM and 12 PM with only a few interruptions of family members checking on me. The only notable pain that is worrying me is abnormal soreness in my right wrist that is not the result of overuse, overextension, etc., although I was able to take care of that pain with another 3 Advil pills. I am considering scheduling a doctor&#39;s appointment, as I know the J&amp;J vaccine got recalled today for blood clots. My assumption is that because I am a healthy 20-year-old, my immune system overreacted to the vaccine, but I want to check to make sure that it doesn&#39;t cause any additional health problems.

Splotches were dark purple.  Went to clinic, they were unsure of the cause.  Waited a day and then went to another clinic where they thought it might be Coxsackievirus, except there were no sores in the mouth and the splotches were on the palms and pads of the feet.  The splotches faded over the next 2 weeks, the last place they were visible were on the upper arm,  torso and thighs.

I took Tylenol in the afternoon and that helped the symptoms but by the time I had gone to bed the chills had returned but not a fever. When I woke up in the middle of the night (night 2) the chills had stopped and I woke up with a moderate headache and sweating profusely. After falling asleep and awaking in the morning I felt much better with the exception of a minor headache.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

Overnight, patient experienced fever, chills, aches, and persistent vomiting. The following day, patient continued to experience aches, tiredness, and chills. Symptoms resolved approximately 48 hours post-vaccine. Patient states they have never felt so terrible in their life and will not be getting additional covid-19 booster shots, etc.

Then pain throughout my arms like pins and needles  began about 8 hours later. I self treated with Tylenol. After going to bed, I woke at 5am nauseous and in pain. I was freezing  even though I would normally be fine. I was shaking which made the pain in all of my limbs and back hurt more. The day following the injection, the pain and nausea didn&#39;t go away. It hurt to pick up and hold things. It is now two days after injection and I keep fighting nausea after eating. I keep stretching and it barely keeps the soreness in my arm at bay. I can feel my hands starting to cramp just from typing this even though I would normally be fine.

I was walking across my room and passed out waking up on the floor. Muscle cramps and tightness followed this.  I could not move my muscles for roughly 12 hours. After 24 hours from receiving vaccine these extreme symptoms seemed to fade and I was left with fatigue, soreness and fever as expected. This lasted for the next 3 days

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  The vaccine was given at 10:45 AM. At 4:00 PM I began feeling nauseous. At 9:00 or 10:00 PM I began feeling both muscle and joint pain on my upper body which made it somewhat difficult to sleep. After one or two hours of sleep at 1:00 AM I woke up with a fever, headache, and worse muscle and joint pain (upper body only). When I woke up I was sweating profusely that the bed was lightly wet and extremely hot from all the heat my body was letting go. An ice pack can relieve the headache and fever. However, I was still not able to sleep. At 4:00 AM I made the decision to consume 800 mg of ibuprofen and it took 20 minutes for my headache and fever to go away. Yet, after being able to sleep for 30 minutes, I woke up again to the same headache and fever. Around 10:00 AM the symptoms were partly gone and was finally able to get sleep after a long night.

The fatigue continued for several hours until about 6-8 hours after vaccination. At that point I started to experience chills, muscle aches, and rash on my left arm (at injection site region) and over other parts of my body. Temperature at that time was still within normal range but close to 10 hours after I began to run a fever. Highest temperature at its peak was 100.3F. These symptoms continued into the night but began to considerably subside in the morning, close to 24 hours after vaccination. At this point, 26 hours after, I still feel mild muscle aches and a mild headache.

                                                At roughly 4pm the day of vaccine I started to feel generally sore in my muscles. At around 7pm I started to become light headed, had a headache, and bad muscle pain. My fever at this point measured 102f. These negative effects increased over the next few hours until I fell on the floor and couldn&#39;t get up without help from my wife. I felt like I was going to pass out every five seconds, threw up twice, my muscles kept contracting and relaxing and were intensely painful. Around 12:30am Saturday morning we went to the emergency department. I needed a wheelchair to get around. The wait at emergency was too long, and by 3am we went back home. I was feeling slightly better, but still not great, and my fever had reduced. I rested on Saturday with less severe but still considerable symptoms, and took paracetamol. Now on Sunday I feel sick and a little sore and very tired, but mostly better.

At first I thought maybe it was due to drinking coffee without food or other water (I don&#39;t regularly drink coffee but I have never had these symptoms from coffee before). However, even after eating food and drinking a sugary drink around 4:00 pm, the pins and needles remained. The symptoms began to subside at 6 pm or 7 pm.  The only other normal symptoms that I had were feeling tired on 4/8/21 and 4/9/21. Also, on 4/9/21 I had very slight muscle soreness throughout my body. I have also had difficulty concentrating which may or may not be related.

                                                (Saturday)When I came home after I received the vaccine I didn&#39;t really have anything to do, so I decided to take a nap and rest. I think after I woke up is when I started to feel the side effects. I can&#39;t remember exactly but I started feeling cold. I didn&#39;t think too much of it I just thought it was a cold day (which was quickly turning to night). Later that night I started feelinga bit dizzy and my head was hot but I still had chills. Since I had a had a blanket with me, and I think I was starting to feel what would become muscle aches, I just didn&#39;t want to move from the couch to my room. Feeling chills the rest of the night, I realized it was bad choice, since one of my family members left a window open. The cold air of the night really exacerbated my chills. Despite the cold I was still able to sleep, but the next day (Sunday) I did have a slight cough which I think was from experiencing the cold air of the night and not a side effect from the vaccine. (Sunday) This is when I really felt all the side effects. I felt weak, chills, headache, dizziness, muscle aches,(I&#39;m not sure if I had a fever, I couldn&#39;t think clearly my head felt hot). I haven&#39;t had a hangover but I think that is what it would feel like to have one. I basically slept most of day Sunday ; This time in my room with  3 blankets (light blankets )and heat up (felt like 80°F under blankets). I was sweating under the blankets but it really helped warm me up and alleviate my chills. I woke up later that day to a call to help my sister with some work. I couldn&#39;t drive, felt weak and dehydrated(dark orange/yellow pee), but she insisted so she picked me up and scolded me for not eating anything all day(besides the side effects I mention, I think I may have also lost my appetite because I felt dizzy). I was still feeling my head aching after I woke up, still had muscle aches and a slight cough too. It was raining that day so I put on a winter coat with layers underneath to help with my chills. At her home she gave me a Gatorade (and water) which I think really helped since I was sweating a lot under the blankets when I fell asleep. She also gave me some home cooked meals she made. The combination of drinks, food, and familial concern really helped me recover. By Monday my cough was gone and the side effects had worn off to the point that I could go to work safely.   My mother &amp; father also received vaccine at the same time I got it. My father also experienced side effects but his started later with the most effects felt on Tuesday. My mother did not get any side effects.

Went to bed around 10:30 and woke up about 3 hours later at 1:30. Had chills and was shaking when I got up. Could not really fall back asleep. Chills turned into a fever. That morning I started to get a headache. I sounded congested at one point, but no runny nose. I also had body and joint aches.  I took Excedrin three times that day. Once in the morning, once in the afternoon, once before bed. I used zquil to sleep a little bit in the afternoon and again at night. I woke up Sunday and felt completely fine except for my arm still being sore.

The chills and muscle pain were extremely intense 6 hours after I received my vaccine. I could not stop shivering, or get warm enough. That would be followed by a feeling that I was too warm and I would begin sweating profusely. I also experienced a few additional side effects I could not find listed:   I felt especially sensitive to stimuli as if normal sensations were heightened (e.g. hot water in a shower felt painful, running fingers through my hair felt like I was having my hair pulled, I kept my eyes squinted because the sunlight through the windows felt too bright.)  I was extremely irritable and became extremely frustrated easily. I mean frustrated to an embarrassing degree over small things that didn&#39;t matter. It was inconsistent with my day-to-day temperament. It felt like an adrenaline rush came in response to the most minor of inconveniences.

                                                About 3 hours after getting the vaccine I started to feel short of breath. About 5 hours after that I got chills that made me shake all over because I got a fever of 103. Then 2 hours later my heart started to beat very rapidly and got up to 126 beats per minute, my heart was also not only beating vast but very very hard. Then throughout the night and all of the next day, I had pain in my chest on the left side and also pain in my rib area on the left side. The pain lasted for over 24 hours and because of that I went to the emergency room. It turned out they didn&#39;t find anything life threatening at the emergency room but all the pain I had was very scary and very uncomfortable. It was a terrible experience and because of it, I am telling people not to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
