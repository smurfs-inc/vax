                                                Friday night at about 10ish I suddenly got a terrible migraine, shaking uncontrollably, and my body have stiff. I tried going to bed at 11pm, but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. I got up sometime around 2am and I still had all of these along with extreme nausea. Check my temperature, it was 101.4 F. Got more blankets and tried to get some sleep, but took a while due to the migraine.   At 7:30am, the shaking was gone and the migraine was not as bad, but I still had a temperature of 99.1 F and nausea. After calling my boss and mother, I went back to sleep. Stayed in bed until about 1:45pm Saturday. By then, the migraine was manageable and nausea was not as bad, though still had a temperature of 99.9 F. Took a shower and took 2 pills of  ibuprofen.

Took a hot shower and relaxed before bed time around 10pm started to have a headache. By 10:45 when I went to sleep it was an intense headache. Under the covers my body was incredibly hot, without covers I was freezing cold. I woke up around midnight in a sweat and again around 2:30am when I called in sick to work. I then sat in my bathroom for 30 minutes, threw up once, and then feeling much better (Still had an intense headache) I drank some water and fell back asleep in my room. Today is the second day, I have a small headache, have not eaten all day, and slept most of the afternoon. I highly recommend not working out the same day of getting the vaccine, I didn&#39;t think to ask about that when I received it. I doubt I would have had this problem if I rested instead.

                                                Quick onset of nausea, stood up and hearing was lost and felt ready to faint, drank a Gatorade and water and sat on the ground. Hearing came back after 5 minutes, but moderate body shakes began and lasted an hour. Got very cold feeling and began to feel fever like. Took acetaminophen and covered up with blankets and drank water. Took a couple hour nap and woke up sweating with terrible migraine and light body shakes. Fell asleep for a few more hours and woke up not feeling feverish, but migraine and body aches. 22 hours after onset I have a light headache and body aches and am mostly feeling recovered.

                                                Initial symptoms of visual impairment, later diagnosed as visual snow, occurred on Sunday 3/28 along with a headache. Assumed it was a migraine, but after it continued on Monday 3/29 I called advise nurse and scheduled exams for my eyes. The eye doctor confirmed it seems to be experiencing symptoms of visual snow. My vision is currently still looks like static. It has not gone away.  Google search showed potential side effect of astrazeca vaccine in their report so am assuming it is also a side effect of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as this occurred as a result of receiving it.  I never had this before.

After awaking he doesn&#39;t remember the last 5 minutes. He laid down to go to sleep and was consistently hot and then cold. He does have a history of night terrors but they have remained dormant for about 2.5 years. Around 12 am he started having one of the worst night terrors I&#39;ve seen. The following morning, April 2nd 2021, he was feeling incredibly sore and the injection spot was tender. He said &#34;it feels like I got hit by a truck.&#34; Seems to be doing okay otherwise now.

Got up to use the bathroom around 5am. Upon finishing peeing while standing, I lost consciousness, falling. As a result of the fall, I fractured my cheek bone, cut open my ear, later requiring three stitches, and was concussed, resulting in a loss of memory. I was nonresponsive when my fiance found me immediately following the crash, and was rushed to the hospital  via ambulance. Upon arrival to the hospital, my fever was found to be 102 F. As a result of the fall, I have a cheek bone fracture, three stiches in my ear, and a concussion.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

                                                The patient was nervous prior to vaccine and had a needle phobia. About 5 minutes post-vaccine, the patient stated he was not feeling well and feeling warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided the patient with water and an ice pack. The patient stated he was feeling faint. The patient fainted for about 20 seconds and then became conscious again. The patient didn&#39;t have any injuries and didn&#39;t fall down. The patient was okay and he laid down and elevated his feet on a chair. He then stated that he has severe needle phobia and has fainted several times in the past with vaccine administration and blood draws. He had experienced this in the past. He was still slightly faint and requested that he be checked out. The EMT arrived and they took his vitals and checked him. By the time the EMT arrived, he was beginning to feel better and had sat up and drinking water. There were no further issues. The EMT stated he was good to head home. We followed up with patient and the patient was feeling good with no further issues.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00am on March 18, 2021 at the Community Center. By about 5:00pm, I started to feel minor flu-like symptoms, but as the night progressed it got significantly worse. Around 8-9pm, I was bedridden with the worst chills/shaking I&#39;ve ever experienced in my life. Around 9:30-10:00pm, I was filling water at my sink and projectile vomitted multiple times into the sink and could not make it to the bathroom. Subsequently, I ate a bagel and drank lots of water, knowing my vomitting could make me dehydrated. Throughout the night, I was awake and shaking, and drank and filled my water bottle repeatedly. At 8:00am, I was filling my water, and without my knowledge of awareness, fainted on my kitchen floor, dropping the Brita filter and likely hitting my head. My roommate heard the commotion and saw me passed out in our kitchen. He tried to wake me up and I phased in, but then subsequently phased out again 20-30 seconds later as I was trying to stand and likely hit my head again. My roommate eventually got me over to our couch and called EMTs. Upon their arrival, EMTs checked my pulse, which was fine, and saw an open laceration on the back of my head, so they took me to Hospital to access the Trauma Center. On the way, I threw up repeatedly and was very lightheaded. Upon my arrival at Hospital, I was checked for any neck bone breaks, given an IV, a CT  scan, an EKG, and staples were placed in the back of my head to heal the laceration. After my release, I was bedridden for 2-3 days and required a daily nap during work (1-2) hours for the next 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. For a while, everything was fine, but recently during the first two weeks of April, it has become apparent that my head is foggy and reacts to changes in the weather, which leads me to believe that I likely banged my head pretty good when I fainted those two times.

Then he felt like he fell asleep until the person checking him called at him.  He had some vision and hearing impairment at the beginning, then after 10 minutes he was better. His arm was hot, he was sweating, his skin was turning white color.

                                                Existing facial dermal filler (restylane) became inflamed and sensitive. Swelling lasted throughout the day and had mostly resolved by the same evening with ibuprofen, while still tender to the touch. No medical attention was sought as I determined it was a non-emergency.

                                                I asked the patient how he felt after the injection and he said that he felt a little lightheaded and nauseous.  He said he had a little too much to drink last night because his buddies were moving West.  I asked him to lay on the floor but he refused.  He said, &#34;I just want to sit for a while&#34;.  Within minutes the patient turned pale and started twitching. I asked another pharmacist to help to move him to the ground.  911 was called while patient was on the ground lying sideways because I was afraid that he may choke on his vomit.  In a few minutes, patient sat up and asked for a bucket to throw up in.  The Fire department came and took his blood pressure  (BP120/?) and asked him some questions. They his blood pressure was good and advised him not to drive home.  They helped him to get back on the chair. He stayed in the vaccination booth for us to keep an eye out until his friend showed up to take him home (30 minutes later). We had a male associate escort him out because he said he was still nauseous.

                                                Shortly after (4 days) receiving the vaccine I began to experience leg pain and minor cramping, in addition to mild general pain. This continued for about 1 week. I still have occasional pain, particularly in the legs, made worse by exercise (lighter exercise than would normally cause pan). I have also been experiencing hypertension that, to my knowledge, did not exist prior to receiving the vaccine. This has persisted since first measured 5 days after the vaccine until today, more than a month after receiving it.

I was unable to find any report of this side effect of severe chills/shaking on the vaccine&#39;s pamphlet that I got.

The second day I had blurry vision and all those symptoms so I went to doctor. They said I was having a reaction and also gave me Toradol for the back pain. I started to feel better symptom wise  but the following day I started to poop blood. That only happened for one day then went away after a day. But I?ve had one or two more bloody stools since then. The ER said that it?s likely from the Toradol but to keep an eye on it. I have had 2 episodes since but it?s been random. Haven?t taken any more ibuprofen at all, was told to take omeprazole for a month and see how my body recovers

I then went to sleep and woke up with a throbbing migraine and my legs were so sore I wanted to cut them off.  I could barely walk they were so tight.  I have now been getting bruising on my legs.  I don&#39;t know if it is due to the shot though.  I shaved my legs and I usually get some bruising after that.  My arms have been slightly tense and sore as well.  I have reasons outside of the shot to believe that it may not be the vaccine, but I thought I should report it.

                                                Pt received the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Pt started to feel numbness and tingling in his left hand (vaccinated arm) 15 minutes following the immunization. Pt stated that he felt fine other than his left hand experiencing numbness and tingling, specifically in his fingertips. Pt had no other adverse symptoms. I asked the pt to remain seated for an additional 15 minutes. He stated that he was ok but I convinced him to remain in his seat so we could continue to evaluate him. After a total of 45 minutes of evaluation, pt stated that the feeling of numbness and tingling was gone. Once again, I verified with the pt that he was feeling ok, with no additional adverse feeling or symptoms. Pt stated that he felt fine now and only felt a little soreness at the injection site.

                                                Woke up at 12:00am today with headache, lots of discomfort (especially in stomach), and for the most part could only fall back asleep for short intervals while being awake most of the night.   At around 2:30am, could barely walk into the front room. Just very slowly and painfully. Ended up in such a state that I absentmindedly urinated onnthe bathroom floor while pulling pant leg up to scratch an itch while urinating in toilet. Laying on back caused butt and thighs to hurt significantly more. Same for stomach. Getting up from and laying down on my floor mattress was and still is difficult.   Later into the morning at around 6:40am, had to crawl slowly on hands and knees to get back in the front room. By around 8am, I could walk around without it being unbearable. Just slow-ish. Ate breakfast, so stomach is more uncomfortable than in pain. Can lay on it without too much problem, but butt is still hurting. Stretching legs forward caused some pain.  Possible fever.

Fell back asleep and woke up with a horrible headache and migraine (primarily behind my eyes). Entire body ached and had a fever of 100.5. This lasted the entire next day after receiving the vaccine. The second day, the headache subsided but my neck and lymph nodes were swollen and very sore.

I collapsed twice, but never went unconscious. My arm was very sore, and I was very weak and dizzy and clammy. I got only a little better as the night went on. Today, I have had flu-like symptoms and my body aches very much. I hadn?t seen a lot symptoms involving nearly immediately passing out, so I thought I should report my side effects.

From this point on however, I experienced a substantial headache, coming and going all morning. Until now (12:45 PM) when I still feel a slight headache.

                                                6-7 hours after receiving, I got a headache, and became very tired &amp; achey all over. I took ibuprofen &amp; acetaminophen and felt reasonably better for a few hours. Then later that night (12-18 hours after vaccine) I became much sicker and was unable to sleep. I had a low fever, upset stomach, severe chills (couldn&#39;t stop shaking/shivering for over an hour) body aches, and an extremely bad headache. I continued to use ibuprofen and acetaminophen but even combined they weren&#39;t nearly enough to relieve my symptoms. Late into the night around 3-4am (15-16 hours after vaccine) nausea became the worst side effect, surpassing the headache. I eventually vomited around 4am, after which point the symptoms became more bearable and I managed to sleep a couple hours. Thursday/Friday (two days after vaccine) I still felt very weak, achey, and tired and had to call out of work both days. I was never again in the severe discomfort I experienced Wednesday night/Thursday morning, but I still felt a little tired, achey, and mildly sour stomach on days 3 &amp;4 (Saturday/Sunday). Monday morning I felt similarly tired &amp; achey, but I do feel essentially back to normal Monday night.

I went for a walk for about 40 mins started to feel worse. I had body aches throughout my back and chest and in both arms, was freezing. Tried to eat dinner but couldn?t, too much pain and increased nausea. Tried to lay down, but began having a fast heartbeat and fast/some difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. Continued feeling horrible with a fever of 100.7, nausea, headache pains throughout chest back and arms, freezing, and my arms and legs felt like they were becoming numb. Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

                                                I gave the vaccine around 6:20pm after counseling on possible adverse reactions and going over the patient&#39;s questions. I then asked them to wait 15min. Within 5-10mins the patient got up and came back to our counter saying he thinks he&#39;s having a reaction. I pulled him back into our vaccination area and had him sit down and explain what he was feeling to me. He looked pale and told me he felt dizzy, sweaty, shaky, &amp; nauseous. He wanted me to grab him a bag incase he puked. I grabbed a bag as well as water and Benadryl. I asked if he was having any issues breathing or if it felt like his tongue was swollen at all. He said no issues breathing and tongue felt fine.  He started to feel better within about 10-15 minutes after onset. He did not puke and his color returned. I had him wait an additional 10-15 minutes after that to make sure we were recovered. I asked him if there was anything else going on and he mentioned that he hadn&#39;t slept well the night before and that he had barely eaten today. He also mentioned he can get anxiety. I told him all of those factors could certainly contribute to what he just experienced but that I would be reporting this on to be safe.

                                                On day 1 (April 15) of noticing my body was very off after the vaccine I had Leg pain and severe headaches, I say severe because though I rarely get headaches and stay hydrated I could tell this headache really hurt and lasted the full day and several days after (something I have never had happen to me) Also on April 15, I had leg pain, If I took a step off a few inches curb or stair step I felt sharp pain shoot up my leg. On April 16th I still had the headaches and leg pain , but also while driving I began loosing my vision and started to pass out/faint. I Pulled over and waited at least a half hour. during that time I. noticed I couldn&#39;t type or read anything on my phone as I was trying to reach a friend to help me. eventually after time had passed I was able to drive myself to a friends where I thought the best thing would be to sleep it off. the headaches and leg pain lasted a couple more days and I thought it was going to go away, but it is now May 5th and today and last couple days the leg pain feels more like someone has been punching my left leg. five had chest pain and headaches return. I do not have medical insurance and have avoided going to the hospital or primary care because I am afraid. today the pain is so irritating and sore I wish I could escape my body.

I sat him down immediately, he was having trouble staying awake eyes glossing over, speech very slow. I turned to push the door open into the main pharmacy to call for help and have them dial 911, grabbed epinephrine and ammonia salts as well. When I turned back he had slumped in his chair. As I took the step back towards him, he spontaneously started to sit up and speak. Was diaphoretic, still slow speech eyes glossy. I supported him as best I could. His HR was 42, i lifted his legs up unto to a chair in quazi trandelenburg position. He stated that made him feel alot better. I stayed with him until EMTS arrived. He got himself onto they stretcher and they took him out of the store.

He then slumped to side and head hit side of wall since we had chair with side rails positioned against wall. He lost conscious for maybe 30 seconds and then eyes opened. I asked if he was OK and the first thing he asked for was water. He said he felt light headed and dizzy. I had my intern who was working grab him water from the deli and had him sit and rest. He started sweating and asked for paper towels. I grabbed him a couple of towels so he can wipe his face. I continued to check on him while doing my work. He seemed fine after that. After 30 minutes, I checked his blood pressure. It read 100/63.  I continued to monitor him and he left after that. He did have friend with him the entire time who helped him.

                                                The evening of the shot, I felt a wave of chills through my body. I felt a sore throat begin. I felt light headed and nausea. By the time I went to bed,  my body was extremely sensitive. Entering my bed was painful due to the cold sheets, the cold was contrasted by the occasional heat flash. The night was full of body aches, hot and cold flashes, and loads of sweating. I woke up with a headache and body soreness. That was the worst of it. Spent the remainder of the day resting in bed.  Notes: I rarely get sick, maybe like this once every few years. I probably could have drank more water to flush out my system following the shot.

Patient reports the immunization hurt a lot more than it usually does when patient receives a vaccine. The following day arm and shoulder continued to hurt. After a few days the muscle became less painful but the pain in the shoulder continued and was deeper as if it was in the shoulder joint itself. Over five weeks later the pain is still sharp within the shoulder with reaching up or across. Patient reports no pain without movement. No numbness, tingling, redness, swelling, bruising, fever, chills, recent injury, or weakness documented. Ibuprofen was not helpful. Patient administered steroid injection during visit and follow-up with physical therapy arranged. Patient reports mild pain relief after injection.

He felt much better and sat in our waiting room again for 10 more minutes. He left without further incident, having never lost consciousness.

Lymphnodes have been in pain and swollen since the first or second day after the shot. Headaches on and off for a month now. And my anxiety has been like I&#39;m in fight or flight mode all of my waking moments. Even when I&#39;m falling asleep. I will wake up with panic attacks. My muscles can&#39;t take talking on the phone for longer than 5 minutes before I have to switch to my other arm because the previous arm is &#34;dead&#34; in the muscles and couldn&#39;t do it any longer. Blood pressure was in the 180-190&#39;s / the high 80&#39;s and sometimes even 90 being my bottom BP number. It has since gone down because of meditation.

                                                On June 19, 2021 I woke up around 6:00 a.m. having extreme chest pains. I went to the Emergency Room to be treated. They did an EKG, blood work, and an ultrasound of my heart. My EKG was negative for a heart attack, but my blood work was positive because of my Troponins were elevated. They gave me some aspirin and the chest pain went away. I was admitted into the hospital where I stayed until the end of the day on June 21, 2021. On June 20, 2021 they continued to watch my vitals, took tons of blood for blood cultures and for pretty much every virus you can get along with urine samples as well. All of the test for any virus and the blood cultures were negative. The urinalysis and urine culture were negative as well. Once all test came back negative, the cardiologist ordered a Heart cath. The heart cath was performed on June 21, 2021 and there was no blockage in any of my arteries and everything was clear so I was discharged that afternoon from the hospital. I was diagnosed with Myocarditis or Pericarditis. The doctor prescribed me 25MG Captopril to take 3 times daily and 25 MG Metoprolol Tartrate to take 2 times daily. I have only experienced any other affects a few times since being released which was a burning sensation in my check. I spoke with the doctor and they told me it could be indigestion or heart burn.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

                                                At 10 pm I started to experience some moderate body aches. By 1 am, I was in so much pain I could not sleep and started to develop a fever. I drank a ton of fluids, used OTC treatments (Ibuprofen and Motrin) but nothing alleviated the pain. By 10 am I had a sustained fever over 100 degrees. I was in so much pain I was crying in bed. By 3 pm my fever reached 102 degrees. I had to go to the emergency room for IV drip and medication because I couldn&#39;t drink enough water to stay hydrated. Once given IV, my temperature plummeted. When the medication they administered wore off, my body started experiencing mild to moderate pains again. Body aches and soreness all over- my muscles feel like they are being squeezed from the inside. I am still feeling a lot of fatigue and pain but it is random and comes and goes along with &#34;hot flashes&#34;.

The next morning I woke up with a headache and was achy/sore throughout my body. While I was eating I passed out without any signs. I was unconscious and do not remember the episode. Once I was alert, I felt nauseas and was heading to the restroom when I passed out again and was unconscious. I do not remember the episodes.

He responnded &#34;yes, but I have a mental anxiety from vaccines, needls, doctors&#34;. one minute later he started complaining of pain in his left arm and feeling weak. . He then asked to sit on the floor and said that he can hardly breath, and lost vision. I administered Epipen injection to his left thigh while the store director was calling 911. He then complained about not being able to move his hand fingers. The ambulance came and took him to the ER. later in the day, his manager said that he spoke to hid family and they told him that he has been having anxiety from doctors, needls, and shots ever since he was little. He is feeling better now and the hospital will keep him for tomorrow.

Back pain subsided shortly after. No other side effects

I was monitoring his temperature and he did not have a fever. I was massaging his hands and legs, this went on for 45 minutes to 1 hour. When the shaking subsided, the fever started, at this point I gave him Tylenol and continued to monitor his temperature.  He is better this morning.

                                                ED NOTE is as follows...from 4/21/21 @ 21:47    a 28 y.o. male who to the emergency room with reports of a headache for the last 48 hours.  He reports this as being one of the worst headaches he has ever had.  He was seen at urgent care and given Toradol, Zofran and Benadryl and still rates his pain an 8 out of 10.  He does feel pressure behind his eyes.  And reports vomiting in the parking lot at urgent care.  He denies abdominal pain back pain, neck pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, numbness or tingling or any other worsening concerns.  Reports that he did receive a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  Patient states he does vape.  He occasionally drinks alcohol he denies any illicit drugs.  Patient denies any head trauma.   Diagnosis management comments: This is a 28-year-old male arrives to the emergency room with reported migraine headache for the last 48 hours.  He did report that he was go to urgent care in which he received a migraine cocktail of Zofran, Benadryl and Toradol.  Patient reported that his headache was not resolved so urgent care sent him on for further evaluation.  Patient upon arrival had a negative neurological exam however he did report that he had pressure behind his eyes.  Was unable to see any papilledema on funduscopic exam.  Check patient&#39;s pressures bilaterally and they were 21 and 18.  Patient did report to me that this was the worst headache of his life.  I did administer IV fluids here as well as Tylenol and morphine.  Patient did report some improvement.  Patient did report in his past medical history had a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  A CBC and CMP was obtained.  Did have thrombocytopenia with a count of 66.  Since my exam was PERRL with normal extraocular movements.  He had no eye redness or eye pain.  Of low concerns for any iritis or uveitis.  Patient&#39;s patient CT of his head did show a abnormal CT that had a dense appearing superior sagittal sinus that was representing a venous thrombosis.  Radiologist did recommend a MRI MRV.  An MRI and MRV was ordered.  Patient MRI MRv did show findings are consistent with a venous thrombosis involving the right jugular right transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus there is also a patchy edematous change within the subcortical white matter areas bilaterally and symmetrically.  There was no CVA.  With patient&#39;s reported migraine headache.  Reported blurred vision, low platelets, recent vaccination I do believe patient has vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.  With this finding I did converse with my overseeing physician Calls were made out to neurology and then a call out did prefer to have patient started on IVIG at 1 g/kg daily for 2 days and blood thinner Xarelto 15 mg p.o. twice daily.  These orders were initiated.  Internal med services was consulted and with conversations of family, internal med services out possible transfer that an interventionalists could be available if patient needed it.  Report was given at 2100 upon my end of shift.

Immediately after regaining composure I began sweating profusely and became very pale/flushed color in face at which point I exited the vehicle and flagged EMS to assist me. EMS monitored blood pressure and blood saturation before releasing me on my own recognizance approximately 25 minutes later. Tingling sensation felt in left arm after fainting approximately 10 minuets after initial injection. Next 48 hours after injection I experienced severe body chills, body aches, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, and night sweats. 72 hours after injection I am close to fully recovered but still experience fatigue and night sweats.

                                                vasovagal syncope or seizure? After receiving the drive-through vaccine, we drove into a parking space to sit and make sure I was ok. Within 5-10 minutes, I was sitting in the car and sending a text and with no warning whatsoever mid-text lost consciousness, profuse sweating, wheezing, lost color in my skin, was making unintelligible noises, and eventually woke up about a minute later but couldn&#39;t speak or comprehend those speaking to me (according to my wife who was terrified).  I was not nervous, stressed, or scared of receiving a vaccine. I regained the ability to speak about a minute later and my wife had summoned the staff on the scene who instructed me to lie back and breathe without a mask. I drank some liquids. A nurse was called over and offered to take my vital signs but I decided I felt ok enough not to. Eventually my normal skin color and came back and sweating stopped after about 5 minutes. We sat for a few extra minutes and once I felt it was past me,  my wife drove us home.

                                                At 6:00 PM 3/12 I began to feel slightly dizzy. It did not effect my ability to stand or move around very much, but my head did feel strange and if I turned to quickly I would need a second to gather myself. However, it was not severe enough to force me to sit or lay down. By 7:00-7:30 I began to feel hot and uncomfortable and I took my temperature at 7:30 and I was running a low grade fever at 99.8 degrees F. I began to feel very fatigued and was in bed by 9:00 PM. I woke up feeling fine and my temperature at 7:00 AM 3/13 is 97.8 degrees F. My only possible side effect this morning (3/12 as I write this) is that I am mildly stiff, mostly in my left arm, neck, and back (the side of the injection site). Despite the mild fever I did not feel any nausea, nor did I have difficulty breathing. Overall the side effects were mild but uncomfortable.

The fourth and fifth day my lips and face would become tingly/numb and my left arm would get weak and I would feel a little disoriented, my sleep has been pretty disturbed. It felt like I was having a stroke. I did not have a stroke,  I continue to occasionally feel the above symptoms, a little less potent than they were, they might be going away, I can&#39;t tell. I will be calling my doctor if it continues.

Slept until 11:15pm and woke up to violent shivering, pounding headache, full body aches, sore skin, achey joints, nausea, swelling tongue and throat. Took 1 dose of nyquil and then tossed and turned all night, very little sleep, symptoms persisted into the next day, but shivering stopped in the night. By morning (3-14) registered a fever of 100.3 which persisted most of the day along with remaining lessening symptoms. By evening I was still very sore, bad headache, and very lethargic/fatigued. Next morning (3-15) low temp of 97.1 degrees, headache, fatigue, lightheaded. Still feel headachy and tired.

This lasted for about 12 hours and I woke up with a slight fever which then subsided. Later the following day I felt fine again.   Essentially, when the symptoms were most intense, I felt like I did when I contracted Covid in March of 2020

                                                High fever reaching 103.8° F. Between 7pm and 12am, my fever ranged from 100-103.8° F Elevated resting heart rate of 90-130 beats per minute. My normal is 62-75 bpm. While I was sleeping, my heart rate ranged from 93-113 bpm (according to Apple Watch). Extreme headache Inability to sleep Chills and shakes Extreme fatigue Light headed and unable to speak clearly  I don?t know if this was life threatening; I know it was likely my immune system responding but these side effects were extreme. I almost called an ambulance. I?ve never felt pain like that before in my head. My heart felt like it was racing all night and my brain felt like it was going to expand out of my skull. The head pain, heart rate, and rapid breathing was keeping me up.  I tried to sleep 7pm?12am which was the worst of it. By the middle of the night, it seemed that the fever subsided and my resting heart rate was more in the 90-100 range (still 15-30% high).   The next day, I have a moderate headache that feels like after pain from the night before. Fever subsided. Heart rate is slightly high at 80-100 bpm. I managed to sleep in the whole morning.  I had to take off from work today in order to rest.

To this day (one month later) by ability to recall memories and recall words remains poor. I have troubles forming sentences because words don&#39;t come to me. To this day I cannot recall anything that happened days 1-3 after the vaccine. I was able to write this report because my partner made me take notes on how I felt. Prior to the vaccine I never had an issue with memory recall. My physical reactions cleared during the second week after the vaccine. However, the mental reactions still stubbornly persist.

                                                I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at roughly 2:15pm on Sunday 4/11/21. I waited at the vaccination site for 30 minutes and did not have any adverse effects. I went through the rest of my day without any adverse effects. I went to bed at 9:00pm. I woke up at 11:00pm with body aches and chills. I could not stop shivering. I then became very warm. I alternated between freezing/shivering and burning up all night. I felt very sore and my muscles hurt. It was primarily my upper body that hurt, not my lower body. My arms, torso, back, and neck hurt to move. I was very sensitive to everything I touched. It felt uncomfortable to touch the blankets in my bed or the water when I washed my hands. It did not hurt to do that, it just felt sensitive and uncomfortable. Around 5:00am I got a terrible headache. It felt like my head was made out of a lead ball. It hurt to move lift my head. My face hurt and felt like I had pressure. This lasted all day for Monday 4/12/21. After 5:00pm I slowly started to feel better. My body aches went away. I still had a headache, but it was far less severe. It is approximately 7:00am on 4/13/21 as I am filling this out. I still have a minor but persisting headache. My left arm is sore at the injection site. I am feeling much better than I was.

Hives eventually were limited to only arms after 3 days. 7 days after experiencing on and off hives, I took an antihistamine until hives disappeared for longer than 24 hours.  Hives were not itchy, but large and warm to the touch. No single hive lasted for more than 24 hours.  They disappear and reappear randomly on my arms. Specially over veins. It has been over a month since my vaccine and I?m still experiencing these hives that appear and disappear at random. I?ve documented each hive outbreak with photos and currently undergoing blood tests trying to learn more about this issue.

                                                7 PM (4.5 hours after J &amp; J shot) - Chills begin, both calf muscle in legs starting to shake. I move to my bed. 7:30 PM - In bed, dressed in sweatshirt, wool socks, etc., a a couple blankets wrapped around me, space heater turned to 80 degrees, shaking uncontrollably from being so cold (mostly hands and feet), mild headache begins in middle back of head.  8:00 PM - still freezing, temperature was at 98.7. most of body is aching 9:00 PM - chills and body ache starting to slow down, temperature at 100.3 9:30 PM - still have chills, space heater still on and i was still wrapped in a bunch of clothing/blankets. temp at 100.5 and i drank 6 oz water.  10 PM - chills going away, heat/blankets/clothing still on, temp at 101. body aches mostly only in left and right calf.   Rest of night until around 4 A.M. was me tossing and turning being restless. My heart rate was ~130 BPM throughout the entire night according to my smart watch. I was checking my temperature constantly with an infrared thermometer and it was between 101-102.5. I probably drank ~24 oz of water throughout the night. It felt like each time i fell asleep, i would wake up no more than 30 min later and each time i woke up it felt like i had been asleep for 5 hours. At a few moments it felt like i was hallucinating seeing little boxes around my head.. At no point  during the episode did i take any advil/tyenol/etc. Only drank water. Woke up around noon the next day, I felt extremely groggy, still had a headache and my temperature was back to ~98.  I ate for the first time that day around 1 P.M. and had a few advil which helped with my headache.

                                                I started feeling fatigue and soreness in both of my legs and arms about a 5 after the vaccine. At day 7 I started to feel sharp, cramps, tingly sensation and numbness in different parts of my legs, arms feet and hands. I also had headaches and felt dizzy. Headaches went away by day 15, but the pain, tingly sensation and fatigue in my arms and legs still remain (tomorrow it?s going to be a month since I got my shot). It gets significantly worse when I walk and I feel very fatigued after walking for about 30 minutes.  The pin has also appeared less frequently on other parts of my body, like my heart, my neck and around my rib area. Over the last two weeks my legs have also been getting itchy.

She states his eyes rolled back and then slumped over and arms flailed a few times. The patient didn&#39;t know it had happened. He stated he felt dizzy and looked pale. We gave him a water bottle and after a few minutes he felt better.

                                                Patient received vaccine at around 11am.  After waiting around for a few minutes he stated he was light headed.  I went over to observe and gave patient some water.  He was starting to sweat and turned very pale.  1 minute later he passed out.  I brought him to the floor from his chair and he  starting shaking and &#39;seizing&#34; for about 10-15 seconds.  We used pressure on his chest to try to &#34;snap&#34; him out of it.  After about 15 seconds of &#34;seizing,not breathing normally and his left arm completely locked up&#34; he came to and did not know where he was for about 2-3 minutes.  After about that time he started to realize where he was and recognized his wife who was assisting.  EMS was called and arrived shortly,  He was lucid and knew where he was and started to feel normal again.  EMS checked his vitals and they were normal.  Patient refused to go to hospital and EMS released him to his wife.  I checked on patient 4 hours later and he had no ill effects and stated he felt just like he did before receiving the vaccination.

Approximately, 5 minutes after receiving it, the stated that he was feeling dizzy and had ringing in his ears.  I had him lie down with his knees elevated.  He stated that he felt better in the supine position.  I attempted to take his blood pressure, but was unable to get a reading after two tries.  After a few minutes, he stated that he no longer had any ringing in his ears, but felt some numbness in his arms.  His fingers were cold and I had a difficult time finding his pulse.  While he was resting, he stated that he had anxiety to needles and &#34;white coat&#34; syndrome.  He felt that he was okay to sit up, so he did without any adverse reactions.  He drank some water and stated that feeling was returning to his arm.  I asked if he had eaten anything this morning and was told, just a cup of coffee.  We speculated that low blood sugar could have possibly compounded the situation.  At approximately 12:55pm, he felt well enough to leave.  I had him contact his mother who was in the store to accompany him out at around 1:00pm.

He was very panicked and stated he thought it was a dream.  He was extremely pale and very sweaty.  We gave him some water and an ice pack to cool down.  We checked his blood pressure.  He then lied down on the floor and we elevated his feet.  He then stated he could not move his hands and his lips were tingly.  We then gave him some liquid benadryl and continued checking his blood pressure and called EMS.  They arrived and he left with them.  I tried contacting him later without success.  Will try again tomorrow.

Once patient got outside of the door to waiting area , patient began to feel dizzy and sat down in the chair.  Patient began to sweat and show signs of impaired vision (spots) and discomfort.  Pharmacist immediately ran to get the patient soda and a bag of chips to get patient&#39;s blood sugar up.  patient immediately began to perk up.  patient later stated he had not ate all day leading us to assume low blood sugar and abrupt movement was the cause of his dizziness.

                                                Pt received JJ vaccination, and subsequently moved to the patient monitoring area. Approximately 2 minutes after waiting in the monitoring area pt states he experienced flushing, dizziness and clamminess then ?passed? out for approximately 20 seconds while in a seated position. Syncope was witness by patients girlfriend. RN didn?t witness pt syncope, but noted patient laying in the seat then immediately alerted me. Pt was recovering in a seated position when I arrived, with noted pt w/ diaphoresis with no associated respiratory distress. While I was collecting pts history said he didn?t want to talk about it anymore in an attempt to calm himself down, approximately 2-3 minutes later I witnessed pt have another syncopal episode which lasted 15-20 seconds while in seated position. Pt regained consciousness and I had an employee help me move pt to the floor for recovery. Pt displayed no signs of respiratory distress, denied chest pain and headache. Pt states syncope is his typical response after vaccinations or blood draws, last occurrence was 8 months ago during a blood draw. Pt states these syncopal episodes initially started in childhood and has gotten worse as he has gotten older, pts father also experiences these episodes. Pt declined EMS several times. Pt was monitored for 41 minutes, vitals taken twice while pt was in recovery on the floor, vitals were stable. I had pt lay supine on the floor for approximately 15 mins post syncopal episode. After recovering for 15 mins I had patient sit upright on the floor, reassessed him and repeated vitals which were stable, pt reported feeling well. After approximately 10 mins pt was helped up into a seat, vitals were stable and patient reported feeling well and having no complaints. I had pt stand and repeated vitals which continued to be stable and pt reported no complaints. Pt drove to the vaccination site in a rental care which he states he will leave parked close to vaccination site and initially states he?d walk. I recommended pt and girlfriend take a free ride home which the agreed to do. I personally walked the patient up the stairs which pt was able to do with no problem and no reported complaints. Pt was given strict ER precautions and given resources for primary care also. Pt stable at the time of discharge. Pt declined follow up.  Pt stable at the time of discharge. Pt accompanied by with girlfriend, who will get pt home via ride.

                                                Patient was seated in the passenger seat of the car. We talked for a few minutes prior to administration and I actually administered a vaccine to the person in the driver&#39;s seat first. I walked over to give his shot and he then tells me he &#34;doesn&#39;t do well with vaccines.&#34; He later told me he felt sick to his stomach after getting the shot and had a metallic smell similar to a bloody nose. About 1 minute after administering his vaccine, the patient&#39;s head went back, his muscles went very stiff, and he appeared to convulse. We called 9-1-1. His mom was sitting in the back seat and placed an ice cube on the back of his neck which seems to have pulled him out of it. During the episode, he reports &#34;blacking out&#34; without orientation to time or place. After the episode, he was dizzy and lightheaded for a few minutes. Soon there after he was jovial. I took his BP and HR about 5 minutes later BP 100/62 and HR 48. Paramedics also took vitals which were a bit higher than these. He reported having a small cereal bar for breakfast and 2 cups of coffee.

Pt says he has a needle phobia, and was hesitant to get the vaccine. He had a muffin to eat earlier in the day, and nothing since. The tech, called  me when she saw him fall. when I saw him, he was standing up. He sat back on his chair. I got his to rest with his head lowered. He appeared to be dizzy and cold and clammy. When I took his Blood Pressure, it was 95/46. He had a 1 cm cut below his right eyebrow. He did not want to go for stitches, because he hates needles. After resting up for about 30 minutes, he told me that he felt better, then left.

The temperature flashes are still occurring 9 hours after injection and do not seem to be getting worse any more; hands and feet cannot warm up and neck and forehead are hot (no thermostat to look at temperature).

                                                After receiving the Janssen Covid 19 vaccine, I proceeded to the waiting area and was instructed to wait 15 minutes before leaving the facility. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I started to feel faint, lightheaded, nausea, and clammy. I informed a member of the staff and several medical personnel came to assist. They laid me down on a cot and checked my vitals. I started to feel better after laying down. The staff took my blood pressure and heart rate readings, which were relatively normal. But after sitting me up and taking my vitals again, my blood pressure and heart rate spiked. I was taken to Hospital in an ambulance; however, after waiting in the ER waiting room for about 2.5 hours, I left without seeing a doctor. During those 2.5 hours my original symptoms did not return, so I elected to leave.

                                                Joints began feeling achy and body felt tired within a few hours of vaccination. About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

                                                Immediately after injection: pain and soreness around injection site.  Starting about 3-4 hours later: impaired coordination.  The next morning: severe dehydration, disorientation, loss of balance, very low energy, headache, body aches, inability to remain standing or sitting, difficulty walking, fever, feeling hot and cold, sweating and shivering intermittently and sometimes both at the same time, impaired mental focus, worsened pain and soreness around the injection site, nightmares. Slept the majority of the day, rising only to eat and drink lots of water.  Symptoms abated throughout the day. By about 7pm, I was able to sit up enough to play some video games.  The second morning: most symptoms gone or almost unnoticeable.  Hot/cold flashes, impaired coordination and low energy continue, but improving. Attempted to go out for my usual 2-mile jog after work, but only made it about one block walking before becoming both too cold and too tired to continue.  The third day, afternoon: completed my usual 2-mile route, at a walk, with frequent stops to rest.  No noticeable symptoms from the 4th day after injection, onwards.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

After washing my hands, I turned to the towel and vaguely remember falling to the floor. When I came to, I was too weak to get up. I laid there for 5 minutes before struggling to sit. After some time I was able to weakly return to bed and drank some rehydration tablets. My best guess was I had been drinking water but not replenishing my electrolytes.

The following Saturday, I had a migraine and it lasted a full eight days - hanging out in my left eye (it was all in that eye - when I moved that eye from left to right, I would feel it) . I had taken Tylenol and ibuprofen but it didn&#39;t do anything.  Some days it was intense and some days it was in the background. I did see and talk to a  someone at my doctor&#39;s office - over video chat (on April 15th - that was day eight of migraine) and she told me to start taking Tylenol that night and I&#39;ve been taking it one time in the morning since that day and it hasn&#39;t come back. I think the migraine went away on it&#39;s own.  I haven&#39;t had a migraine ever in my entire life so it was very unsettling.

                                                Seizure - I have never had a seizure before and there is no history of epilepsy in my family. I had the Janssen vaccine shot at around 5PM on Thursday and felt mostly fine on Friday. I had typical shot symptoms (tired and soreness near injection sight). On Friday night around 10:00, I was standing talking to one of my friends in the living room when I had a blackout seizure without any warning. The seizure only lasted about 30-45 seconds, and then I became conscious again. It took me about 5-10 minutes to become completely aware and able to stand up. I have never had a seizure before and have not had one since then.  Later the following week, I did have a couple of hours where I felt extremely dizzy and lightheaded, but it went away without another seizure. This is also not typical for me.

When the exhaustion would hit, starting the day after injection, I was too weak to go up and down stairs. It seemed significant and was more than normal tiredness, and I ended up needing to take a half day at work four days after vaccination. On the sixth day after vaccination, I was feeling well again and discomfort at the injection site had subsided as well.  It was the worst the day after getting vaccinated, which was to be expected. I did not expect it to last so long.

Patient complained of experiencing tunnel vision while passing out. He proceeded to pass out once more, while seated, this time the pharmacist was able to support him in his chair.  After the water and rest, patient said he felt much better and his girlfriend came to escort him home. He stayed for about 30 minutes before leaving and staff made sure he was feeling alright.

We looked over to see patient slumped over and seizing. My technician called 911 and I put a cool compress on his neck and he started to come to. The seizure stopped but the patient was still feeling lousy. I had him lay down with his knees elevated until the EMT&#39;s arrived

                                                The night/next morning after receiving the vaccine I was awoken by a racing heart rate that I measured at a resting heart rate of 200 bpm. After 5 minutes of trying to assess what was happening, I recognized that my heart rate was not slowing down. I woke my wife because I was worried and had difficulty breathing. It continued to be in the 180-190&#39;s, I called an ambulance. On the way to the hospital my resting heart rate was 180. After I got to the hospital they ran blood work, a CT scan and a chest x-ray. I was in the hospital until 10 am. My heart rate steadily fell to about 110 beats per minute after 9 hours in the hospital. They released me because my tests had come back normal. Upon being released, I came home, had lots of fluids and rest. After 1 week, my heart rate went back up to 160&#39;s. My chest started to feel tight again and I had difficulty breathing again. I called my PCP emergency number and they advised me to go back to the ER at 10 am on 05/15/2021. They did another EKG, a D-Dimer and I received saline. My heart rate dropped to 120 and they released me. I was given an all clear from all tests performed. Sunday-Wed that week, I had a slightly elevated resting heart rate, have had difficulty getting a full breath, general stomach pains and I had felt fatigued. Thurs-Sat, my resting heart rate returned to normal (60 bpm) minimal difficulty breathing, but continued pressure in my abdomen and chest. Saturday I fell asleep because I was having a migraine. I woke up at 10 pm and the cycle started again. My heart rate went back up into the 160&#39;s. I called the emergency line for my PCP and was told to go back to the ER (05/22/2021). They performed a chest x-ray, an EKG and some blood work. My resting heart rate went to 90 bpm around 3 am and was sent back home. The rest of Sunday, I had difficulty getting a full breath and my resting heart was higher than usual. I had an echocardiogram on Wednesday and it came back normal. I wore a heart monitor for 24 hours, but I have not received the results yet from my doctor. I have never experienced any sort of cardiac episode in my life.

Upon accessing the patient I notice that the patient was unresponsive to my calls, at which point I motion for my technician to call for emergency; then I proceeded to try to move the patient from the chair to the floor with the aid of his fiance. The patient became responsive a second before we go him to the floor and he seemed responsive and was breathing pretty well. The patient was unresponsive for about 35 second at which point his eyes were rolled backwards, his head was sweating profusely as well as his muscles seemed to become very rigid. Thankfully within 5 minutes emergency personal was at the scene and they took his blood pressure and heart rate with both values being on the lower end. The patient objected to going to the hospital, at which point they offered to roll him outside for him to get fresh air and observes him before leaving with his fiance

Patient received his vaccine on his right arm, remained seated in his chair. A few seconds later, he decided to lie down on the floor, removed his mask and started taking deep breaths with his eyes closed. About 3 minutes later, his eyes got dilated, skin started flushing red, started with mild seizure like twitching and patient became unresponsive. So I quick put some ice cold water (from his water bottle) on his face, patted his cheek, put an ice pack on his face and neck and while I was asking his father (who was with him) to call 911, the patient regained consciousness and said he was okay.  He continued to put the ice pack on his neck and forehead and in a few minutes the flushing stopped, in about 5 to 8 minutes, patient was able to sit up, lean back against the wall, take a few sips of water and the eat a granola bar. Patient then proceeded to wait in our waiting area for another 15 minutes and then decided to leave , since he was feeling much better.

                                                I had my Johnson and Johnson vaccine around 10:30am and felt fine throughout the day.   Went to work, had a 40 min workout, and had dinner with friends (had one drink and a cigarette) .  I was in bed by 9pm and with in a few min started to get chills.  By 9:30pm I was in  sweating, shaking, headache, and had extreme body aches.  I struggled to get out of bed to use the restroom, any movement was painful.  I didn&#39;t get much sleep due to the body aches.  By 8am my symptoms began to fade.  I felt fatigued and had a headache by noon.

                                                a 31 year old man who received the  COVID-19 vaccine on March 27, 2021 in the  Public Health Department parking lot. Upon arrival and check in, the patient declined any comorbidities and health history but did state that he was nervous. After administration of the vaccine by  NP, the patient lowered himself to the ground, from a sitting position, and had a 60 second tonic clonic seizure. Seizure precautions such as turning the patient on his side, supporting his head, and calling EMS were taken during the seizure. After 60 seconds, the patient came to and asked what happened. PPHD staff oriented the patient to what had happened, to which he proceeded to say ?oh that is normal for me when I get anxious.? With the help of PPHD staff and his wife, the patient was brought to a sitting position and given a granola bar and water to his request. According to clinic lead RN, ?his skin was normal in appearance for race, ethnicity, and age. He was mildly diaphoretic. He verbalized feelings of anxiety and worry surrounding the vaccine.?   As EMS arrived on the scene and began assessing vital signs the patients anxiety appeared to increase; he became less verbal, closed his eyes, and his breathing pattern became shallow. The patient then had a second seizure at this time lasting approximately 25 seconds. When the patient came to he immediately verbalized, ?I?m good, I?m good, I?m fine?. He was slow to respond to verbal cues, but persistently refused transport to the local acute care hospital for further evaluation. He rested on the ground in supine position for approximately 25 minutes, with his partner and EMS at his side. Upon further evaluation of the patient and his wife, it was determined that the patient has a history of seizure activities when he is nervous and that he was ?expecting? this to happen. The patient continued to decline medical care and transportation to the hospital. The patient left in medically stable condition with his wife operating the vehicle.

                                                As expected from any vaccine I&#39;ve received, I have a sore arm that is lasting over 3 days (again, this is expected). What I wasn&#39;t quite expecting: -Fever at 101 for 48 hours -Extreme fatigue for 48 hours -Alternating chills and hot flashes/sweating for 48 hours -Quite strong aches and pains (hurt to lay down, sit, stand, just existing hurt) for 48 hours -Headache for 48 hours -Itchy/sore throat around the 24 hour mark, lasting to the 36 hour mark from time of injection  Treatment: I took 400 mg of Ibuprofen around the 12 hour mark from vaccination (about 5 hours after fever spiked at 101--fever rose no higher than 101). I continued 400 mg of Ibuprofen the next morning and once more that same evening (two does of 400 mg Ibuprofen). Each of those doses brought fever down to around 99 for about 4 hours, and I felt considerably better (though definitely still quite sick--just not contained-to-lying-in-bed sick). I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen around the 36 hour mark, and that was it. Fever then back to normal range (approx 98) and feeling 95%-100% recovered all day.  Obviously none of those are life-threatening, but they sure knocked me out. Definitely way worse than the &#34;mild&#34; symptoms advertised. I&#39;m definitely not complaining, as I&#39;m overjoyed to now be vaccinated, and I&#39;m so grateful for the scientific community, the CDC, and you people reading this right now for all your work in making it happen, and doing it as safely as possible. Thank you!

Upon standing up from the laying down position, I got lightheaded, started profusely sweating, became nauseous and ultimately lost consciousness. When I regained my consciousness, there was a loud ringing in my ears and my hands were numb. I took some Tylenol, laid down and it subsided shortly after. I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

We pulled of the freeway and I walked around for a few minutes trying to catch my breath but I was unable to. My wife started to drive and I as I sat in the passenger seat I started getting the chills and all the muscles in my body were shaking. When we got to town I told my wife we needed to go to the ER because I was not feeling well. That is where they did some tests and hooked me up to an IV.

Itching started on the back of my hands and then progressed to the tops of my feet and rose up my legs, I took 2 Benadryl and went to urgent care.  The Benadryl started working within a half hour of taking it.   The itching started as o laid in bed where the only food or liquid I consumed before getting out of bed was a bottled water.  The doctor stated that I may be allergic to the pba?s in the water bottle.   I have never been allergic to this before  I was given this vaccine.  Intense itching and  hives have been occurring  ever since that day and without taking Claritin  or Benadryl daily  the itching and hives takes over my whole body.  I fear I could go into anaphylaxis if I do not take this medication.  I have cut out several different foods and different liquids including bottled water and have fasted yet still am getting a allergic reaction.  I saw my family dr and he said it?s likely due to the Johnson and Johnson covid 19 vaccine and I believe that to be true.  Other symptoms include facial flushing and upset stomach

                                                The day of the vaccine I had full body aches which went away. Three days after the vaccine I started to get soreness in my upper back, the left side of neck stretching to the left shoulder and down my  left arm.  It feels like a muscle pain it is on a 5-6 on the pain scale. The pain is worse about midday and in the afternoon and early evening. I have tried Tylenol and I was prescribed some Muscle Relaxants which I haven&#39;t tried yet. I have had a couple of occasions of pain on the right side but not much. I have been referred to PT and Massage Therapy. It has been there now for four weeks and the pain is still the same and happening daily.

I did not check if I had a fever, but it felt like I did. I had body aches, nausea, and I vomited a couple of times. By about 10:30-11 I felt a lot better.

I was able to get the patient to the floor and he became responsive.  He said he &#34;was ok&#34;.  We had contacted EMS.  We had the patient lie flat until the EMT&#39;s arrived.  He was very sweaty and tired but he insisted he was fine.  He refused to go to the ER and he was able to get a ride home.

                                                At 23:15 (7 hours after the dose) I started to get cold while under my blankets trying to sleep. My teeth began chattering as I started to shiver. I got up out of bed to put on a sweater. With each step I took towards the sweater my body started to fully shiver and contract. After about 4 or 5 steps I could no longer move and I fell over. I started having full body spasms and full contractions. I felt like I pulled every muscle in my body trying to relax and fight the contractions. It felt like I was being tasered for about 10-15 minutes. Once I had the strength to grab my sweater I slipped it on. As my body warmed up these contraction subsided.  By 01:00 (9 hours after dose) my body temperature had spiked. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to check my temperature but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I spiked a fever. I placed a wet cloth on the back of my neck, forehead and chest to cool down.   At 06:00 (14 hours after dose) I took a cold shower to further drop my body&#39;s temperature. It felt like a full body sun burn where you just radiate heat. I was hot everywhere.  At 08:00 (16 hours after dose) I took three (3) 500mg ibuprofen to help fight a nagging headache. I did not have much appetite for food. I regularly eat breakfast in the morning (bowl of cereal).   From 09:00 to 12:00 (17-20 hours after dose) I felt groggy. Did not seem or act like myself. Was very tired from the lack of sleep the night prior. Seemed very fatigued.  Around 13:00 (21 hours after dose) I took a 45-60 minute nap. Woke up feeling much better. I would say most / if not all symptoms subsided after 22-24 hours.

After speaking with him, he said that was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to monitor the symptoms and if they worsen or don&#39;t go away to see him again. They went away after a day or two.

The pain started in my teeth, jaw, temple, eye and ear. The next day I went to the dentist thinking it was my wisdom teeth, they checked my teeth, did ex rays and checked for infection but found nothing. Went to my primary care flight doc and she was un sure what was going on. Then I went to the Emergency room and I was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia of the face.

After putting on a sweater and trying to stay warm I also started to get sore. Around 8-9 hours after vaccination I decided to go to sleep to hopefully sleep of the symptoms. I was extremely cold and sore, but attempted to sleep. Around 12 hours after the shot the fever broke and I was sweating. After that I slept much better and woke up the next morning feeling fine. No further issues.

                                                I got my Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 5/5/21. That night I experienced the typical side effects (Chills, Aches, Pains, Soreness in the injection site on my right arm). By Thursday afternoon I was feeling significantly better. However, on Friday evening I started to feel a tightness and pressure in my chest and left arm and neck. The chest pain felt like I was having a heart attack but my heart rate was mostly normal. I felt shortness of breath  where I couldn&#39;t get a good deep breath in and I was also nauseous and had no appetite. At times I felt lightheaded and weak. These symptoms continued over the next couple days. On Monday 5/10/21 I decided to got to the ER to get checkout since I was still having chest pains and tightness. They ran a series of tests and concluded that I was just experiencing typical aches and pains from the vaccine.  My symptoms continued for another full week and at times the shortness of breath and chest pains felt really severe. By the following week I was starting to feel a little better on and off. I got my appetite back and and I was able to start exercising again. After about 2 full weeks after receiving the vaccine most of chest pain and pressure &#43; shortness of breath has disappeared and I feel better.

Ejaculation was yellow for about a week with a different texture than normal texture (which is back to normal seemingly now).   Longer side effects: Overall it took about 2 weeks before I felt back to normal. Lingering issues are some slight inter-muscular pains that didn&#39;t exist before.

On June 15 I woke up with a new pain in my leg. Went to urgent care and had a D-Dimer test that came out very high. I was sent to ER where they discovered one clot in each leg and two in my lungs via ultra sound and ct scan. I was immediately hooked up to herapin blood thinner through an IV. I was released the following afternoon with Eliquis blood thinner tablets.

On Friday 05/07/21 I had severe joint and muscle pains. To the point where I could not make a fist with either hand. The pain in my joints and muscles would not be the same each day. Some days it was hands and elbow. Then it was knee and a hand or a foot and a hand. This lasted for 4 weeks. There were times where the pain on the bottom of my feet was so bad I could not walk on them. Pain in my hands to where I could not use them to pick up a cup or open a door. The pain subsided for a week or so until tonight 06/17/21 when my left wrist and fingers are sore with a slight pain.

                                                Initial symptoms were normal (chills, fever, fatigue) and stopped in a day. Over next few weeks, began having tingles all over both legs, including a burning/throbbing sensation in my calves. I also noticed any physical exertion could lead to extreme light-headedness where I felt like I was going to pass out. This stopped within a few days. By week 3, I began having pretty significant (and constant 24x7) joint pain in both knees, making it difficult to walk. I have never had issues with my joints before and am healthy / active / young. I did not change anything about my routine or life, and my doctor agreed it was likely from the vaccine so I am reporting it here. The joints in my fingers also become painful if I spend too much time typing or on the phone. It&#39;s now 2 months of this joint pain and really hoping for some relief soon. Please contact me or my doctor if you have any thoughts or updates!

She then proceeded to administer to use an epi-pen, which in turn immediately relieved my symptoms. Paramedics were called, vitals were checked - was eventually able to leave the facility and return home.

                                                It was a fully body rash the developed over the course of 24 hours.  The night before I noticed a bit of itching an a bump that seemed like a bug bite. The following morning I had many such bumps in clusters on my neck and arm (and a few more bumps on my legs). At the time I thought I had bed bugs. By about 6 PM, I had more bumps and many of them had spread and turned into welts. There were bumps and rashes on all limbs, my neck and redness on my chest and back, The itchiness was severe. While not extremely painful, it was extremely uncomfortable and seemed like it would be hard to sleep or do anything.  Around 9 PM I took Allegra to try and alleviate symptoms. I also used hydrocortison cream and calamine lotion all over my body to reduce symptoms of itching.  By around 11 PM, I the rash was spreading into my face in the form of some bumps and redness. I visited the ER after consultation with a nurse over the phone, who said that anaphylactic shock could be a possibility and that it would be best to go in.  At the ER, I was treated with 50 mg diphenhydrAMINE , 20 mg famotidine , 10 mg dexAMETHasone. I was given a prescription for dexAMETHasone and instructed to take a refill in 3 days if I still had symptoms. I was discharged a couple hours later.  I did not need to refill the dexAMETHasone  as the sympoms subsided and was almost unnoticeable by day 3 (and completely gone by day 4).

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

                                                After receiving my Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine I experienced a lack of motor function in my throat. Approximately 40 minutes after having received the shot, I lost the ability swallow. A tingling sensation took the back of my throat and eventually felt as though it moved into my head. The whole experience lasted a couple of minutes. Since that time all other symptoms have been normal, sore, slight fever, etc.

At around 8 pm I couldn&#39;t do anything but lay in bed. I had high flashs and cold flashes every 30 mins. I was laying in bed with a hoodie and sweat pants on and could not stop shaking from being cold. Then 30 mins later I was so hot I had to take everything off. It kept going on like that till the next morning. I just now started to feel better around 10 am the next day.

I was wearing contacts and had my prescription renewed 2 days before my vaccination so I don&#39;t think my contacts are the issue. I  The discomfort feels like my eyes are having trouble focusing even though I can see fine. It&#39;s as if my eye muscles are strained. It also feels like I&#39;ve been trying to look at something very close to my eyes for a long time even though I haven&#39;t. I&#39;m not certain, but I think the discomfort is on top or behind my eyeballs. My optometrist told me to stop wearing contacts for 2 weeks and that&#39;s helped but I still have slight discomfort still, especially when driving or having to focus on near and far objects.

I went to check on him and he was yellowish in color and barely able to speak to me. I asked another pharmacist to get me a cold pack and water. By the time we got the cold pack and water, he was not speaking, but eyes were open. I called 911 and the other pharmacist fanned him and placed the cold pack on his head and neck. He started talking within minutes and we waited for ambulance to come just to check him out. He was ablet to verify his name and where he was and EMSA came at 3:50pm. He left to their truck and said he was okay just felt shaky and clammy, but he could hear everyone talking to him.

April 9 (5pm): feeling very cold and tired (worse than noon) April 9 (11:30pm): This time was the most severe for me in respect to side effects. I believe my headache woke me up. The headache was so bad that my eyes hurt as well (swollen almost). I think my fever broke. I felt very ?heavy? all over. The main concern was that around midnight I was having sharp pains on the right side of my body, near where my Liver is located. That was one effect that I did not read about. The sharp pains happened once every few minutes. I considered going to the ER but wasn?t sure. I ended up just changing my shirt, got some water, and went back to bed.  April 10: My appetite was not normal, I ate but very little. The sharp pain on my right side went away but I had a minor headache for the rest of the day.

Also became quite thirsty. During the entire night I also had horrible dreams. After about 5am things started improving. Had some light sensitivity in the morning for a shot bit. By noon I was almost back to 100%

                                                I typically faint when getting shots or blood drawn. I did faint about 10 seconds after the initial shot injection. I was conscious throughout but was not able to speak clearly or control my body even though I could hear everything going on around me. After 30 minutes, I was feeling back to normal. The remainder of the day I felt drowsy and a little out of it. At 12:15am I began to get severe chills and shakes. This lasted throughout the night but was the worst from about 12:15-1:00am. I woke up at 4am with a fever and sweating. My entire body was stiff and in pain with aches specifically in my arms and legs. Very sore pain in my left deltoid where the shot was injected and is still slightly sensitive. It felt like my veins were stiff and in pain and it hurt to move. I had what I can describe as flu like symptoms (i.e. my teeth hurt, my body ached, fever, shakes, body stiffness and overall tiredness and weakness). These all lasted until about 6:30am at the worst and were relieved over the next few hours. I started to feel back to normal around 3pm later that day. That was April 11th. Last night, April 12th, I had trouble sleeping because my left arm was in pain from my elbow to fingers. It was a lingering pain that went away by this morning and  is mostly gone now (morning April 13th).

Around 5 hours after injection I was overcome with extreme lethargy and had to sleep. 8 hours after injection I woke up very nauseous and could not stop salivating, however I never puked. I woke up again 18 hours after injection and felt nauseous and my chronic back pain had returned. I also had a weird throbbing pain in the right side of my neck and in the lower left side of my left leg. All symptoms were gone by ~36 hours after the injection.

I started feeling flu like fatigue, body aches, and a headache 8 hours post injection. I ran a 101&#43; fever Monday night and got less than 4 hours sleep due to fever and fairly intense muscle aches. On Tuesday morning the headache, fever and muscle aches persisted till the late evening accompanied by general fatigue. By 9:00 on Tuesday night I was feeling significant improvement and slept well Tuesday night with minor night sweats on and off. Wednesday morning I felt 80% back to normal. No fever, minor headache only evident when standing up quickly or sudden head movement, and continued muscles aches body wide specifically in the neck and chest as well as injection site muscle soreness. These symptoms continue to persist into Thursday at the same or perhaps slightly elevated levels. Friday 4/15 symptoms persist with generalized soreness, fatigue, headache,  injection site soreness. Not his typical self.

                                                I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 7 hours post-vaccination. Symptoms started with severe chills, elevated heart rate, fever (~102), and progressed into muscle and joint soreness, severe migraine with sensitivity to light, and strong fatigue, coupled with insomnia. The symptoms were severe enough that I considered going to the hospital, but ultimately did not. Fever, chills, and elevated heart rate subsided by the next morning (~12 hours after onset), but muscle soreness, migraine, and fatigue lasted for another 12-24 hours, along with a loss of appetite.  I am an otherwise healthy, male adult with no outstanding medical conditions whatsoever. This was one of the most severe immune responses I have ever had, including actual illnesses. I have received other vaccinations in the past and never had any response nearly as severe. I was significantly concerned for my overall health during the height of the vaccine response, and I wanted to report this to ensure that is aware of these types of responses, and can help prepare others by informing them adequately of the types of responses to expect from the vaccine. This response very much took me by surprise in terms of severity -- I had to call out of work at a critical time.

                                                This is a comprehensive neurological evaluation for a very pleasant right handed 32 year old gentleman who denies any past medical history who presents to the hospital with several day progressive visual changes and facial weakness. Patient reports he noted on Saturday that he had somewhat of a headache, he does get headaches from time to time in particular while looking at screens the television, he did have some associated blurring of his vision as well. This was not the worst headache of his life. He had no other associated symptoms. He went to bed on Saturday, he awoke on Sunday and went out to eat and noted that he couldn&#39;t form his mouth around the utensil, his face and lips and mouth felt weak. He still did have an intermittent headache and perhaps some neck pain as well at this point. His vision was still blurry. He denies any recent trauma, no car accident no whiplash no falls. He did go to an outside facility where a CT brain was performed and was normal he was told. He has noted yesterday that he could not close his eyes unless he did it manually, also he notes the way his voice sounds is different to him. He has not appreciated any weakness of his arms or legs. He is able to lift up his head off the bed without trouble. He does not think he has a hard time swallowing or breathing per se however he does describe that he is more &#34;aware&#34; of his breathing. He describes paresthesias of his face and around his mouth. No recent URI or diarrheal/GI illness, he did receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID -19 vaccine March 31st. Seen and evaluated in the ED with ed staff. He does report he recently ran a virtual type marathon over the course of 16 days. Clinical context and exam most consistent with that of GBS type variant (?Miller Fisher).  Treated with IVIG.  Symptoms improved after 1 dose.  4 more doses pending.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine JJ: 32 y.o. male w/ no PMH presenting 2 weeks after receiving his Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine after having severe L calf pain found to have thrombocytopenia.    From H&amp;P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&amp;J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation. As he has had 2 negative US for DVT, unlikely that he has an unresolved DVT. abdominal and head CT are neg for thrombosis.

                                                Patient had standard side effects (fever, fatigue, muscle soreness) day 1 and 2 after vaccination. Starting approx. 3 days after vaccination, patient started noticing altered smell and taste, which has gotten worse in the 14 days since vaccination. Patient also has fatigue and has been experiencing weakness since vaccination. These symptoms are identical to the symptoms the patient had with COVID (starting ~3 weeks after contracting COVID and lasting over a month). The patient contracted COVID in December 2020 and had fully recovered prior to vaccination. Recrudescence of symptoms appears to be due to immunological response to the vaccine.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection I began experiencing extreme fatigue. This was soon followed by uncontrollable shaking and chills. As this progressed I began to experience extreme aching pains all over my body, a headache, and dizziness. I fell asleep somewhere around 11pm or 2 hours after on set of symptoms. I awoke multiple times in the night to body aches and a head splitting migraine. During the night the chills and shaking turned into a fever and sweating. At 6am the next day I forced myself to take some painkillers and hydrate. The body aches had started to recede at that point but the migraine was extremely painful and It was nearly impossible to open my eyes with a hypersensitivity to light. I slept on-and-off through the next morning and nearly all symptoms stopped by 1pm on May 8 or 24 hours after the injection.

Took acetaminophen day of vaccination, which helped, and soreness has lessened over time, but still lingers. Morning after vaccination:  Muscle aches, chills, feverish.  Took acetaminophen every 6 hours and it helped somewhat, particularly in the morning, but was less effective as the day went on. Next day:  felt mostly better from feverish symptoms.  Pain/tenderness in arm has continued but lessened over time.

                                                Roughly three hours after getting the shot I was very cold and developed a fever of 102.8. I vomited that night. I took an ibuprofen to help reduce the fever then slept. For the next six days I had an on again and off again low grade fever and was nauseas most of the time. Sometime during those 6 days I developed intermitted tingling in my left hand, primarily by index finger. This continues to today happening roughly once a day.  On rare occasion my right had will do the same thing but that is far less often. I never had tingling in either hand prior to my vaccine. I also developed heartburn occurring roughly 1-2 times a day. Prior to the vaccine I rarely (1-2 times a year) had heartburn and I have not changed anything about my diet or lifestyle since my vaccine. Occasionally my head feels &#34;foggy&#34; as well and this began sometime after the vaccine but I can&#39;t recall exactly when it started. It&#39;s not a headache, more of a slight lightheaded, dull feeling. I had none of these symptoms with any regularity until I was administered the vaccine.

                                                Patient began sweating profusely approximately 10 minutes after his vaccine.  He went to his parent&#39;s car and asked his father to turn on the air conditioning as he was hot.  he then passed out in the back seat of the car.  His mother came inside and asked for assistance.  I grabbed an epi-pen and ran outside to the car.  Patient was breathing and had a pulse rate of 64.  He aroused shortly after I began asking him if he could hear me and asked if he could tell me his name.  He was pale (notably his lips were quite pale) and confused.  He could not say his name but could nod appropriately to questions when asked.  We immediately called EMS for assistance.  They arrived within 4-5 minutes and transported the patient to hospital.

Tried to get him to wake up, he opened his eyes but immediately closed them again. I attempted to keep him alert and eyes open. This proceeded to go on for several minutes. Ice packs were placed on neck and wrists. Feet elevated. Once patient was alert and oriented, water was provided and patient was instructed to take small sips. Patient was kept in pharmacy area for additional 15 minutes once he was back to normal. Patient stated that when he passed out, he felt tired, couldn&#39;t see or hear.

Suddenly I began to get tunnel vision and felt as if I was about to pass out. I was transported via ambulance to Medical Center where I was given IV and medication to treat vertigo and massive head pain/migraine. Since that day I have continually dealt with severe neck and head pain leading to migraines causing visual issues (auras and blind spots), vertigo, and nauseau.

                                                Patient had rapid heart beat that occurred on and off of approximately 10-15 minute intervals over the course of 40 minutes. His face also felt warm at the temple area. His blood pressure was elevated when taken by EMT services but pulse was normal. EMT was called and he was given the option to go to the hospital which he did as precaution.

                                                7 minutes after the injection of my Janssen injection for COVID-19, a heat enveloped my body from deep in my chest and I went pale (according to the objective findings of my nurse) and I began to feel lightheaded and almost became syncopal. I was asked to remain there for 30-minutes, and began to feel better shortly thereafter. The next several days, the lightheadedness came and went in waves, which became stronger and stronger. Two days post-injection, I developed severe joint pain where I&#39;d otherwise previously had none - for instance, my low back ached with 7/10 pain which only went away after the first week. I had thoracic spinal pain which radiated to my chest, and by day 3 I was having serial panic attacks (which I don&#39;t have), such that I visited the local emergency department to rule out sinister cardiorespiratory sequelae. I was discharged with a ddx of GERD, though I do not believe this to be true. Since then, I have largely recovered, however the lightheaded spells have dissipated only a little but are largely still plaguing me. Thankfully, the panic attacks have decreased to the point of almost being gone altogether.

                                                At around 4 am when he came to bed, he lay down and started convulsing. It was like he had an extreme chill but his body was so tensed up and he could not control his muscles or his breathing. He kept convulsing and was unable to control it for about 20 minutes. He asked if he was having a seizure but he was cognitively aware with no trouble speaking and so I told him it was not. His muscles hurt but I assume that was from the prolonged tensing of them. Later that afternoon he complained that his whole body was sore- arm, back, etc. He also has a headache and sore throat. Things to note- he has been running low on sleep (about 3-4 hours a night) for about 5 days leading up to the vaccine date.

Prior COVID, I went to martial arts 4 times a week and went to the gym 4-5 times a week still. My awareness was not good, hand dexterity was not as high, concentrating was not easy for long, high blood pressure, pre diabetic now,  fatty liver, gallbladder stones/sludge, have high wbc count, rbc count high, high alt/ast range is 44-88-116-222, skin sensititivty, could only stay awake for 6 hours at a time.  BTold to introduce coffee to help liver/ keep taking baby aspirin/ put back on Dexilant 60mg. When working out, I go to sleep within an hour of running 1 mile,  weight lifting gets me extremely tired now, now its not as bad, can work out longer.  In may, all my allergies disappeared, now they are back but in first month I was no longer allergic to fruits. This is new and started in June, pimples on skull and ears, voice is normal now, may have grown taller, leg shins hurt when touched. Skin still very sensitive, awake longer now  but when I work out I still get tired where I have to stop, sit, or nap.

                                                I received the shot around 11AM on the 11th. By 5PM that evening I was beginning to have a headache and chills. I drove home from work and by 6PM I had severe chills, I was shaking so bad I could barely fill a cup of water and take ibuprofen, the water was sloshing out of the cup. I had a fever of 102 and spend the rest of the evening in bed, shaking. By around 10 PM the severe chills had subsided and my fever was 101.  I did not sleep much during the night due to a headache and alternating chills/sweating. This morning it is 7 AM and my temperature is 99.5 and I am beginning to feel more normal. I took advil at first and then tylenol every 4 hours during the night.

The symptoms progressed to feeling week and having a chill by 10:00 PM.  I woke several time during the night feeling hot and uncomfortable.  By the time I woke up at 6:30 AM the following morning those symptoms had gone.  I had a bad headache in the morning and took acetaminophen which helped alleviate the headache.  I have felt a bit weak and tired through the day.

Now I still have a minor headache and a dead arm after taking Tylenol (Rapid Release).    I also felt very weak and fatigued all night with a dry mouth and  plugged up sinus. Felt like I was going to be knocked out for 24 hours. I can hardly do these basic task on my work laptop.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First day after getting the shot I got a feeling of being very tired throughout the day I did not feel like to do anything. Also my arm was very very sore. Even moving it slightly a bit would hurt. The second day is when things got way worse I could not really sleep that well throughout the night because I noticed I had  body aches in my legs and my back. Throughout that day I also felt like I had a fever in the morning I took my temperature and had a 100 fever. At night time I took my temperature and it went up to 102, with  still a bad headache, chills, and body aches throughout my legs mostly. I also felt some palpitations. When I went to bed I was sweating very prefusively all night that I had to change my shirt. On the third day I felt a lot better, still with a slight headache no fever, and still feeling like im sweating on and off.

I took 600 mg of Tylenol as mentioned by the pharmacist for those that are feel side effects. Around 1:00 am, I woke up shivering with a 104.5 fever and nausea. I took another 600 mg of Tylenol, which brought the fever down to 100.5 for the six hours. I also threw-up around 2:00 .

I parked my vehicle and didn?t feel well so I switched seats with my girl friend. As soon as I got into the passenger seat I was out. She said My eyes rolled back in my head and I started shaking and eyes at this point she said where going up down and side to side . She ran for help and after about 1-2 minutes I  woke up. I thought I passed out so I instantly put my feet on the dash of my car and the pharmacist gave me water and chocolate milk.  He then checked my heart rate it seemed good  and after 20 minutes he let us go home.

CMA noticed that continued to shake arm after 5 minutes but patient was alert and oriented x 3.  CMA thought the way he was shaking his arm seemed irregular so she advised pt he would be taken to an observation area for further observation.  Half way to the observation area, pt reported to CMA that he was seeing spots and felt like he was going to get sick.  CMA called for help.  Patient experienced a syncopal event just as he made it to the chair.  Several staff was helping to support patient.  Legs were lifted to another chair.  Patient was not responsive for a short time, very diaphoretic, breathing regular and unlabored.  Patients eyes then rolled upward toward the ceiling and patient&#39;s entire body began shaking uncontrollably while staff managed to keep patient from falling to floor from the chair.  Once patient was conscious, he was able to state his name but reported he was very confused and could not think clearly.  He was able to sit upright.  In the meantime while patient was shaking uncontrollably, staff sought urgent care provider to come and see patient.  Patient was then taken over to the urgent care side of the building to evaluate and treat patient.

                                                Right arm became very sore the following day and remained extremely sore for about five days after receiving the first and final dose of the J&amp;J vaccine.  On the day following the injection, I began developing a headache.  I didn&#39;t think twice about it until the headache didn&#39;t go away on the second day, the third, the fourth, but finally the fifth day it seemed to subside.  The intensity was severe and was concerning due to how long it lasted.  I had simply assumed that it was normal side effects.  Yesterday on Monday, 04/12/2021, I developed severe and sharp pains in my stomach/abdomen that actually put me in bed all day.

                                                I received the vaccine Saturday 4/10/21 at 9 am. By 8 pm of the same day I had fever, chills, headache and body aches. For about 30 minutes I saw a white spot on the peripheral  view of my left eye.  By Monday, I felt dizzy and bottom right part of my chest hurt when taking deep breaths. The dizziness and chest pain lasted all week, still feel feel it today 4-18. My doctors office told me vertigo was a common side effect. On Thursday 4-15 every time I bent down and tried to get up, my right leg hurt as if I had exercised. At the moment I haven?t gone into work since Monday 4/12 since my job requires a lot of physical work.  I have mostly been home  resting  but don?t feel ready to go back to work. If someone  calls can it be a Spanish speaking person please.

                                                Within maybe 20-30 minutes of vaccination, I noticed a small dull pain in my right calf;  I disregarded and walked back to the car.  This pain has reduced over the last week, but is still vaguely present.  5-6 hours after vaccination, headache and strong sinus-headache.  Laid down to rest.  I woke up around 20-30 minutes later with full body tremors and muscle spasms.  Muscle spasms particularly violent in my back, feeling similar to if someone was involuntarily using one of those muscle-stimulator elecrode pad systems on  me;  could feel each individual muscle tensing and releasing at random.  Tremors and spasms persisted and then diminished over the next 4-5 hours.   99.7F fever was recorded.   Chills, fever, nightsweats, and repeated sleepless rest/waking every 30-40 minutes until the next day.  Headache was still strong and present at 4am,  took 600mg ibuprofen and continued hydrating.  Headache, general soreness, and fever persisted for ~3 days, but manageable with hydration and rest.  On day 3 a rash appeared on both my knees/innerthigh just above the knee.  Likely not hives, subdermal red speckles that appeared at night;  close to 4mm in diameter, skin was warm to the touch and very itchy.  Most of the rash was gone by morning, and the itching and warmth was completely gone.  I have noticed a very similar rash appear on my front left collar/shoulder area just this morning, but no itch/warmth.  Outcomes: Muscle spasms/tremors subsided within a day. Fever/headache subsided within 3 days Knee/Thigh rash gone. More similar rash just appeared on upper left shoulder/collar. Upper calf dull pain still present, but only barely  &#34;It feels a bit off&#34; would be the best description.

He received the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/8 and felt well afterwards. Last Friday (4/16) he began to experience constitutional symptoms (fever to 100.4, chills, night sweats feeling drenched, decreased appetite) so decided to get his labs drawn as an outpatient for further evaluation.

He had test in the past to determine root cause but doctor do not know why he had seizure.   He said he did not want his girl friend to come in because he didnt want  her to freak out just in case he had a seizure.   I observed patient for full 30 minutes to make sure he was well to leave and his girl friend took him home.  I did not know about his seizure history and he did not indicate it on the vaccine form.

                                                Started feeling tightness in my left arm and left side. Then, eventually, I had muscle spasms on my left side. They had to issue 2 CC of lidocaine in my left shoulder. My muscles were so painful that I couldn&#39;t drive or stand any type of vibrating sensations, and I was issued muscle relaxers  My left arm will go numb frequently and I have trouble moving it. For a while, I couldn&#39;t sit up straight or work because of my arm.  My blood pressure has also shot up significantly and is often over what is healthy for me

I had no respiratory issues but I had a little troubling swallowing. I met with a Teladoc doctor who said that if I didn&#39;t get better by 6pm, to go to the ER. At 5:20, things calmed down and the reaction stopped. I felt very tired.

His hands were flinching into fist and pt was unresponsive.  This lasted about 20-30 secs.  We called ED and got the operator on the phone.  When we started to give the operator information, pt starts waking up.  Pt&#39;s mom didn&#39;t want the ambulance to come since pt is now awake so we told the operator everything is fine now and hung up.  Pt&#39;s forehead was sweaty and facial color was very pale.  We gave pt some water to drink and asked pt to continue to sit there and relax.  Pt has no idea of what happened he said he just remember one moment talking to his mom and the next moment she was holding him up.  Pt sat there for a total of about 1 hour and he said he was fine so they left.  We informed mom and pt to please go the UC or ER for follow up but they declined.  They said they will have him rest and hopefully things will be OK soon.  I checked his Blood pressure x 2 and both times they were good at around 128/87.  Gave mom my pharmacy business card to call with any further questions or concerns

                                                Patient received dose of Janssen Covid vaccine in right deltoid. He chose the right arm because his left upper arm is fully tattoed. Patient sat for about 5 minutes and then he got up and fell forward on our counter in the waiting room. After about a minute he got up and sat on the bench for a few minutes. We discovered him after about 10 minutes lying sideways on the bench. First BP reading was 86/63mmHg and patient was clammy and sweating. His major complaint was fatigue. He took a sip of soda and ate a peanut butter cup. EMS arrived his BP had gone up to 120/68 mmHg. Oxygen levels were normal but patient refused to allow EMS to check his blood glucose.

At approximately 6:00 P.M., patient&#39;s companion alerted pharmacist that patient appeared to be unresponsive. Patient was slumped forward and momentarily unresponsive to verbal queues. Patient quickly (within seconds) became oriented and stated he felt hot and sweaty. Pharmacist called 911. Patient denied difficulty breathing and reported no swelling or difficulty swallowing. EMTs arrived within 10 minutes. EMTs determined that patient most likely experienced vasovagal syncopal episode. Patient was allowed to leave on his own accord by EMTs with instructions to seek medical attention if difficulty breathing developed. Duration of entire case was approximately 25 minutes.

I had a temperature of 99.5 but immediately came down. In the early morning (the next day since receiving the vaccine), I felt nauseous followed by a headache. I also felt dizzy, but that immediately subsided. All of the mentioned side effects have subsided. My arm has been sore since receiving the vaccine but the pain has relatively minimized over time.

Felt basically normal by the time I left the facility and my arm has not been hurting since.   Approx 8:00 PM onset of headache, progressively worsening thru ~11:00 PM and plateauing. Headache was less by ~8:00 AM, and took Ibuprophin at 9:00 AM to further alleviate.   Approx 9:30-10:00 PM onset of chills and shivering, progressively worsening thru ~11:30 PM. Chills lasted through the night, but shivering stopped around 12:00 AM after turning the heat up and putting on more clothing, beanie, and blankets.   Fatigue is ongoing (as of now, ~22.5 hours after administration), but may be a result of poor sleep due to the chills overnight.

                                                After vaccination, patient appeared to be slouched over in chair in observation area.  Two bystanders approached him and held him to prevent him from falling from his chair. Patient was diaphoretic and eyes half-closed. Attempt was made to arouse patient by talking to him and rubbing chest. His head and body moved erratically for approx. 3 seconds.  Patient was lowered to the floor. Nurse continued speaking to patient and rubbing his chest.  He then opened his eyes and was startled. Patient abruptly sat up and said, ?what happened and where is my phone?? The nurse reassured him he was being taken care of and she asked if he knew where he was?  Patient replied, ?I have no idea.?  A paramedic approached and asked the patient if he knew his name.  The patient correctly replied. The patient had no recollection of what had taken place, but did know where he was. Patient was then evaluated by the paramedics.  All tests performed were normal and patient refused to be transported to hospital.  Patient was driven home by his wife.  Follow up phone call to patient yesterday evening with no answer.  Follow up phone call to wife (listed as emergency contact), 4/7 at approx. 6 pm.  Per wife, patient experiencing fatigue and still very pale. She said he just wasn?t himself. Patient was concerned that they did not know what to expect a week or two from now.   I advised patient that if she had concerns, she needed to have patient evaluated in ER.

                                                Minutes after receiving the injection (4pm) my blood pressure dropped and I lost consciousness. I recovered well enough to drive home within 15 minutes afterwards. That night (10pm) I began shivering, which escalated to periods of convulsions, to which a mouth guard was needed to prevent chipping teeth and/or biting my tongue. There was no fever present, and to subside the uncontrollable shivering I sat in a very hot shower until motor functions gradually returned. Periods of headaches, joint pains and sweating ensued for the remainder of the night. There were no other symptoms in the following days.

                                                Began with cramping/convulsing of my left thigh, then my right and within a split second all the muscles in my body were convulsing for about 3-5 minutes.  I had a headache and small tremors following that episode.  Tylenol helped but side effects did not dissipate until the following morning 3/11  at 10AM.  Fresh air helped also.

Called patient at 7pm to check in and they stated they &#34;felt better but still off&#34;.

T&#43; 2 days - 7 days: fever subsides, hot flashes increase in intensity significantly, continuing to interfere with sleep. Other possible androgenic symptoms begin to arise: change in body odor, sex drive, motivations, appetite. T&#43; 7 days till current: previous symptoms of days 2-7 continue, extremely gradual onset headache begins one night. Making sure to rule out hydration and electrolyte imbalance expecting headache to be gone in the morning after sleep, I found that it was only worse and that an interpolation of the two pain points from when I went to sleep and woke up would have created a almost imperceptibly gradual but linear increase between the two points. The headache was of a type I had never had before, located in the center of my head just barely dorsal to the spinal insertion. It felt deeper than any headache I had had before which usually occur in the frontal lobe/neocortex zone. I do not regularly suffer headaches getting maybe a couple per year. Once I recognized androgenic involvement and the headache were continuing I took myself to the ER where I was evaluated and despite presenting with continuous hypertension and the symptoms mentioned above, I could not get them to perform a estrogen test and they let me leave with hypertension without any investigation. I&#39;m returning today to their urgent care facility to try again to get my estrogen levels checked. I had left a message on the phone line of VAERS prior to the original ER visit but had not heard back from anyone so I felt it was prudent to file a written report here.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  About six hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt a sudden lack of energy followed by uncontrollable shivering. I developed a low-grade fever that persisted for three days. I treated the symptoms with over-the-counter medications. I did not see a doctor. The symptoms went away on the fourth day after receiving the shot.

I was lightheaded within 5 minutes and that lasted about 30 more minutes of dizziness/lightheadedness. My left ear started ringing as soon the the lightheaded feeling started subsiding. About 2 hours later I had a small muscle cramp in my neck and the ringing stopped. My face was numb until about 2am.

I went to the emergency room the next day after pain meds (ibprofen) did not help, and they did an EKG and X-Ray and they said it was a muscle strain. I went home and alternated between 3000 MGs of Tylenol every 24 hours, 2400 MGs of Ibuprofen, 8 hours of 4% lidocaine patch and then off for 8 hours &#43; and a heating pad when the patch was off. The pain in my chest got worse and worse on Mon and Tue (started having spasms in the chest that caused extreme sharp shooting pain down my back up into my head) so went back into the ER Tues night.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced fever, chills and a left sore arm and those symptoms resolved in 24 hours. On 04-06-2021 I experienced headaches on and off and on 04-07-2021, I had light headiness, an air-filled pressure sensation to my eyes, forehead, more like a sinus headache. On 04-14-2021, I went to see my PCP due to my headaches continuing, the doctor ran complete blood panel test were performed along with a D-dimmer test to rule out blood clots and he told me to take Advil as pain medication.  My D-dimmer test was normal. I noticed when bending down my headaches became worse. On 04-20-2021, an MRI of the brain was performed. On 05-01-2021, I experienced muscle body aches, fever and continued with headaches. I went to a walk-in clinic, where a Covid-19 test was performed and it was negative. I started taking antibiotics and the fever and muscle bode aches started to go away. I still have to this day headaches and an air-filled pressure sensation around my eyes and eyebrows.  As of today, my headaches are consistent, and they come and go.

                                                Patient was advised to remain in observation area for 30 minutes due to history of breathing difficulty with sulfa antibiotics in past. Shortly after being vaccinated the patient presented to our service window stating he did not feel well and was immediately escorted by the pharmacist to our administration area to have a seat. He stated he felt light headed, flushed (though not visibly), felt like his heart was racing, and was not having diffuculty breathing but felt like he couldn&#39;t catch his breath and stated he thought he was having a panic attack. He had stated before vaccination that he had not had a vaccine since his routing childhood schedule, his whole family had already had doses, and he had been putting it off because he was nervous. He insisted he needed some fresh air several times and was escorted outside by the pharmacist (with emergency supplies and a cell phone and within shouting distance of the pharmacy) for continued obsevation and was given water when requested. After a few minutes he stated he felt much better and the symptoms had resoved. He was directly observed outside per his request for the remainder of his waiting period and had no further symptoms. He was instructed to call the pharmacy right away if he had any additional symptoms after leaving.

We laid him on the floor and he started to shiver and said he was cold. We monitored his pulse and contacted emergency services. An ambulance came at 10:45 AM and they asked which vaccine he was given and took over care of the patient. We gave the paramedic the EUA facts sheet for the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and they took the patient.

It&#39;s not a muscle weakness in my leg; numbness in my foot and pain in my leg (right leg). Primary care doctor - had me take Oral Steroids and that didn&#39;t help. I&#39;m taking Gabapentin - it does help with the pain when I do take it - but I can&#39;t drive with it so to go to work I can&#39;t take it.

                                                Nothing for the first two hours; malaise and fatigue from hours 2-8 post-vaccination, with a return to vibrancy around 1500 local time. Around 1700, fatigue returned. Took a 3 mile walk between 1700-1800. Consumed two beers @ 7% ABV between 1800-1845. Around 1830 began feeling tingling, chills and muscle and joint pain which continues. The pain is similar to DOMS that occurs after a robust workout; did not have a robust workout today. I&#39;m fully functional, able to eat and able to otherwise function, so the symptoms are manageable.

He now describe it similar to &#34;numbness on your foot when you sit on it too long&#34;.   He said he would be okay and he left.

I fell asleep and woke up at about 3 AM with incredibly itchy skin from the tops of my feet all the way up to my shoulders. It was so itchy and uncomfortable that it woke me up. I took 2 Benadryl and put some anti-itch lotion on, and was able to fall asleep. I woke up the next morning feeling groggy, but better. The itch has not returned at all in the week since this happened.

                                                Terrible body aches starting at 8pm on April 1st.  Then had the chills.  Was able to take ibuprofen and slept for a bit.  Next morning April 2, got a migraine where it hurt to open my eyes.  Had that for about 2 hours then got better.  Also, I had trouble eating.  I would take a small bite of crackers and feel like I was going to throw up.  Took me a long time to eat a package of crackers and to drink 1 whole bottle of gatorade.  I took more ibuprofen through the day and that helped.  Around 5pm that night I was able to eat a little more and drink some with out feeling sick to my body.  Around 9pm that night headache came back and I went to bed for the night.  Today April 3 I feel a lot better.  Body still aches a bit and feels like I?ve been sick for 2 days so will probably take today and tomorrow to fully recoup.  No headache today.  Just small aches and tired.

                                                Patient felt light-headed, then became unresponsive. He moved both arms halfway up, and they both quivered simultaneously. I called for help. One nurse raised his legs &amp; another put a pulse oximeter on patient &amp; took his BP. Patient started responding to verbal cues. A nurse gave him Gatorade to start drinking. He was drenched in sweat from head to feet. The nurse continued to take his BP, which did hit 120/~70, but then dipped again. Once his BP &amp; pulse stabilized, he was able to go home. Patient ate a full meal &amp; a non-diet soda. He reported being exhausted ~4 pm. He fell asleep &amp; rose once to urinate.  Dr. at a Family Medicine practice checked his heart and lungs, and confirmed this did not appear to be an allergic reaction, but more likely was a vagovasal reaction. Patient started reacting ~10 minutes after the injection.

                                                About 6/7 hours after the vaccination, I experienced fairly violent chills/shakes and the beginnings of a headache. I went to bed and woke some hours later with a 101-102-degree fever and muscle/joint aches (at the injection site on my left arm and throughout my body; I especially thought the joint aches in my legs and hands).  Now, about 27 hours after the vaccination, my fever has reduced to 99 degrees, my chills/shakes are gone, and my headache is mostly gone. The primary symptoms I have are the remaining sight fever, continued joint/muscle aches (mostly in my legs) and fatigue.

                                                I received vaccine about 4:00 PM. I felt fine until I went to bed about 10:30 P.M. I got extremely teeth chattering cold and could not get warm and began to have a small headache. I awoke about 2:30 A.M. and was extremely hot. I went downstairs to bathroom and the next thing I know my wife is shaking me to wake me up laying on the floor. My wife said she heard me fall and discovered me in the bathroom floor. She woke me up and I stood up and exited the bathroom and collapsed in the hallway. My wife awoke me again and I didn&#39;t know what occurred. My wife called 911 and EMS responded and assessed my condition. I explained everything that occurred and that I had my J&amp;J vaccine hours earlier.  My vitals were taken and my condition was evaluated. I had a bad headache that felt like my head was in a vise and my knees and chins hurting a bit from the fall I was fine. I just did not recall collapsing either time and I was distraught when my wife woke me both times. That&#39;s what I was informed by my wife. I don&#39;t recall anything after urinating to being woken up by my wife and I was on laying on the hallway floor and my wife was on the phone with 911.

Patient started to feel light headed and nauseous while walking to his car.  About 20 minutes following vaccination, a vaccinator had walked passed his vehicle and noted that he was unconscious.  Patient was still unconscious upon medical response team arrival and unresponsive to stimuli.  Once the patient awoke about 30 seconds later, he continued to state that he was nauseated and ?did not feel good.?  Patient was unaware that he had lost consciousness.  He further disclosed that he had been working in the sun planting trees all day and had not consumed any food or beverage.  He denied allergies to medication, food, and other vaccines.  He relayed that he had passed out from vaccinations in the past as a child.  He affirms lightheadedness and nausea.  He denies chest pain, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/lips/tongue/throat, skin rash/itching, cramping abdominal pain, and vomiting.

It happened a lot at first, and happened multiple times a day for 10-20 minutes at a time.  After a couple weeks it slowed down to the point where it only happens every couple days.  This absolutely did not happen before that exact day so I am relatively sure it was caused by the vaccine.

The patient had a gatorade and rested for about an hour and his wife drove him home. I called him 2 days later to check in on his status and he said he got a good nights sleep and felt much better with just a sore arm.

My left arm is extremely tingly, almost as if it?s asleep. As of this evening (4/18/21 around 7:30 PM), I am also experiencing this tingly sensation on the left of my face as well. It feels like pins and needles, and is very bizarre.  I?m extremely confident in saying it?s in direct correlation to the shot.  Please advise.

I proceeded to have left sided weakness,  difficulty speaking, slurred speech, and loss of motor skills.  I was taken to the ER.  They did a CT scan, blood work, and an ekg.  All were normal.  I was admitted to the hospital and they did MRI or the head, MRA of the neck, MRI of the neck and spine, Echocardiogram, Stress test, and further blood work.  Everything came back normal.

I was given water.  The pharmacist measured my blood pressure, and I believe he said I was 70 over 50.  I began to feel like I was about to pass out, so I laid down and gradually began to improve.  I began to feel very cold instead of very warm.  About thirty minutes later, I felt well enough to leave the pharmacy.  After a couple hours, I began to experience what I think are more typical symptoms - stiffness and pain in the arm which received the shot, and chills.  The next day, I experienced sore wrists, shins, and lower back; fatigue; headache; and hot &amp; cold flashes with uncontrollable shivering or sweating at times.  These symptoms were alleviated about 42 hours after the injection, except for persisting mild pain in the arm had which received the shot.

His mother was present and I called for assistance and she came into the room at which point the patient was able to respond to me verbally but he reported being confused, feeling nausea and fatigued. He was visibly sweating.  His mother reported that he had previous episodes of syncope when having blood draws or other injections.  He remained seated and I offered multiple times to contact emergency medically services but he and his mother wanted to just wait as he usually feels better after a short time.  We did give him cold water bottles which his mother used at the nape of his neck.  We also provided him with wet paper towels.

                                                Violent chills happened while working on computer. Laid on heat pad to assist in bed. Chills lasted about 20 minutes. Parasthesia happened immediately. Myalgia in legs happened immediately. No fever at this time.  Woke in morning with no fever, but muscle aches, malaise, lethargy, parasthesia were all present. Spent entire day in bed napping occasionally.  Measured temperature in evening at 100.7F.  Painful stomach pain happened in evening. Patient never gets acid pain or similar so this was very abnormal. Antacid helped but stomach pain continued all evening at a lesser degree.  When going to bed most symptoms had subsided. Still some parasthesia and Myalgia. Woke up on 4/9 feeling much better after lots of sleep.  No fever or other symptoms on morning of 4/9.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine . I went to bed early, at 8:15pm. Within 5 minutes, I began to have uncontrollable chills. My body shivered and my teeth chattered like never before. I live in cold state and it was not a cold night, relatively speaking. I generally find cold nighttime weather easier to sleep in. I had to turn on a room heater, get fully dressed in warm clothes, and use an extra blanket and heating pad to warm up. Within 4 hours, I became warm. But, then I began to feel too warm, and my body went the opposite direction. Now, I was sweating. I took everything off.  That eventually stopped. Then I developed a head cold, at least that is how it felt. My nose became stuffy. This morning, I woke up at 5:30am and feel better.

                                                On the evening of 4/8/2021 at around 8 pm I began experiencing an upset stomach (felt like I might throw up) and then shaking in my stomach started and I got a lot of chills and a headache.  Then I spiked a very high fever and sweat like crazy.  I was shaking like crazy and had to call a doctor on call twice.  I had full body pain and was very sleepy.  The fever and chills lasted a bit over 2 days but unfortunately the pain  in my body had not gone away.  Currently (4/14/2021) I have pain in all my joints and my neck and back and I noticed a rash around my right knee. I have felt very tired. I have felt some mild shortness of breath, which may be seasonal allergies (discussed with a nurse earlier, my oxygen levels are 98 percent today, so I am breathing fine, but there is a sensation of shortness of breath) . I have consulted my primary care office about the above and they are speaking to the doctor.  I am trying to limit my exposure to any hospital setting until the 14 days (2 weeks) is up from the vaccine.  Hopefully these symptoms will go away soon and hopefully none are related to a blood clot issue.  We&#39;ll see if my doctor or you guys may recommend a future platelet test?

                                                Two days following vaccination I started having tingling in my feet.  Often it felt like pins and needles, and eventually more like a burning sensation.  My understanding is generally we would refer to this as neuropathy.  It comes and goes in my hands as well.  I&#39;ve had some significant leg pain in my hip off and on, and a couple of headaches, but the consistent for more than  two weeks has been the neuropathy issue and it is not going away.

When they went to check on him today they found him deceased in his chair.  Further investigation would be needed.

The top half of my spine has discomfort at its best and mild/modern pain the rest of the time. It&#39;s constant. At times my spine feels cold and tingly. Then my entire core gets cold and tingly. I&#39;ve never had back pain or injured my back. This pain is directly related to the vaccine and my experience seems to be outside the norm of side effects subsiding after a couple days.

                                                For 2 days, typical arm soreness, flu-like symptoms with significant muscle pain and general weakness and malaise. However, on the 5th day, EXTREME abdominal pain, left side. Pain level up to 9. Incapacitating. Two visits to urgent care. This was in March before any info came out about adverse blood clot events for the J&amp;J vaccine, so the doctors were not really interested at the time that I had just gotten my shot. They gave me antibiotics, thinking it may be diverticulitis (diagnosis based on symptoms only - no diagnostics - it was the doctor&#39;s &#34;best guess&#34;). Pain did not subside, only got worse. 4 days later I could barely move, abdominal pain was extreme. Went back to clinic and they did a PET scan to check for diverticulitis. There was none; PET scan revealed nothing out of the ordinary. So they told me they had no idea what it was and sent me home. PET scan reading by the doctor notes specifically that blood/vascular was not able to be observed because no contrast or dyes were used. Bottom line was over 10 days of extreme abdominal pain 5 days after receiving the shot. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like that before.

                                                36 Y male patient from another country with a past medical history significant for mild HTN (on 2.5 mg amlodipine) who was in his usual state of health until approximately 4/17/21 when he developed acute onset left volar forearm tingling sensation. He had received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on 4/2/21 in his left arm and states that he did not experience any noticeable reactions after vaccination. He also recalls having had sustained a minor superficial scrape on his left volar forearm by a trash can lid when he had taken out garbage, which occurred very shortly before the onset of this tingling sensation. The tingling sensation then progressively worsened and became more diffuse across most of his body. He then developed fevers up to 102 at home, chills, neck pain, headache, and pain in all extremities (primarily arms but also in his legs).   He initially went to the Health Care ED on 4/28/21. He was afebrile at the time and his vital signs at that time were unremarkable with the exception of elevated diastolic blood pressures (90-104 mm Hg). WBC 10.1 with normal differential, electrolytes and liver enzymes within normal limits. Influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR were negative. Urinalysis showed few bacteria but no WBCs. Chest x-ray was clear. Blood cultures were drawn and patient was then discharged.   Patient returned to the ED on 4/29/21 and reported fever to 102-103 d F, chills, nausea, weakness, body aches, and bilateral foot paraesthesias. He was afebrile (98.8) and his vital signs were within normal limits. His WBC was slightly elevated to 12.2 with a normal differential. His ESR was 11, CRP 1.5, CMP within normal limits. He was noted to have urinary retention and a foley was placed and he was given tamsulosin.    Patient then returned to the ED again the following day, on 4/30/21, with worsening generalized pain and weakness and difficulty walking.   ED course: temperature 101, heart rate 100s-110s, BP 140s-160s/70s-90s, RR low 20s, SaO2 high 90s. Labs remarkable for WBC 13.1 with 82.4% N, ESR 7, CRP 5.9, lactic acid 2.6, RF 10, urinalysis unremarkable, HIV antigen/antibody negative. Several imaging studies were performed. MRI T spine showed &#34;Extensive cord signal abnormality in the cervical and thoracic cord as detailed above, with associated expansion of the cord (most pronounced in the cervical cord). Differential includes acute transverse myelitis, demyelination, infection (HIV, syphilis, other viruses)/parainfectious phenomenon, subacute combined degeneration, and inflammatory etiologies. An underlying mass or masses are not excluded but less likely given extensive multifocal patchy involvement. Recommend postcontrast imaging at this time for further workup. Consider brain MR as well to assess for systemic white matter disease.&#34;   A lumbar puncture was attempted in the ED but was unable to be performed.   Patient was given empiric IV ceftriaxone 1 g q24h and admitted to the hospitalist service. He was evaluated by neurology and was started on Solumedrol 1000 mg for acute transverse myelitis.   5/1/21 MRI brain showed &#34;Multifocal patchy white matter signal changes, predominantly in the subcortical white matter, also present in the bilateral thalami and bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle, and redemonstration of extensive cervical cord signal abnormality and expansion. No associated restricted diffusion or enhancement. Broad differential, but given pattern of involvement findings are most concerning for ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), other considerations include other demyelinating processes, toxic-metabolic pathology, or potentially atypical viral infection.&#34; Patient was given methylprednisolone for ADEM with transverse myelitis and clinically improved. He was hospitalized from 4/30/21 until being discharged to home in a wheelchair on 5/6/21.

While texting her, I started experiencing color distortions and the next thing I knew was the Pharmacist was asking if I could breathe and they laid me down on the floor and called 911. The Fire Department arrived and took my blood pressure and I tried to walk out and the next thing I knew was that I was weak; therefore, the Ambulance transported me to the hospital. In the ER they examine me and ended up giving me a nausea pill after observing me for two hours.

A headache came about 2 hrs after and a little later I developed a fever and the headache went from light to mild.  Throughout the night I could not sleep because the headache had gotten so severe and I had uncontrollable chills and shakes and a fever.  3/6 I did start around the clock Tylenol which did reduce the fever and make the headache less as intense but for about 2 days the headache so bad with pressure  associated it felt as if my eyes were going to bulge out of my head.  By day 3 I woke up feeling better but was in a fog which lasted the remainer of that day and by day 4 all symptoms had subsided

                                                I received my vaccine this morning at 6:12AM and felt fine after. Around 7:45AM I started to feel slightly short of breathe, but figured it was just from the cold outside and my Asthma. The shortness of breathe feeling goes away. Later in the day sometime after 3 PM, I start to feel as if I am getting stuffy. I take a nap on the buss on my way home, and when I wake up I suddenly feel like I am freezing and have chills all throughout my body. I get home and jump in a hot shower to warm up, but it did not help. I then heat up some food to eat dinner, and I go to drink some soda, and I notice I have no taste. I figured the soda was flat, but even flat soda has some taste to it. I then drink a Cherry Gatorade, and still no taste. Now I check my temperature and it is at 101.4, and I have a slight cough.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation.  Within minutes (less than 3), patient was very dizzy, clammy (cold sweats), pale and said he did not feel right.  I assisted him to a sitting position on the floor from his chair and we were able to ease him back to a lying down position from there with his head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient said that the cold floor actually made him feel better instantly.  At 4:18pm after lying down for about 3 minutes we checked his blood pressure with him still lying down.  It was 110/88 and pulse of 104 (so slightly elevated pulse).  He said he was feeling better and we kept him lying down.  Patient&#39;s wife was also there so she was able to provide information in addition to him doing it also.  She did state that he occasionally had panic attacks and she thought this might be one, the patient was adamant that it was not.  At 4:24 pm we checked his blood pressure again and it was 100/90 and Pulse of 104.  He was feeling quite a bit better so we had him come to a sitting position on the floor and he had not eaten in a while so we got him a granola bar and water.  Pt slowly ate these and begin to feel clammy and sweaty again within 3-4 minutes. We checked his blood pressure again and it was 104/90 and pulse of 100.  He wanted to stay sitting to see if it would pass.  We did continuously observe injection site and screen for any other symptoms of an allergic reaction (nausea, cramping, swelling, and none of these were occurring). Since he was still not feeling well we gave the patient 50mg of benadryl (20 mls of 12.5mg/5ml liquid benadryl) with his approval. After about 10 minutes of sitting total he was still having cold sweats and feeling dizzy so we had him lie back on his back with his feet elevated while the benadryl kicked in.  By 4:50pm he was feeling well enough to sit back up and we got him some wraps and a coke from the cafe to eat.  Pt continued to consistently improve and was ready to leave about 5:20pm.  We advised him and his wife of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction and to have those treated to immediately at urgent care or and ER.   We also told him to follow-up with his PCP.  I had a manager help walk them to their car.  They were very kind and grateful.  I will follow-up with a call tomorrow and again on Friday to make sure he continues to do well.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received my dose at 3pm on March 12, and experienced no adverse events until about 5 or 6 hours later. Between 8pm and 9pm, I felt a bit tired, though wasn?t sure it was vaccine-related at first. However, I shortly afterwards started feeling much more tired, and experienced chills and shivering. I went to sleep. My wife later said I felt very warm, though we did not measure my temperature.  During the night, at one point, I got up to go to the bathroom, and became very dizzy and nearly fell over, though I was able to catch myself and did not experience any fall or injury.   I went back to bed. At some other point during the night, I started sweating. My wife later said I felt cold at that point.  For most of the following day, Saturday, March 13, I no longer felt dizzy nor overly hot or cold, but had a migraine and mild nausea. I did not vomit, but I also ate very little during the day. I did eat a little in the morning, and had some water throughout the day. For the most part, I laid in bed, drifting in and out of sleep.   At about 7pm on March 13, I took two Tylenol to try to fight the headache. By 8pm I felt almost completely better. I ate more bits of food, and have felt fine since then. Sunday, I woke up and felt back to normal. I ate normally as well.

                                                Started feeling tired and drained around 10pm the same day of receiving the vaccine and then after going to bed around 11pm I felt body aches, chills, and I assume I had a fever. I could simply not get warm or comfortable and tossed and turned for hours. Felt like I had the flu. Finally fell asleep around 2am. Woke up the next morning around 6:30am and took Tylenol but no longer had a fever or chills. I felt drained and tired throughout the whole next day but unsure if that was vaccine related or simply due to lack of sleep. Slept fine that evening and had no other effects.

Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

                                                JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE EUA  I received the vaccine on 3rd April, 2021, at approximately 9:30 am. There were no immediate side effects. Approximately 10 hours later I began to feel EXTREME cold and chills. So much so that I had to put on 3 layers of clothing, socks and cover myself with 3-4 blankets. I also experienced a fever and body soreness. My wife tended to me with two ibuprofen tablets, 200 mg each and continually to put cold presses on my forehead. I drank a lot of water but my fever continued to spike to 102.8. The symptoms continued for another 3 hours. Out of concern we called the emergency room to ask if we should be concerned about the fever. We were advised to take two Tylenol tablets. My wife gave me two Tylenol PM tablets. About 30 mins after taking the Tylenol tablets and continuing to hydrate, my cold and chills began to subside and I began to shed all of my layers. About 30 minutes after that, my fever levelled out to abougt 100.8. Then I passed out. The following morning, I woke up with cold, chills and fever gone. I had a mild headache and took 2 Extra Strength Tylenol tablets. It&#39;s been four hours since then and I feel fine, just a little weak.

I told him, yes the shot may cause some discomfort after injection and he was standing at this point.  He was about to say something and he fell backwards and hit a mobile laptop cart and the wall.  The patient went unconscious not talking but breathing was given an epipen and 911 called vaccine given a few minutes before 12:30 and 911 called at 12:29.  He regained consciousness fairly quickly and was assessed by the pharmacist and then EMT and transported to the hospital for monitoring.

                                                Patient received vaccination and proceeded to post-vaccination waiting area. After being seated approximately 5 minutes, the patient began to slump over but did not faint. The pharmacist approached the patient, who was then reporting that his heart was racing, he was having hot flashes, and felt faint. His blood pressure was 151/106 and HR 116. Emergency services were contacted; EKG was normal and patient did not need to report to hospital for further care. Patient felt better approximately 45  minutes post vaccination and left at that time.

                                                Patient was waiting in designated waiting are following vaccine administration. About 5 minutes after vaccine I heard wife calling for help. When I went out to assess patient I found him laying back in chair with his head back, shaking, eyes open, and making fists with his hands. I asked him if he wanted me to call 911. He was able to respnd through clenched teeth that he felt very strange and to call 911. He remained conscious and knew his name. We contacted 911 and I supported pt from opposite side of wife. After a few minutes he calmed down and asked for water, he appeared to be sweating around head area. He took a few sips of water until operator on phone asked us to withhold further liquid until EMTS arrived. He was completely back to normal status within 5 minutes, EMTS came and assessed pt and allowed him to leave of his own accord. After the incident her relayed that similar reactions including full fainting spells have occurred to him in the past when receiving vaccines. this was not indicated on his intake form

About 3-4 minutes after his vaccine, he slumped over in the chair and was unresponsive. The pharmacist and store manager stayed with him as a technician called 911. He was unresponsive for about 30 seconds before he came to but then continued to go in and out of consciousness for the next couple of minutes. He said he had a history of dizziness after vaccines. When he was finally able to hold a conversation with us, he said he felt hot and we gave him a cold bottle to put on his head until the paramedics arrived. His blood pressure was 100/50 when the paramedics arrived about 7-10 minutes after we called and patient was fully responsive then. Paramedics continued to monitor him and followed him home to make sure he was okay.

                                                The evening after the shot, I felt common side effects like headache, lack of energy, weakness, fever, chills, body aches, and inflammation. But my skin was also very sensitive to the touch. Upon 100% recovery from the common side effects on Monday, April 19, my skin sensitivity went away but was replaced with intense itchiness that has continued and gotten more intense since then to this day (Wed.). I am developing a few small welts on hands and feet. So far, my symptoms are very mild and not alarming, but are noticeable and bothersome. I do hope they will go away soon. I thought you should know about the skin issue since I have not seen it reported anywhere this far after the shot.

Started with shortness of breath and asthma exacerbation symptoms on 4/1/21; saw PCP, on 4/2/21 for shortness of breath and asthma/allergy-like symptoms. He also reports that since the time of his vaccine his BP has been running slightly high around 140/85 and headaches have continued off and on. He was started on Budenoside inhaler by PCP and prednisone (patient does not recall dose). Came to see me at on-site clinic on 4/13/21 for continued headaches and concerns to blood pressure elevation persistence

While attempting to go to the bathroom, I must have passed out because I woke up some time later on the floor with a busted face and nose, and a severe headache.  Initially the day after the shot, I had sharp shooting pains down my right leg. I have also had a headache on more days since getting the vaccine.  Mental fog and tiredness is also occurring a few days after the initial shot.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after the vaccine my son started to feel shaky and very cold. He laid in bed to try and keep warm and I decided to take his temperature. It was 104.3. F. He didn&#39;t feel to sick just cold and tired. He&#39;s not the complaining type at all. I took his temperature at half hour intervals and at one point it reached 106.3 F. I called the hospital ER and asked if we should bring him in. They said since he wasn&#39;t feeling too too badly to just give him Tylenol. For the next few hours until about 2:30 A.M. his fever fluctuated between 104-105.8. It broke at that point down to 99 degrees F. He woke up this morning feeling OK but just tired. I and my husband both tracked our temperatures so we would know our thermometer is accurate, and we both consistently showed 97 and 98 degrees which is our normal temperature.

After 2 hrs of observation, he was feeling much better and all vitals were normal.

Lifted him out and placed on floor, he was unresponsive - called 911, he came to slightly after 3 minutes.  Ambulance took him to ER and we stayed all day receiving fluids and chest XR (clear).  We were discharged in the afternoon with the doctor saying he has a syncopy episode.  At 4:00 PM PT was going to the bathroom and he stated he didn&#39;t feel good.  I stood in front of him because he turned white and eye rolled up into his head and he blacked out and stopped breathing for approximately 2 minutes while I got him on floor and gave CPR.  Called 911 and he began breathing again .  Back in ambulance to hospital and we stayed in hospital for 2 days.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the vaccine I began developing flu-like symptoms, which quickly escalated. Within a couple of hours I developed a very high fever (which peaked at 104.1 and hovered around 102-103), body-wracking cold chills, extreme lethargy and body aches. The only thing that kept my fever down was 1,000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours, with a cold compress on my head. The symptoms were less severe but still substantial by the following day. On the second night after receiving the vaccine (Monday the 8th) I had nightsweats, but then woke up on the morning of Tuesday the 9th feeling almost completely back to normal. The only other strange thing to happen was waking up today on Thursday the 11th with a giant fever blister on my lip, which I suppose could be attributed to an immune system in temporary disarray or overdrive. I am still very grateful for the vaccine and would do it again, but it was very scary that first night on Sunday the 7th. I don&#39;t remember the last time I felt that sick.

                                                On Saturday 3/20 I experienced the usual symptoms that were noted. On Monday 3/22 I began to get very dizzy with a heart rate of 150bpm. My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

                                                While sitting down during the post-vaccination period, patient asked his wife for water about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Pharmacy staff provided water and pharmacist went over to check on the patient. Patient expressed feeling &#34;hot&#34; and wanted an ice-pack, which was given. Patient expressed feeling &#34;faint,&#34; after which he briefly lost consciousness. Pharmacist immediately started checking for pulse and obtained Emergency Kit. Patient regained consciousness quickly without need of CPR or administration of Emergency Kit medications. At some point patient also released his bladder,  most likely during the syncope episode. Patient expressing feeling &#34;nauseous&#34; and asked for something to throw up in. Pharmacist quickly got a trash can and gave to patient, shortly after which patient started vomiting. Pharmacist was attending to patient and asked patient if he wanted 911 to be called, to which he replied &#34;No&#34; and that he just needed some time to sit. Patient also stated he did not eat much that day. Pharmacist offered Pedialyte, to which patient agreed, in order to replenish fluids/electrolytes lost due to vomiting. Patient also asked for some crackers since he did not eat much earlier. After taking sips of Pedialyte and taking bites of crackers, patient could not hold anything down and continued to vomit. At that time patient&#39;s wife asked pharmacy staff to proceed with calling 911. 911 was called and paramedics took patient&#39;s vitals upon arrival at the scene. Vitals were all stated to be normal. Patient agreed to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. A couple hours later patient&#39;s wife informed pharmacy staff that patient was doing much better and was expected to be released from hospital soon. Before receiving vaccination, patient did share that in the past he had &#34;felt faint&#34; when giving blood but it was not made clear that patient had felt faint or fainted during vaccinations prior. After the incident patient&#39;s wife confirmed that patient had fainted in the past both after giving blood and after receiving vaccinations. Pharmacist called patient at 9:12 AM the following day (4/3/21) to see how patient was doing but was only able to leave a voicemail message.

                                                The evening after I received my vaccine I became very cold and couldn&#39;t get warm, to the point of shivering very hard, while at the same time having a fever of 102 F (about 9:30 pm).  The house was 68 F, and I bundled up with thermal underwear, fleece pajamas, a robe, and two extra blankets, but I couldn&#39;t stop feeling cold.  My body was painfully sore the rest of the night; this may have been a reaction from shivering so hard and wearing my muscles out.  Later that night, I woke up in a sweat (maybe 11:30pm) and had to strip out of my clothes down to my underwear, and I couldn&#39;t stop feeling warm.  I slept the rest of the night on top of the covers, and woke up very frequently, probably every half hour.  Each time I woke, I drank half a glass of water (about 6 oz).  The next day my fever was gone and I felt normal temperature wise, but my muscles were all very sore.  I had flu-like symptoms for about a week, a little bit less each day.  It was probably a full week later until I felt normal.

When I awoke I was still sweating and cold for the next five to ten minutes.  Paramedics checked my vital signs onsite afterwards (blood pressure, sugar levels, and pulse) and everything appeared to be normal.  I was able to drive home 30 minutes later after making sure that all side effects subsided.  I have not experienced any other side effects from the vaccine.

                                                Hi I was vaccinated Thursday April 8th 2021 at approximately 9:15am. I kept a log so I could share my experience with my friends and family. After vaccination I was fine for a few hours but I randomly got a case of  watery eyes that would last about 15 minutes and then clear up. This happened 4 times over a 9 hour period. Around 9 hours after vaccination I started to feel like I had a cold and my skin all over my body ached to touch and my heart started racing. I felt sunburned and nauseous and went to bed. 13 hours exactly after vaccination I was hit hard with intense chills to the point of teeth chattering and full body shivering. 15 hours after injection I woke up intensely hot and I had a massive headache, full body pain, a tickle deep in my lungs that made me cough, nausea, and a fever of 101. I also was having extreme heart palpitations. I have a laser thermometer and I discovered my fever was 101.5 at my forehead but my neck and chest were 103. I took ibuprofen and kept patting myself with cold wet wash cloths to combat the fever. At this point I debated going to the hospital. I had intense fatigue and I was too weak to move but too sick to sleep. This level of fever and symptoms went on for about a day and a half. Since my vaccination I am still fatigued, I get winded very easily, something small like feeding my dog makes me break out in a sweat, and I need to lay down. I am still weak and fatigued but not to the same level as before and it changes every day. I have a sore throat, headaches, occasionally my body will twitch in random places, fever will pop up and go away, I cough gag and get very weak under any physical stress. I did not have injection site pain out of the ordinary until 48 hours after injection and it felt like a shotgun blast to the arm.. I did have very unusual joint pain from the start. I was injected in my upper left arm, but my lower right ankle was painful and my left wrist...    I am a 38 year old male with treated hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea. My mother who is 65 was vaccinated at the same time as myself and her symptoms were slow onset and much milder than mine but she too has headaches, upset stomach, fatigue, watery eyes, fever, chills, twitches, injection pain, etc.

                                                On April 8, 2021, I received the J&amp;J vaccine. Initially, I only had the chills and body aches. Then, on Monday April 12, 2021, I went to the gym where I worked out. When I came home and after showering, I returned a phone call shortly after 8 P.M. While speaking on the phone, I could tell after a few minutes of talking something was off, and then all of a sudden, the words stopped coming out. After a few more seconds, I was trying to yell upstairs to my wife for help. I sounded like a goat while trying to yell that word. I then snapped out of it, and was able to speak clearly and normal again. I told my wife and called back my friend. My friend said I sounded like I was getting sick when I had the attack. The next morning I went to the hospital. I was diagnosed with a Transient Ischemic Attack &#34;TIA.&#34;

About a day or two later, I developed a chronic cough that is still currently persisting.  After seeing my doctor on Sat 4/17, I was prescribed an Albuterol inhaler for asthma, which has been dormant for years.   The coughing is continuous, and at times strong/violent.  On the morning of Tues 4/20 I had coughed up a little bit of blood after the coughing had persisted for about 5 or 10 minutes.  Asthma, chronic cough, and  coughing up blood are not typical/documented side effects of received the Covid vaccine.  My asthma has been dormant for years, and prior to this event, I have not had instances of chronic cough or coughing up blood.

The next morning, I felt very tired walking up stairs from the basement to my room on the 2nd floor..barely made it to the 2nd floor, felt like my body hitting a wall/ no energy to lift my legs up. I made to my bedroom but felt very dizzy, using my hands holding myself up on my desk and realized I might faint any seconds..my vision was bright and blurry. I slowly moved myself to a bed and laid down for a while. Later that day in the late afternoon, my muscles were sore (legs, thighs, back) I could not walk more than 10-15 steps which I needed rest. These conditions lasted me for 6 days since receiving the vaccine and felt better on the 7th day. Currently I&#39;m ok.

                                                I had a severe headache starting in the evening. The pain was constant, dull, and felt like it was coming from the center of the head. I don&#39;t have a history of headaches, so this was unusual. After going to bed at 11PM, I woke up around 2AM from the intense pain. I could not sleep for a couple of hours in the night and I took Nyquil, which helped a little bit. I considered going to the emergency room, but decided to wait until morning to make the decision. I was able to go back to sleep and then slept until 11AM. I woke up feeling weak and groggy, although it may have been due to the Nyquil. The headache was improved and gradually diminished throughout the day. The next morning, it was completely gone and I felt back to normal.

                                                On 04-16-2021 I experienced I could feel tingling sensation on my let arm and face, lasting couple of hours. Earlier that night, I woke up I was cold, my temperature was 99.F.  For the rest of the week of Friday morning wok up with headaches, focused at temple, left side of my head. I still had some tingling to my left arm radiating to my left pinky finger. My tingling sensation and headaches come and go and come back again on and off.  I went to see a physician 04-23-2021 and did blood work which was negative. On 04-28-2021 I saw a neurologist on 04-28-2021. I have had this tingling sensation to my body before due to a parasite, previous history. She states that it sounded that the vaccine caused a flare up t my body and recommend treatment steroid injections to my temples and neck. She states this injections work about 70% of the time. She also prescribed muscle relaxer and take Vitamin D complex. Herdiagnosis was related to nerve damage due to the flare up.

I could not get warm.  My body would go from hot to cold and shiver/spasm in a pattern that lasted about a minute or so.  this pattern of hot cold and shiver/spasm lasted approximately an hour.    when that subsided I started to experience relatively extreme fever and flu symptoms.  I completely sweat through my pajamas.  My entire body ached and hurt like a normal fever flu but more extreme.  Around 2:30AM I took three 500mg acetaminophen, 2 mg Xanax and a 10 mg Valium.  I fell back asleep some time between 3:30 and 4:00AM.  I woke up at 8:30 with most of the symptoms having dissipated.  It&#39;s now 10AM.  I still feel groggy and a little achy in my body, but the fever seems to have subsided.  For now that is about it

On Sat, May 1, I had an afib episode in the morning. Reset to sinus rhythm the next morning around 2:30am. I spoke with you during the episode.   3. On Mon, May 3, I had brain fog. I?m usually tired after an afib episode. But this seemed different. I?ve never experienced something like this before. But I chalked it out to the after effects of the afib and moved on. 4. On Fri, May 7, I started having the stiffness in my right calf. I checked in with you that weekend to make sure it wasn?t a clot. After we spoke I think we ruled out a clot.  5. In addition, I?ve developed some added symptoms since then: (i) Sweaty feet. (ii) Pins and needles sensation in feet.  (iii) Tightness in the arch of the right foot. (iv) Feet and hands feel sensitive to cold.  (v) Burning sensation in feet and left hand.  (vi) Mild headache mostly felt in the left temple.  (vii) A pulling feeling on the left side of the face. (viii) A feeling that if I close my eyes, I may faint.

                                                5 minutes after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I went lights out.  As I was sitting in the monitoring area, I was completely fine and then a wave came crushing down on me and I was out for about 5 minutes.  The nurses said it looked like I was having a seizure.  The EMTs called it a syncope event.  I am a member of the military and and have been pumped full of vaccines.  I get my annual flu shot every year.  I have survived 6 rounds of Anthrax vaccines and every other vaccine the military has pumped into me.  This is the First Time I  have ever REACTED this way.  It was CRAZY!

                                                I administered a Janssen covid imz to patient at 1:07pm. Immediately following the patient proceeded to faint, his head fell back and limps went limp. I called for pharmacist  to come into the immunization room for assistance and bring an ice pack. She ran into the room to help. At this time 1:08pm the patient began to shake and had what appeared to be a seizure. I dialed 911 and pharmacist was helping patient and protected his head. After shaking for about 10 seconds, the patient stopped. He then awoke, jumped awake confused and scared. We sat patient down and monitored him. At this time the pharmacy tech called management. After patient was calm and sitting, we called his wife into the room. Management arrived in pharmacy. At 1:12pm patient felt cold and clammy.  He said he very much had to use the restroom. With assistance, he used the pharmacy bathroom. EMT arrived at 1:16pm. EMT determined low blood pressure. Patient had worked outside all morning in heat and was likely under hydrated. Over the next few minutes, EMT determined the patient&#39;s blood pressure was increasing. At 1:22pm, patient declined to go to the hospital. EMT signed off and left. Patient remained in room until about 1:40 with his wife to rest. Management got him candy and a fan to help. His wife and management then took him to their car.

                                                Arms and legs tingling, pins and needles as if they have fallen asleep and this was perpetual, slight numbness, weakness in grip. The feeling of tendonitis only not just in tendons. Every time I move I feel pins and needles through muscles and tightness in joints. This lasted for about three weeks and has declined by about 70% since. I still feel it now localized to elbows, wrists, inner and back of legs with the occasional spams and shaky feeling in my hands. Throughout the day my fingers will randomly shake. It&#39;s not enough to effect motor control loss or precision, but it&#39;s enough for me to notice and feel happening and is extremely unsettling.

THE VACCINE WAS GIVEN WITHOUT INCIDENT AND PATIENT SAID HE FELT OK. HE TRADED PLACES WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND SAT IN A CHAIR IN THE EXAM ROOM. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIS GIRLFRIEND HER VACCINE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS FEELING FUNNY. HIS COLORING CHANGED AND HE WAS DIAPHORETIC. I GOT A PAPERTOWEL WITH COOL WATER ON IT AND PLACED ON HIS NECK AND ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS FOREHEAD. AFTER A MINUTE OR SO, HE DID PASS OUT WHILE IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN CAME BACK TO AND WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED X 4 BUT STILL FELT VERY WEAK. I GAVE HIM A WATER TO SIP ON. HIS GIRLFRIEND STAYED AT HIS SIDE THE WHOLE TIME. HIS O2 WAS 100% AND HIS PULSE 53. HE SAID THAT HE HAD EATEN SHORTLY BEFORE COMING TO GET HIS VACCINE BUT THEN LATER ASKED FOR AN APPLE BECAUSE HE WAS ON A CLEANSE DIET AND REALLY HAD NOT EATTEN MUCH. THE PCT WENT TO GET HIM AN APPLE. AFTER EATING THE APPLE AND SITTING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN HE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE. STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HIS GIRLFRIEND COMMITTED TO DRIVING HIM SO HE DID NOT HAVE TO. HE LEFT WITH NO ASSISTANCE.

                                                Pt had history of anaphylaxis related to bee stings. We asked if he had ever had a reaction to another vaccine and he said no. Pt came up saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the observation period, within about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccination. He look very pale and clammy. I asked if he was ok and he shook his head. Tried to grab a chair for him and he started to collapse. With some help I was able to get him to the ground without injury. We called 911 and I grabbed an epipen. I tried to assess the patient, and he was unable to tell me if he was having any trouble breathing or if his lips/mouth/tongue was swelling. He was conscious but couldn&#39;t speak coherently. I administered the epipen to his right lateral thigh due to his history of anaphylaxis with bee stings. We were able to lay him down while waiting for the ambulance. His color started to return and he was able to respond to questions, but was still slightly confused. He did tell me at this point that he has had similar reactions after vaccines and blood work. The paramedics arrived and took the patients vitals and took him to the hospital.

I looked at my toes and noticed they were turning very pale.  One minute later the bottoms of my feet started turning yellow and within one more minute the bottoms of my feet souls were completely yellow. I have never had this reaction before. It was shocking and looked like I had stepped in yellow paint.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.

                                                10 hours after my shot I had moderate to severe chills with pains that moved around my body. Pain would go from deep pain in my leg, to hands, to feet.  Not ache like the flu, but piercing pain.  Head ache as well. This first round lasted for 1 hour and 36 minutes.  Then, a break for almost two hours. Following that break, the next 12 hours i was achy throughout my body, headache that would come and go and very fatigued.  I was only able to get out of bed for roughly 2 hours during that 12 hour stretch. Following this I ended up getting a fever later that night that lasted for about 2 hours (100.5 at the highest).    Since that night I have had pain daily throughout my body.  They are quick, sometime sharp pains in my head, and various muscles throughout my body. I have also had deep pains as well that have come and go in random muscles in my body.

Some leg pain was noticed the 2nd or 3rd day. And I have experienced ear ringing randomly about a week and a half after vaccination. Those may or may not be related.  Also I feel it important to note in March of 2020 (before testing was available) I experienced a very similar set of symptoms: fever, chills, fatigue, multi-day headache, body ache, 6 weeks of slight cough, leg pain, and a day a few weeks after the coughing started where I had shortness of breath. I wasn&#39;t tested back then as it was not available. But based on the symptoms I experienced, I truly believe I had COVID-19 last year prior to vaccination.

                                                The patient returned to the pharmacy shortly after receiving a Janssen COVID vaccine.  He was sweating, pale, clammy, and breathing hard.  We had him sit, helped him calm his breathing; I assessed for wheezing and swelling of the tongue, but he did not have those symptoms.  The patient was able to speak and did not report dizziness or lose consciousness.  Paramedics responded.  I spoke with the patient this morning, and he reports no residual symptoms.

He then went into a syncopal episode and started having seizure like movements. The nurses onsite assisted the patient to the floor to prevent any injuries. After about 5 minutes the patient came to. As EMT was being called the nurse assessed the patient blood pressure and other vitals which read as the flowing BP 176/86 , RR 19 , HR 83. The EMT team arrived on site around 2:15 and assessed the patient. The EMT&#39;s did a 12 lead  on the patient and noticed some elevation in his heart rhythm and told the patient that he recommends  he go to the hospital the patient refused and went home instead.

                                                I went to bed just fine on the night of the vaccine. Woke up two hours later with extreme shortness of breath, sweating and hot flashes. Symptoms eventually disappeared within 48 hours. But they returned on June 20th, though more mildly. Mainly whenever I puff my cigarette, I start feeling a lack of breath -- not being able to  breath deeply and fully. If I keep puffing, I eventually start having hot flashes and chest pain. It&#39;s very bizarre, because I&#39;ve been puffing 10&#43; years with no problems.
