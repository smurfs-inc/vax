                                                On March 11th at around 10pm I experienced severe shaking, fever, headache and delirium. The next day I improved but had a fever on and off of 99.1. I felt like I was stable, but felt dizziness increasing, and was lethargic through the weekend.   Then on Monday the 15th, I had a noticeable cramp in my right abdomen. At around 8pm CST I began feeling like I needed to burp and that I had GI problems.   The problems increased that night at around 10pm I had pain where the cramp started. Two hours later I started throwing up because of the pain and feeling of too much air inside of me. I could not stop vomiting after 2 hours so went to the Hospital ED at around 2:30 AM Tuesday the 16th.   I was admitted after a CT scan showed and white cell counts confirmed and infection and drastically enlarged appendix. I was diagnosed with an appendicitis and they immediately scheduled me for surgery.

On-site nurses noticed I started to look pale and clammy and took me into evaluation room and checked my vitals. My vitals came back with low blood pressure and low oxygen levels. After resting and a cup of water, my vitals became all normal.

The next day, I woke up with general pain in the body, pain in the arm where the vaccine was injected and it swelled up a little the skin under the eyes (hives). As the day goes by, the pain in the arm has diminished, as well as the hives in the eyes.

My body felt incredibly hot but I did sweat at all. If I would move the bed covers and any part of my skin below my neck felt the air I would get chills the would shake my entire body for a few seconds.  Later that morning; body aches all over, a fever reaching 101.3, fatigue. Over the counter medicines, napping, and a shower helped reduce symptoms.  All was gone by the next morning.

                                                I started to feel really tired around 7:30pm and got a head ache so I went to bed early. I couldn&#39;t sleep well because I got the chills and a fever. I went to use the bathroom around 3am. All of a sudden I got really nauseous, the room spun, everything went black and I fainted in the middle of my bathroom. My wife woke up and helped me back to bed. The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

                                                Heart racing the next day after vaccination. I went for a walk in the park and i noticed my hear rate jumped up to 165bpm on my fitbit for a period of time even though i just began walking. I wasnt running or anything. I was foggy and very jittery. I also experienced the same symptoms today, 4.12.21 while also heading for a short walk. Im an athlete and in great shape and ive never had my heart jump to 165bpm just walking. That would happen normally after a sprint or long run, but not just walking.

                                                Patient received Janssen vaccine around 10:30. He left the observation room feeling fine. once he got at his car and started to drive, he felt shortness of breath and some weakness. Then, he came back to the SR Vaccine site to get help around 10:50. We met him in front of the parking lot, he was having some trouble of breath and weakness. We put him in a wheelchair, brought him back to the Observation area. I asked him to lay down with elevated legs on a chair. He instantly felt better, no more shortness of breath. He did not need to use any Oxygen supply. Also, he drank some water, sit back in the chair and felt better ready to leave with his brother who came to help him just in case. At 11:10 he left the building with orientations about worsening of symptoms and when to call EMS.

Once on the freeway I felt dizzy.  This came on me very fast.  I thought I better get off at the next exit.. but instantly blacked out.  While unconscious I struck another vehicle going approximatley 65mph, rolled my vehicle on its side, skidded, then rolled back upright.  I awoke to my car spun sideways on the freeway, paramedics, and fire dept working the wreck from my window, and no recollection of what happend.  It felt instantaneous to me.    I ate a breakfast of granola, yoguirt.  I hydrated before the shot.  I even took extra Vitamin C.

                                                First evening of the J&amp;J vaccine (4/1/2021) I had a fever, chills, headache, and was lethargic.  This lasted for 2 nights.  These symptoms I anticipated.   What I didn?t anticipate was my abdominal pain.  I still feel as of today (4/14), pain in my abdomen.  The areas of the discomfort are all over my mid-section.  I was so worried that I went to ?Urgency Care? doctor on 4/5/2021 and the nurse had me go for a ?CT Scan?.  I also went to my Primary care physician on 4/13/2021 and described my concern and abdominal pain but didn?t get a diagnosis.

Sonner I felt a slight headache and from time to time it intensified to become unsupportable. At that time though about a lack of oxygenation, because I wore mask for the whole time I was working. About 9:am when I drove to home, I saw everything foggy in front of me.  When I get home I took  some paracetamol and another painkiller, because at that time my entire body was so warm, and the headache was very bad. I slept for 5 hours, when I woke up I went to the mechanic to fix my car.  While I got back during the time I saw the same foggy vision.

                                                Unusual exhaustion within an hour of the vaccine.  Had to go to bed and slept into the evening developing a fever of 103, severe thirst and chills. The fever lasted until 10:00 a.m. the following day, but weakness, thirst, chills and body aches continued for 3 more days intermittently. I would feel like I could finally exercise and then be too weak and tired to go back to routine. My appetite declined for 4 to 5 days as food didn&#39;t taste appealing. On Thursday, April 8, I announced to my mom in the morning that I finally felt like I was back at almost 100% and later in the afternoon felt nauseous, incredible pain in my chest and had dry heaves. I finally vomited some and was once again overcome by a fever of 101 and all I could do was sleep from severe exhaustion. I am against medication, but finally agreed to taking ibuprofen and tums. After sleeping into the next day around noon, I finally was able to eat some breakfast but the pain in my chest continued and I could rid it for another day. I intermittently had to sleep and gave up my exercise routine until my body has had time to recuperate. I have not fully recovered, but my appetite is picking up. I still require more sleep than normal.

                                                The evening of the vaccination I began experiencing tingling at the site of the shot, then this extended through the night to chest pains and tightness in the chest. That continued through the night and into the following day. The following day and  lasting until present (4/27/2021) I have continued to experience tingling at night, extending to my arm and fingers, random very sharp pains in my chest, and some feeling of strong heart throbbing. This subsides during the day-time (when I&#39;m upright versus lying down) but all of these symptoms return during the evening. These are all things I never experienced prior to the vaccine. Also, I have tested regularly for COVID-19 since my companyconducts covid-19 testing and I have not been infected with COVID-19 at any point during the past year. The continuation of these symptoms is concerning. There have been at least two instances where the sharp pains in my chest were much more intense than the other chest pains I have felt since the vaccine.

                                                Got injected, didn?t hurt much. Was told to wait 15 minutes in case of reaction. They walked away and left me sitting in a chair in a public space with everyone else who was waiting. I texted my wife to check in, when I started tearing up and crying for no real reason, then started feeling nauseous so I closed my eyes.   Suddenly I felt like I had been given a shot of adrenaline out of nowhere so I?m just trying to figure out if it?s nerves or a physiological response to something. I?m trying to control my breathing but having a hard time breathing.   Then the fever hit. The most intense flash of heat. I was hyperventilating. I couldn?t open my eyes or move or make a sound, I could just sit there struggling to breathe. My phone was in my hand and I couldn?t lift it. I just simply didn?t have the strength or energy to move.   At some point I legit thought I was about to die. I managed to angle my wrist so I could check my heart rate with my watch. It was 47bpm.   I was fading away but I made myself get control of my breathing and forced myself to take long deep slow breaths. It hurt, and I felt like passing out, but I kept doing it.   Fever turned into chills and then I soaked through my jeans and T-shirt in under a minute. I was finally thinking clearly and breathing and getting oxygen. Everyone else near me was fine.   Nobody checked on me the entire time including the 3 people who sat there and watched me suffer through this.  I told the pharmacist about my reaction and asked if it was normal and didn?t receive any indication that I should be concerned, so I went home since I felt better.   It wasn?t until my friend pointed out that this sounds like anaphylaxis that I thought I should report it. So here I am. Hopefully I?ll be okay.

                                                Mild aches and joint pain  all day. Didn&#39;t think anything of it. Then at 830 pm I very suddenly got the chills. Chills turned into  shakes.  My temp read 99.1. Normal is 97.4-97.7. Took Tylenol and went to bed.  Woke up  a few hours later sweating profusely.  Took temp again, was  101.6.  Was very unpleasant.  Fever broke a few hours later, though it went up and down throughout the next day, but not nearly as high. This was easily the sickest I&#39;ve been in 10-15 years.

At about 10:30pm I started feeling sick, fever of 99.6, muscle and joint pain, chills, dizziness, weakness. Left arm where I got injected also felt like it was falling asleep at some point when it shouldn&#39;t have been based on how I was positioned. I finally took an ibuprofen so I could sleep around 2:30am, and felt better a couple hours later or so. Today so far I feel fine but my resting heart rate is about 30 beats higher than normal so I&#39;m still responding to vaccine.  I think overall my symptoms aren&#39;t out of the ordinary, just way stronger than I was expecting. I felt miserable.

                                                The next day I noticed tinnitus (high pitch mild ringing in both ears) .  Therefore it has been a total of 7 days with ringing in both ears and it has not gone away.  It has been constant, no pulses, no frequency changes, etc.  Just constant high pitch ringing in both ears. Sometimes by inner ear feels funny, slightly tingle feeling that is related to the tinnitus.  The tinnitus is most noticeable in quiet settings, sleeping, reading, watching TV, I do not noticed it as much in office environments, listening to music, walking outside.  I have experienced tinnitus in the past after loud music band or rock concert but do not attend live loud music often and try to avoid it because it hurts my ears.  I do not have any known hearing problem, I try to protect my ears and use hearing protection often to avoid damage. When I cut my lawn I wear hearing protection, when I am working on shop floor I wear hearing protection.  I am thinking the vaccine is related somehow. I never had COVID-19 in past.  I use to be able to be in quiet settings and not have any tinnitus before vaccine.

I went to e.r. in the night as advised by my doctor. They gave me a oral steroid, a pepcid and some benadryl, also gave me prescriptions. When I woke up the next morning hives had mostly gone away, but returned  later that evening due to not picking up prescription from pharmacy. I have it now and am taking them. I still get itchy and have some burning but it&#39;s very minor and a little more tolerable with the medications.

About ten minutes after getting the vaccine, while sitting in a chair, I began to get tunnel vision and felt extremely tired. I broke out in a cold sweat all over my body. I began to lose my vision like I was fainting and I momentarily blacked out or dozed off, then came back awake. I started to get tunnel vision again for a minute, then it faded away. Then I continued sweating for a minute and then it faded away. After a couple minutes I felt fine again. I sat for another several minutes then left at 1:15 feeling ok with just a sore shoulder.

At that time he stated that the tingling had stopped but he still felt hot.  5 minutes later (4:12) patient stated that he no longer felt hot and thought that it may have just been nerves about the vaccine.

                                                About 10 minutes after shot I asked patient how he was feeling, he said he was hot. I walked out to talk to him and he said he felt dizzy. He turned pale and fell sideways off chair onto floor lowering himself with his knee. He did not bump his head, he was sweating profusely, but did not lose consciousness. I yelled to the tech to call 911. Patient was sitting on floor.  He said he did not eat much all day. He was alert and talking. He said he fainted when his wife had their baby. We gave his some orange juice. The paramedics arrived 8 minutes later and checked his vitals. In the meantime we called his wife. Paramedics checked his BP, glucose and questioned patient. Patient refuse to go with paramedics. Wife came and paramedics released him to her.

At about the 17 minute mark patiently suddenly fainted in his chair for 15-30 seconds. He then began to vomit and woke up in the process. Once he fully came back to, he said he felt remarkedly better and no longer felt light-headed or clammy. Following this episode he reported feeling back to normal and that he had just ate a large breakfast before coming in for the shot, but did not feel bad in any way anymore. We observed for another 30 minutes and patient showed no further sign of issues. He was released with his wife.

                                                Injection Friday.  No issues Friday, Saturday, or Sunday other than slight pain at the injection site and slight body aches on Sunday.  Monday morning at approximately 0230 i woke up to what i can only describe as lightning pains in my legs.  It was a very intense pain shooting from my upper thighs to my knees and slightly bending around to the top of my calves on the outside of the leg.  Monday all day i did not feel well.  Had a dull pain in center of chest, and my left arm from the shoulder blade to the elbow had what i can only describe as a slight warm sensation.  I was also very &#34;foggy&#34; and light headed.  On Tuesday the pain in my chest worsened.  My left arm kept going numb (and still does today 04.21.2021), my jaw hurt, i was light headed and again very foggy.  On Wednesday it was the same thing and I called the VA and they told me to come to the ER for evaluation.

I have been checking in with that website (V-safe App)  you gave me no one has contacted me. Monday (5/3/21) I missed work due to me not feeling good and still today (5/5/21) I&#39;m at work but feel like I could fall asleep, no energy, nausea still, and like I haven&#39;t slept in weeks even though I get good sleep. My breathing has gotten to the point that it hurts to take a deep breath. I believe this is all due to the shot but didn&#39;t know what you thought.&#34;

                                                April 30th began to notice dull ache in calf.  At first assumed it was a muscle cramp.  The pain began to increase through the weekend and into the following week.  I went to urgent care on May 6th.  They sent me to the ER to get an ultra sound as their preliminary evaluation was that it could be a blood clot.  The ER ultrasound confirmed the presence of a superficial thrombosis in my left calf.  No blood work was performed.  I was told to take ibuprofen and use a heated compress and to wear compression stockings.  If the pain grew worse, I was to return to the ER.  I scheduled a follow-up with my Primary the next day.  Blood tests show all values to be in normal range.  I have no history of blood clots and perform cardiovascular exercise on a daily basis.

I?ve subsequently had muscle aches and the feeling of being fatigued.

By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

                                                After the initial 12 hour period, I experienced night-time chills followed then by being too warm and night sweats.  This happened both the first and second night.  During the day I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours for aches and pain.  Mainly my neck and back have been what hurts, although my knees, elbows, hips, etc. also were achy.  The third and fourth days I still continued to have chills, no fever throughout as far as I am aware (took my temp 2-3 times).  The fourth day I was very faint and somewhat unbalanced, felt shaky and light headed and I ended up having an anxiety attack.  I mention the last symptom as I have never had an episode like this previously in my life.  Today is day 5, still feel tired, slightly nauseous, neck and back pain, headache, difficulty focusing.

Vaccinator was notified that he has a history of vasovagal response with needles. This response presents itself as sweating (and possible fainting) and is alleviated by lying down. Client mentioned that previous nurse advised him to smell an alcohol pad to distract and prevent a vasovagal response, as this had worked previously on a glucose check. No medications were disclosed or history of anaphylaxis reported. With this background information, RN offered to have vaccine administered in reclined position, however client refused. RN conferred with co-lead about administration recommendations. Vaccinator then checked in with patient at 1423 to see if patient was okay and patient did not answer the question. RN then felt the client&#39;s hand and noticed hand was clammy. At 1425 the reclining chair was brought to the station and patient was transferred into chair, appearing diaphoretic. RN palpated pulse and noted patient was not tachycardia, but RN did note tachypnea and uneasiness. RN then provided distraction and promoted relaxation. Then at 1426 patient reported feeling okay and RN noted patient no longer felt clammy. At 1440 patient was asked if he would prefer if EMS should be called, patient declined and stated that he was able to drive home. Then at 1447 patient left the site appearing well, alert and oriented x3 leaving by self in private car.

                                                He got cold and clamy and passed out in the chair with head slumped.  His wife rubbed his chest and spoke to him and I, waved ammonia inhalants under his nose.  He immediately came to.  We got him a bottle of water and a snack (he had not eaten yet today).  I also checked his blood pressure and it was normal.  We had him sit a little longer until he felt better.  We initially called an ambulance, but called it off at his request.

                                                My initial symptoms were light swelling a region around the shoulder of my injection arm and excessive sweating in the armpit on my injection arm side.  Following this, symptoms similar to being on a hallucinogenic gradually manifested over the next several hours, including euphoria, a persistent urge to grind teeth, and some mild-to-moderate visual and physical effects.  Following the date of the injection, the primary symptom has been a bruise/cramp hybrid pain in the upper arm of the injection site that is gradually receding (but still ongoing), along with random light bouts of nausea and headaches, random light pains throughout my injection arm, and occurrences of coldness in my injection arm (lasts about an hour)

                                                Started feeling dizzy and started to respond slowly to things and felt weak around 8pm. Shortly after these symptoms I begin to have uncontrollable chills followed by a fever and Nausea. The whole time starting around 8pm I had pretty bad muscle aches as well. I took a warm shower and bundled up the whole night because I had a fever, aches, chills, and nausea. It was impossible to sleep because of this and sometimes my heart was beating fast as well. The next morning I had a headache that would not go away until I took Tylenol. The whole next day I felt exhausted as well and very weak. I began to feel better on day 3 but still feel somewhat foggy from the shot. I would not recommend this vaccine to anyone and would never get it again and hopefully the foggy sensation goes away.

                                                First 2 days after vaccine I had the expected slight sore arm, some minor headache, some muscle aches. Nothing major that kept me from working or sleeping. Some time after, maybe 3rd or 4th day, I noticed a shortness of breath. This I did not expect since it&#39;s not a listed side effect for the vaccine but it is one for Covid. I notice it everyday while sitting/working. It does not keep me from being active (running/yard work) but I notice I&#39;m not 100% healthy feeling. It feels like  the shortness of breath is closer to the top of the chest/throat area if that makes any sense. If I breathe deeply it feels like I may want to cough although I don&#39;t usually cough from doing so. It&#39;s mostly just a constant feeling of a very slight shortness of breath.

                                                On 4/10 I started feeling tired with muscle aches.  A few days later my skin started to hurt.  Clothing was uncomfortable when it moved across my skin. Those symptoms lasted about a week. Then as they started to lessen I had some back pain (Sciatic) and a sore throat.  Also the muscles behind my eyes were slightly painful and bright lights were uncomfortable.  Then about  4/21 most of the symptoms reduced and I was feeling close to normal.  Then on 4/22 I was brushing my teeth and noticed that I couldn?t spit water like normal.  I called my GP doc and she recommended I head to the ER.   After thinking about it I also remember on 4/21 while drinking something I had some water squirt out of my lips.  At the time I thought I was just being clumsy but in hindsight the muscle weakness in my face started on 4/20.   I checked into the ER on 4/22.  When I checked into the hospital my facial weakness was very difficult to notice.  By the evening of 4/22 it was noticeable if I tried to ?show my teeth? or make a big smile. By the morning of 4/23 it was very noticeable.  The morning of 4/24 I couldn?t move my lips, nose or eyebrows.  My tongue, jaw and throat were not impacted at all.   I was started on plasmapheresis on  4/24. I had another treatment on 4/25. I noticed facial weakness was very slightly recovering the evening of 4/25.  By 4/27 my facial weakness is still healing with noticeable improvement day to day.

Skin was cold and clammy to the touch. I checked his BP and it was 89/53. I called 911 as precautionary and ems arrived within 5 minutes.  Patient had stopped sweating by then and was able to stand and walk with EMS to another area of the store to be evaluated further and monitored.

When I try to feel for something poking the top of my head, there is nothing there and touching the area does not cause pain. But then I may look to the right and frown, and suddenly there is a sharp needle feeling in the top of my head.

At 2:50, the patient had a strong, bounding radial pulse with a HR of 70 BPM and 115 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At 2:55 pm, the patient&#39;s vitals were: HR 75 BPM and 115 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At this time the patient reports feeling &#34;better&#34;. At 3:00 pm the patient&#39;s vitals were: HR 81 BPM and 118 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At 3:05 pm the patient&#39;s vitals were: HR 77 BPM and 120 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At 3:10 pm the patient&#39;s vitals were: HR 74 BPM and 118 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At 3:15 pm, the patient was assisted up from anti-gravity chair. The patient had a steady and balanced gait. The patient denied any additional dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea.

Three days later around 6:25 am on April 15, 2020: I got out of bed, next moment I recall is of me on the floor. No memory of falling. I was shaking uncontrollably as if my body was getting many commands at the same time but I had no control over it. I could not call out for help. At one point I was biting my right  hand but could not make myself stop until my shaking stopped. Bite did not penetrate skin but I had visible bite mark on my hand.  I regained control suddenly and just got up slowly and shaken by the experience. Wife then drove me to the ER.  Been feeling pressure on my head.

                                                I received the shot on 4/10. First 24 hours I had a slight fever and headache. Treated with Acetaninophhen. Since that time, I had relatively mild symptoms 4/11 - 4/13. Mostly fatigue.  On 4/14, I had a sudden increase in heart rate, dizziness, tingling sensation in all arms and legs and weakness in my limbs/grip. This prompted me to visit the ER. They ran numerous blood tests amd scans on me but found no abnormalities. Various unusual symptoms have continued to persist since 4/14.  For brief moments I feel fine.  At other times I have experience fatigue, diziness/vertigo, rapid heart rate, pins and needles feeling in my left hand and left leg.  Left leg numbness/tightness and heaviness. The fingers on my left hand sometimes move involuntarily.  And my anxiety has also gone up during this time. Tonight it has migratee to my left foot, where I have numbness in several of my toes.  I&#39;m looking for advice. Should I be concerned? Should these symptoms still be occurring 11 days after receiving my shot?  It has been very distressing and there seem to be very few people who have knowledge on this subject.  My care providers keep saying to self monitor and contact them if symptoms worsen. The problem is symptoms don&#39;t necessarily worsen, they just migrate from one area of my body to another.  The numbness comes and goes in maybe 1-2 hour intervals.

                                                I thought I was going to get the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, it wasn&#39;t until the needle was in my arm that I was told I had received the Janssen vaccine.  At approximately 4:46pm I developed a strong pain at the injection site.  At approximately 8pm I began to run a  fever and feel extremely fatigued.  My back and all my joints started to ache, I was sweating but also freezing cold.  I had a dull, throbbing pain in my testes.  I had pain in my scalp, my eyebrows, my ear lobes, my fingernails, my toes and toenails, the soles of my feet hurt.  Least of all I also had a headache.   I took 500mg Ibuprofen for the pain.    Now, almost 48 hours later I still have a low grade fever, still have considerable pain at the injection site, still have a headache.  The remaining symptoms dissipated on 5/2/21 at about 12pm.  Took another 500mg Ibuprofen for breakfast, but otherwise have had no appetite since receiving the vaccine.

At that point, started getting chills, which progressed into mix of chills and hot spells, fever, headache, and frequent urination throughout the night (though was also hydrating a lot).  Had fever the next morning still and Diarrhea.  Still feel modest headache and chills the next evening (before bed where I had felt the worst overnight the first night of the vaccine) but feeling better than the first night.  Per the form I received, I was told to include Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA in this section of the form.  I am reporting this on the day after the vaccination, so don&#39;t yet know final outcome, but again, improving and don&#39;t feel like I need medical attention.

                                                I felt fine all day and went to bed at 9:30pm. I woke up to my body shaking uncontrollably and I was freezing at 10:30pm. My wife felt my skin and she said I was burning up. Unfortunately our thermometer wasn&#39;t working so I don&#39;t know my temperature, but I have never in my life shaken so badly with a fever. I couldn&#39;t control myself and I was shaking so hard that my muscles were sore from it, but I still couldn&#39;t stop. I then began vomiting every 45 minutes or so. This happened for nearly 4 hours until 2:18am. Then very suddenly everything just stopped. No more feeling cold (actually I then felt very warm and couldn&#39;t cool off. I was sweating quite a bit). No more shaking. No more vomiting. I did get a wicked headache, but I figured it was due to dehydration and took two Advil. The Advil didn&#39;t do anything and I was awake until 5:59am because my head hurt too badly to sleep. Finally I slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I just felt worn out for most of the day on the 10th, and couldn&#39;t shake the headache. Then on the evening if the 10th, I started getting a sore throat and a slightly runny nose. I went to bed that way. When I woke up on the 11th (today) I still had the sore throat and slight runny nose. The headache was gone, but I felt tightness in my chest. As I went throughout the day, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m short of breath with doing most things. I have two young children, so even taking care of them I feel like at times I&#39;m struggling for breath. I&#39;m not in bad shape and am a runner, so my cardio isn&#39;t bad. So I was surprised by this.

Lasted through the 29th and right leg got it the 24th through 30th.  I attributed it to pushing too hard at the gym.  When they didn&#39;t go away after heat/cold/rolling/hot tub I did worry about clots, but not due to vaccine.  Was going to call Dr but they went away.

                                                In sleep, on the night of vaccination, i thought I twisted my left leg ankle. It was not hurting if not moving but hurt when walking on uneven surface or when tried to move the ankle. I used bandage few days.   its not completely gone, but much better and hurts when try to push the foot/toe downwards.

                                                Got COVID (Janssen) vaccine shot on April 6th at noon.  Felt fine Tuesday and went to bed as normal.  Woke up April 7th at 7AM with sharp pains in my left shoulder (same side as shot) and slight shortness of breath, and slight chest pain in the left quadrant of my torso (same side as shot).  Proceeded to take Advil and seemed to help a bit.  Minor aches/pains and shortness of breath throughout the day until about 8PM.  At this time shoulder chest pain became more severe, and breathing became very strained, short, and painful.  Pain and breathing kept getting worse and at midnight on Wednesday night thought I was having a heart attack due to extreme chest pain, couldn&#39;t breath, lightheaded, dizzy, tingly extremities.  My wife drove me to ER at 12:30 AM Thursday.

                                                At injection muscle spasmed, nurse stated never seen that before.  Within 1-2 hours had runny nose and felt stuffed up, thought it could be allergies or something and didn?t really attribute to vaccine.  4-5 hours  after injection felt something across the top of my brain ... felt as though something had been stuck in a blood vessel and became unstuck allowing blood to shoot through.  Was certainly freaked out by this, but was at an event and head of the ER department of the local hospital was also attending - so figured I had quicker access to medical care there if needed, than at home.   30-60 minutes later congestion completely cleared up.  9-12 hours after vaccination had extreme chills.  Day after vaccination had pain below the injection site... injection was 2? above pain.  Also neck pain. Day 2-8 since vaccination, on/off muscle pain or injection site pain. Today, day 9, have muscle pain in wrist of injection arm.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) frequency 1 total, dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 06-APR-2021 at 12 noon for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 6-APR-2021 at 12 noon, patient got vaccinated and was fine that day . Next morning on 07-APR-2021,  patient woke up with sever cramping in same shoulder which he got the shot in, most pain was in the upper left quarter of his torso to down half way to chest up to the shoulder till the neck . By the end of the day it  spread to his whole chest and upper body. Also he had shortness of breath ,could not breath .The cramping and shortness of breath came at same time. He took Advil and went along with his day . He took 3 tablet of Advil 200mg  every 4-5 hours all day ( total of 3 dose that day) . By night time the case was progressively worse as the whole chest had a lot of pain . He thought that he had heart attack . He thought that he was about to  pass out . He could not stand on his own . So his wife took him to emergency room at mid night at 12:30 am on 08-APR-2021. He stayed there for 5 hours and they did  bunch of tests , EKG which rolled out the heart attack .They did  Chest X-ray which found things then did D-dimer which its level was very high . They found  bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides. They did ultra sound on the legs  which had no evidence of blood clots . They discharged him  from the emergency room as  they felt that he was ok to be out . After couple of hours after discharge , patient&#39;s health care professional wrote for him Eliquis, antibiotic and pain reliver. He was given antibiotic because he had  beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed) . It was found air sacs in lung with signs of pneumonia in both lobes . He came home and started to  monitor his blood oxygen . He stayed in the  same position till recovery . He was better each day since last week but still had sinus and cramping in the chest ( very minor but was still there). The lung capacity was very limited to take some steps. Patient stated that he needed a specialist to understand his condition. He had no medical history before that incidence . He was wondering regarding which type of blood thinner was good for this type of blood clots because he read that the regular blood thinners are not good for that type of blood clot which his HCP gave (regular blood thinner). Laboratory data included: Total lung capacity decreased (NR: not provided) lung capacity is very limited. On 08-APR-2021, Laboratory data included: Chest X-ray (NR: not provided) found things, EKG (NR: not provided) rolled out heart attack, Fibrin D dimer (NR: not provided) level was very high, and Ultrasound scan (NR: not provided) no evidence of blood clots.  Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: apixaban, and ibuprofen. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the severe cramping in left shoulder and upper body, chest pain (whole chest had lot of pain)/thought that he had heart attack, shortness of breath/could not breath, thought that he was about to pass out, difficulty in standing, bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed), cramping in chest and sinus was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 44-year-old male patient reported blood clots of both lungs 2 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient denies any medical history/condition prior to vaccination.  The symptoms reported were severe cramping of arm that spread to his whole chest and upper body and shortness of breath; the patient thought he had a heart attack, about to pass out and could not stand because of the progression of pain.  EKG done at the emergency room ruled out heat attack, D-Dimer was reported to be very high, clots were found in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, x-ray showed beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed).  The patient was prescribed with Eliquis, an unspecified antibiotic and pain reliever.  Outcome of the events were not reported.   Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

Then, after the first week of having the vaccine, I began to have these symptoms about once a week. Last week, it was on 5/6 when I gradually become colder regardless of layers and my stomach was repelling the idea of food (no vomiting or actual nausea). I went to bed and I was better by morning.   Yesterday (5/12), I had the same thing. Chills and the inability to stay warm, loss of appetite, and a sort of sleepy vertigo.

Wife was hot while I was freezing and shivering uncontrollably, so I know something was wrong with me.  The shivering and chills lasted for a couple of hours until about 2:30-3:00am.  Then I got really hot.  Took my temperature, was at 99.1 degrees.  But room was really warm so I turned down the temperature and took off my layers of clothing.  Woke up this morning, around 7am, to a headache and aching legs.  I took 2 Excederin, but the headache is still there.  Legs are feeling better after a couple of hours.

                                                About five hours after I received the vaccine I began to run a fever that averaged 102 degrees fahrenheit. At that time I also developed chills and extreme fatigue. These symptoms persisted until I fell asleep at 10:00 PM 3/13/21.  I was awakened at 1:00 AM with severe muscle spasms in my left bicep and a fever of 102.5 I started taking tylenol to begin reducing the fever. I also lost my appetite around that time. Things were pretty much the same all day 3/14/21. I went to sleep at 10:00 PM I got up every four hours to take tylenol. I woke up at 7:00 AM 3/15/21 to prepare for work my bed sheets and shirt were soaked with sweat but my fever was gone. I ate breakfast and drank a cup of coffee. When I got to work I begin having stomach problems.  When I started working I noticed that I was having a lot of trouble concentrating. I decided to leave early to go home and rest. Things have improved since then but I do have a headache that won&#39;t go away.

So I took two tylenol and hoped in bed with a few blankets.  The next day I felt like crap, but ok

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

At 4:00 am was due to take 2 more Advil, and that finally seemed to help so he finally stopped having chills and could sleep. Woke up in the morning tired, but feeling better, symptoms pretty much gone.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, my throat became dry and my eyes began watering. It was hard to tell but my throat felt slightly swollen also. I drank some water and a few minutes later things seemed to clear up. Randomly throughout the afternoon I had similar dry/itchy/tingling in my throat but not as strong as the time right after the vaccination. I didn&#39;t suspect this was directly related to the virus since I have allergies to grasses, trees, pollen, etc. and take over the counter allergy medicine as needed.  At 3:30am today (4/10/21) I woke up having to use the restroom and when standing up out of bed I was extremely dizzy. After laying down in bed the dizziness disappeared. When waking up later in the morning the dizziness/light headed feeling was still present when standing. I also have noticed random strange pinching pain in my legs that only last for 1-2 seconds and sends a quick short pain sensation throughout my body.    I have no clue if any of this is related to the vaccination received, but after noticing news articles with issues in a few folks receiving the Janssen vaccine, I decided I would pass this info along just in case.

After 40 minutes, the lightheadedness, faintish and dizziness subsided.  However, the intense heat, sweating and nausea continued.  By the evening an intense migraine started and by 4/10/21 my sister vomited and started running a fever 100.5.  Complete muscle aches, overall feeling extremely ill, totally bed ridden and a migraine that cannot be controlled at all.

                                                Had leg pain in the form of a knot in my left calf muscle. The muscle would tighten and feel like a Charlie horse. The issue lasted for about 3 weeks.  I tried cooling and then warming it since it felt like a pulled muscle at first. Then as the days went on there was more of a knot in the muscle and then tried warming, stretching, compression sleeve,  hot tub, and then tried a massage gun.  The issue finally went away but not sure if it was rest or a combination of the treatments.

                                                I started shivering uncontrollably in the evening.  I could not warm up, and my body was shivering.  I wasn&#39;t sure if I had a fever, but I did not feel well.  My wife was trying to warm me up and she thought I was having a seizure because she had never felt someone shiver so violently.  My eyes were watering abnormally as well.  The shivering subsided after about 30 minutes.  I was soar and weak over the couple of days, but I believe those are normal symptoms.

I was bedridden for 36 hours and then the symptoms gradually subsided by day 3.  I then developed a sense of chest tightness intermittently for the next 4 days usually at night.  I did not have chest pain, but had tachypnea at times with a respiratory rate up to 22/min. At day 7 this resolved.

                                                after receiving vaccine, about 12 hours later i had the standard side effect of moderate fever (approx 102), chills, and was very fatigued.  The fever was gone the next day, but i took the next day off and stayed in bed.  The concerning problem was i developed tingling and numbness throughout most of my body, especially on the side where i had the shot, in my arm, neck mouth and tongue.   After about 36 hours after the shot i started to feel about 80% better, but the tingling/numbness continued and i continued to have major fatigue.  From day 3-5, i was having some trouble moving around - almost like my legs weren&#39;t wanting to respond to my brain.   Since these symptoms lasted until about day 5, i got concerned and called the doctor.   However, right before talking with the doctor in day 5 i was able to do some yoga and was feeling much better, and it all seemed to resolve.  I feel better now.

Approximately 10 minutes after the vaccine, he reported feeling very faint and was about to pass out. He wasn&#39;t feeling well so 911 was called. He also reported feeling hot and was visibly sweating. He drank some water and sat in front of a small fan until medics arrived. They assessed him and he walked out with them for further evaluation. I called patient at 7:30 to see how he was feeling. There was no answer and his voicemail didn&#39;t allow me to leave a message.

                                                Before receiving the vaccination the patient mentioned he had a fear of needles.  Patient was asked if he ever fainted after getting a vaccination or injection and patient reported no.   The vaccine was administered to the patient and patient appeared to be fine for the next few minutes after getting vaccinated.  Patient was told he could take a seat in the waiting area and wait until his 15-minutes were up and he could go.  Patient was seated in the waiting area for about a minute but then got up to walk down one of the isles. When walking down the isle patient fainted and collapsed. This occurred approximately 10 minutes or so after he received the vaccine.  Patient was helped to a chair and once seated appeared to shake/convulse (almost like a seizure) for approximately 5-10 seconds before snapping out of it and regaining consciousness.  Afterwards he was alert and talking but didn&#39;t remember fainting.  911 was called and he was checked out by paramedics. After observing him for 15 minutes or so and determining his heartrate and blood pressure were normal and he appeared to be ok, the paramedics told him they can take him to the hospital to be evaluated further, or he was free to leave on his own without going to the hospital.  The patient said he felt fine and declined being taken to the hospital. After another 10-15 minutes the patient left under his own power. Patient mentioned he would possibly be calling his physician and alerting them to the episode.

                                                The 46yo patient came in to get his covid vaccine.  His parents reported he has a medical condition/disability that requires him to receive services in their home.  After receiving the vaccine the patient reported feeling lightheaded, dizzy, hot, and that his blood pressure felt abnormal.  He requested an ambulance and some water.  I called 911 and provided him water, but did not administer any epinephrine or any other medications.  The paramedics arrived and talked to him for about 15 minutes.  He then left on his own accord with his parents and declined further medical attention.

I felt extreme fatigue for the next 48 hours.  I felt my heart racing off and on for 24 hours,  I felt a loss of strength in both arms and legs for the next 48 hours.  Monday Night I woke up sweating as I had a fever.  The fever persisted off and on for about 24 hours. I was irritable (probably due to not feeling well) for about 48 hours.  My wife had to drive me home.

At 15 minutes asked nurse if normal. Then started sweating. left hand turned purple. Dont really remember anything else. Went unconscious. Remember them yelling Code something and Cardiac arrest. Taken to ER. Think they may have said anaphalatic shock. I think they gave me epinepherine. Had paralysis in left hand when i woke up for a few minutes. Blood work and EKG were normal. Went home within a couple of hours. Light-headed two days later still. Saw doctor two days after. Blood pressure is high.  Little bit of fatigue and brain fog.

                                                I received the J&amp;J shot after work on Friday around 5:30 p.m.. Around 3 a.m. Saturday morning, I woke up with a fever and chills. My head was hot. My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

My blood pressure was elevated as well. And that was not going away either. I went to doctor. My headaches have decreased. But for the last two to three days I have been getting chest pains. I have called the doctor this morning and I&#39;m waiting to call me back.  It&#39;s not ongoing pain - just every now and then - I&#39;m not sure what it is.

                                                I am experiencing slight ringing in what appears to be my right ear. I don&#39;t know if it is both ears. I have not seen my primary doctor yet. The feeling is similar to having head congestion or sinus pressure, I guess.  It is not an emergency for me. I will be checking with my primary doctor soon. The only discomfort I have is when I try to fall asleep. I hear the slight ringing in my right ear. Still optimistic that it will go away on its own. I am tolerating it at the moment and can work throughout the day. But, sleeping appears to be the most interruptive. With that being said, I do end up falling asleep. I am pretty sure this is a vaccine reaction. I have not had any history of it before. As soon as I see my doctor, I will update the notes for more clarity on what these symptoms are. Thank you.

Head was insanely stuffy when I woke up around 8:30, my ears hurt on the inside and I couldn?t hear well. My lungs felt kind of funny, as if I?d taken too much asthma medication. By noon my lungs were burning with every breath, my eyes were hot and weepy, the fever and muscle/joint aches had gotten really bad, and I had pain in my neck under my jaw between chin and ears.

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often. --- Thank you ---

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often.

His headache was getting worse.  All symptoms were getting better except the headache.  He thought he was feeling better but when he woke up today 4/6/2021 he was SOB and diarrhea was back. Pt has taken Pepto Bismol for his symptoms and will probably need to go to the ER since he is having trouble breathing.   He feels like he has had such a bad reaction to this since he possibly has had the covid vax in the past 90 days.

                                                Patient received the vaccine. Immunizing tech stated: the patient seemed fine at the time of the shot. After administration of the shot the patient began to bleed out of injection site (like normal). The immunizing tech swabbed the area with cotton and placed a Band-Aid on the patient then stepped back into the pharmacy to grab another band aid while the patient remained at the immunization chair. The tech applied another band aid and told the patient to wait 15 minutes after the immunization and directed him to a waiting chair. The tech came back into the pharmacy and was cleaning the immunization basket when the patient&#39;s wife yelled for help. At this point I went out to the patient. Another tech called 911, another grabbed a nearby EpiPen. The immunizing tech grabbed the e-kit while I was out with the patient while he was unresponsive. Patient was unresponsive and slouched in chair. His wife and I supported the neck of the patient and laid him on the floor. I checked pulse and breathing to which both were present. Patient was still unresponsive and making strange movements. Pulse and breathing remained present and then the patient became responsive relatively quickly. At this point patient responsive and answering questions and moving fine. He asked if he had passed out then stated, he had a phobia of needles and said he felt nauseated. (wife previously stated he had a fear of injections). Soon after the ambulance showed up and I told the paramedics the above story. After a few more minutes I checked in with the paramedics and they said the patient was doing fine. Lastly, he was taken out of store with paramedics.

After 15 minutes slight tingling/numbness on the tip of my tongue and slight tingling in the upper lips of my mouth. I was not worried. I took 1 Benadryl and 2 Ibuprofen (400 ml) at that time for symptoms. I took additional 1 Benadryl and 4  Ibuprofen about 6 hours later as a precaution.  Day 2 after about 36 hours I had slight soreness, and some sweating as I slept the 2nd night. Treated with 4 ibuprofen. Also I woke up with a feeling of uneasiness in the middle of the night on the 2nd night.  Day three, just a general feeling of tiredness. Day 4 and 5 still slight ache in the injection sight if pressure is applied. Other than that I feel normal as of day 5.

About a week later, I started coughing a lot. My head hurt,but i didn&#39;t run any fever. I thought I was having bad allergies from changing weather, but it lasted longer than usual, over a week. I was sore, tired, not really hungry. I feel better now, but I still have this lingering dry cough and it won&#39;t completely go away. I still feel sore and very tired. I get a headache every now and then. I thought it was allergies, but it falls into the time period that people are having reactions to this JJ Janssen shot. The cough is annoying. I get short breathed and winded rather easily or more easily now. I thought I&#39;d at least report it.

I fell asleep one hour into my arrival and slept for 17 hours. Up to and including today I am having headaches, pain in my legs on left side only, nausea, lack of sleep and a continued smell similar to dried blood after a injury. I have also have and continue to have shortness of breath and chest pains resulting in two panic attacks within the last three days. This has led me to report this and I have doctor visit scheduled for 4/22. I also reported today based on internet search of reactions.

                                                On 4/14/2021, right elbow started to hurt.  This was a site of a removed gout-caused mass over a year ago.  That subsided within a day.  On 4/15/2021, left foot started to hurt.  By 4/17/2021, the next to smallest toe and the large toe was swollen and very tender to any sort of touch.  It was not warm.  The pain was almost unbearable on 4/18/2021 and the suspicion that it might be gout was considered.  On 4/19/2021, after a visit with his doctor, gout was confirmed as the likely cause of the pain/swelling.  However, no blood tests were run to confirm.  Treatment for gout was initiated.

                                                Pt. had (what we think) a small seizure on Thursday, March 18th and then again on Saturday, March 20th.  On Sunday, March 21st, 911 had to be called as his seizure did not end.  He had a grand male.  He was seizing for several hours.  At the time this was all occurring he has been on anti seizure meds for a few years Divalproex 1000 mg am and 1000 mgs pm daily).  He passed 1 week later, March 28 at approx 6:45pm at the Clinic.  I am unable to get any information  on his medical report for that week.  Statement from his Nurologists is on second page. Additional information for Item 18:   Statement:  47 year old gentleman who passed away on March 28 from aspiration pneumonia secondary to status epilepticus and on a history of multiple sclerosis / additional leukoencephalopathy of unknown etiology (both treated with rituximab), prior seizures (on valproic acid) and pulmonary embolism (on apixaban). The key reason for reaching out is in light of the announcement about the side effects of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. While he had a known history of seizures, he had no clear trigger for these seizures; including that his valproic acid level was therapeutic (83.0 mcg/mL) at time of presentation. He had, however, received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on March 12 before having what in hindsight appeared to be repeated seizures between March 18-21; he had a more significant one on March 21 that hospitalized him. This time frame appears consistent with the reported cases of central venous sinus thrombosis associated with the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. Equally, he was taking apixaban at that point in time and his PLT (173) / INR (1.1) / PTT (36.6) at time of presentation were all normal and stable. He did have an elevated ProBNP (552.0) at presentation; nasopharyngeal swab was negative for COVID / Influenza A/B / RSV and non-contrast head CT did not show any clear new abnormalities. His only D-dimer was obtained on March 23 and was 226. He did not have a CT angiogram or venogram.   Overall the link between the vaccine and pt. seizures is not definite. At the same time, the similarity with the reported cases has led to me wanting to report it in case of the possible link. If you require further information then please don&#39;t hesitate to email me Pt. med list at the time of this incident  Modifinil - 100 mg/1per day/AM Sertraline - 100 mg/1per day/AM Vitamin D3 - 50 mg/1per day/AM Divalproex - 500 mg/2per day/AM Eliquis - 5 mg/1per day/AM Furoseminde - 20 mg/1per day/AM Metroprolol - 100 mg/1per day/AM Lisinopril - 10 mg/1per day/AM  Divalproex - 500 mg/2per day/PM Eliquis - 5 mg/1per day/PM Metroprolol - 100 mg/1per day/PM Melatonin - 5 mg/1per day/PM Quetiapine - 50 mg/3per day/PM

                                                My full list of symptoms were:  Pins and needle feeling as well as hypersensitivity all over my skin that originated in my lower legs but traveled up my body to include my entire legs, hips, and arms.  It was more severe on the left side of my body which is the side I received the vaccine. I did not notice it on my head, face, and upper torso.  I had full muscle control but I did have problems with my bladder and bowels.  I&#39;m not sure if I could not control them or did not feel them because the sensitivity was high in my hip area but I could not control them fully.  No treatment was administered except to wait and see.  Three days later and I am improving but not fully recovered yet.

I did not measure my body temperature because I immediately ran under the blanket. Icy-cold hands and feet, even after my body temperature seemed to stabilize. I fell asleep but not a restful sleep. I woke up after 2.5 to 3 hours with the feeling that it was morning, but in fact it was between 2am and 3 am. At that point I felt the worst part had gone, I felt weak and with muscle aches but I could drink water and go back to bed. I did not have a restful sleep all night and I woke up may times. By the morning I was tired but no fever.

                                                Extremely bad headache, shortness of breath, dizziness lump in throat, chills followed by getting hot flashes and very lethargic and fatigued. Shot was administered at 11:45am on the 9th and by 03:00am on the 10th felt the above symptoms. Today date I am feeling better with minor unsteadiness here and there and a slight pain deep inside the middle of head almost like a headache for a few seconds then goes away, So far so good I think. I did call doctor to note on chart. Thank you!

Around 2:30am the following morning (April 13, 2021) I started feeling ill. I had flu-like symptoms including: body aches, chills, fatigue, etc. I did not take my temperature, however, I believe I was feverish. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen around 11:30am (24 hours after receiving the vaccine). After sleeping for 2 hours, I began feeling better.

                                                On April 7th in the  morning, I woke with sharp pain in right calf.  It was not swollen, discolored, or hot.  I had not participated in any activity recently that I felt caused an injury.  I took Advil and Tylenol and rested for a few days, but the pain got worse.  On April 14th, after reading reports on some adverse affects from the J&amp;J vaccine, I made an appointment to see my primary physician.  After blood work and an ultrasound, I was diagnosed with a DVT in my right calf.  I have a started a 90-day cycle of Xarelto to treatment the DVT.

My right arm at injection point was extremely sore.  I figured it was a immune response and didn?t get too worried.  These symptoms have persisted. Hopefully will subside soon

                                                I had some head pressure - dull headache each day for a couple of weeks starting about five days after vaccine; I didn&#39;t notice until the evenings when I was relaxing. From day 5 or so - for about two weeks I noticed this head pressure. My blood pressure did rise  at that time-it was elevated - within about two weeks after the shot, I couldn&#39;t control my blood pressure. I went to the doctor  - they had to raise my blood pressure medication to the max because I couldn&#39;t get my blood pressure down and I even donated blood.  Today I am at 135 over 90 which is good for me but at that time  when I noticed the rise after the vaccine - I was running 165 over 115 . I&#39;m still taking the maximum blood pressure medication that I can take currently but it is at a good level currently. I was taking 20 mg pills and after the vaccine we tried to raise it to  25 mg and then raised it up to 30 mg and then they finally said up to 40 mg a day. It&#39;s the most I can take.   I have chest pains on the right side of my chest -it will start (on a scale from 1 to 10 -  it&#39;s about a four) - it&#39;s shooting pain - in my chest for about 10 minutes and then it will move to my left side - not my pecs -  it feels like it&#39;s my  heart. It&#39;s not enough that I feel like I&#39;m having a heart attack - it happens about four days a week. It doesn&#39;t last real long - but it&#39;s intense. A &#34;4&#34; pain for me is intense. It goes on for about 5 minutes - switch sides and then another five minutes - I try to relax/watch tv during that.  I did have leg pains in the middle of all of this time - hand, inner thigh, then on my right leg - single spots of pain that moved - like ant bites - that happened in the beginning - at day five and after - the same time I was getting the head pressure. I would rub over the spot with my hands and then it would go away and go to a different spot.

                                                Patient received Johnson&amp;Johnson COVID vaccine in the afternoon on 3/31/21. Patient reported having right arm pain, diaphoresis, chills, nausea, and muscle aches/pain in upper leg/lower back at 5:30am the following morning. Patient took 2 tablets of 500mg naproxen in the morning and in the afternoon. Symptoms did not resolve and patient had to leave work early. Upon getting home patient took 2 tablets of 650mg tylenol and symptoms resolved within 48 hours. On 4/3/21 patient reported mild to severe pain in heel of left foot. The following day the patient went to WellNow urgent care to get his heel examined. During examination provider noticed patient&#39;s lesions and patient stated more lesions have appeared since getting the vaccine.  1 on his stomach, 1 on the dorsum of his left foot, 1 on his back, 1 on his left elbow, in between his toes of his left foot, and in between the fingers of his right hand. Patient stated that these lesions cause a burning sensation and can become itchy. Patient was sent to Hopsital ED as provider at urgent care was concerned patient may have purpura. Patient was seen and discharged on 4/4/21 from the ED. The heel pain was determined to be plantar fascitis which was treated with at home exercises with a heel cup. The patient was given clotrimazole for his lesions. The patient had a follow-up visit with his primary care provider at hospital on 4/6/21 in which he explained the clotrimazole only made his lesions worse. Patient was referred to follow up with dermatology on 4/8/21. Primary care provider believes progression of the lesions since getting the vaccine leads to concern of an underlying autoimmune exacerbated by vaccine.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes and abdominal pain from right him bone down to scrotum. Pain on 4/7 was such that i though i was suffering a hernia.  Couldn&#39;t get out of car or move my right leg across my body. Could put right leg into pants leg.  Hurt to bend over and do much of anything on 4/7.   Initially thought pain was in testicle but doesn&#39;t hurt at all to the touch.  Realized it more a swollen area in the groin between hip bone and scrotum.   Nothing hurts to the touch at all in that area either which lead my to believe it was swollen lymph nodes.  The  Feeling is as if i got hit in the right groin  and my testicle has been hit and discomfort is 8 inches above right testicle in my groin area.    It has been improving every day since then, the more i walk the better it is.  It only hurts when i sit now and it seems to aggravate it pretty well but once i start moving the pain goes away.  It has been 9 days now and the i don&#39;t notice it all day until i come back to the office and sit at my desk and again it gets aggravated and the discomfort feels like my right testicle is near my appendix  Since this all started my legs feel heavier in the calf and have little nerve sensations when i sit too, which concerns me about the blood clot possibility and so i have been emailing with my doctor.  I am going to make appt for Monday 4/19

                                                The patient is a 49 year old male who has a past medical history significant for bipolar disorder with manic episodes, OSA on CPAP, morbid obesity, HLD, and  relapsing remitting MS.  Per chart review, patient&#39;s MS was initially diagnosed in 2012 on MRI and LP and was on Copaxone for several years but stopped taking in 2017.  Symptoms and imaging remained stable through 2019 then patient was lost to follow up until he was seen by Dr.  on 4/12/21 who ordered an outpt MRI.   Patient had COVID vaccine with Jansen vaccine on 4/10/21.  He developed bilateral upper and lower exremity weakness and urinary retention on 4/21/21 which prompted presentation.  He came into ED 4/21/21 and had foley placed but removed foley and decided to leave AMA. Returned on 4/22/21 with worsening symptoms and was subsequently admitted. Patient was seen by neurology and started on high dose steroid x5d for MS exacerbation. Initial MRI of the brain obtained on 4/22/21 was notably stable without change in previously described white matter disease. No new lesions to suggest active demyelination. New plaques were noted on MRI C and T spine (4/22/21). It is noted that patient received COVID19 vaccination with J&amp;J vaccine on 4/10/21 and temporal relationship between his acute presentation and recent vaccination was questioned.    On 4/30/21, patient developed severe bilateral facial weakness and he additionally was reported to have had an episode of aspiration.  Repeat MRI brain on 4/30/21 showed new bilateral facial nerve enhancement. Etiologies could include: GBS, Lyme disease, botulism, neurosarcoidosis, less likely myasthenia gravis.  LP was pursued on 5/1/21 which was significant for tube 4 with 136 WBC, 88% lymphocytes, glucose 89, protein 632. Meningitis/encephalitis panel was negative.  Lyme CSF was negative, Lyme antibody panel was positive.  MuSK antibody negative.  ACE blood level normal.  Ganglioside antibody panel and myasthenia graivs adult panel pending. He is being treated for Lyme disease with Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily since 5/1/21 with plan for 2-4 week course to cover for Lyme disease.  He is still admitted and is still having symptoms of facial palsy as of today (5/4/21)

Body shaking, extreme fatigue, feverish, significant aching in upper half of body including head. Tinnitus.   After cold/flu symptoms subsided, heavy fatigue and some tinnitus persisted for 20 days. This was followed by approx. five days of tapering fatigue, after which approx 95% of symptoms had subsided. Unclear 5 weeks later if symptoms are 100% subsided, as diminished activity and exercise over three week period has left an unclear sense of physical norm (I suspect the symptoms are 100% subsided and my energy will return to normal with resumption of exercise habits).

                                                Patient received first Johnson and Johnson, 2 minutes into a 30 min observation, patient began to have seizure like activity.  Patient&#39;s eyes rolled back and he started to quickly shake for about 1 minute.  Patient came to and was responsive.  Provider arrived, vitals and physical exam were within normal limits.   Patient was recommended to schedule an appointment with PCP and ask for a referral to Neurology, since patient had seizure like activity with a Tdap a few years ago.

                                                About 10 minutes after injection, got dizzy/clammy. It took about 5-10 minutes after that with EMTs to wait until my blood pressure normalized, and then I was fine.  Walked off site.  Slowly throughout the day had an increasingly bad headache, which peaked about 10 hours after the injection. Around that same time, bad fatigue started, and then slight chills. The headache at this point was extremely severe for about 10-12 hours. After that (so 20-22 hours after initial injection) the fatigue and chills subsided, but came back occasionally. The headache was less severe at that point, but in total did not go away until an additional 15 hours had passed.   My estimate is that took about 36-40 hours to feel 100% normal again.

This lasted for several hours after... At 11:30pm, almost 7 hours after the shot, I started to feel lousy. I started to get body aches and chills. Within 30 minutes they were fairly intense body aches and chills, shaking. At 1:00am I started to feel nauseas . At 1:30 am I started dry heaving. At approximately 2:30 I threw up twice, and the dry heaving and nausea lasting until 4am , when I took an anti nausea pill. I finally fell asleep at 430am. I woke up at 8am and felt tired, and no longer nauseated.

                                                The patient came in for J&amp;J vaccine. He said he had no history of severe allergic reaction to anything, including meds, food, vaccines or any injections.  He said that he did not receive any other vaccine in the past 14 days. According to the patient, he did not have test positive for Covid or was in contact with anyone with Covid for the past 2 weeks. He appeared perfectly fine prior to receiving the vaccine. Once the vaccine was given, within about 5 seconds, he said that he was seeing spots, he closed his eyes and made sounds that were similar to snoring. His neck was completely down on his right side and he almost fell off his chair. I held him so he would not fall off the chair and called for help.  A few of the co-workers came to hold him. He was non responsive and my co-workers helped to put his legs on the chair. At point, I gave him an epipen. Once the epipen was given, he opened his eyes in about few seconds and became responsive. The nurses came and took over at this point.  I stayed with him and the nurses for a few minutes. The patient was fully responsive and talking by the time I left the nurses and the patient. 911 was activated after the first epipen was given.  The patient was then evaluated by EMS and the onsite nurses. The patient was AOx4 with stable vital signs.  The patient had orthostatic vital signs taken and were within normal limits.  The patient demonstrated that he was able to ambulate with no assistance.  The patient signed a refusal for transport to the hospital and was driven home by a colleague.  The patient remains in care of that colleague for monitoring.  The patient was instructed that if he were to begin feeling the previous symptoms that he is to activate 911 and be seen in a hospital.  Patient understood the instructions and went back to his residence.

We were both fine but he had side effects on the higher/ more severe end. Lasting about 24 hours where it then began to break into cold clammy sweats (he did use Tylenol starting about 3-4:00pm on the 25th and by the morning of the 26th he felt much better. The Vaccine did not write our lot number on our vaccine cards - I have to call and attempt to find out. I am reporting this in case it is helpful for others.  He did not have to be admitted anywhere but he would say that for those first 24 hours he was having side effects more on the severe side.

I have had Hives at least once  before while on high-dose (400-600mg) ibuprofin, but never from allergies. Not certain this is related to J&amp;J shot, but doctor said it wouldn&#39;t hurt to report.  Next day stayed indoors. Hives are less common, but still present.

I also had irregular heart beat for 16-18 hours. I have had neurological issues with 2 other medications in the past which calmed my concerns. I had my arms lock up on me while on Humira and I had the exact facial numbness and tingling with Enbrel. Both of those drugs work through TNF cells. I do not know the mechanism with J&amp;J vaccine but wanted you to know that.

                                                About a week after receiving vaccine, both my shoulders and both hips started experiencing pain and weakness that is still ongoing, though improving. Until recently, it was difficult to raise my hands over my head, and it would be difficult to stand up from a sitting position. I have regularly exercised and done resistance training for several years. I&#39;m not sure if this is coincidental nor am I concerned, but a pharmacist encouraged me to report it here.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure and diabetes.  The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number 1802070, expiry date unknown), dose not reported, 1 total administered on 19-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination on left arm. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate for drug used for unknown indication, empagliflozin for drug used for unknown indication, fenofibrate for drug used for unknown indication, insulin aspart for drug used for unknown indication, insulin glargine for drug used for unknown indication, losartan for drug used for unknown indication, and pioglitazone hydrochloride for drug used for unknown indication. On an unspecified date (reported as 22-MAR-2021; 28 days prior to vaccination), the patient experienced shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, chills and was hospitalized (date unspecified). He reported that on this past Saturday, 17-APR-2021 (2 days prior to vaccination), he went to the emergency room. He reported that his toenails were coming off, the skin on his toes was coming off, and he had swelling in his right foot and up his leg. He says there was no circulation going to his toe and he was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg. He says he had surgery to open up the arteries in his leg, and also reported gangrene in his toe. The subject was discharged on 21-APR-2021. On 23-APR-2021, the patient experienced feeling hot. He also reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene. He reported that he is going to go back to the hospital, to which he would seek medical attention if he was having issues. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included paracetamol. When called back due to his vaccination dates being after event start dates, the patient said that his memory is not too good, so he &#39;had to take his time to remember the correct dates&#39;. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient was recovering from blood clot in leg, and had not recovered from runny nose, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, chills, feeling hot, gangrene in toe, right leg swollen, and right foot swollen. This report was serious (caused hospitalization).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old  hypertensive and diabetic male patient reported that he was feeling hot and may need to have his fifth toe amputated because it has gangrene 4 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 2 days after discharge form the hospital.  The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, and chills 28 days prior to vaccination.  The patient went to the emergency room 2 days prior to vaccination because his toenails/skin on his toes were coming off, swelling in his right foot and up his leg, gangrene in his toe; he reported that there was no circulation going to his toe and was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg; the patient reported he had surgery to &#34;open up&#34; the arteries in his leg. Four days after vaccination, the patient felt hot and reported reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene.  The patient is taking paracetamol as treatment.  No other details was reported.  Based on the lack of temporal association, the causality is considered not related for the events blood clot in leg, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, right leg swelling, right foot swelling, chills, and runny nose.  The information available regarding event gangrent of fifth toe and feeling hot precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

The day I went to the doctor, a guy crashed into me and the pain I experienced was more. I can put my fingers into my shoulder region and it is very painful.  I saw a doctor 04-23-2021 ad he advised me if my symptoms persists I should come back for a re-evaluation. I can not put my left arm first, my left arm is unstable.  Before the J&amp;J vaccine, I did not have this pain to my left shoulder.  I have also taken OTC Tylenol but it does not help with my pain.

                                                Patient was given Janssen vaccine on 05/11/21 at 3:02pm. Patient was asked to be seated for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, because he had food allergies.  Immediately after administration, patient started complaining he felt dizzy. Pharmacist checked patient&#39;s vitals. Pulse was at 46. He was sweating profusely, drowsy, dizzy, not coherent, tingling in right hand, trouble seeing, blacking out. Paramedics were called to the scene by pharmacy technician. Upon arrival, they also checked his blood pressure, pulse, and blood glucose. Patient refused to go to hospital and signed a form provided by EMS. Before leaving, patient was alert and able to walk and carry a conversation on his own.

But that evening when getting ready for bed I experienced extreme shaking and chills, and sweated all throughout the night.  On day three I continue to be fatigued, but no fever.

Went to bed at my usual time and woke up at 2:00 am with the chills I could not get warm late that night around 5:00 am I started having joint pain and fatigue with a headache and hot skin. I had taken my temperature and it was 100.7. I tried to wait out symptoms but I seem to bee get worse throughout the morning. Around 10:00 am I was in terrible pain and my body hurt all over. I once again took my temperature and it had gone up to 101.9. I had to call of work because I was so ?out of it?.  I started taking Tylenol ever 4 hrs for my fever and I was trying to hydrate.  My temperature slowly went down but still had body pain. I then started thank ibuprofen to help. Later that night around 9:00 pm my temperature was 99. The next day I called off work for fatigue and body pain. Today my temperature is normal and I?m starting to feel like my self again

                                                Patient had arm tingling shortly after injection. Pt stayed in store for about 4 hours after 2pm injection, no redness or swelling noticed. Pt was quite anxious &amp; nervous (but already has severe anxiety). Pharmacist called patient following afternoon, the 11th and patient noted he was doing marginally better but still sounded anxious. Pharmacist called patient on Fri the 12th 5:16p and this was when the patient explained the following: Muscle stiffness on left side &amp; pain down left leg; cranial pain; shoulder stiffness; nasal congestion; some shortness of breath; soreness &amp; fatigue.  Patient called back and said he had partial shortness of breath at 7:34p on the 12th.  On Sat the 13th at 11am, pharmacist called to check on pt; found him quite agitated &amp; saying, &#34;He feels the shot was botched&#34;, noted he had called Janssen to report his issues.  At 4:30pm, pt came to pharmacy, looked fine, arm showed no redness, was more subdued in person than on the phone earlier. He said he was feeling better but was not happy with Janssen and wanted the Moderna 2 series shot because he feels Janssen&#39;s vaccine wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to.

On 4/6/21 I came home from work about 7:00 am due to an extreme headache and muscle weakness. By the afternoon my fever was up to 101. On 4/7 my fever went up to 102.7 and I was shaking uncontrollably, sweating , dizzy, headache, and had heaviness in my chest. I felt as if I were going to have a stroke. The headache was excruciating. I took acetaminophen 500 x 2 and 400 mg of ibuprofen, and Theraflu to try and alleviate the symptoms. On 4/9/21 my fever broke, but the weakness, dizziness and headaches have continued. I currently have ongoing headaches and dizziness. I have not gone to the doctor because I do not have a PCP. I am looking for one now.

I was also feeling tired and unsteady. 12 days after the shot I became very sick for 10 days with severe diarrhea, no energy,  stomach pains, weak, shaking, no more motivation.  I saw a doctor and was given antibiotics to stop the diarrhea. Now 1 month after I have no diarrhea but still get nausea and shakes . I feel very anxious and will see a therapist and prescribe medication for my anxiety that I have due to the vaccine reaction.  I took the vaccine so I can travel abroad much easier but now afraid to travel because of my symptoms.  I will get blood tested tomorrow to see if all is ok.

                                                I received an injection in June and July 2020 to control my herniated discs problems that caused me severe sciatic pain down my left leg.  After those injections I have led a normal life.  NO issues whatsoever.  No discomfort, no leg pain, no back pain.  Within about an hour after receiving the COVID-19 injection, I started to have discomfort and pain in my lower back.  Within a few days my sciatic pain had returned.  I am now scheduled for another injection in my back for 4-23-21 to get rid of the sciatic pain.

                                                Exactly 11 days after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine my husband developed leg pain in his right lower inner leg, he was taken to the hospital on 04/20/2021 which a ultrasound was completed but resulted no blood clots, no other labs or treatment was performed that day, the next day he developed severe diarrhea and flu like symptoms with continued leg pain and difficulty breathing, He was then rushed to the hospital by ambulance where he was suffering from very low BP 41/31 was the lowest, a line was placed and he was put on pressors to increase his BP.  He was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a flesh eating bacteria in the right leg where the pain was at and Sepsis.  He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

                                                Patient initially presented with meningitis-like syndrome with altered mentation, fever, headache, neck stiffness and found to have multifocal brain (predominantly brainstem lesions).  He was initially started on empiric meningitis coverage (ceftriaxone, vanc, ampicillin, acyclovir) which was stopped when CSF tests/cultures returned negative and he improved. Around 10 days later he then developed Guillain-Barre syndrome with ascending weakness of legs and inflammation of cauda equina nerve roots and inflammatory involvement of spinal cord as well causing weakness, numbness, autonomic dysfunction (cardiac arrhythmias) and urinary retention. He was treated with 5 day course of IVIG and improved enough to go to acute rehab. Diagnosis was ultimately concluded as atypical Bickerstaff&#39;s encephalitis or idiopathic inflammation of the brain, spinal cord and nerve roots without no other causative event identified other than recent vaccination

He sat down on a chair about 30 minutes just to relax.  Before the shot, he was pretty nervous about getting vaccinated (needles) and his fiance told me that he hardly gets vaccinated in the past because he is afraid of needles. She was not sure if his reaction is because of his nervousness about the vaccine or if it is an allergic reaction. I told his fiance who was with him the whole time, to take him to the ER if he is having hard time breathing or if his dizziness gets prolonged.  I tried calling patient and her fiance  on 5/10/21 vaccination day, and 5/12/21 again and left message to follow up but no answer/ call back.

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

We quickly checked his temperature however it was within normal range. We applied cold packs to his wrists, forehead, and face for about 12 minutes. I checked for normal capillary refill and asked him questions to assess his mental status. About 20 minutes after starting the treatment, patient started improving. He returned almost back to normal in about 30 minutes.

                                                Approximately three weeks after receiving Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, I began to get pains in legs. Calves were aching and throbbing. Didn&#39;t think anything of it at first....just thought achy muscles and such. The day before Easter (April 3rd 2021) decided since the pain was continuing and the internet will scare you to death - I went to a local Emergency Room in advance,  I had an ultrasound on my left leg and it was noted I had DVT. (blood clot in left calf)  To briefly explain: I had an achilles issue back in Nov. 2020 (slight micro tear - achilles tendonitis) I thought maybe this was related to that, as I had not been to the doctor to get it checked until early March 2021. and it bothered me off and on for a few months. I thought the calf pain may have been related to that?  I explained to the emergency room doctor about my achilles and thought it was an issue related to that. They decided to perform an ultrasound on my left leg. Which noted the DVT/Blood Clot. They put me on a starter pack of Xarelto and I am to follow up with my normal doctor on April 22, 2021.

Arm is hard to lift up at some times and weak to lift anything up sometimes. Arm feels week for about 2 to 3 days and then starts to fill better. Then after a day of the soreness or no weakness in the arm, it starts back hurting again. It now getting worse at night time and sometimes during the day. Some days it hurts so bad that I can&#39;t even move it. I don&#39;t bother to tell my wife, because it just last for about a 2 to 3 hours. I have been to my doctor yet. But if it keeps bothering me I will make an appointment to see him.  It just my arm and hand be very weak to use at sometimes every other day.

Temperature started to decrease over the next two days so did the cramping. Then starting on 4/5 I started to experience pain in the back of my head along with the sensation of heat/burning. This was accompanied by a stiff neck. This pain and stiffness persists to today. Medication prescribed by my doctor lessens the discomfort but has not rid me of the issue.

I was admitted 1-2 am into impatience room. CT diagnosed a big gray area in between speech are and spine. 4/3/21, Sat afternoon. MRI and MRA had been tested.  Cardiologist said he could not rule out the last option, which was due to slow heart beat 50-60. But I have slow heart beat since I remembered things from 4-5 year-old. He suggested wearing a heart monitoring device for a 4 weeks after discharged.  4/4/21, Sun noon.  Doctor admitted to discharge.

By 8:00, I was feeling tired enough that I went to bed early.  By 9:00, I had terrible chills and body aches throughout my body.   The aches were worse in my chest / torso -- maybe from so much shaking.  I did not watch any of the men&#39;s championship game that night.  I also felt nauseous but I seemed to lack the strength to vomit.  I can not remember a time when I had so much physical pain in my life.  My hands felt numb / tingling.  I tried to drink some ginger ale but drinking was difficult.  Although I was aware that I was breathing and my heart was beating, I thought that I might die.  The terrible pain continued for a few hours.  Around 10:30 PM, the pain dissipated.  However, after about 10 minutes of relief, the pain returned, perhaps worse than before.  At around 11:30, my wife came to bed.  She suggested that I try relaxing Yoga breathing.   I did that and the pain stopped and I fell asleep.   The next day, I woke up with a typical headache and took more Tylenol.  I continued to improve the remainder of the day.

We thought it was related to the weather getting warm and we work the night shift, so he rested and increased his water intake. He was able to go to work on Monday night and return home and continued to rest on Tuesday. On Tuesday, there was no numbness, but there was weakness in both his legs. On Wednesday, he felt weakness throughout his body, especially in his legs. On Thursday, he collapsed. He did not lose consciences but his legs gave out under him and he was not able to get up up. He was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a stroke, increased sugars (diabetes he has never had before), acute kidney injury, and uncontrolled increased blood pressure. He was hospitalized and discharged April 19, 2021. He was readmitted 04/24/2021 for another stroke.

                                                Lost his vaccine card would not give him a new one.  He got his vaccine, had burning sensation immediately after the needle was pulled out.  About 5-10 minutes later he started sweating, and seemed to have calmed down and felt OK.  He was observed for 30 minutes there and went for observation for another 30  minutes.  He went to another doctors office and at about 15:00 started feeling light headed and weak.  He drove back home, picked up some stuff at a grocery store, and outside the grocery store in 80 degree heat he felt the need to put on a jacket as he had the chills.  he went home, went to bed feeling bad, his shoulder was still burning where he got hte vaccin.e  He had a little bit of site pain, applied topical and the pain went away.  He woke up the next morning feeling really bad, felt like a major flu, his head felt like it was going to explode, but no problem with sinuses, no cough, no sneezing.  His eyes were watering from the pain, and chills on and off.  He had to change his sheets a couple of times due to sweating.  He then developed a fever of 99 degrees at about 18:00 that night, and about 19:00 he went to 102 when he checked it.  After that it went to 103, and about 15 minutes after that it was 104, and then higher at 104.&#43;.  He took some vodka, honey and lemon juice and took an alcohol bath and the fever had not broken yet.  He called the clinic and they told him to call 9-1- 1 and to go to the ER.  He went to the ER at about 10:00, gave him fluids, did a chest x-ray and released him about midnight.  He apparently disoriented and tried to walk off and didn&#39;t remember this.  They took him back to the gate and called his son.  He went home, took another bath and woke up in sweat and was in bed for the entire weekend.  He got up Monday morning, 4/13/21 feeling a little bit better and went to see his doctor, who does not believe he was having any side effects and that the information that is being reported is true.   He is still feeling a little weak and still fatigued and on bedrest.  He was taking Advil besides his regular medicines every 6 hours with 500 mg of Tylenol for the intense pain as every joint in his body ached, and the worst headache he had ever had, as well as the high fevers.  His fever subsided on Saturday morning, and still had some sweats following that.  Did have hot/cold flashes on Saturday and Sunday.   He was given a COVID test in the ER and he was negative, but did not give him any other information regarding his lab work.

                                                Received the vaccine on 4/4/2021.  On 4/8/2021 started having pain in lower left leg.  Pain off and on for two weeks.  Pain intensified on 4/23/2021.  I went to the emergency room where they performed on ultra sound examination of my left leg.  Confirmed that I have a deep vain thrombosis (DVT) behind my left knee.  Prescribed Eliquis.  Saw Dr. today.  He could not confirm that DVT was caused by vaccine, but I thought I should report it.  I am to stay on Eliquis for six months at which time I will be evaluated for a blood clot disorder.

                                                On Friday, March 19 around 9:10am I had seizures - loss of awareness, very pale, shaking (but not quite convulsions). This happened before 25 years ago and is likely unrelated to the vaccine. Expected cold/flu-like symptoms did occur on March 14 and part of March 15 but things have been fine since then. I&#39;ve followed up with my GCP and am scheduling a Neuro appointment for followup.

By 9a.m. my blood pressure taken at home was 180/110 and started having chest pain on left side.    Went to urgent care where they felt it was a cardiac reaction to vaccine and they sent me to ER.   Underwent EKG and chest xray.   Blood pressure still at same level 180/110 and not going down, migraine still at an 8 out of 10, chest pain still present.    I was given an IV to treat for migraine pain and within a few hours all symptoms had went away.   We started with Urgent Care at about 10a.m. on 4/3/21 and then by the time all was done I was released from the ER at 6:30p.m. on 4/3/21.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination I started to experience chronic exhaustion, leg cramping and pain in my lower back right side, upper right thigh, behind my right knee and down into my right calf. I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

Next morning pain, swelling and nausea persisted. Medium intensity body aches and headache began late morning. By mid afternoon body pain increased to the point that I was no longer able to function and needed to lie down.  Took a 4 hour nap. Side effects persisted after waking up.  At time of writing, 28hrs after vaccine, I am still feeling the side effect although less severe. Ibuprofen and Tylenol  do seem to help.

                                                I had a small lump appear at or near the site of injection past the 2 week period. My arm was stiff and sore. My spouse massaged my shoulder and the lump seemed to disappear. Arm felt better. The next day the same thing happened. My spouse massaged my arm and it went away again. I haven&#39;t had any other issues beyond that. I&#39;m not completely sure it is related to the vaccine. I was also in the hospital during this time for an unrelated health issue. I had an obstructed bowel that required surgery. My surgeon assured me that they did nothing to my left arm during the surgery and treatment of the bowel obstruction. After a few conversations with the medical staff and my spouse we thought that the arm issue may have been a side effect of the vaccine shot. That&#39;s why I&#39;m submitting this to you now. So far I haven&#39;t experienced anything else at the injection site. My spouse also had the same vaccine at the same time as me. He hasn&#39;t experienced any of the same effects as I have.

                                                DIAGNOSIS: 1. Superficial thrombophlebitis MEDICAL DECISION MAKING/DIFFERENTIAL DX: Differential diagnosis includes DVT, superficial thrombophlebitis, muscle strain, tendinitis. The patient presented to the emergency department with atraumatic left leg pain. An ultrasound reveals a fairly large blood clot in the greater saphenous vein. Although this is a superficial clot, given its extent, I think it warrants anticoagulation. Per the trial, the patient would benefit from 45 days of 10 mg Xarelto treatment. The patient was given good precautions regarding bleeding risk while on a blood thinner. He will schedule follow-up appoint with his primary care doctor. He will also use Tylenol and warm packs to help with the discomfort from the superficial thrombophlebitis. He was discharged in satisfactory condition.

For a few minutes I continued to get warm and at about the 10 minute point I was taken to the waiting room where I got a drink of water.  After drinking the water I felt much better and soon felt normal with the exception of discomfort at the injection site.  (My left upper arm just below my shoulder)  After six days now, I still feel fine overall however, if I message the injection site, I can still feel a little bit of discomfort.

                                                Evening after getting vaccination I developed fairly loud tinnitus in both ears.  The ringing was loud enough to keep me awake, even though I felt pretty weak and achy from the vaccine.  It subsided after about a week but is still present to some extent.  I&#39;ve noticed it off and on before the vaccination, but never so steady or strong.  About one month after the vaccine I&#39;d say it&#39;s a little worse than before, but not terrible.

I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

About 10 hours later I started feeling sick.  One of the first things I noticed besides a headache was my heart rate jumped up to over 100 beats per minute (it is normally below 84).  I started getting chills and fever.  It was worse than any flu fever I ever had and I could not sleep.  Worst part was my heart rate would not go down, remaining above 100 but below 110-115 beats per minute.  I considered calling 911 but after looking online decided not to as long as it remained below 120 bpm.  I don&#39;t know my maximum temperature - I did not think to take it until after the peak had passed by 20 minutes or so (was 99.4 at that point - normal temperature runs 97.2 (low 96.8, high 98.2)).  Heart rate finally started to drop around 3:30 am.

Sat outside in 85 degrees for awhile to try to warm up. About 9pm got in the walk-in shower and sat on bench super hot water. Got out of shower at 9:40pm my skin beet red mostly my chest. Still freezing and body aches. Put on sweatpants and long sleeve t-shirt. Now have A/C off and windows open, 82 degrees outside. My temp taken before I started this form was at 98.7. I ache all over and am freezing. Not shivering though. But have goosebumps on arms under sleeves. I am very uncomfortable. It is now 10:35pm.

                                                Pt wanted to test BP prior to shot. Rph said pt BP was a little high so they waited and took BP again a minute or 2 later. BP had gone down some, so they agreed to proceed. After dose, pt was dizzy, sweaty, unresponsive for a short time. Once he was more responsive, we helped him sit on the floor against the wall as he was quite dizzy. We called 911 and pt refused transport to hospital, but was evaluated.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the shot, I started getting a headache, body aches, and chills (April 3rd, 8 p.m.).  I went to bed and had severe chills and body sweats for the entire night.  The primary symptom to report is that my heart raced all night.  It felt like it was beating at about 140 to 150 Hz or higher.  When I woke up in the morning, it felt like my chest had been pounded on all night.  The pain was in my sternum area.  The headache and body aches took a little over a day to go away.  The chest pain took a couple of days to die down.  On April 12th, I walked my dogs in the morning and felt out of breath, which isn&#39;t normal for me.  In the afternoon, while working at my desk at home, I started getting more and more severe chest pain and then started getting dizzy and felt weak.  I drove myself to the local ER and they tested me for a heart attack.  All tests came back negative.  They suggested going to another facility to get checked for clots or to make an appointment with a cardiologist.  The next day, after talking to a doctor friend, he suggested going to the ER facility to get imaged for clots and to get fully checked out.  No cardiologist appointments were available till the next week.  I went to the ER facility and was there for seven hours getting tested.  They came back and said all test results were negative and that my heart looked fine.  They did not have any suggestions for what might be causing the pain in my chest.

                                                I developed a high pitch ringing in the ears the morning after the vaccine.  It was noticed when I woke up.  I did have a low fever, high chills, and significant neck muscle &#34;cramping&#34; during the night when this reaction developed.  The ringing (Tinnitus) is pretty loud and bothersome.  The volume has not changed since the day after my vaccine shot (two weeks now).

She said my face was drooping, I couldn&#39;t smile or stand.  She called Ambulance.  Ambulance arrived and decided symptoms of stroke and called for helicopter to take me to medical center.   When I arrived they did CT and I was later told it showed possible areas of no oxygen to brain.  They gave me TPA drug and almost immediately  I could see improvement - my headache cleared.  Throughout the next couple hours I regained movement on right side and all functionality returned except weakness in right arm.  I stayed in ICU for 24 hours as required after receiving TPA and while additional tests were ran then was discharged on Friday, April 16, 2021

                                                I began to feel numb around my mouth and nose.  It spread to most of my face, then chest, then arms, mainly left arm and leg, then to both legs.  General weird feeling / numbness, no pain.  I had trouble with limb control, not bad, but enough to notice. Mainly left side, but noticeable  on both sides.  From the onset on face numbness to the chest leg spread was just a matter of a few, maybe 5 minutes.  I looked at my face in the car mirror, and appeared to have facial control.  I was driving to a relatives house, and it worried me. On the way, I also noticed a lump in my right neck, about the size of a pea.  When I got to my relatives house I told them I thought I had a small stroke, but wasn&#39;t sure. The numbness lasted until the next day, then slowly went away.  It took about 2 days before the numb twitchy feeling went away from my left eye/upper cheek area.  The lump in my neck also went away.  rubbing on it actually made the numbness slightly go away. I did not go to a hospital, or seek any treatment.  I think I should have.   I do believe that l had a small stroke / blood clot, and that it should be reported.  I think I am OK now,

                                                After the injection on Friday 03/12 at 1:50 PM at facility, I started to get a slight temperature, Along with chills as well. This continue throughout the weekend. I remained at home and did not have any energy to go out and be around people. The next day, I also got diarrhea and was very dehydrated.  Immediately, after I left the vaccine shot location, like within 5 minutes, I started to smell fish and my mouth tasted like salt for three days. I also had excruciating headaches that did not go away with advil. So I rested a  lot and had no real big appetite what so ever!.  Today, I am concerned that on my left side below my left clavicle, I feel a big bump what appears to be possibly a lymphatic swelling of node? I am concerned because I did not have this swelling before and do not know if it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine.  Pls contact me via phone, this is urgent.  Thanks

At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

That lasted about 30 hours. I realize this is probably a mild symptom, and probably a normal reaction.  But you might need to know that.

Duration of blackout unknown. Woke up on floor not knowing how I got there. Sat up, nausea and lightheadedness returned, then dissipated with no further blackout. Felt rush of blood from head to toe and felt okay after that. Pharmacy staff took blood pressure, readings were close to normal (slightly elevated). Paramedics were called by pharmacy, and their BP readings were also close to normal. After all that, aside from some fatigue, no other appreciable side effects over the next 48 hours. No nausea, flu-like symptoms or fever, and very little soreness at injection site.

                                                the day after the shot, started feeling unwell (approx 24 hours post shot). Slurring words, stumbling around and general unwell feeling with a fluttery feeling in chest. No previous heart issues of any kind. After it continued for an hour or so, I took him to the ER and it was discovered that he was in AFIB. 2 rounds of meds and tests, but stayed in that rhythm. They ended up doing a cardio version and it went back into normal sinus rhythm. Follow up with dr, placed on Eliquis, EKG, stress test and sleep study have found no other contributing factors atthis point.

                                                Some weeks after vaccination I started feeling shortness of breath. When I walked from the parking lot to my work desk it was hard and when I arrived at work my co-workers could hear me grasping for air, I felt winded, and it never happened before. Also, another episode when the elevator broke down I could not go the flight of stairs without having to stop and catching my breath.  Since the weather is better I decided to start walking in the park for exercise but I realized I did not have the strength nor the capacity to breathe. I amafraid at night because sometimes when I lay down I can&#39;t breathe.

My PCP scheduled an ultrasound on 3-24-21 where the nurse discovered blood clots in my lower left leg. I started taking Eloquis later that afternoon. I then had an apt with a blood dr. on 4-9-21 where she drew blood for tests. I was experiencing my heart racing and she scheduled me an apt with a cardiologist on 4-13-21 where the cardiologist suspected that the clots had moved into my lungs. The cardiologist did an EKG on the same day. I have a heart echo scheduled for 5-7-21. I am experiencing side effects from Eloquis so 4-19-21 I switched to Xeralto.

I was already taking blood thinner. I went to the Emergency Room the next day and they found a blood clot in my leg. The Thrombosis was behind my left knee. My leg was swollen from the knee down and my ankle was very swollen. My Eliquis dosage has been increased from 2.5mg to 5mg twice daily. I did not have a repeat sonogram but my leg is no longer swollen.

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after the injection, while sitting down, I felt light headed, sweating, weak, face turned white. I was close to passing out but didn&#39;t. I requested attention after about 10 minutes. While being treated by medics they mentioned color had returned to my face. I felt better enough so I refused to go to hospital and was driven home. Later that morning, 03/08/2021 about 10 AM, I developed a fever and body aches with sharp pains thru out my body and joints. First temperature check was 100.5. My fever, pains/weakness increased thru out that day and overnight with chills. Highest temp check was 102.8 that evening prior to bedtime. I don&#39;t know if it could have been higher at some point overnight. It felt like I had a moderate to bad case of the FLU. The next morning, 03/09/2021 the fever broke down to about 101. By 03/11/2021, aside from a little residual weakness I felt more like myself. However, as of the writing of this report my temp seems to fluctuate between normal and 99.8. Will report this to my Doctor on next visit. Worth noting that I haven&#39;t had any Flu like symptoms to that degree in many years.

Sometime later very had high fever that lasted for hours and was accompanied by high heart rate and aches. After I had cooled a bit I took my temperature--103. Heart rate over 100, maybe up to 120 my resting pulse is typically in the l 50s )Suspect fever at peak was over 104. Fever and elevated heart rate lasted for hours. . At 2:30 AM took 3 ibuprofen, returned to bed and drifted off. An hour or two later woke up completely drenched and dripping with sweat but no longer feverish. Drifted back to sleep. By 9 AM felt almost normal, but (not surprisingly) a bit wrung out.

Intense muscle aches were later (approx 6-8 hrs after shot) along with overall fatigue.  A medium grade headache began 8-10 hrs after shot and continued throughout night - lowering to a slight headache within 24 hrs after shot.  Headache ended 28-30 hrs after shot.  Developed a post nasal drip and mild congestion in sinuses about 1.5 days after shot (and continues).  Numbness in toes appears to have returned with some stiffness felt in my calf muscles.

Within the first 5 minutes, the pharmacist was alerted to the patient dropping his phone and glasses to the floor and staring off into space. The pharmacist proceeded to make contact with patient by calling their name and giving them gentle taps on the shoulder and knee. The patient &#34;came to&#34; within a few minutes stating that they could hear and see but felt as though they were &#34;off in space&#34; . Once the patient &#34;came to&#34; they were coherent but perspiring a bit.  The patient was offered water and a cool damp cloth. The patient was offered EMT services which they declined.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced left hip and joint pain. I could not lift my left leg up. The next morning after my J&amp;J vaccine, my left leg started hurting more and I could not ambulate. My left hip was hurting so bad I could not sleep at night. I went to the doctor 03-17-2021 to get monitored and he said it could be arthritis. I was prescribed by Dr.  cyclobenzaprine 10mg and naproxen 500mg. I feel that my pain is inside the joint, hip pain region and to this day, I still have sleeping problems due to my pain in my left leg and left hip pain since the J&amp;J vaccine. I will have a  follow up with Dr. in the coming weeks.

Starting about 10-14 days after receiving the vaccine (IM into my deltoid), I have been experiencing a regional (almost dermatomal) distribution itchiness and hypersensitivity in my left infrascapular and upper lateral back region. It&#39;s a superficial (dermal/epidermal) discomfort, not deep. I have observed NO associated rash or hives; nothing is visually evident. I am still experiencing this at day 19 post vaccine. I&#39;ve not taken any medication, have not applied any topicals, etc.

                                                The night after the shot, I started feeling some pain in my right leg from about the hip down the thigh. It got progressively worse and I was actually having difficulty standing. It peaked around Monday, but as of today (Friday 4/16/2021) it is definitely still there. However, it is diminishing in pain. I think it will go away with time so I haven&#39;t seen a doctor yet. I don&#39;t experience leg pain so this was a surprise. I thought maybe I perhaps slept in a wrong position but I would assume it would go away. I don&#39;t see any discoloration in the area.

                                                This is a 59 year old male that presented to the emergency department at approximately 1447 on 04/27/2021 with sudden onset of left upper and lower extremity weakness and left-sided numbness of his face. The patient stated he may have had some weakness the previous night (04/26/2021), but mostly noticed it when he woke up around 0900 on 04/27/2021. The patient stated he may have also had some transient speech changes which he felt were improved upon emergency department presentation. The patient stated he took an 81 mg aspirin prior to hospital arrival. The patient was overall hemodynamically stable in the emergency department. Past medical history is only significant for benign prostatic hyperplasia. This patient has no history of previous CVA or TIA, no smoking history, no history of clotting disorders, no recent trauma or other injury. CT head revealed a small right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage with no midline shift and concern for clot. CTA head and neck perfusion study was significant for ?perfusion abnormality involving the right frontal lobe in the region of known subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely related to dural venous sinus thrombosis involving the posterior aspect of the superior sagittal sinus, left greater than right transverse sinus, and left sigmoid sinus.? This patient is noted to have recently received his Johnson and Johnson vaccine on 03/20/2021. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Neurology and hematology were consulted.

You would have to contact her directly for more information. He was found dead in his room  by the manager around 5 pm on April 22nd. Manager told me his body was cold to the touch so she thought he may have passed the previus day on April 21st.  Daughter todl me earlier today that a doctor is running some tests to try to determine the cause of death. You would need to contact her for the doctors name.  My own inpression is that the emphysema was not severe enough to have d=caused his death as he could walk up to half a mile.
