                                                On March 11th at around 10pm I experienced severe shaking, fever, headache and delirium. The next day I improved but had a fever on and off of 99.1. I felt like I was stable, but felt dizziness increasing, and was lethargic through the weekend.   Then on Monday the 15th, I had a noticeable cramp in my right abdomen. At around 8pm CST I began feeling like I needed to burp and that I had GI problems.   The problems increased that night at around 10pm I had pain where the cramp started. Two hours later I started throwing up because of the pain and feeling of too much air inside of me. I could not stop vomiting after 2 hours so went to the Hospital ED at around 2:30 AM Tuesday the 16th.   I was admitted after a CT scan showed and white cell counts confirmed and infection and drastically enlarged appendix. I was diagnosed with an appendicitis and they immediately scheduled me for surgery.

After resting and a cup of water, my vitals became all normal.

The next day, I woke up with general pain in the body, pain in the arm where the vaccine was injected and it swelled up a little the skin under the eyes (hives). As the day goes by, the pain in the arm has diminished, as well as the hives in the eyes.

My body felt incredibly hot but I did sweat at all. If I would move the bed covers and any part of my skin below my neck felt the air I would get chills the would shake my entire body for a few seconds.  Later that morning; body aches all over, a fever reaching 101.3, fatigue. Over the counter medicines, napping, and a shower helped reduce symptoms.  All was gone by the next morning.

I couldn&#39;t sleep well because I got the chills and a fever. I went to use the bathroom around 3am. All of a sudden I got really nauseous, the room spun, everything went black and I fainted in the middle of my bathroom. My wife woke up and helped me back to bed. The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

We then monitored the patient&#39;s BP every 10 minutes or so. Pt stablized after roughly 45 minutes to an hour and then left the store.

I took three ibuprofen at about 4am. Now I feel fine. Maybe just a little tired. But that could be from sleeping poorly last night.

At about 10:30pm I started feeling sick, fever of 99.6, muscle and joint pain, chills, dizziness, weakness. Left arm where I got injected also felt like it was falling asleep at some point when it shouldn&#39;t have been based on how I was positioned. I finally took an ibuprofen so I could sleep around 2:30am, and felt better a couple hours later or so. Today so far I feel fine but my resting heart rate is about 30 beats higher than normal so I&#39;m still responding to vaccine.  I think overall my symptoms aren&#39;t out of the ordinary, just way stronger than I was expecting. I felt miserable.

                                                The next day I noticed tinnitus (high pitch mild ringing in both ears) .  Therefore it has been a total of 7 days with ringing in both ears and it has not gone away.  It has been constant, no pulses, no frequency changes, etc.  Just constant high pitch ringing in both ears. Sometimes by inner ear feels funny, slightly tingle feeling that is related to the tinnitus.  The tinnitus is most noticeable in quiet settings, sleeping, reading, watching TV, I do not noticed it as much in office environments, listening to music, walking outside.  I have experienced tinnitus in the past after loud music band or rock concert but do not attend live loud music often and try to avoid it because it hurts my ears.  I do not have any known hearing problem, I try to protect my ears and use hearing protection often to avoid damage. When I cut my lawn I wear hearing protection, when I am working on shop floor I wear hearing protection.  I am thinking the vaccine is related somehow. I never had COVID-19 in past.  I use to be able to be in quiet settings and not have any tinnitus before vaccine.

                                                Patient received Janssen vaccine was told to sit for 15 minutes post observation. He came up shortly after (less than 5 mins post imz) saying he didn&#39;t feel well, like he was going to pass out. I immediately came from the pharmacy, my tech sat a chair behind him. I called for optical to call a code white. The patient requested to sit on the ground. At this point, his wife was present. He was sweating. I gave him an ice pack, a water after it was determined he was breathing okay. He was pale, extremely lethargic and sweating. After sitting him on floor I told my tech to call 911. I took his blood pressure, it was 99/73, pulse 75. Very low for him. Hes on blood pressure medicine but been having issues controlling it. He later tells me hes terrified of needles. He also tells his wife he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. I stayed with the patient until ems left with him because when standing his heart rate dropped 20 points, after they stuck him again to check his blood sugar. They determined then he should be checked out at the hospital and they took him.

The shaking stopped at that time and my temperature went from 101.1 to 102.5. My skin was warm and I began to be very clammy. Around 3:45 AM, the fever broke and I was down to 99.5. I?ve subsequently had muscle aches and the feeling of being fatigued.

                                                Around 8pm I became very cold and tired. I took a bath, which is out of character, and tried to sleep. By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

                                                For the 36 hours after my vaccine, I had commonly listed side effects; chills, aches, and shivers. These subsided, and I developed a cough for the next 3 or 4 days. This developed into more of a chesty feeling and lethargic feeling. On the 8th day after my vaccine, my symptoms were similar to those in Covid positive cases; chest tightness, dry cough, and chills. I went to get tested, and was found to be Covid-19 positive. Since then, I have experienced severe headaches, continued tight chest, cough, chills, and sweats.

This happened both the first and second night.  During the day I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours for aches and pain.  Mainly my neck and back have been what hurts, although my knees, elbows, hips, etc. also were achy.  The third and fourth days I still continued to have chills, no fever throughout as far as I am aware (took my temp 2-3 times).  The fourth day I was very faint and somewhat unbalanced, felt shaky and light headed and I ended up having an anxiety attack.  I mention the last symptom as I have never had an episode like this previously in my life.  Today is day 5, still feel tired, slightly nauseous, neck and back pain, headache, difficulty focusing.

Vaccinator was notified that he has a history of vasovagal response with needles. This response presents itself as sweating (and possible fainting) and is alleviated by lying down. Client mentioned that previous nurse advised him to smell an alcohol pad to distract and prevent a vasovagal response, as this had worked previously on a glucose check. No medications were disclosed or history of anaphylaxis reported. With this background information, RN offered to have vaccine administered in reclined position, however client refused. RN conferred with co-lead about administration recommendations. Vaccinator then checked in with patient at 1423 to see if patient was okay and patient did not answer the question. RN then felt the client&#39;s hand and noticed hand was clammy. At 1425 the reclining chair was brought to the station and patient was transferred into chair, appearing diaphoretic. RN palpated pulse and noted patient was not tachycardia, but RN did note tachypnea and uneasiness. RN then provided distraction and promoted relaxation. Then at 1426 patient reported feeling okay and RN noted patient no longer felt clammy.

                                                Patient was given shot and asked to wait in pharmacy area at least 15 minutes.  Within about 5-10 minutes his girlfriend comes to the pharmacy window and tells me he&#39;s feeling bad.  By the time I get to his chair he is very lethargic and slumped over.  I sit him up in the chair and his head rolls back and his eyes have rolled back in his head.   I place him on the floor and instructed my staff to call 911.   The patient presented with sweats and was unresponsive for about 10-20 seconds.   When he came to he asked how he got on the floor.   The patient never had any trouble breathing  heart rate was steady the entire time.   When EMS arrived they checked him out and was fine.  He refused transport to the hospital.  He walked out of the store after about 30 minutes from the point of his passing out.

At that point, started getting chills, which progressed into mix of chills and hot spells, fever, headache, and frequent urination throughout the night (though was also hydrating a lot).  Had fever the next morning still and Diarrhea.  Still feel modest headache and chills the next evening (before bed where I had felt the worst overnight the first night of the vaccine) but feeling better than the first night.  Per the form I received, I was told to include Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA in this section of the form.  I am reporting this on the day after the vaccination, so don&#39;t yet know final outcome, but again, improving and don&#39;t feel like I need medical attention.

Immediately sat back down to place my head between my knees, and completely blacked out, fallout out of the chair and hitting my head and knee on the floor and  nearby fixtures. Regained consciousness on floor about 30 seconds after fainting and immediately felt much better. Pharmacy staff were on hand and promptly called 911, instructed me not to move and took my pulse and monitored me until EMS arrived within 5-10 minutes. Vital signs normal including BP 120/90, 100% o2 levels, normal blood sugar and EKG. EMS assisted in getting me back to seated position and monitored for another 10-15 minutes. Declined transport and had family member drive me home where I rested for a few hours and woke up feeling fine. Very minor bruising / bump on head with no lasting sign of concussion or other trauma. 24&#43; hours post vaccine no other notable vaccine reactions aside from sore arm / muscles on injection site.

Wife was hot while I was freezing and shivering uncontrollably, so I know something was wrong with me.  The shivering and chills lasted for a couple of hours until about 2:30-3:00am.  Then I got really hot.  Took my temperature, was at 99.1 degrees.  But room was really warm so I turned down the temperature and took off my layers of clothing.  Woke up this morning, around 7am, to a headache and aching legs.  I took 2 Excederin, but the headache is still there.  Legs are feeling better after a couple of hours.

                                                The 46yo patient came in to get his covid vaccine.  His parents reported he has a medical condition/disability that requires him to receive services in their home.  After receiving the vaccine the patient reported feeling lightheaded, dizzy, hot, and that his blood pressure felt abnormal.  He requested an ambulance and some water.  I called 911 and provided him water, but did not administer any epinephrine or any other medications.  The paramedics arrived and talked to him for about 15 minutes.  He then left on his own accord with his parents and declined further medical attention.

Monday Night I woke up sweating as I had a fever.  The fever persisted off and on for about 24 hours. I was irritable (probably due to not feeling well) for about 48 hours.  My wife had to drive me home.

                                                Beginning around 10:00pm the day of the vaccination, which occurred at 2:00pm, I began to experience chills and went to bed. I woke up several times during the night and felt feverish. I got up once and felt dizzy and had some body aches. At around 7:00 am the following day I took my temperature and it was 99.4 F.  I took acetaminophen at 8:00 am. I went back to bed and was still feverish and sweating. I woke up at 10:15 am and felt much better. My fever was gone and I had no more chills or body aches. After that time no other adverse reactions occurred.

At 15 minutes asked nurse if normal. Then started sweating. left hand turned purple. Dont really remember anything else. Went unconscious. Remember them yelling Code something and Cardiac arrest. Taken to ER. Think they may have said anaphalatic shock. I think they gave me epinepherine. Had paralysis in left hand when i woke up for a few minutes. Blood work and EKG were normal. Went home within a couple of hours. Light-headed two days later still. Saw doctor two days after. Blood pressure is high.  Little bit of fatigue and brain fog.

                                                I received the J&amp;J shot after work on Friday around 5:30 p.m.. Around 3 a.m. Saturday morning, I woke up with a fever and chills. My head was hot. My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

Also mentioned that this happened to him after he got a TDap vaccine about 15 years ago - he said it is a mental thing with him and does not like to get vaccines.

Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often. --- Thank you ---

His headache was getting worse.  All symptoms were getting better except the headache.  He thought he was feeling better but when he woke up today 4/6/2021 he was SOB and diarrhea was back. Pt has taken Pepto Bismol for his symptoms and will probably need to go to the ER since he is having trouble breathing.   He feels like he has had such a bad reaction to this since he possibly has had the covid vax in the past 90 days.

                                                Patient received the vaccine. Immunizing tech stated: the patient seemed fine at the time of the shot. After administration of the shot the patient began to bleed out of injection site (like normal). The immunizing tech swabbed the area with cotton and placed a Band-Aid on the patient then stepped back into the pharmacy to grab another band aid while the patient remained at the immunization chair. The tech applied another band aid and told the patient to wait 15 minutes after the immunization and directed him to a waiting chair. The tech came back into the pharmacy and was cleaning the immunization basket when the patient&#39;s wife yelled for help. At this point I went out to the patient. Another tech called 911, another grabbed a nearby EpiPen. The immunizing tech grabbed the e-kit while I was out with the patient while he was unresponsive. Patient was unresponsive and slouched in chair. His wife and I supported the neck of the patient and laid him on the floor. I checked pulse and breathing to which both were present. Patient was still unresponsive and making strange movements. Pulse and breathing remained present and then the patient became responsive relatively quickly. At this point patient responsive and answering questions and moving fine. He asked if he had passed out then stated, he had a phobia of needles and said he felt nauseated. (wife previously stated he had a fear of injections). Soon after the ambulance showed up and I told the paramedics the above story. After a few more minutes I checked in with the paramedics and they said the patient was doing fine. Lastly, he was taken out of store with paramedics.

                                                1 hr after shot (tuesday 0831 hrs), right bicep was twitching. Next morning (wedenesday 0700 hrs) pain an redness in Right shoulder.  Most importantly pain in the spine from middle to lower back..  (Thursday 0510 hrs) while brushing teeth, a sharp pain put me to my knees..  1200 hrs pain was still there... Went to urgent care.. Doctor said it was back spasms.. Said he didn&#39;t know if it was related to the vaccine. Then also said nobody knows.  I have not worked out nor have I lifted anything heavy in 2 weeks prior to receiving the covid vaccine.

I did not measure my body temperature because I immediately ran under the blanket. Icy-cold hands and feet, even after my body temperature seemed to stabilize. I fell asleep but not a restful sleep. I woke up after 2.5 to 3 hours with the feeling that it was morning, but in fact it was between 2am and 3 am. At that point I felt the worst part had gone, I felt weak and with muscle aches but I could drink water and go back to bed. I did not have a restful sleep all night and I woke up may times. By the morning I was tired but no fever.

                                                After the injection I felt fine. After falling asleep that evening, I awoke around 12:30am with body aches and slight amount of nausea.  It lasted for a few hours through the night in which I did not sleep.

Prior to that, I have been having some problems breathing after getting the vaccine and have been using my Ventolin  more often after the vaccine. Also noticed shortly after getting the vaccine, a feeling of liquid in my right ear.  the liquid in the ear did go away a day before the dizziness started.  Did not consider the ear or breathing issues as possible side effects  as I do have asthma and figured the ear was congestion. Not sure if the dizziness and the feeling of liquid in my right ear are related and/or related to the vaccine.

Suffered trauma to noise and back during fall as a result of passing out including laceration from hitting face on counter.  After coming to sever body shakes.  Temperature was taken twice and recorded 92.5 and 93.0.  Blood pressure and pulse after moving to couch to lie sit down was normal.  Next day couldn&#39;t do much and was very tired.  By second day I was recovered but sealing with injuries from the fall.

                                                I received the shot at 1:11 pm. I felt sorta drunk and not safe to drive by 3 pm. Sorta woozy. By 7 I was  home and fell asleep and did not wake up until 4 pm the next day.   I was sleepy and felt terrible nausea and was sweaty three nights in a row.  By the 2nd night  I had a headache that was unbelievable.  I eventually took Tylenol 48 hrs after the shot and it barely helped the headache. I never ever get sick never have headaches. It was bad. I was also super super irritable and I am generally a happy person. I was so bothered by everyone I was sorta angry at them it was weird. By Sunday night my headache was even worse so bad in my neck on my left side that I had the shot, I could barely move my head. I took Tylenol recommended dose. I finally fell asleep on Sunday night 3 days later midnight sweaty again.   Monday morning I woke up and I never felt better. On top of the world amazing.  I felt not  just good but extra good. Ready to go for it all.  It was a very strange experience for over three days. I typically get the flu shot, I stay healthy and never had an experience like this, I don?t get sick luckily. Any I wanted to share this because it was so strange and no one warned me really. .  I have felt great since and am thankful I had the shot.

                                                Patient received Johnson&amp;Johnson COVID vaccine in the afternoon on 3/31/21. Patient reported having right arm pain, diaphoresis, chills, nausea, and muscle aches/pain in upper leg/lower back at 5:30am the following morning. Patient took 2 tablets of 500mg naproxen in the morning and in the afternoon. Symptoms did not resolve and patient had to leave work early. Upon getting home patient took 2 tablets of 650mg tylenol and symptoms resolved within 48 hours. On 4/3/21 patient reported mild to severe pain in heel of left foot. The following day the patient went to WellNow urgent care to get his heel examined. During examination provider noticed patient&#39;s lesions and patient stated more lesions have appeared since getting the vaccine.  1 on his stomach, 1 on the dorsum of his left foot, 1 on his back, 1 on his left elbow, in between his toes of his left foot, and in between the fingers of his right hand. Patient stated that these lesions cause a burning sensation and can become itchy. Patient was sent to Hopsital ED as provider at urgent care was concerned patient may have purpura. Patient was seen and discharged on 4/4/21 from the ED. The heel pain was determined to be plantar fascitis which was treated with at home exercises with a heel cup. The patient was given clotrimazole for his lesions. The patient had a follow-up visit with his primary care provider at hospital on 4/6/21 in which he explained the clotrimazole only made his lesions worse. Patient was referred to follow up with dermatology on 4/8/21. Primary care provider believes progression of the lesions since getting the vaccine leads to concern of an underlying autoimmune exacerbated by vaccine.

Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

Patient was recommended to schedule an appointment with PCP and ask for a referral to Neurology, since patient had seizure like activity with a Tdap a few years ago.

                                                About 10 minutes after injection, got dizzy/clammy. It took about 5-10 minutes after that with EMTs to wait until my blood pressure normalized, and then I was fine.  Walked off site.  Slowly throughout the day had an increasingly bad headache, which peaked about 10 hours after the injection. Around that same time, bad fatigue started, and then slight chills. The headache at this point was extremely severe for about 10-12 hours. After that (so 20-22 hours after initial injection) the fatigue and chills subsided, but came back occasionally. The headache was less severe at that point, but in total did not go away until an additional 15 hours had passed.   My estimate is that took about 36-40 hours to feel 100% normal again.

This lasted for several hours after... At 11:30pm, almost 7 hours after the shot, I started to feel lousy. I started to get body aches and chills. Within 30 minutes they were fairly intense body aches and chills, shaking. At 1:00am I started to feel nauseas . At 1:30 am I started dry heaving. At approximately 2:30 I threw up twice, and the dry heaving and nausea lasting until 4am , when I took an anti nausea pill. I finally fell asleep at 430am. I woke up at 8am and felt tired, and no longer nauseated.

                                                The patient came in for J&amp;J vaccine. He said he had no history of severe allergic reaction to anything, including meds, food, vaccines or any injections.  He said that he did not receive any other vaccine in the past 14 days. According to the patient, he did not have test positive for Covid or was in contact with anyone with Covid for the past 2 weeks. He appeared perfectly fine prior to receiving the vaccine. Once the vaccine was given, within about 5 seconds, he said that he was seeing spots, he closed his eyes and made sounds that were similar to snoring. His neck was completely down on his right side and he almost fell off his chair. I held him so he would not fall off the chair and called for help.  A few of the co-workers came to hold him. He was non responsive and my co-workers helped to put his legs on the chair. At point, I gave him an epipen. Once the epipen was given, he opened his eyes in about few seconds and became responsive. The nurses came and took over at this point.  I stayed with him and the nurses for a few minutes. The patient was fully responsive and talking by the time I left the nurses and the patient. 911 was activated after the first epipen was given.  The patient was then evaluated by EMS and the onsite nurses. The patient was AOx4 with stable vital signs.  The patient had orthostatic vital signs taken and were within normal limits.  The patient demonstrated that he was able to ambulate with no assistance.  The patient signed a refusal for transport to the hospital and was driven home by a colleague.  The patient remains in care of that colleague for monitoring.  The patient was instructed that if he were to begin feeling the previous symptoms that he is to activate 911 and be seen in a hospital.  Patient understood the instructions and went back to his residence.

                                                Fever, fatigue, congestion, sore arm, sore muscles.  The fever started the morning after the shot, and lasted all day. On the second day I woke up with the fever continuing, though the symptoms weren&#39;t as strong, and by 3pm they were gone.  But that evening when getting ready for bed I experienced extreme shaking and chills, and sweated all throughout the night.  On day three I continue to be fatigued, but no fever.

Went to bed at my usual time and woke up at 2:00 am with the chills I could not get warm late that night around 5:00 am I started having joint pain and fatigue with a headache and hot skin. I had taken my temperature and it was 100.7. I tried to wait out symptoms but I seem to bee get worse throughout the morning. Around 10:00 am I was in terrible pain and my body hurt all over. I once again took my temperature and it had gone up to 101.9. I had to call of work because I was so ?out of it?.  I started taking Tylenol ever 4 hrs for my fever and I was trying to hydrate.  My temperature slowly went down but still had body pain. I then started thank ibuprofen to help. Later that night around 9:00 pm my temperature was 99. The next day I called off work for fatigue and body pain. Today my temperature is normal and I?m starting to feel like my self again

Pharmacist called patient on Fri the 12th 5:16p and this was when the patient explained the following: Muscle stiffness on left side &amp; pain down left leg; cranial pain; shoulder stiffness; nasal congestion; some shortness of breath; soreness &amp; fatigue.  Patient called back and said he had partial shortness of breath at 7:34p on the 12th.  On Sat the 13th at 11am, pharmacist called to check on pt; found him quite agitated &amp; saying, &#34;He feels the shot was botched&#34;, noted he had called Janssen to report his issues.  At 4:30pm, pt came to pharmacy, looked fine, arm showed no redness, was more subdued in person than on the phone earlier. He said he was feeling better but was not happy with Janssen and wanted the Moderna 2 series shot because he feels Janssen&#39;s vaccine wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to.

Aches and pains are a discomfort to say the least, but add a tennis ball size swollen mass under your arm pit and you get concerned.  You should have a 24/7 hotline or something or add this to your possible side effects at least.

Very restless, tossing and turning, not tired - very awake (which is unusual).  Next morning, arose at 5am with moderate chills, moderate all over body aches, and moderate headache - very symptomatic of the regular flu.   Felt bad enough to call out of work.  As of this moment, roughly 33 hours later, it seems to be subsiding, but unsure if that&#39;s just the Advil. * Note:  Vaccine is &#34;Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Lot # 1805031 administered.

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

By 8:00 pm his fever started to break and was 102 degrees.  I continued to alternate Acetaminophen and Advil every few hours.  By the morning of 3/13/21 his fever was back to normal.  He was left feeling extremely tired and had a terrific headache. By Monday, March 15 he was feeling much better.

                                                Lightheaded about 5 minutes after injection. Medical team took HR and BP and was normal Took about 20 minutes and light headedness went away  Later that night at around 12:30 am, felt very cold and shivering with severe headache Did not take temperature Had a hard time going back to sleep Got up around 1:00 am to take 800 mg of OTC Advil When walking back up stairs had severe muscle pain in arms and legs Was fine after that Seemed to get better by 2 am No issues next day  About 7-10 days later developed severe frontal headaches/sinus pressure No other symptoms Used Neti Pot with saline solution and did nothing Took OTC allergy meds and Advil and did nothing  Say my primary care Dr and he prescribed Flonase, Singular and Allegra &#43; continue Neti Pot and Advil as needed Not much improvement on this regime after 3-5 days of use  About a week later developed severe pain in bottom right jaw Took OTC Advil and again no improvement Went to Dentist and said not tooth related but probably TMJD Recommend dental appliance to help with grinding  About a few days later after this jaw pain developed, developed sharp stabbing pain in bottom of left knee cap. No recollection of any insult that would cause this  All three of these pain sites were perfectly fine prior to getting J&amp;J vaccine.  No history of pain or injury to these areas prior  All of these incidents to me seem to be inflammatory/immune in nature and could be related to J&amp;J vaccine based upon how I reacted to injection.  Curious if others are seeing the same thing and if so what should be done or how long should this last?

                                                I had Covid in June - and felt the same - fever (not real high - 101), chills, nausea, no energy, headache - lasted from 7pm ish until sometime around 5am woke up sweating and only had slight headache that went away after some fluids - it was not fun at all, but didn&#39;t last too long - I didnt take any Advil until about 2 am, then could sleep. Stayed home Monday because I could, but by noon felt nearly 100%, by 6pm felt 100%.

                                                I had no noticed issues for about 18 hours after the injection Tuesday evening.  Sometime early Wednesday afternoon I began to experience body aches, a low-grade fever, and extreme tiredness.  I slept most of the rest of the day and night and felt better when I woke up Thursday morning, well enough to go about a normal day.  It is now late Thursday afternoon and I am still a little tired and mildly achy with no fever but otherwise much improved.    One other thing to report, initially there was no pain or tenderness to the injection site but that started changing about 24 hours after the injection.  Now about 46 hours after injection the site has a constant noticeable soreness even if I am not moving my arm.

                                                On Friday, March 19 around 9:10am I had seizures - loss of awareness, very pale, shaking (but not quite convulsions). This happened before 25 years ago and is likely unrelated to the vaccine. Expected cold/flu-like symptoms did occur on March 14 and part of March 15 but things have been fine since then. I&#39;ve followed up with my GCP and am scheduling a Neuro appointment for followup.

                                                I just thought I should report two changes I have noticed in my body since being vaccinated, the first being about a dozen small pimples on my forehead, which is weird for me, but were evident for several days that week after the vaccine; and I have been very dizzy when I get up in the  middle of the night to go to the bathroom, bumping into the wall, which is uncommon for me.  I also teach at a community college and I noticed that I get dizzy when I turn to go to the board and sometimes have had to put my hand out to steady myself against the board before writing on it.  Not major disruptions, but strange to me.  I don&#39;t take much in the way of medications, ever.  I might take an aspirin once in a while, but I don&#39;t take any regular meds or have any other health issues.  Just wanted to put this on the record.  Thank you.

By 9a.m. my blood pressure taken at home was 180/110 and started having chest pain on left side.    Went to urgent care where they felt it was a cardiac reaction to vaccine and they sent me to ER.   Underwent EKG and chest xray.   Blood pressure still at same level 180/110 and not going down, migraine still at an 8 out of 10, chest pain still present.    I was given an IV to treat for migraine pain and within a few hours all symptoms had went away.   We started with Urgent Care at about 10a.m. on 4/3/21 and then by the time all was done I was released from the ER at 6:30p.m. on 4/3/21.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination I started to experience chronic exhaustion, leg cramping and pain in my lower back right side, upper right thigh, behind my right knee and down into my right calf. I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

Both heart attacks woke me up from sleep. I went to the emergency room and was hospitalized each time. I suffered chest pain prior to each heart attack but have never suffered chest pain before. I am continuing to suffer from periods of chest pain at rest.

                                                Around 7:00 P.M. on March 12, 2021 approximately 9 hours after receiving the Jansen COVD-19 vaccine in my left arm. I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

                                                Headache, body ache, chills. Lasted from 7pm on Friday, 3-12 to 10am on Saturday, 3-13.  Symptoms faded away after I took a 500mg Tylenol at 9am on Saturday, 3-13.  This is the first time I have ever had an adverse reaction to a shot. I also do not get headaches, like ever, and haven&#39;t had body ache or chills since I had the flu in 2009.

About 10 hours later I started feeling sick.  One of the first things I noticed besides a headache was my heart rate jumped up to over 100 beats per minute (it is normally below 84).  I started getting chills and fever.  It was worse than any flu fever I ever had and I could not sleep.  Worst part was my heart rate would not go down, remaining above 100 but below 110-115 beats per minute.  I considered calling 911 but after looking online decided not to as long as it remained below 120 bpm.  I don&#39;t know my maximum temperature - I did not think to take it until after the peak had passed by 20 minutes or so (was 99.4 at that point - normal temperature runs 97.2 (low 96.8, high 98.2)).  Heart rate finally started to drop around 3:30 am.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Prickly itchy rash appeared on thighs; discomfort waned after ~ 15 min.  Similar rash appeared on arms, legs, &amp; back after showering same day at ~ 5 pm.  Again, discomfort waned after ~20 min.  Rash appeared on thighs again this morning at ~ 7:30 am.  Again, discomfort waned after ~20 min. I have not yet sought medical attention since symptoms have been intermittent rather than persistent since first appearing.

Sat outside in 85 degrees for awhile to try to warm up. About 9pm got in the walk-in shower and sat on bench super hot water. Got out of shower at 9:40pm my skin beet red mostly my chest. Still freezing and body aches. Put on sweatpants and long sleeve t-shirt. Now have A/C off and windows open, 82 degrees outside. My temp taken before I started this form was at 98.7. I ache all over and am freezing. Not shivering though. But have goosebumps on arms under sleeves. I am very uncomfortable. It is now 10:35pm.

He said he was dizzy. He was at this point dizzy, pale, sweating, low heart rate in the 30&#39;s. We put a cold wet rag on the back of his neck and monitored. We gave him some cold water also. Slowly over the next 5-10 minutes his stats got better, color returned, and was not sweating anymore. He did not feel dizzy anymore.  We monitored for an additional 30 minutes. Gave instructions. Sent home with spouse.

BP had gone down some, so they agreed to proceed. After dose, pt was dizzy, sweaty, unresponsive for a short time. Once he was more responsive, we helped him sit on the floor against the wall as he was quite dizzy. We called 911 and pt refused transport to hospital, but was evaluated.

                                                I got the shot at 10 am, then at about 7 pm I got chills and achy.  I layed down and had a hard time getting up.  When I got up at 10:30 to check and see if I had a fever, I measured it at 103.5 F.  I took 2 tylenol at 10:30 and at 130 am my fever was 102.5.  I just thought this was a larger reaction than what is typical, so I thought I would report it.   Additionally, this mass vaccination site had a number of adverse reactions (within 15 minutes of injection), so I thought I should report this to someone.   Disappointingly it is near impossible to talk to anyone on the phone these days to get or give information.  I called the VAERS phone number, but was on hold for 15 minutes and gave up.

                                                After the injection on Friday 03/12 at 1:50 PM at facility, I started to get a slight temperature, Along with chills as well. This continue throughout the weekend. I remained at home and did not have any energy to go out and be around people. The next day, I also got diarrhea and was very dehydrated.  Immediately, after I left the vaccine shot location, like within 5 minutes, I started to smell fish and my mouth tasted like salt for three days. I also had excruciating headaches that did not go away with advil. So I rested a  lot and had no real big appetite what so ever!.  Today, I am concerned that on my left side below my left clavicle, I feel a big bump what appears to be possibly a lymphatic swelling of node? I am concerned because I did not have this swelling before and do not know if it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine.  Pls contact me via phone, this is urgent.  Thanks

                                                First 4 hours post injection no serious side effects, slight headache was settling in.  At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after the injection, while sitting down, I felt light headed, sweating, weak, face turned white. I was close to passing out but didn&#39;t. I requested attention after about 10 minutes. While being treated by medics they mentioned color had returned to my face. I felt better enough so I refused to go to hospital and was driven home. Later that morning, 03/08/2021 about 10 AM, I developed a fever and body aches with sharp pains thru out my body and joints. First temperature check was 100.5. My fever, pains/weakness increased thru out that day and overnight with chills. Highest temp check was 102.8 that evening prior to bedtime. I don&#39;t know if it could have been higher at some point overnight. It felt like I had a moderate to bad case of the FLU. The next morning, 03/09/2021 the fever broke down to about 101. By 03/11/2021, aside from a little residual weakness I felt more like myself. However, as of the writing of this report my temp seems to fluctuate between normal and 99.8. Will report this to my Doctor on next visit. Worth noting that I haven&#39;t had any Flu like symptoms to that degree in many years.

Sometime later very had high fever that lasted for hours and was accompanied by high heart rate and aches. After I had cooled a bit I took my temperature--103. Heart rate over 100, maybe up to 120 my resting pulse is typically in the l 50s )Suspect fever at peak was over 104. Fever and elevated heart rate lasted for hours. . At 2:30 AM took 3 ibuprofen, returned to bed and drifted off. An hour or two later woke up completely drenched and dripping with sweat but no longer feverish. Drifted back to sleep. By 9 AM felt almost normal, but (not surprisingly) a bit wrung out.

This lasted for about 10-15 minutes.  Next day very mild flu symptoms and lack of energy--this continued through the following day but milder.

Intense muscle aches were later (approx 6-8 hrs after shot) along with overall fatigue.  A medium grade headache began 8-10 hrs after shot and continued throughout night - lowering to a slight headache within 24 hrs after shot.  Headache ended 28-30 hrs after shot.  Developed a post nasal drip and mild congestion in sinuses about 1.5 days after shot (and continues).  Numbness in toes appears to have returned with some stiffness felt in my calf muscles.

Then, without warning, I passed out, while driving on the freeway. Fortunately, I did not hit anyone, or was hit by anyone, and must have bounced off guardrails after crossing traffic twice and going off the freeway into the middle of an off ramp, where I finally came to. I did not suffer any injuries in the accident.
