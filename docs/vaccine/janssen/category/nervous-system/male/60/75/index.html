                                                I had a residual cough when I had the vaccine. Up to a week after vaccine, I had low grade fever and chills; night sweating and coughing seemed to be getting worse and coughing getting more frequent and worse (when it had been dry and occasional). It was ongoing for a week. I called my Doctor during that time and she prescribed me medications including an antibiotic and cold medications for the cough. The medications helped symptoms after I&#39;d been on them awhile . I no longer have the fever and I stopped the night sweating. Cough seems to be improved.

Additional information: Pt here alone. Pt reports that 3-4 weeks ago he awoke with neck, right shoulder and arm pain. States he can&#39;t turn his head, raise his right arm due to pain. Taking 800mg of ibuprofen and it is not helping. States &#34;it just dawned on me, I had the J/J vaccine 3days prior&#34; Per pt and it was given in. right arm. Not sleeping well. Feels it is triggering his reflex sympathetic dystrophy.

The first afternoon I felt a bit feverish with chills and took a couple Tylenol which removed the feverish feeling but not the fatigue.  The second night I had full body trembles on and off for about an hour - not strong enough to disturb my wife who was sleeping in the same bed.  I felt much better Friday morning but there is a little lingering fatigue.

Today, April 17th, I believe they did a cat scan of his lungs to check for blood clots and I am not sure of the results.

                                                10 days after the shot, my blood pressure rose to 198/112 and my pulse went to 161. and i called 911 and went to hospital.  i had a severe headache for 3 days leading up to calling 911. finally on the April 1st, i went to hospital. i had a lump on my right shoulder never there before and i felt like the lump was causing my right side of my face to be numb.  The hospital refused to believe me that i had some blood clot, they downplay the incident and instead gave me a brain CT SACN and brain  MRA which was negative, they kept me for observation overnight and let me go noon the next day.  since i have had follow ups with my regular doctor, a cardiologist and my nephrologist.  I know that reaction was due to medication, either way glad i got the shot.  BUT Since this time, I am retaining water, i know this because my rings do not fit anymore, rings i had for 20 years, never ever once had a hard time to put on or remove. I know my body, thats not the worse of it. i test my blood pressure every day at requesting of my kidney doctor,   since the incudent of my pressure 198/112 my diastolic on average is raised  20 points.  I log this daily.  here are some examples from before the medication  111/67 ,  109/63 ,   129/64 , 105/62 120/81.   now my pressure is totally different for example, 155/88  150/91  157/90 ,  134/88.  nothing else changed in my life, I am exactly the same as before only now i have covid shot..  yesterday i saw the 4th doctor since i am shot up and she gave me a new pill  olmesartan medoxomil,  only on it one day but my diastolic pressure is still much higher than before.  i dont want to die, i dont want a stroke, or a heart attach, i have a lot to live for still.  nobody is helping me, doctors are just throwing pills at me and not treating root cause which i feel strongly to beleive it is from covid shot.

That helped   36 hours later my throught 1/2 of it, got very sore, like pins sticking inti it like a tonselitious maybe. Same time my mid/right side back started to hurt. Thought it might be gastral. Continious to this day and wordened up until today. Maybe Kidneys? or?? I was thinking again was gastral, but now I know it is not. Same pain when pressure put on it by bending, sitting in my truck against seats etc... Now I am worried. NEVEER had something like this other than a Gal Blagger which was removed.

I saw a specialist about three weeks ago and I&#39;m not bad enough to have COPD but close. Treatments with inhalers with steroids and I have been on those for two weeks. I started feeling pain in back of my left leg. I thought it was a blood clot and went to ER but it wasn&#39;t a blood clot. No treatment for that. I still feel the pain occasionally at this time. I have been taking Tylenol for it.

He got light headed and started to pass out.  A pharmacy technician was able to get to him in time and guide him to the ground. He was unresponsive for 10-30 seconds.

I went back into the clinic where I  received the injection and was checked by EMT&#39;s.  I was experiencing chest pain and  my  bloodpressure was extremely high (195/125) An EKG was done which showed irregularities and I was given Baby Asprin and Nitrogylicern.  I was then transported by ambulance to  Hospital and kept overnight.  Several Tests were conducted including EKG&#39;s, Ultrasound, Nuclear stress test, and Enzyme Test to determine if I had a heart attack.  In the end, all tests were negative and I was released from the hospital the following evening (8:00 pm).    I was extremely fatigued and weak for the next two weeks and eventually recovered.  The chest pain was determined to be a pulled chest muscle wwas exacerbated by the high blood pressure.

                                                On four separate occaisions, for as long as 15 minutes, my left hand became paralyzed.  This is the same arm as my shot.  The first time I called my PCP and we discussed it and she said if it happens again to let her know.  A week later, my hand became paralyzed again.   I called my HCP and they told me to go to the nearest emergency room.  I explained the relationship between the shot and the paralyzation to the health care company, my PCP, the er attendant, and the nurse practitioner.  When I was released after an hour in the ER, they hospital said they had no idea what was happening.  I asked if they would report it to the CDC.  They said anything flagged as covid related was to be sent to you.  I was not reassured that they cared about Covid or vaccine related causes.  I have the feeling that they checked me for a stroke and sent me on my merry way.  When I arrived at my ultimate trip destination, one of my clients told me she had her non-shot arm paralyze two years ago from the flu vaccine.

                                                For the first time ever, I had what I determined (based on internet searching) to be an ocular migraine.  My vision was distorted in both eyes, although the distortion was stronger when looking to the left.  There was a circular area that was fuzzy and a bit wavy like looking through water.  The circular distortion area seemed to be outlined by a ring of brighter light. No flashes or floaters.  I did not have a migraine headache then or afterwards; I&#39;ve never had a migraine headache.  I followed the on-line advise and laid down and did try to use my eyes for about an hours.  The distortion faded within an hour or two; it has not recurred.  I did not connect it to the vaccine as a potential source at that time.

                                                Within one day following the vaccine, I experienced 24 hours of the same symptoms I had when I contracted covid-19 in November 2020.  Since then I&#39;ve had muscle and joint pain that is not normal for me.  I&#39;ve also had occasional chills and a general feeling of weakness.  This has been for 3 weeks now.

It took a full month for the pain to stop - especially if pressed on. After two weeks, the pain in the arm migrated to the central right back. I could sleep on my right side only. Lasted about two days and then subsided. About a week or so after that, I was getting a throbbing pain on my left calf. That lasted a couple of days where it would intermittently start throbbing. I called the doctor. When I went in the symptoms has subsided but the doctor  (on April 13) said to do an ultrasound if it returns. It didn&#39;t return so I have not had an ultrasound.

                                                After my vaccine, I experienced redness sensation to my arm. My left arm was swollen and raised bump with a rash. I called my doctor and he thought it was possible cellulitis. He prescribed Prednisone and an antibiotic for seven days. After the seven days my rash was gone but I still had the raised bump. I went to an urgent care facility where they performed an ultrasound of left upper extremity and no blood clot was found. I was told to apply warm compresses to my left arm once a day. To this day I still have an aching sensation to my left arm and is also sore and my left arm is still red but flat in shape.

                                                For the first two weeks, there was only mild headache and fatigue.  But on day 12 (or 13) following the shot, my husband had severe abdominal pain and black, tarry poop.  He passed out on the toilet in the middle of the night and hit his head, woke up in a puddle of blood (from hitting his head) . He was severely lightheaded, short of breath, could not walk.  He had to crawl back to bed.  He continued to have severe  lightheadedness, shortness of breath, muscle aches, abdominal pain, and also ringing in his ears.  He called me early Saturday morning and told me what happened and that he called out from work.  (We do not live together. He is 280 miles away because of his job.) That man has called out sick only one time since I&#39;ve met him in 1998; so when he told me he did not go to work, I knew it had to be really bad.  I drove up there ASAP the same day, and I took the pulse oximeter with me.  His oxygen levels were all over the place.  They were usually better (like high 70s to low 80s) while he was lying down.  When he would sit up or stand up, the number would plummet, reading so low I thought he was going to die. One time his finger was so cold that it took me 4 tries to get a reading.  It read at 55, but I realize that might be because his finger was too cold.

                                                Almost immediately after patient sat down in observation chair after vaccine administration, he stated he was feeling extremely dizzy and light-headed. He also became extremely sweaty and cold/clammy to the touch. Took his blood pressure and it was 80/56 mmHg. HR was 49 bpm. Grabbed him some cool cloths to apply to his face/head/neck. He stated he was extremely anxious about the vaccine as he has an extremely phobia of needles &amp; thought this may have contributed to the event, but was not sure. After a few minutes, he began to feel better. He stopped sweating, skin warmed up and he was no longer dizzy or light headed. By the time his 15 minutes were up, he was back to normal again.

Patient then fainted in his chair and was initially non-responsive to the nurse. At this time I called 911. The nurse administered a single epi pen in patient&#39;s quad and he woke up. The nurse then took patient&#39;s vitals at 1138: BP - 109/73; P-84; SPO2-99%; T-97.4; R-16. Patient stating he was still feeling dizzy and fatigued. The paramedics arrived and took patient to hospital for continued evaluation. I called patient later in the afternoon and he had already been discharged and was at home resting and feeling better.

We went to healthcare facility at 4:30pm.  He was diagnosed with Acute Pancreatitis.  He was sent home at 10:30pm    We went back to ED at 1:30 am Thursday.  He was admitted during the day.  In the early morning of Friday May 28th his blood pressure tanked and he became unresponsive.  His heart stopped and they did compressions for 8-9 minutes.  He was put into ICU.  By 3am we were told he may not survive.  By 5 am we were told his organs were shutting down.  He passed around 7:45am.  In researching the vaccine we discovered the SARS virus used in vaccine can attack the pancreas.  We believe he died as a result of the reaction to the vaccine and his body and organs could not fight.

Intermittent fatigue for the next few weeks. On 5-11-2021 another bout of flu like symptoms that lasted 2 days. Started having severe back spasms randomly for the next 2 1/2 weeks. On 5-30-2021 the back spasms became so severe and painful I was rushed to the ER. The first diagnosis I received was a Plural Effusion caused by a bacterial infection that later turned into Pneumonia, requiring a chest tube  in my right lung, and a 10 day hospital stay. Before I was hospitalized I had no fever, no cough, no shortness of breath.

No difficulty breathing/swallow, thus gave water and gatorade. He was responsive to my questions. He has history of anxiety to needles and he did not eat lunch before vaccine. He stayed seated for 1 hour to monitor. Then, walked an aisle before driving home. Asked him to eat first before driving home. Called him twice and he is home and feeling okay. Counseled to call pharmacy if any symptoms of allergic reaction to vaccine.

                                                On Monday March 8th I went to the Pharmacy to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine under the new 1b guidelines. I am a 62 year old white male with type 1 diabetes, insulin dependent for the past 49 years. I filled out the question form I was presented by the staff and then was given a dose of the J&amp;J vaccine. This vaccine was administered at approx. 1:30 p.m. I was asked to wait 15 minutes to see if I had and acute reaction, following none, I was told I could leave. There rest of the day I was fine. I went to bed at 11:00 p.m. and within 15 minutes I was cold, shaking and sick on my stomach. I took my temp and it was 100.2 F My O2 sat was 95% and heart rate was 120 with feelings of palpitations from time to time. I went to the bathroom and stayed there the rest of the night with frequent vomiting and loose stool. Stomach cramps all night long. Several BGL were taken and even with an insulin pump I was not able to lower my 299 level for over the next 24 hours of repeated bolus. I was finally able to stop dry heaves and fall asleep for moments at a time around 5:00 a.m. My temp finally broke around 11:00 a.m. the next day Tuesday. I had a headache this entire time. I called hospital ( Ask a Nurse ) on Tuesday morning around 8:00 a.m.and enquired about side effects for this vaccine and effects on a type 1, they basically told me to go to the ER or Clinic and be seen by a Physician. I choose not to do either, but to monitor myself and see how the rest of the day went. The first time, other than a headache and complete body soreness my vitals and BGL, were WNL,  was late Tuesday evening around 7:00 p.m. This was a horrible set of side effects. Onset was within 11 hours from injection. No warning for type 1 people to be careful for the possibilities of increased BGL. Today is Wednesday March 10th, and my vitals have remained WNL, but I still have a mild headache and body soreness, some maybe from the vaccine but I believe mostly from the throwing up. Today is March 11th, my vitals are still WNL and BGL is in target. BGL control is responsive to pump therapy now. The past 2 nights I have awoken in a cold soaking sweat that cannot be tied to a low BGL. My body is somewhat still soreness.

Legs intermittently felt numb and at time with &#34;pins and needles&#34; tingling. Knee joints felt as if in danger of flexing backwards. Arms were similarly affected but not as drastically as legs. Arms had better function and control than legs but with marked weakness.  Day 2: Some improvement. Able to go to work but still have fatigue and leg weakness persist. It takes additional mental and physical effort to walk. Walking does not feel automatic or safe like it was before. Still have high level of fatigue. Symptoms improve  some later in the afternoon.

As the evening wore on, weakness spread through the left side of body and speech began slurring. The next day, after no improvement, went to hospital to find from CT scan that he had suffered a stroke. He had no precursors that would lead to being prone to strokes.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine   Woke middle of the night very cold under heavy covers, Hard to walk the next day, had some of the same symptoms I had when I had covid in November.  I can&#39;t find the lingering side effect mentioned and why I am sending this: A month later my legs feel like they are in ice water, everything else went away after 3 days.  At the touch they feel normal, this is all day everyday.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on March 13.  By the next weekend, I had what I thought was a spider bite on the inside of my left thigh.  That &#34;bite&#34; got worse--bigger, hot to the touch, and then red.  On the weekend of the 27-28 of March, it was red, raised and very painful even when not touched.     I called my family doctor on Monday morning, the 29th of March, and I was sent to the Emergency Room, where I was diagnosed with a 7cm thrombosis in my left greater saphenous vein, which is treated the same as a DVT.    I was treated first with Lovenox injections, then Eliquis 10 mg 2x daily, now 5 mg 2x daily.    The blood clot is still painful to the touch.

                                                Patient received the Janssen vaccine on 3/17/21 at 4:42 pm. Beginning at 2:30 am on 3/18/21 the patient began to experience dizziness, vertigo, shaking, tremors, nausea, and vomiting. The shaking and tremors occurs all over but is most significant in the hands and arms leaving the patient unable to do simple daily tasks or return to work.  These symptoms began 3/17 and have persisted every day since in varying severity. Sometimes the tremors last for more than 20 minutes straight. The patient was seen in the emergency department on 3/26/21 but the hospital notes are unavailable to the pharmacy at this time. Per patient, he had an MRI and no other tests and was given a prescription for ondansetron for nausea and discharged. The patient believes he was not adequately assessed and is still suffering from symptoms. He has a follow up with a primary physician 5/28/21 which is the soonest he was able to be referred.

Persistent muscle cramping is experienced with the calf muscles of both legs.  A routine of stretching and daily mile walk before and after vaccination has not eliminated the pain.

                                                I woke up three days after the shot with a headache. I was running and I got a sharp pain in my hamstring muscle in my right leg. I had to stop running and the leg pain persisted for two days. I went and saw my doctor and my tests were normal. The headache lasted for several days and was dull at first and then concentrated at the back of my head. The leg pain was present for a couple of days. All of the symptoms are gone after two weeks. I still haven&#39;t returned to running daily as I normally do.

                                                Patient states he received J&amp;J vaccine on 4/1; on 4/10 he had nonradiating persistent low back pain. A few days after that (on 4/13) he felt numbness and pain in his legs, in addition to ?decreased sensation in his inner thighs. These sensations were migratory and intermittent. Also noted in his upper extremities as well. He also had issues with temperature sensation in his lower extremities. On 4/14 he had slight haziness in vision while driving which resolved after 30-60min and has not recurred. He also had slight difficulty walking. On 4/15 he had an appointment with his PMD; had L-spine XR which revealed moderate lower lumbar facet arthritis, and was thought that change in sensation was likely d/t radiculopathy - was prescribed ibuprofen, muscle relaxant, oxycodone (took oxy x1, ibuprofen for a few days). Since then he has also had intermittent stabbing pains in various parts of his body which resolved spontaneously. On 4/17-4/18 his back pain resolved. On 4/18 at 4:30am he woke up with R-sided facial weakness. He has not had focal weakness aside from the face.  Was seen in ED that morning for this R-sided facial droop involving the forehead, diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy and given prednisone/valacyclovir. Yesterday 4/19 around mid-day he started having L-sided facial weakness and slurred speech. This has progressed since yesterday. Reports ability to swallow, though a little difficult d/t cheek weakness. Low back pain has returned as well. Does report constipation and possible poor bladder emptying for the last few days.  He was seen by a Doctor and referred to ED to rule out AIDP and other diseases after J&amp;J vaccine.

He then on the 9th day had extreme intercostal pain in the ribs on the right side and his right shoulder extremely painful, low grade fever, chills, fatigue and inability to draw a full breath.  He called the doctor and they were on the way to the clinic they told him to go to the ER based on his symptoms.  He went to the ER and they admitted him and did blood work, and then did a chest x-ray, then a chest CT scan and it was positive for pulmonary embolism.  He was treated with an anti-inflammatory through the IV and a blood thinner to the stomach.  He was hospitalized for 1 full day, and discharged home with Eliquis double dose for 14 days and then a single dose until further notice.    He is still having fatigue and aches on the right side of his brain and aches in his feet, but is to see a pulmonologist for his lungs, as it will take up to 6 months for it to resolve.  He also has damage to the right side of the heart and lung.  Is waiting to get a CT of the brain.

It felt like every time I would massage the cramps out of my legs, an hour later the muscle tightness/pain would come back. It was interrupting my sleep. I also experienced knee and hip pain along with the tightness in my legs. I also experienced some brain fog on and off for about 3 weeks. I visited my PCP on 05/19, but by 05/17 my symptoms had improved. On 05/18 my pain/tightness had gone away completely. I had to do vigorous stretches and I took 4 tablets of 200mg per day for a couple days.

According to his wife, he started to feel weak on Sunday 5/30/2021. She said his hands were cold that day too, then by Tuesday his fingers turned white, this is when she took him to the hospital and found out about the blood clot. His wife also mentioned that after examination, they found out that he has an extra rib that was pressing on the brachial artery and that might have caused the blood clot. It doesn&#39;t seem to be sure that the blood clot was caused by the covid vaccine or not

Lumbar puncture had high protein levels. Neurology consulted and think process is either cervical myelomalacia or cervical transverse myelitis/vaccine associated inflammation.  Patient had never had a problem like this before.  He was given high dose Solumedrol X 2 days and sent home on a prednisone taper.  His numbness and weakness had improved at time of discharge from the Hospital on May 18, 2021.  However, I see he has been readmitted to the Hospital on May 27, 2021 with similar symptoms.

                                                Slept badly 9-Jul-2021. Woke up with strong flu-like symptoms - fuzzy headed, ears hot (probably fever, but thermometer broken), total lack of energy. Did not make it out of bed beyond bathroom visits and light snacks 9-Jul-2021 or 10-Jul-2021. More energy Monday 11-Jul-2021 and was able to work a few hours. I then noticed a lump on lower left neck jaw that looks like mumps, which I had as a child, and pox all over my body that look like chicken pox, which I also had as a child. I believe mumps/chicken pox symptoms began earlier, probably before the flu-like symptoms, but they were not yet severe and I did not carefully note them. Chicken pox has gotten worse through 11-12-Jul-2021 with over 100 pox, particularly bad on knees and elbows with about 70 in those areas alone. Prior to vaccination, I had taken only 1 sick day in over 20 years. I just don&#39;t get sick beyond minor cold-like symptoms.

                                                I started feeling mildly shaky sometime between 10:16 PM and 10:32 PM.  I am a diabetic, so I took a blood glucose reading to determine if my blood glucose levels were low (which can cause mild shakiness).  They were not (reading was 172 mg/dL), but by the time I took that reading at 10:32 my shakiness had increased from onset, and I was so shaky at 10:35 PM that I was not sure if I could take my bedtime injection of Levemir safely.  I was only able to do so by injecting myself and then letting the insulin rest on the palm of my hand (rather than hold it firmly as I usually do).  Although the shakiness began to subside several minutes later, I was unable to fully control my toothbrush in my mouth when brushing my teeth.  I then got in bed, and the shakiness was gone by around 11:00 PM (I didn&#39;t record the exact time).

Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

                                                I started getting a headache about an hour along with pain in the back of my neck and a mild headache after my shot (maybe an hour or so).  Around 1100 hours, about the time I got back from the Facility, I began to feel a tightness in my throat and got a little raspy.  When I drank water and ate a little, it hurt similar a hangover as if dehydrated, but went away after a minute or so. About 1400 hours began to develop chills, causing me to get into bed, and then the chills, overall muscular pains, very tired, moderate headache and some nausea ensued as well along with an initial low grade fever.    Fever went up to 102.1 degrees and had fever till about 2130 hours and broken only after I took two (1) Tylenols. Still had a very low grade fever till about 2300 hours or so (99-100), but finally went away.    I awoke next day (13 APR) about 0800 feeling a bit better, but with a moderate headache and touch of diarrhea.  Headache lasted all day.  This prompted me to contact my treatment facility and a telecall was conducted giving them my symptoms.  They recommended Rizatriptan should my headache continue and Tylenol not enough to relieve.  I cannot take any analgesics due to my liver disease and Thrombocytopenia.  Finally  my headache went away (with a slight hint it might come back), but no more fever, chills etc.    On 14 APR, no more headache but still felt a little tired.  From 15 APR through today (16 APR), no further symptoms and feel great, but prepared to report anything that may develop laer.

I returned his call and he verbalized all issues above and also said his legs, arms and hands were cramping up and having ringing in the ears.  I recommended him to go to the ER now, he said he had called his PCP and was told the same thing.  He stated he is single and lives alone and does not drive.  I told him to call 911 and he verbalized he is too embarrassed to do that and states he will wait for his daughter to call him.  I offered to call his daughter for him and he declined.   Addendum: Created by RN. 04/16/2021 02:01 PM 04/16/2021 Client called reporting the same symptoms as in 4/13 message -- I told him to go to the ER immediately. He stated he could not drive due to muscle spasms and feet and leg pain. Asked if he would please call 911 and stated that was not necessary. He verbalized he understood my directions and stated he would go to urgent Care. Called Sheriff office to make a well person check.

The following day I began seeing swelling, redness, itching and burning of extremities (mainly the hands, but also feet, ears, face). These symptoms seem to be triggered by the slightest exertions, but have also exhibited without physical activity. These appear to be getting more prevalent each day.

                                                I started feeling kind of puny and sat down for supper - no taste or smell. After that I felt cold symptoms - and I had no energy whatsoever. I talked to the Dr online and he told me take Zinc Sulfate and Hydroxychloroquine; nebulized a medication but I can&#39;t remember what it was. I got pretty sick for about three days. I got to the point that I was so weak I could hardly move. I went to  ER and was there for 1/2 day. They gave me IV fluids. They said that my lungs still sounded good The illness ran it&#39;s course of about 10 days. I still feel winded two months later.  I have a little nagging cough yet. I can still go to work though.

                                                Four days after the vaccine I felt a little chest tightness but the next day it was very scary like a weight on my chest. I also had a cough that was an uncontrollable tickle and then I had trouble catching my breath. I went to the Urgent Care they just thought I had Acid Reflux.. Seven days after my cough was worse and I was very short of breath and I had very bad night sweats. I went to the doctor he gave me Asthma medicine. Two weeks after the vaccine I went back to the Urgent care and they thought Bronchitis. I went back to the ER and I saw a Covid-19 doctor and he thought I had Covid-19 symptoms. He gave me Prednisone and Azithromycin. I took the Prednisone for ten days and I finally started to feel better. I was trying to chew some fresh ginger helped the cough. I have a Heart Echo scheduled next week and I am still a little short of breath. Before the shot I used to walk two or three miles a day and go fishing every day but I can?t do that right now. At least I am back to 80% now which is better.

His heart rate was in the 180-190s beats per minute, but it was bouncing all over (for example 120, 90, then 190s beats per minute.) Heart rate would bounce around within seconds of each other. He was transferred into hospital and admitted to hospital on 11-MAY-2021 at 22:00 until 12-MAY-2021 at around 17:00. The patient was hospitalized for two days also was put on medications (blood thinner, beta blocker and another medication) while in hospital.

On 12-MAY-2021, while in hospital heart rate stabilized to around 74 beats per minute. If he moved around at all heart rate went back into the 90s beats per minute. He told that this never happened to him before. On 13-MAY-2021, the patient reported that heart rate high around 80s to 90s beats per minute while resting and over 100 beats per minute when moves around. On MAY-2021, the last 7-10 days he started feeling fatigued, like fighting some kind of cold or flu (but didn&#39;t have either) and chest congestion, voice was not normal.

Laboratory data included: COVID-19 virus test (NR: not provided) negative (units unspecified), and Heart rate (NR: not provided) 190s beats per minute. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: metoprolol tartrate(Lopressor), and apixaban (Eliquis). The action taken with Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of heart rate increased, felt like fighting cold or flu, respiratory tract congestion and voice not normal, fatigue and heart rate unstable was not reported.

                                                I didn&#39;t have anything for two weeks. But then a lot of pain in arm. from a sound sleep. I took ibuprofen. Over the next few  hours,   the pain radiated down my left arm. Wave would come and go (of pain). The pain came on to my chest - and I decided to go get check.  Had very low energy for about four days - after that. My left arm, I lost the strength in it - I could barely lift 10 lbs over my head. Swimming - I couldn&#39;t pull my arm with my elbow high - I could barely skim the top of the water. This is still happening.  I had a doctor appt - yesterday but that was for arthritis pain that is in my knees, wrists etc - he gave me arthritis medication and I noticed the positive affects of it already. But it didn&#39;t address the arm that I can&#39;t pull up over my head. It seems like my immune system is attacking me- a couple of years ago this happened when I had a virus and it took me almost a year to get that muscle to start working again.

Including the ear which is actually the worst part. It hurts. I went to the doctor on 6/11/2021 and was given  steroids for a week. It helped with the ache in my neck and ear but once I was off the steroids all that came back. They didn&#39;t help with my face. Bells Palsy takes months to heal - so I didn&#39;t notice any healing on face. Ibuprofen and Tylenol OTC for pain is what I&#39;m currently taking.

After speaking, his eyes then went closed, and he clenched his fists and he started coughing up liquid. He was not responsive. He was moved to the ground and turned on his side. He became alert about 3 minutes after becoming unresponsive. He claimed this happens to him when he is at doctor&#39;s offices or receiving vaccines/procedures. He claimed it was &#34;normal.&#34; He said he felt fine/normal, and this has happened in the past, though he did not mention this to the pharmacist prior to administration. 911 was called and examined him. He was allowed to go home on his own, did not go to the hospital.

                                                At 5:05 am on April 11, approx. 37 hours after I received the shot, I awakened to a rapid muscle convulsion in my left shoulder muscle, at the approximate location of the injection. I counted between 2 to 6 contractions per second (yes, it was a very quick twitch that involved my whole upper arm). It went on for at least 10 minutes, then paused for less than a minute and then resumed. This was a pronounced muscle spasm which I cannot remember having before. I have had twitching eyelids or facial muscle that would twitch for a few minutes in the past, but this went on for over 30 minutes, and I am not sure it is done. Also, this was much more intense than the above-referenced twitches. The location and time relative to my shot makes me fairly certain that this is an effect of the vaccine. I have not exercised or done anything to cause this to my knowledge. Of course, this seems like a harmless side effect, but my concern is that my heart muscle reacting to this in a similar fashion could be more serious.

                                                Patient received his J&amp;J vaccine for COVID-19 on 03/10/2021.  On 3/17, he was at the grocery store when he felt a sting on his left lateral ankle. When he pulled up his pant leg, he saw the small little red spots that were exquisitely tender. He went immediately to his primary care physician&#39;s office, where he was prescribed Bactrim for suspected cellulitis. The rash steadily worsened with extension up his left leg and onto his right leg and blistering of some of the lesions most markedly in his groin. Pain associated with the rash increased and remained most severe on the lateral aspect of the left ankle. He presented back to his primary care physician&#39;s office on 3/19, where he was given methylprednisolone 80 milligrams IV, discharged with a prescription for prednisone 60 milligrams daily for the next few days. Pain worsened the morning of 3/20/21 to the point that he was unable to bear much weight on the left leg prompting his presentation to the emergency department.

That never has happened before.  on 4/7/2021, at approximately 1:00 pm, I stood up, got light headed and blacked out for a few seconds.  I took my blood pressure and it was in the normal range.    I didn&#39;t think much of this until the recent reports on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine started circulating. I&#39;ve had no other issues.

After 10 days I experienced severe pain at the site of injection, very small red spot appeared around injection site. Pain was so severe, I took one capsule hydrocodone 5-325 TB at 2 AM. The medication did not cure the pain, and I slept less than two hours. I called my nurse practitioner&#39;s office, and they offered an appoint late in the morning. And I couldn&#39;t wait that long so I drove to urgent care. Prompt care examined and saw no swelling, ruling out possible blood clot. Prompt care did not have ultra sound. They told me to use ice, heat, and pain medication. Extreme pain continued for about three more days, pain medication did very little to help. Unable to speak directly to the Nurse Practitioner on the phone, due to my disability and alexia, communicating online is very difficult without an assistant present. The pain slowly subsided over the next week.

                                                4/25/2021 - He was apparently well until 2 days prior to admission when he developed spontaneous left calf pain and swelling.  He denies any associated trauma, recent travel and immobility.  He is not taking any new prescription, including steroids. One day prior to admission, he started experiencing left-sided pleuritic chest pain up to 9/10 in intensity and exertional shortness of breath.  He denies any fevers, hemoptysis, sputum production, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness or lightheadedness.  The pain was persistent throughout the day.  Today, his chest pain persisted and his shortness of breath had progressed.  He also noted left arm swelling with mild discomfort.  He felt that his left leg swelling and pain had improved today.  Nevertheless, given persistent symptoms, he decided to come to the emergency room for further evaluation management.   In the emergency room, his initial blood pressure was 218/104 with mild tachycardia of 99, normal oxygen saturation and no fevers.  CBC showed a white count of 12.35, hematocrit of 50.4 and normal platelet count 198.  INR was normal at 1.06.  BMP showed mild hyperglycemia at 148.  Troponin was 5 and BNP was 8.  Imaging studies show extensive left upper extremity DVTs that involved the left subclavian vein, left lower extremity DVTs and bilateral lower lobe pulmonary emboli.   4/30/2021 Presumed unprovoked extensive DVT of the left upper extremity and left lower extremity.  However, he did recently receive Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine.  Now status post catheter directed thrombolysis to the left upper extremity.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included pollen allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported. 1 total, administered on 16-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination on left arm. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin and lisinopril; both for unknown indication.  On 07-APR-2021, the patient experienced cerebral venous thrombosis, hypoaesthesia, and visual impairment. The patient had cerebrovascular thrombus with partial loss of sight and numbness of his left arm.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from cerebral venous thrombosis, hypoaesthesia, visual impairment. This report was serious (Disability Or Permanent Damage).  This case version (1) was created on 30-APR-2021 for the purpose of quality improvement the following corrections were made. The MAC was added for the pharmacovigilance narrative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V1: This spontaneous report was received from a health care professional via VAERS (ID: 1207958) and concerned a 64-year-old male of unspecified race and ethnicity who experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) 22 days after vaccine. Concurrent conditions included pollen allergy and concomitant medications included atorvastatin and lisinopril. Twenty-two days after vaccine, the patient experienced CVST, hypoaesthesia, and visual impairment. The patient had cerebrovascular thrombus with partial loss of sight and numbness of his left arm. Specific imaging and laboratory results, including platelet count, were not reported. Information is limited in this case, and the occurrence of CVST could represent background incidence of such events in the general population. The platelet count is not reported and thus this case does not meet the Brighton Collaboration (BC) definition for Thrombocytopenia Thrombosis Syndrome (TTS) with BC Level 5 (not a case of TTS.)

                                                April 20, 2021. PT needed to use the restroom.  We stopped, he walked to the restroom, I went to the gift shop. Upon returning, I saw PT sitting on a bench. He was leaning to his left, could not see out of his left eye, very unstable when sitting. We missed lunch, so we thought it was his sugar dropping. I started to feed him jam and a chocolate bar. After 2 hours, his vision returned &amp; he seemed better. He drove us back to the rental cabin. He rested the next 2 days.  Then on Friday, we packed up our vehicle and Pt drove us back home. After arriving home, Pt&#39;s condition got worse. We went to the Dr, explained the events of the previous week &amp; she came to the same conclusion, Diabetes spell. His condition continued to worsen, we went back to Dr several times, the ER 2 times and finally we got into see a Neurologist. That appointment, the doctor said he thought stroke. Dr scheduled a MRI for June 1, 2021. Results of that MRI was a definite stroke. Now he has started outpatient rehab with no promise he will ever regain full mobility. He can no longer drive, mow grass, walk without a cane and help, etc. Life has changed dramatically for both of us.

                                                I had no symptoms until the next morning when I woke up with very extreme pain in my left arm with the epicenter of the pain on the back of my left hand between the bones leading to the ring finger and the pinky. Whenever my hand was below my heart, the entire hand was dark purple in color. I had read that severe reactions from the shot generally dissipated in a day so I took some Hydrocodone which I had for migraines, kept my hand elevated, and decided to wait it out. The next day the pain was still extreme so I went to urgent care. Urgent care eventually said I needed to go to the emergency room to have an ultra-sound. I did so. After many hours of waiting, they got me into the ultrasound room where they told me they cannot ultrasound the back of the hand because the vessels are too small and don?t show up. So they ran an ultrasound on the shoulder and front of the arm and found nothing. I?m not surprised as that is not where the pain was coming from. I went home and alternately put my left hand in ice water and hot water periodically, which eventually reduced the pain to a tolerable amount. As of today, all the pain is gone except for the region mentioned in the back of the hand. That still hurts, so I&#39;m answering item 20 with a No.

He stated he felt like the vaccination was given to high and he took a picture of where the nurse placed the band-aid. Director verified if band-aid was the actual place of injection the vaccine was given to high and could have caused SIRVA. Pt stated his shoulder was fine after injection and it was over two weeks post injection that he started to feel shoulder pain.  On  6/10/21 pt stopped by vaccination clinic and informed staff his pain was worse and was now causing pain down his arm to his wrist. Nurse informed pt to see his physician.

                                                Approximately 2 weeks after being vaccinated, I started having joint pain and stiffness throughout my body. It continues to bother me.  It is especially noticeable in the morning after rising from bed, or after sitting for a long period of time.  After pushing through the pain into normal activities, the pain lessens, but afterwards, the pain returns. I especially notice numbness and stiffness in my calves and feet after waking in the morning.  I do not feel pain while not moving.  Only when I attempt to move. My range of motion has been decreased because of the pain.  I am normally an active person.Taking Ibuprofen seems to relieve the symptoms, but pain returns after the medication wears off.

                                                15 min. after receiving vaccine in left arm, felt tingling in left hand. Two weeks later left arm went completely numb, temporary loss of fine motor control, ok after a couple days. About a week later arm went numb with an icy cold prickly feeling. Lasted about a week, with a little residual numbness still present. About May 1st, also noticed swelling of left ankle. During the month of June had pain behind knee and continual pain and stiffness in left leg. End of June left leg became noticeable swollen. Went to Urgent Care on June 30, 2021. Sent for ultrasound, found four blood clots (DVT&#39;s) in left leg (3 upper thigh and one behind left knee). Sent to ER, started on Eliquis, will follow-up with primary care next week. No history of blood clots before, and I am quite active.

                                                On Friday, March 12, 2021, at the pharmacy I had an 8:00 am appointment to receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson?s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. I received my vaccine in the left arm but the injection seemed to me (and my wife) to be in an odd location, which was very high up on the shoulder near the shoulder joint. Things seemed fine until Saturday evening when I started to feel some tightness in my left trapezius between my scapula and my occipital bone. By Sunday morning that same area was very tight and painful; what we used call a ?crick.? Sunday afternoon I began to feel some sharp pain in my left shoulder joint. I had very little sleep on Sunday night and by Monday morning I had significant pain in what felt like my humerus.  I made an appointment with a chiropractor  for Monday afternoon and he suggested the vaccine shot might have started an inflammation that led to the tight trapezius, which in turn was causing the cervical spinal nerves to react, thus causing the pain in my arm. At this point I was in a lot of pain and the pain was moving further down toward my elbow. The chiropractor did his usual things and told me to put ice on it and take OCT Ibuprofen and or Naproxen. I was a bit better on Tuesday and decided to attend a three-day pastors? retreat. By Tuesday afternoon the pain had expanded to just below my elbow. I consulted with a doctor friend and he thought it was likely that I was having a reaction to the vaccine and that it would pass. He as concerned to hear of the odd location of my injection. I had another sleepless night and on Wednesday I noticed that the ends of my left thumb and index finder were numb and by that night the numbness had expanded to include most of my index finder. The other arm and shoulder pain continued but varied in intensity. On Wednesday morning I called my wife and asked her to come get me at the retreat and that afternoon I called my doctor&#39;s office office and made an appointment for Thursday morning (3-18-21). I&#39;m  feeling the cumulative effects of the pain and fatigue. My overall pain level is a little less but still present, as is the numbness in my index finger and thumb. My doctor suggested the nerve inflammation was a reaction tot he vaccine.

His eyes were rolling in the back of his head, which this symptom would come and go.  He would have hallucinations.  On unspecified date Pt woke up screaming the house was on fire and there was a dog by the bed and a person in the closet, talking out of his head.  An ambulance came and brought him to ER.  Pt coded in the ambulance and brought back. Pt was coherent upon arriving to the ER.  He had to be intubated and bagged and died about 15 minutes later.  Pt had blood work which was totally out of whack.   Family was told they did not understand what had happened to him.  The only thing the family could think of that was different was he had recently been vaccinated.

                                                2 weeks  ago on April 17th,  I woke up feeling very dizzy and nauseous. The room was spinning. My left ear was ringing, My balance was off.  Every time I bent over it was worse. I vomited after I ate.  Spent the day and the next day in bed. On Monday I called my doctors office and explained how I was feeling  and a tele visit was scheduled later in the day. During the tele visit,  the doctor diagnosed my symptoms as vertigo. I never had vertigo in the past. She couldn&#39;t tell me if it was from the vaccine or not. She did mention she had patients complaining of vertigo after getting the covid vaccine. Medication and exercises were given to me.  A few days later, my big toe on my right foot was aching terribly.  Each day it seems to be worse and I am at the point where I can barely walk.  Today I did some research online and saw that it could be gout. I never had gout n the past. I read vaccines can cause gout.  So here I am 2 weeks since my symptoms began and I am still dizzy and have the toe pain. Exercises and medication is not helping.

                                                About 2 minutes after vaccine injection patient became pale, hands became cold and purplish. Patient&#39;s head leaned to the left side,  started slurring and became unconcious while his eyes were open.  I tried to get the patient&#39;s attention but saying &#34;hello, are you still with me?&#34; loudly and he did not respond.  His eyes were still open at the time. At that point I yelled for help and other colleagues were calling &#34;911&#34; immediately. Based on store protocol and knolwedge of  CPR and CDC guidlines, I checked for pulse and respiration - did not have any.  I grabbed epinephrine injection 0.3 mg and injected him on left thigh. He immediately gasped for air, then started to faint again. His face color turned pale. At this point he is still sitting upright and EMT has arrived. His blood pressure was lower than normal based on EMT report.  I called the patient on 5/12/21 (one day post-event) and patient reported no adverse reaction from vaccine site, he also reported taking 1.5 hours nap. The injection site on epineprhine injection was somewhat painful.

                                                About a week after the shot, I started getting redness, tenderness, discoloration, and swelling of my right arm. The discoloration began to spread and I went to the doctor on the 21st. The doctor said there was inflammation and because it was warm to the touch, was concerned about blood clots. I was sent for an ultrasound and prescribed an anti-inflammatory medication and advised to take aspirin. Everything cleared up about a week later.

Tuesday, May 11th he worked at home, Wednesday, May 12th we had coffee, laughed &amp; joked around &amp; he went back to work at home. I went to check on him about five minutes later &amp; he was sitting up sleeping. He would usually wake up &amp; say I took a power nap but he was not breathing. I started mouth 2 mouth but he did not respond. My sister told my nephew to call 911 &amp; they told us to lay him on the floor &amp; start CPR until the paramedics arrived. Once they arrived &amp; took over they tried to get him to breathe &amp; restart his heart. The paramedics worked on him for a long time giving us updates on what they were trying to do. Patient never regained consciousness. They indicated probably a heart attack.

                                                Started experiencing fatigue, muscle weakness.  After light cardio exercise, energy depleted and would have to lie down and then would fall asleep.  I didn&#39;t feel sleepy, just extremely weak.  Most pronounced in the arms and legs, but sometimes felt like whole body.  Saw doctor on 5/12.  Later on 6/5 had a complete CBC, physical workup.  Some values were slightly out of range, but nothing significant.  Went to urgent care about a week or so later because symptoms seemed to be getting worse.  They repeated the complete CBC and also ran a lactic acid test.  Again results were insignificant.  Echo completed on 7/1 showing only mild diastolic disfunction.  I&#39;m afraid to exercise.  I wake up in the morning with a mild tingling in hands and legs.  As the morning progresses, the tingling, weakness, fatigue get worse.   I can have some fairly good days, but most are not good.  I have experienced some fatigue in the past, but this time has absolutely been the worse.   Even as I am writing this, I feel the tingling, weakness in my hands.  Earlier my legs felt achy,  Legs feel ok at this time.

I was working on installing flooring and i associated the tingling with the work I was doing and didn&#39;t think anything of it as it seems minor but has not gone away since May etc.  It doesn&#39;t seem to be getting worse but it&#39;s constant numbness in  the tips of both fingers.

Then waves of oversensitivity with knee and foot joints hurting as if arthritis, and this lasted most of the night. I also experienced strange hallucinations in the night as if I had a high fever but I don&#39;t believe I had a fever, and I also had a migraine and neck pain. The arm where the vaccine was applied is fine and not sore at all.  I also have a slight soreness in my stomach as if I had been coughing for a while, which was not the case.  It is now 11:34 AM the following day and I believe I&#39;m getting back to my normal self but it sure was a rough night and I though you should be aware.

I had a rash on my arm around the site of the injection about an inch around which is still visible after three weeks. The rash was a little itchy.

Shortly after, a few seconds, the patient stated he felt flushed and head started to fall back. Staff member cradled his head and called another staff member over.  Staff member called 9-1-1.  Patient went unconscious and his eyes rolled back for approximately 30 seconds.  When aware, we (staff members) transferred patient from the chair to the floor where staff member supported his back and fanned him due to his profuse sweating.  Staff member continued talking to him when he became unconscious again, this time gasping for air and turning pale.  We kept saying his name until he came to again and was somewhat aware of his surroundings.  He fainted one last time.  After this time, he sat up on his own and seemed to be very coherent.  The EMS arrived shortly after and took over.  They said they would take him out to check him out but he seemed to be doing better.  An EMS personnel let us know the patient did tell him that he has fainted from vaccines before.  However, he did not disclose this to us on the PQCF form or when asked verbally.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

About 10 days post vaccine, the symptoms returned with a ferocious energy.  The pain in my muscles and joints is so severe that I can&#39;t roll over in bed, have difficulty walking, and getting on and off the toilet. It interrupts my sleep so that I play musical bed-chair-couch throughout the night.  Needless to say, it exacerbates the level of pain and fatigue I&#39;m already experiencing.  It is life debilitating as I cannot participate in my usual daily activities of walking, hiking, gardening, biking, etc.  As a result of joint and muscle stiffness, I am also now experiencing headaches. These extreme conditions have persisted from March 23- April 9...and I don&#39;t see relief in the future.

Things have gotten progressively worse as I now cannot walk up a flight of stairs without a racing heart and heavy breathing and extreme exhaustion. (FYI, before this I was running 4-5 miles 4-5 times a week). In addition, my doctor tells me that I have no Covid-19 protection based on blood tests.

                                                Had a heart transplant 5 years ago. After vaccination, my calf muscles ached and I had to walk on the balls of my feet. I didn?t feel well and was achy, but all of that resolved after about 4 or 5 days. About 25 days after the vaccine, I woke up and my legs were hurting, swollen and lumpy. I went into the house and elevated my feet. I was sore from my calf to my ankles. I called the doctor and he told me to go the ER. After a 3 hour wait, one of the patients waiting almost threw up me, so I told them I was going home. Later, I went in to see the doctor about what was going on. After rubbing my calf vigorously, some of the lumps started to go away. The only thing my doctors came up with was that I was retaining water. I felt like I had gained some weight. I couldn?t stand long before my legs swelled. They prescribed a strong diuretic called Torsemide and I lost about 10 lbs. I currently wear compression socks every day, which helps with the swelling and my ankles hurt all of the time. I only take the meds as needed because it?s hard on my kidneys, which are already compromised due to my transplant meds.

                                                I am a retired physician who has done injections in my practice.  My injection was in the wrong site, either sub- periosteal or in the shoulder joint.  After the initial severe pain, my arm ached for about 5 days but not like a typical vaccination.  I was concerned about not having an appropriate immune response because of the lack of vascular in the site of the misplaced vaccine dose.  My primary doctor sent me to an immunologist.  We waited for over 4 weeks after the vaccination and I had a semi-quantitative spike antibody test at lab which came back as no measurable antibodies.  Dr. recommended a second vaccination and I had the Pfizer vaccine (lots EW0170 and EW0183 on 4/18/21 and 5/9/21.  I am scheduled to have a follow up spike semi-quantitative antibody test on on 6/22/21.  Also of interest is that my wife also got the J&amp;J vaccine and had no spike antibodies over 6 weeks after her vaccine on 2 different occasions.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included covid-19. His concurrent conditions included inability to see after he got something sprayed into one of his eyes in jail and wheelchair user. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of administration was not reported, batch number: unknown and expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 31-MAY-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  Since the day of the shot, the patient had been sick. On 02-JUN-2021 (about 2-3 days after the vaccination), the patient experienced side effects. He had bleeding in his brain due to which he could see with his eye, could not walk, had so much pain in legs, and sharp pains through his head. The patient was getting worse. On an unspecified date in JUN-2021, the patient had bleeding from his eyes and ears. The patient could not walk at the time of reporting. He had one good eye (not the eye with which he could not see due to bleeding in brain) but could not see from it too as he got something sprayed into it previously. Hence, he lost both eyes and could not see at all at the time of report. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from bleeding in brain, could not walk, could not see with his eyes, pain in legs, and sharp pains through head, and the outcome of bleeding from his ears, bleeding from his eyes and sick was not reported.

Awoke night of vaccination at 0130 with bad case of chills and shakes. Awoke again at 0330 with same. Took an ibuprofen at that time, which ameliorated problem. Had a headache for 36 hours. Awoke in the morning exhausted with headache. Next evening, awoke in the middle of the night with soaking wet PJs. Still lethargic and not feeling normal 48 hours later.

Over the next two days the left stayed the same while the right continued to worsen to include pain and tingling from the elbow to the hand particularly in the three central fingers. Hand difficulty holding item in my right hand. I then decided to seek medical attention the next day. The next morning swelling and pain were lessened so I did not contact medical attention.  Each day since symptoms have improved except for discomfort in my right middle finger which is noticeable upon touch. Most noticeable when using eating utensils. The right middle finger has remained the same for days.

By March 8th the swelling and pain in my left leg was so bad I made an appointment with Dr. for March 11th. He ordered another sonogram and found 2 DVTs in my left leg, and prescribed anti-coagulants whyich I am still on. At the time the Doctor said that this was most likly a result of having stood in line for 2&amp;1/2 hours.

                                                Day of injection: Slight fatigue,  fever and headache began about 6-7 hours after injection.  Next day; extreme fatigue, slept three hours in the middle of the day, no fever immediately (slight in the evening) but increased headache, tightness feeling in head all day, joint pain.   Next day; fatigue worse, no headache nor fever, joint pain increased. At this point, I considered seeing a doctor but did not. Today; slight headache, no fever, fatigue seems to be getting better.

They ordered blood work and my hemoglobin and rbc was so low the told me to go straight to the hospital. They gave me 3 units of blood. They did a colonoscopy and endoscopy, and have not determined the cause of the bleeding. I was admitted in the Hospital for 3 days.

                                                I experienced 3 strokes consecutively. First one came when I was sitting in the couch and they took me to the hospital. They took me in and we stayed there for about 2-3 days (Can&#39;t focus) and then they dispatched me. I was pretty messed up. Then I spent like the next 2 weeks with micro strokes. I didn&#39;t know what was going on and went back to the hospital only for them to send me back home. Shortly after that, I saw Dr. and told him that I wasn&#39;t feeling well and went home. At about 4 o&#39;clock I took a shower and didn&#39;t feel well. My wife drove me to the hospital and when I went I couldn&#39;t do anything. I got shots for strokes and took me to a bed. That is where I stayed and saw Dr. who told me that I got a stroke. I stayed there for 3 days and they sent me home. By now, I have lost my eyes, speech and it is really hard to focus or remember everything. I was going to a speech therapist and walk funny. I was stumbling at home.

For about 5 minutes, I was unable to find words and properly communicate.  I went to the ER and was admitted and had a battery of tests, kept overnight, and discharged the following day  My statin dose was increased, and I was put on a baby aspirin, in addition to Pradaxa blood thinner.  i believe that I may have had a vascular thrombi related to the effect of the medicine/spike protein.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included diabetes type II. The patient experienced drug allergy when treated with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), and ibuprofen.  The patient received Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805020, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered to left arm, on 18-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid/calcium/minerals NOS/retinol/tocopheryl acetate/vitamin B NOS/vitamins NOS/zinc (centrum silver), fish oil, glipizide and lisinopril, all for unknown indications. Patient had acute onset of low back pain 1.5 weeks prior to presentation on 03-JUN-2021. On 09-JUN-2021, this pain and weakness (asthenia) progressed to complete bilateral lower extremity paralysis (diplegia) with loss of bowel function (anal incontinence) and bladder function (urinary incontinence). He was seen emergently and was found to have critical, bilateral lower extremity ischemia. Computerised Tomogram angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed: 1. Right runoff: abrupt vessel cut off suggestive of acute thrombotic occlusion of the proximal common femoral artery with propagation into the superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery. On the delayed imaging a small amount of contrast was seen within the severely stenotic popliteal artery and very small amount of contrast was seen in the peroneal artery extending to the ankle suggesting proximal stenosis and extremely slow flow. 2. Left impression: abrupt cut off suggestive of acute thrombotic or embolic occlusion identified at the origin of the left common iliac arteries (iliac artery embolism, iliac artery occlusion) with propagation throughout the left lower extremity down to the popliteal artery. 3. On the delayed phase imaging, tiny wisp of contrast within the severely stenotic popliteal artery (peripheral artery stenosis) identified suggestive of very slow flow. The peroneal artery is also faintly patent on the delayed phase imaging with flow contrast extending to mid-calf level. Additional events were reported which occurred on an unspecified date in JUN-2021: peripheral arterial occlusive disease, peripheral artery occlusion, peripheral artery stenosis, peripheral artery thrombosis, poor peripheral circulation. The patient was hospitalized for 6 days. Due to severity of the ischemic limbs, he was offered bilateral above the knee amputations. He declined and would discharge from the hospital to hospice on 12-JUN-2021. Report stated &#34;He is going to die.&#34; The patient had also visited Emergency Room (ER) for the events anal incontinence, angiogram peripheral abnormal, asthenia, back pain, Computerised Tomogram abdomen, Computerised Tomogram pelvis abnormal, diplegia, iliac artery embolism, iliac artery occlusion, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, peripheral artery occlusion, peripheral artery stenosis, peripheral artery thrombosis, poor peripheral circulation, and urinary incontinence. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from anal incontinence, angiogram peripheral abnormal, asthenia, back pain, Computerised Tomogram abdomen, Computerised Tomogram pelvis abnormal, diplegia, iliac artery embolism, iliac artery occlusion, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, peripheral artery occlusion, peripheral artery stenosis, peripheral artery thrombosis, poor peripheral circulation, and urinary incontinence. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).  Version created to amend previously reported information on 25/Jun/2021. Upon review, following information was amended: In event tab, for Emergency Room (ER) ticked as &#39;yes&#39; for all the events and updated same in narrative too.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V1 The follow up version updates the following information: In event tab, for Emergency Room (ER) ticked as &#39;yes&#39; for all the events and updated same in narrative too.The updated information does not change the causality of previously reported events.  This case, received from VAERS, concerns a 71 year-old male patient with diabetes, who presented with back pain, weakness, lower extremity paralysis and bowel/bladder incontinence, and was found to have critical lower extremity ischemia, 83 days after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.  Angiography revealed occlusion of the left iliac and bilateral femoral and popliteal arteries. Events included iliac artery occlusion and embolism, and peripheral artery occlusion, stenosis and thrombosis.  No platelet counts were provided. The patient was offered amputations but declined; the events did not resolve and he was discharged to hospice.  The vessel stenosis is longstanding in nature and most likely related to his age and diabetes; the embolism/thrombosis may also be related to his chronic condition, and the latency between the events and the vaccine is long.  However, a relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine cannot be ruled out and thus the relationship is considered indeterminate.

                                                Patient came in today on 7/14/21 and stated that he has been experiencing symptoms after the vaccination. He had a rash and severe itchiness that has since gone away. He states that he has been having leg cramps and has been experiencing muscle weakness. The muscle weakness has been getting progressively worse. He is also experiencing nerve tingling, all of which he did not attribute to the vaccine until recent news about Guillen  Barren Syndrome associated with the Johnson and Johnson Covid 19 vaccine.

                                                6 days after injection woke with soreness in all joints, stiffness, fatigue. Now on day 10, the S/S are getting worst. Fingers are swollen,. I can&#39;t grasp or pinch things. I must use both hands to hold a glass or cup. Very weak, sleeping 16-18 hours a day. At times I get very chilled and start to shiver. Never have had a fever, loss of taste, or smell.  I tested NEG for the virus on day 3 (10 days after receiving the vaccine). Soreness is turned into pain. Feels like full-blown RA and if I was black I would be thinking sickle-cell because of the general pain.

My wife and I received the same lot number of the J&amp;J vaccine on Saturday, March 13. We both had slight fatigue that evening and into the following day and she has had no further symptoms.  On Tuesday, March 16, I had a mild ache around injection site with no further symptoms until Saturday, March 27 when I experienced a brief episode of lightheadedness. (CONTINUED BELOW)

                                                13th of April. I had a blood clot in my hand. My index finger on  my left hand was numb and black and blue all around the knuckle area and into my hand area. I went to my primary care - I went to the acute center there. She said the hand was cold and could see the black and blue. They put me on Plavix for 30 days and I haven&#39;t had any reoccurrence of that. I think it was the 21st, I couldn&#39;t sleep all night, I had a kidney stone - the pain was so bad I got nauseous - around my back and side and in my front. I didn&#39;t have a fever. I went to the doctor office and they checked urine - and said there was blood in the urine. I was prescribed - Tamsulosin HCL. They thought I had passed most of it by the time I got there.

                                                Patient received vaccine on 5/24/21. He called pharmacy on 6/14 complaining that his arm had been sore for about a week since getting the vaccine. he stated that his arm did not bother him after he got the vaccine but started &#34;aching&#34; on 6/7/21 and has been aching on and off every since. patient states that he does not have problem moving his arm or raising arm above his head, but was concerned that the pain did not start until approximately 2 weeks after receving vaccine. he states that there is no redness or swelling or heat around the injection site, has not developed rash or any other reactions, etc. I told patient to continue taking tylenol since that was helping with his muscle soreness and to contact his doctor if aching sensation continued.

                                                It started with a familiar reaction and that was I had tingling and pain in my feet it started with both feet and it was significant, like when the feet goes to sleep and it is coming back and you feel the pins and needles feeling, and it was exactly what I get with CIDP. It moved from both feet up to both hands and I was not really afraid because that is what happens with CIDP when your auto immune system is stimulated. I get numbness on my feet and in my hands. I thought that the vaccine stimulated my immune system. The CIDP has been in remission and maybe the shot has stimulated my nervous system.  The other day I noticed that when taking the hot plate from the microwave it was hot but I did not feel it at all. I thought the food has not heated up, when my wife touched the plate she said it was very hot and I did not feel the plate hot at all. I also felt pain in my left foot to a point that I am not ambulatory. The pain is so extreme in my left foot if I try to stand up. I have been in my bed for the last 2 days. I am not sure if it is the CIDP or GOUT that is attacking my foot but it has been triggered by the vaccine. I also have severe pain in my left leg. I called my cardiologist and I have a phone consultation with him today to check for clot formation. The pain has subsided a bit today, but yesterday the pain in my leg was very intense. I also had pain at the injection site and felt a little feverish since yesterday around 3PM and it went to 101F and this morning I am fine again. I did not take anything for it and this morning I woke up and I felt well (in regards to the fever). I did not have fever before then.

                                                Beginning about 10 days after vaccination, the patient noticed pain in his arm and he started ?not feeling so great.? Over several days, this pain began to radiate and involve muscle and bone aches. He continued to feel ill to what he described as the worst symptoms on Monday, April 26th, which included severe pain, high blood pressure (211/113 documented by the ER), symptoms similar to cardiac event. The patient was seen by Emergency Department who did not find a diagnosis, but gave the patient medication to lower blood pressure and referred further treatment to his Primary Care Provider.  Blood pressure mediation was taken to lower his blood pressure and clonidine 0.1mg was prescribed by his PCP because of elevated BP (over 150/90). The patient was also instructed to take Advil for pain and was referred to get an X-ray  with follow up in 2 weeks on 5/13.
