On May 4 he was really weak, moving much more slowly than normal, complaining of sinus headache above left eye, sleeping longer and more than normal, brain fog and confusion, not able to do normal activities.  This impairment has continued through May 11 with no improvement from one day to the next.  Visited his Dr to get checked on May 11 due to our concern over how long this was lasting.   He has had no fever but some chills here and there.  Dr checked everything she could think of and requested blood tests which we have not heard about yet.  Extreme fatigue was the major symptom.  Today, May 12, he feels better, moving around faster and doing some normal activities but still tires easily and must rest.

                                                One month after the vaccine I started to get Hot Flashes followed by pain. The pain lasted for six hours and then went away. The pain is all over my body The process returned after a week or so and it has continued intermittently since then. The cycle is always the same. I get a hot flash and then the pain starts. As time goes on it is happening more often and the pain lasts for longer. I get really hot and sweat for about 15 minutes and then the pain starts. It builds up to being a more severe pain which has been lasting up to 24 hours. It has been getting less often and for slightly shorter periods of pain. Just in the last two weeks I started to get pain at the injection site, and it is starting to affect my whole arm around the area. It is like a muscle pain. I have consulted my doctor and She prescribed Tramadol. It seems to help but over the counter medications don&#39;t seem to work.

                                                PATIENT WAS ADMINISTERED THE JANSSEN COVID VACCINE AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30AM. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF NEEDLE AFTER INJECTION, THE PATIENT APPEARED TO FAINT FALLING FORWARD IN HIS OWN LAP. AFTER ABOUT 15 TO 30 SECONDS, HE REGAINED CONSCIOUS. WE ASSESSED THE PATIENT TO ASK IF HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED FAINTING BEFORE  OR SPECIFICALLY DURING VACCINATION. HE HAD NO PREVIOUS EPISODES. WE QUICKLY OFFERED THE PATIENT SOME WATER AND CRACKERS WHILE HE REMAINED SEATED. THE PATIENT FELL FORWARD AGAIN AND APPEARED TO BE CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, MY PARTNER STEPPED AWAY TO RETRIEVE WATER, AND THE PATIENT ONCE AGAIN FELL FORWARD AND BEGAN CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, HE DRANK SOME WATER AND ATE SOME CRACKERS. HE MENTIONED THAT HE FELT EXTREMELY TIRED. WE INSISTED TO CALL THE PARAMEDICS FOR HELP,BUT HE DECLINED SAYING THAT HE WAS OK AND MAYBE THE NEEDLE TRIGGERED THE EVENT. AFTER WE OBSERVED THE PATIENT FOR 30 MINUTES AND HE ASSURED US HE WAS IN STABLE CONDITION, HE LEFT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. PATIENT WAS CALLED TWICE AFTER THE EVENT TO FOLLOW-UP BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD SUCCESS IN FOLLOW-UP.

                                                Patient has been very stable on anticoagulation with warfarin.  On same dose since 2016 with only rare very mild excursions in INR.  He had appointment for routine INR check which happened to fall 3 days after his vaccine, and INR was found to be 4.1.  There were no other identified explanations for the unusually high INR in him.  He did not have any symptoms of bleeding or thromboembolism.  He did have some arm pain so took a few doses of ibuprofen (which should not cause the increase in INR and he has been using ibuprofen prn the duration of his anticoag therapy)  He was asked to hold 2 doses and returned 1 week later, which was 10 days after vaccine.  At that time INR came down to 3.0 and CBC was ordered which came back normal for him.  He still did not have any symptoms of bleeding or thromboembolism.
