                                                First night: flu symptoms.  Next day: fatigue, drowsy, some flu symptoms.  That night: halucinatory dreams, woke up  and had difficulty with orientation - room spinning, difficulty walking came back to bed, bed spinning.  Got up later room spinning vertically - took several minutes to settle down.  This problem has gotten worse as the days go by.  This morning, dizziness persists longer than before, feeling of strong nausea, near vomiting, cannot walk in a straight line.  Fear of falling.   These are symptoms of vertigo I believe.  Should I go to a doctor?  Feeling that this will get worse.  Difficulty concentrating.  Quite an unsettling and scary experience.
