Pt states going to the doctor to check on the leg, ran tests, and also did an xray. Pt states the Dr did not find a clot and mentioned that perhaps it was a sprain/strain. The pt did not agree that it was a sprain and wanted the pharmacy to report this adverse event. No other side effects were reported. Recommended that pt goes back to doctor to get leg checked out some more.

IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF NEEDLE AFTER INJECTION, THE PATIENT APPEARED TO FAINT FALLING FORWARD IN HIS OWN LAP. AFTER ABOUT 15 TO 30 SECONDS, HE REGAINED CONSCIOUS. WE ASSESSED THE PATIENT TO ASK IF HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED FAINTING BEFORE  OR SPECIFICALLY DURING VACCINATION. HE HAD NO PREVIOUS EPISODES. WE QUICKLY OFFERED THE PATIENT SOME WATER AND CRACKERS WHILE HE REMAINED SEATED. THE PATIENT FELL FORWARD AGAIN AND APPEARED TO BE CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, MY PARTNER STEPPED AWAY TO RETRIEVE WATER, AND THE PATIENT ONCE AGAIN FELL FORWARD AND BEGAN CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, HE DRANK SOME WATER AND ATE SOME CRACKERS. HE MENTIONED THAT HE FELT EXTREMELY TIRED. WE INSISTED TO CALL THE PARAMEDICS FOR HELP,BUT HE DECLINED SAYING THAT HE WAS OK AND MAYBE THE NEEDLE TRIGGERED THE EVENT. AFTER WE OBSERVED THE PATIENT FOR 30 MINUTES AND HE ASSURED US HE WAS IN STABLE CONDITION, HE LEFT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. PATIENT WAS CALLED TWICE AFTER THE EVENT TO FOLLOW-UP BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD SUCCESS IN FOLLOW-UP.
