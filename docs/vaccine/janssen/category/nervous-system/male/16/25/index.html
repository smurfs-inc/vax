                                                Patient received vaccine in the AM of 3/16/21.  Patient was in his usual state of health when he went to bed the evening of 3/16/21.  He ate dinner normally and his PD was started as usual.  There were no overnight complications with his PD and he got up shortly before 8 AM.  Mom reports the dialysate from his bag was clear and normal and none of his dwell was retained.  She heard a loud thud from the bathroom around 8 AM and the patient was found by his mother having generalized convulsions (bilateral upper and lower extremities) and he appeared to be foaming at the mouth.  He did not respond to her and she called 911. The seizure stopped by the time EMS arrived and his initial GCS was 12, and 15 by the time they started transport.  He had another seizure en route around 9:30 AM and was given 2.5 mg versed and required bagging. Patient was loaded with Keppra and now has been on maintenance Keppra. Patient has not suffered any additional seizures and is currently undergoing an extensive workup by inpatient neurology team. Vaccine adverse effect currently remains on the differential for inciting event leading to seizure however additional labs are pending to rule out other causes (eg. viruses causing PML).  Patient was also diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and started on antibiotics at time of admission.

He convulsed for around ten seconds after about two minutes of being unconscious. Four to five healthcare workers attended to him, asking him to &#34;stay with us.&#34; They called an ambulance, and the medics monitored him for awhile. Heart rate dropped to 34 bpm, clothing drenched with perspiration. Blood sugar was slightly low, although he had eaten a late brunch of two fried eggs, sourdough toast and fruit salad. The last thing he remembers is a cold sensation shooting down his arm and into his left hand. He tried to talk to say he wasn&#39;t feeling well, but he couldn&#39;t form the words, so he raised his arm and then fainted. He felt generally unwell the rest of the day, and today he is still not fully recovered.

                                                After a few hours, developed a low grade headache and some soreness at the injection site.  About two hours later I started getting extremely cold, despite the temperature in the mid-high 70s. I covered up under blankets. I began feeling very tired and a general sick feeling. After about an hour and a half of progressively worse chills and cold sweat, I began to get very very hot and removed all blankets and eventually clothes. I took my temperature, which was at 102 f. At this point I drank some water and Gatorade and waited for it to pass. I also noticed that my Apple Watch heart rate detection was saying my heart rate was in the high 90s to low 100s despite me just laying in bed. This was alarming because my typical resting heart rate is in the low 60s. About two hours later I felt well enough to at least brush my teeth, but upon standing up was greeted with an extreme feeling of weakness and dizziness and it was hard to keep myself up right. I eventually was able to fall asleep, and upon waking up, felt better, but still not great. My heart rate was more normal at this point, I no longer had chills or a fever, but still had a headache and soreness across my body, worst at the injection site.

He was cold and clammy. He never lost consciousness.  It took him a couple  minutes to &#34;come back&#34; to alertness and feel better.   Severe headache, chills starting and began asthma symptoms (wheezing) at 11;30pm the night of the injection.. 2 extra strength Tylenol did not help. He was very cold and the headache did not let up after several hours.  Eventually he had a bout of sweats and he reports he was soaked.  In the morning, at 8 am the headache was still severe...was sensitive to noise, light and touch. He was given 2 extra strength Tylenol at 8 and then 2 Advil at 10am, which finally began to reduce symptoms. He was not hungry, felt weak, and finally by late night he was feeling better.  In the morning on Saturday he awoke with a swollen left eye and blood shot in that eye.

                                                Adverse reaction started at approximately 1030pm about 8 hours after receiving the vaccine. I started to shake and took my temperature to find that I had 104.6 fever and took Tylenol 1000mg and tried to go to sleep. About 30 minutes later at 11pm I vomited so I went to talk to my parents. They took my temperature and it spiked to 106.7 knowing I had already taken Tylenol they grabbed ice packs and wrapped them in a towel and placed them under my armpits and behind my neck they also placed a damp cloth on my forehead and monitored my fever. At around 1145  my fever started to come down slowly to 104.2. Around 130am I ate a few crackers and took ibuprofen 600mg and the fever still slowly dropped at around 2am my fever was still at 102.4 at this time my  parents went to bed knowing that my body needed to continue to fight the fever. At 530am my father checked my temperature and it was normal.

I was able to get the patient into a chair and he experienced two more episodes within 5 minutes. 911 was called. Patient requested water and it was provided. Paramedics arrived and conducted multiple tests (blood glucose, blood oxygen, blood pressure, heart monitoring). Patient refused referral to the local hospital and left the pharmacy within 30-45 minutes after the  incident without any further problems.

The fever, would drop to 101 with Tylenol, but would spike as soon as it would wear off.   He was very tired and  slept most of today. Today, the fever is gone, but his back hurts and so does the injection site.

The patient leaned over and became quiet and was not responding to questions. Patient then leaned back up and went stiff and had symptoms similar to that of a seizure (arms and legs went stiff and was unresponsive to questions) for about 30-60 seconds (at this time the paramedics had already been called). Patient then regained control and felt awful (a 5 on a scale of 1-10) and then felt even more nauseous and had to spit up into a trash can. Patient was given a water bottle to help them relax and cool off because patient felt warm. Paramedics arrived and checked blood pressure and pulse but found everything within normal ranges except for a slightly low blood pressure. The paramedics did nothing else except offer a scan of the patient&#39;s heart in their ambulance which he was then rolled out on a stretcher.

                                                Patient had an adverse reaction to the Janssen COVID vaccination. After vaccination, patient was told to wait 15 minutes in this chair and we would observe. I prepare their COVID card and went back out to give card and ask if the patient had any other questions. Patient was scared of shots, so some anxiety was expected, however after a few minutes while I was talking to the patient, I noticed he got stiff, and started to seize. His family was near by and we immediately put him onto the floor with head on a cushion and called EMS/911 CODE WHITE. He did not hit anything while seizing/convulsing. Once he laid down, within a few seconds, He stopped jerking, became conscious, and asked what happened. He lost consciousness and only remembered me talking to him about his questions about the vaccine. He was fully aware of his surroundings afterwards and said he never had a reaction like that to a shot before. Some anxiety, but not a seizure. EMS arrived shortly there after and he was taken to the hospital after inspection from EMS just to make sure everything was okay. We had to make a report to management per Store Policy. VAERS was reported

                                                My son said his arm hurt badly, he then said he needed to go to the bathroom because he needed to vomit. Then he asked for water, then oxygen and then he said he was going to pass out. He reached for my hand and then he was ?gone? like the nurses surrounding us said. He was unconscious, his eyes were open but he wouldn?t speak and he wasn?t there, not breathing no pulse. They came and took his pulse and it was very low, if I can recall correctly it was 94? over 54? ?they brought him back with an ice pack on his neck, shoulders and lifting his legs.   He explained afterwards he felt like a weird sensation in his arm, the. It went up his brain, like electricity? ?and then went towards his ears and that?s when he said he can?t remember, started dreaming everything was black and came back to me saying: ?no, wake up? ? Wake come now??and he realized he had indeed passed out.  They said it was common for young healthy boys to have this side effect, faint.   I still feel I need to report this. It scared the life out of me, he was gone for seconds, seemed way too long!!!

                                                At almost 10 hours after receiving my covid vaccine I experienced extreme chills and weakness. I had a tough time moving throughout my room and could barely get up from bed. It felt similar to having a severe fever. However, these symptoms diminished throughout the night and I only felt a slight weakness going into the next day. The severity of these symptoms decreased throughout the day but remained in the background for a while.

Throughout night woke up many times with same symptoms. At 6:00 AM woke up for good with a 102 fever, migraine, soreness, chills, and no energy. At 8:00 AM the fever got up to 103°F. I then took Tylenol and the fever slowly started to subside but the migraine, soreness, and lack of energy stayed. As of Tuesday, two days after the vaccine, symptoms have gone away.

The next day I was really tired, fatigued and had a really bad headache but by that Wed all symptoms had subsided.

Heart rate (normally 60) spiked to 140 and could not see fit five seconds, had to call ambulance. Ambulance determined much of it was due to anxiety (multiple exams and significant work were due soon), and recommended medical supervision to ensure it did not escalate. Went to urgent care and was supervised until 1 pm, 24 hours after the vaccination, by which time symptoms had subsided

Following this, the patient described the sensation of &#34;blanking out&#34;. The pt fell off their chair and lacked alert conconciousness for roughly five seconds. When the pt came to, they appeared confused and twitchy, with wide eyes and an overall appearance of shock. Pt remained in their state for roughly a minute, before stating that they felt completely better. The pt had developed a sweaty back but didn&#39;t state that they felt overally hot. They didn&#39;t mention being in any pain. The local injection site appeared a bit red but nothing of significant note. Pt did bump their head on the side wall behind the chair, receiving a minor bruise. Pt was given some water to drink and was monitored for 30 minutes. They pt stated they felt fine. They had no past history of fainting with vaccines, thought pt claimed to have passed out like this before but only after suffering a head injury. After their wait, the pt was allowed to leave and assured us that they felt completely fine.

He did not respond to me calling his name.  Pt gained consciousness and was a little frightened, not understanding the situation or remembering where he was at.

Within a few minutes,  he said he was feeling a lot more like normal.

                                                After I administered the vaccine the patient&#39;s pupils became dilated right after I finished injecting vaccine. On my question whether he was doing ok he answered yes, then stood up and walked out of the immunization room. While walking he walked directly into the end cap of the aisle. I rushed to him and with another customer and his mom was able to handle to make him sit on a chair. I kept talking to him while tried to keep him alert waiting for EMT. Another customer turned out to be EMT healthcare professional so he was helping me to keep the patient alert as he was losing his conscience, and we tried by any means to prevent this to happen. I pour a cold water on the back of his neck and put on the fan. His pulse was slow as well as his blood pressure as his whole body became very pale and cold to touch. However, he was alert as he was able to answer questions of how old he was, what type of education he was about to get and at what location he was pursuing his career. So, it was sort of a &#34;zombie&#34; state of mind which scared me the most. I have been practicing as a Pharmacist for six years as well as immunize people according to NYS Department of Health authorization and I never ever saw such a reaction before.

                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

                                                Immediately had a dull headache. About an hour and a half just didn&#39;t feel well and became very tired where he was dozing off.  About 7:00 pm started to shake.  This continued to get worse with severe jerking along with the uncontrollable shaking.  Had a rapid resting heart rate over 142 and a fever at 102.4.  Was incoherent, mumbling his words and not making any sense. Went to ER at 8:48 pm they did blood work, urine test and started an IV.  They weren&#39;t sure what was going on and first accused of doing drugs then wanted to do a spinal tap. His father stopped that and again told them it was from the covid vaccine. They finally gave him a shot of Ketorolac 30mg and LORazepan 1 mg. They sent him home and told him to take tylenol for his fever. spontaneous shaking kept on until late 3/11, along with a fever.  Friday 3/12 he is feeling better, fever has broke but not quite 100%.

                                                Besides arm pain that went to my pinky, I was fine. Later that night, I started to get chills and was really cold. The next day, I developed a fever of 100.2 and was really cold. For about a week, I would be fine during the day and would get really tired by the evening and extremely cold. I also started feeling tightness in my chest about 2 days after I got the vaccine. I contacted my doctor and she told me to take Tylenol and Albuterol.

As I was running to him pt started slipping out of his chair, as a women, who I later found out was his mother and I helped keep pt in chair as he fainted and then seized for about 2 seconds and then gained consciousness. Upon awakening pt said , what  just happened?&#34; The mother answered &#34;oh you just had a little seizure, you&#39;re fine.&#34; To my surprise, I asked the mother is this has happened before and she said yes when he sees needles/get shots.  I told them the ambulance was on it&#39;s why and the mother asked &#34;why?!&#34; I told her because your son just fainted/had a seizure and we want to make sure he is ok.  The pt refused to go to the hospital.  I did go back out there and mentioned to them that it is very important to answer questions truthfully any time they are asked as they failed to honestly answer our questions about ever feeling faint after receiving a vaccine. His blood pressure normalized and once the paramedics left so did they.

                                                Patient was waiting in chair about 5 minutes after the vaccine when I heard him say he didn&#39;t feel too good. His skin color was pale and when I went up to see how he was he bent over and vomited. After he vomited he said he felt a lot better. I asked him to remain seated and asked for my tech in the pharmacy to call 911, but he then said no and that he was feeling better. He said he felt clammy just before he vomited. I asked him to stay seated and got him some cold water. He remained in the waiting area another 15 minutes after to make sure no further problems. After 15 minutes he was feeling fine and I reassessed and his color returned to his skin and I noticed some redness around inner portion of both thighs, but he said that was from his eczema and that it was there already.  Allowed him to leave at 1:15pm and told him to seek medical attention right away if he felt any issues regarding trouble breathing. I called him an hour later to check up on him at 1:30pm and he was feeling fine. He thanked me over the phone.

I thought nothing of this until around 7:30 where I began to have extreme chills and a headache. Around 9:00, I tried to get some water and I was too dizzy to walk at any normal pace. I took my temperature and it read at 101.9F. I proceeded to take ibuprofen, drink lots of water (about 80 oz that night), and go to sleep as best as I could.

                                                It is now the next day, and I feel significantly better. I have pain at the injection site, some muscle fatigue, a little bit of a depleted appetite, tiredness in my eyes and head (likely due to lack of quality sleep), and a bit of sweating, but my pain has reduced to maybe a 2/10 or 1/10 (i.e., not even uncomfortable). I did end up getting decent sleep between 2 AM and 12 PM with only a few interruptions of family members checking on me. The only notable pain that is worrying me is abnormal soreness in my right wrist that is not the result of overuse, overextension, etc., although I was able to take care of that pain with another 3 Advil pills. I am considering scheduling a doctor&#39;s appointment, as I know the J&amp;J vaccine got recalled today for blood clots. My assumption is that because I am a healthy 20-year-old, my immune system overreacted to the vaccine, but I want to check to make sure that it doesn&#39;t cause any additional health problems.

After a couple of hours he started feeling hot and flushed but did not have a fever.  He had body aches and  a headache.  At 4am he went to the bathroom and started feeling faint so he tried to go back to his bed but fainted in the bathroom.  His Mom helped him back to his bedroom, he had no injuries just a headache at that time.  He stayed in bed until approx. 5pm when he felt better.  No other injuries, or doctor visits.

                                                The patient had a needle phobia and was very anxious prior to the vaccine. Once the patient received the vaccine, he waited in the waiting area for 15 minutes post-vaccine. About 5 minutes after the vaccine, he notified the pharmacy staff that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and he was feeling faint. The pharmacy staff provided him with a glass of water and was monitoring him. He said he  felt like he fainted and wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he felt warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided him with an ice pack. He then notified the pharmacy staff that he urinated in his chair while waiting post-vaccine. He wanted to be checked out and wanted us to call 911 . The patient began to feel better after about 20 minutes. The EMT arrived and checked the patient. Even though, the patient was feeling better, the EMT recommended the patient be checked further anyways. He was brought to the Triage center and was there for about 1 hour, according to the patient, and was feeling better. He said he felt slightly fatigued that day and the following day, but other than that he was feeling back to normal and no issues. He stated he has severe needle phobia and has experienced these fainting spells and anxiousness in the past. We followed up with the patient and he provided this information to us. He stated he was feeling good and back to normal. He had no further questions or concerns. We told him to follow up with us if questions or concerns came up.

I reassure patient that he will be okay and this is the body&#39;s response to pain/anxiety. I also provided patient with water and make sure he was seated so he does not fall. His vision return to normal after 5 minutes or so and he started recovering within 15 minutes.

He was able to answer all questions, but was still shaking. We called 911 and EMTs were here within 2 minutes and took over.  After assessing him and taking his vitals they decided to transport him to Hospital.

He moved out to the chair and sat down about 2 minutes later his abdomen started to move back and forth a few times and then he started to have what appeared to be a seizure. It was very short (20 seconds), he remained in the chair. His mom and I moved him to the floor with his help. He then mentioned that he forgot to take his seizure medication last night and was feeling very nervous about the vaccine.

Around 930 pm I started experiencing a lot of nausea and what seems to be a migraine. Migraine lasted all through the night along with muscle spasm/aches in my hips and legs. Migraine and muscle aches carried into the following morning of 06/09/21. I have taken ibuprofen to help deal with the migraine and muscle aches.

I fell back asleep and when I woke up the fever had broken and the chills had improved but the soreness and headache remained. I took Tylenol in the afternoon and that helped the symptoms but by the time I had gone to bed the chills had returned but not a fever. When I woke up in the middle of the night (night 2) the chills had stopped and I woke up with a moderate headache and sweating profusely. After falling asleep and awaking in the morning I felt much better with the exception of a minor headache.

After about 20 seconds he came to and leaned forward but wasn&#39;t oriented to time and place. As I was talking to him, trying to assess his breathing, he slumped back in the chair and began shaking much more violently.  I asked the store director to call EMS at that point, I took his mask off at that point to better assess his breathing. After about 15 seconds, he came to again. At that point, I had him lean forward with his elbows on his knees, and he didn&#39;t lose conciousness after that. I took his blood pressure (70/22) and pulse (52, light and hard to find). EMS arrived soon after and at that point patient felt much better. EMS decided not to transport the patient to the ER. They instructed patient to follow up with his provider. Patient left the vaccine area under his own power about half an hour later.

Almost immediately he collapsed to the floor before we could grab him. He fell face first onto the floor. He moaned and shook. With the assistance of a medic and police office, he was rolled onto his back and his feet were elevated. He started to regain consciousness. EMTs were called to assess him after his head hit the floor. He was monitored by EMTs for 30 minutes. He refused to go to the hospital and was instructed to call 911 if he had additional symptoms.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Following the shot was the expected soreness. Then pain throughout my arms like pins and needles  began about 8 hours later. I self treated with Tylenol. After going to bed, I woke at 5am nauseous and in pain. I was freezing  even though I would normally be fine. I was shaking which made the pain in all of my limbs and back hurt more. The day following the injection, the pain and nausea didn&#39;t go away. It hurt to pick up and hold things. It is now two days after injection and I keep fighting nausea after eating. I keep stretching and it barely keeps the soreness in my arm at bay. I can feel my hands starting to cramp just from typing this even though I would normally be fine.

For the ears, it was as if someone had taken ear plugs and coated the ear drum with them, making it hard to hear.  Headache was treated with an ice pack on the temple for immediate site relief.  Began to feel tired and worn out while in bed, loss of vision begins to occur as well.  Body aches begin.  4/9/21:  Patient is woken up from intense body spams throughout the entire body.  Once awake, the entire body was spasming, causing the patient to be unable to control his body, and all extremities.  After sipping some water for about an hour, the spasms subsided in all areas of the body except for the legs and shoulders.   4:00pm patient begins to feel extremely nauseous, begins having increased bowel movements including rapid diarrhea, and extreme stomach cramping.  Deep body aches and pain continue.  4/10/21:  10am: patients body begins to become covered in hives all across his skin, inside his mouth, under his feet, and in his hair.  Hives continued to grow, with no reddening of the skin however.  This was treated with Benadryl for the remainder of the day; hives subsiding around 6:15pm. Dehydration also occurred, and hospital treatment for IV saline bag was soon to be utilized had the patient not been able to rehydrate himself.  Body aches continue

Slept the rest of the night. Felt tired and with a slight headache, similar to that of a sinus infection, coming and going throughout the next day (April 11), so stayed in bed. Symptoms were gone by the night. No more symptoms starting on April 12 and after that date.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine (LOT#201A21A) in his left arm at approximately 14:43 on 5/25/21. During the 15 minute observation period, he expressed &#34;I don&#39;t feel well&#34; and endorsed dizziness/ lightheadedness, slight tingling feeling in fingers, and nausea. Shortly thereafter at approximately 14:50, he started to slouch and appeared faint while sitting in a chair with eyes closed. He did not fall or hit any part of his body. He was easily aroused with a touch on his arm and responded to verbal questions immediately. He denied trouble breathing, chest pain, palpitations, headache, muscle weakness, vision changes, skin reactions, swelling. He was oriented x3 and not exhibiting verbal or swallowing problems. His vitals were normal- HR 80 bpm and BP 105/80 mmHg. He was offered a receptacle to vomit in if needed; however, he did not vomit. This initial reaction was consistent with potential vasovagal reaction/ near-syncope after vaccination.   Patient was encouraged and instructed to sit on the floor to prevent injury in case of fall but he refused. Staff offered him water, a fan, and opened windows while monitoring.   Later while waiting for a ride at around 15:10, he endorsed headache (first above his eyes and then toward the back of his head) and clarified this did not feel like a typical migraine that he has had before. Then at around 15:20 he endorsed vision changes in his right eye- he could not see a portion of vision out of that eye except peripheral vision and described not being able to see writing on the right side of a whiteboard in front of him in the room. Later he described a resolution of that gap in vision but then had blurry vision out of that eye. He denied any vision changes in the left eye.   Due to alarming symptoms of vision changes and onset of headache, patient was recommended to go to ER for further observation and evaluation. He was not in urgent distress and patient did not wish for EMS to be called but agreed to go to ER when his emergency contact picked him up.    Patient&#39;s emergency contact came to pick up patient at approximately 15:40 and was recommended to take him to the ER. Patient and emergency contact were amenable to this plan. He was able to stand up and walk to the car without issues.

A few minutes later, he started feeling lightheaded and called his father. His father notified me that he was &#34;spazzing out/seizing&#34; with his head jerking backwards &#34;for a couple seconds&#34;. When I saw the patient, he was sitting and unresponsive to verbal and physical stimuli with his father patting his cheek. After a minute or so, the patient was able to respond, but his voice was faint. He reported having a &#34;severe headache&#34; and feeling &#34;sweaty&#34;. He had no fever or difficulty breathing. Father said there was no anaphylaxis, and asked for a bucket since the patient felt very nauseous. I then called 911 for emergency services. When I returned to the patient after the call, the father said he was feeling much better and that the &#34;color had returned&#34;. Patient was unwilling to stand, and remaining symptom(s) was headache. Emergency services came and checked blood pressure, which was normotensive (SBP 111). Father insisted ER visit was not necessary.

                                                RN to J&amp;J vaccine about 3-5 min after delivery. Assuming Vasovagal response. His brother reports that patient was sitting there and his eyes rolled back in his head and he fell off his chair and hit his head/right eye. Employee got out there and he was a bit combative and saying &#34;whats going on, whats going on&#34;. I asked him to sit down and employee called 911. We put pressure on his eye area to stop the bleeding. He was sweating, shakey, pale, and nauseous. Paramedics arrived quickly and eventually took him away on a strecher. Update: mom came back a couple of hours later to thank us and let us know that he is home and resting. He did get 3 stiches by his eye and the reason they took him via strecher was because his blood pressure was staying so low while they were here.

Pt did not lose consciousness but blacked out (visual disturbances, tinnitus/temporary hearing loss, nausea) occurred within 2-3 minutes of administration. First attempt to read BP was low (~80/60). Pt is an athlete, so I waited until after water was consumed to take BP again. 2nd reading was ~106/65. Pt felt better after drinking water and after sitting for 15 minutes under observation.

                                                12 hours after receiving vaccine I got sharp pains in back and legs. Burning sensation all over body. I was walking across my room and passed out waking up on the floor. Muscle cramps and tightness followed this.  I could not move my muscles for roughly 12 hours. After 24 hours from receiving vaccine these extreme symptoms seemed to fade and I was left with fatigue, soreness and fever as expected. This lasted for the next 3 days

                                                The patient (self) felt a soreness around the site of the injection begin immediately and grow throughout the day. The soreness continued to at least April 12 (at the time of this report). The soreness was immediate unlike a tetanus shot but the pain the following days was 2-3 times less that of a tetanus shot. By 4pm the same day, the patient felt fatigue and tired and had difficulty staying awake. Around 6pm the patient took 200 mg of ibuprofen by mouth because of a strong headache. At 7pm the patient was experiencing the following: headache, warm head to the touch, shivering/shaking,  fatigue, mild aching. The patients pulse was consistent 100-104 bpm. The patients temperature at 8:30pm was 100.4 F. The patient then went to bed at 9pm. Patient had trouble falling asleep due to fever, shaking, aching. The patient slept intermittently until midnight. At midnight, the patient noticed the fever and shaking had ceased but the headache and aching were still strong. The aching was all over the body. The patients eyes hurt to move. The aching was constant and at times was throbbing. At 3am the patient could still not sleep well so he took 650 mg of Acetaminophen by mouth. The patient began to notice some relief approximately 30-60 min after. The patient fell asleep after the relief began and slept soundly til 9:15 am, April 11th. The patient awoke feeling much better. All side effects had stopped with the exception of a feeling of weakness and slight dizziness. The patient was able to carry on normally and took no more medications.

                                                I first started developing chills and a mild fever about eleven or twelve hours after taking the vaccine. My entire body felt like burning and a headache came up not long after the fever.  I could barely fall asleep at night due to body ache and excessive sweating. The headache and body pain persisted till the next morning, and as of I am writing this response now, I feel extremely weak and I have no appetite at all.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  The vaccine was given at 10:45 AM. At 4:00 PM I began feeling nauseous. At 9:00 or 10:00 PM I began feeling both muscle and joint pain on my upper body which made it somewhat difficult to sleep. After one or two hours of sleep at 1:00 AM I woke up with a fever, headache, and worse muscle and joint pain (upper body only). When I woke up I was sweating profusely that the bed was lightly wet and extremely hot from all the heat my body was letting go. An ice pack can relieve the headache and fever. However, I was still not able to sleep. At 4:00 AM I made the decision to consume 800 mg of ibuprofen and it took 20 minutes for my headache and fever to go away. Yet, after being able to sleep for 30 minutes, I woke up again to the same headache and fever. Around 10:00 AM the symptoms were partly gone and was finally able to get sleep after a long night.

Once I awoke at around 6pm, I had irritated eyes, extreme nausea, extreme dizziness, insatiably low body temperature, extreme shivers, migraine because of my head uncontrollably shaking, and dry mouth. I felt like I was in 20 degree weather and nothing I could do would heat my body up. My body grew so tired from the uncontrollable shaking that I could not get out of bed to get my phone to call 911. Every symptom I was experiencing was not mild and was to the level of extreme. This lasted until around 9am. I have been slowly recovering since then (currently almost 9pm) and feel only 70% back to normal.

                                                Patient was administered the Janssen COVID vaccine at 403 pm. I returned back to the pharmacy to prep his partner&#39;s vaccine and when I came back at 405 pm, he was loopy with his head swaying. He wasn&#39;t responding to verbal communication by his spouse and me nor through touch as I shook his shoulder. He then lost consciousness and so I lifted his head to check for breathing and pulse which he had. I asked my technician to call 911, and asked my other tech to help me transition him to the floor so we can raise his legs to provide blood flow to his head. Mid-transition, he had a seizure. We brought him completely to the floor and just as I was about to turn him to his side, he regained consciousness. Pupils were dilated, breathing normal, pulse elevated. He also was able to speak immediately and confirmed feeling &#34;okay&#34;. I then had my technician remain outside with him laying on the ground as I returned back inside the pharmacy to call management and my technician was still on the phone with EMS. Paramedics and management arrived within 10 minutes upon which patient was then taken to the hospital. Wife followed and we rescheduled her vaccine.

                                                immediately following the vaccination (within seconds) patients head dropped down. I said his name bc I thought he was looking down at first but he would not respond for about 20-30 seconds before he came to.  He blacked out for that short amount of time he said everything suddenly went black. He was able to get to the floor with assistance once he came to and he laid down, he was sweating and pale. his BP was 138-78 pulse 88 about 10 minutes after the event.  he had reported being nervous when he first arrived for his appointment. he also has severe food allergies but never had a reaction to a vaccine.

Patient asked for a glass of water. When getting the patient water my technician said she saw the patients eyes roll to the back of his head and that he was going to pass out. I went out to the patient and helped him to the ground and had him lay flat on his back with his feet elevated. After 3-4 minutes the patient was feeling better. Patient never lost consciousness.

Prior to administration, pt informed me that he was afraid of needles.  After administration, we discussed the type of needle that was used (vanish point syringe) and the mechanism of how it works. He seemd anxious so I advised that it was ok for them to sit in the room for a few minutes instead of getting up to wait in the lobby, I left the door open for them.  I walked back into the pharmacy and his girlfriend alerted me that he had passed out. He regained conscious within a few seconds. I advised he sit with his head between his legs, as he mentioned feeling light headed, feeling hot and sweaty. he threw up a little into the trash. pt sat in room for at least 30 minutes until he felt better. was given a few cups of water while sitting. did not leave until he felt comfortable and no longer light headed. pt mentioned that his last vaccine was about 2 years ago and the same response occured then.

I took Tums, Pepto, and other prescriptions to try and alleviate those pains. None of those worked so around 5:30- 6pm (4/25/2021), I went to ER. When I went in they took blood work, a urine sample, and then gave me Iv fluids, and other medications. The Dr. confirmed that I was dehydrated, and I had a normal reaction to the shot. I was in the ER for about 2-3 hours, and then they let me to go home. I went to work the next day.

He stated that he felt dizzy.  He started to jerk his head backwards (911 called) and then his head fell forward, unresponsive.  At his time, we used an ammonia inhalant close to the nose.  He started to move and we brought him to the floor supine with a pillow at his feet and then his head.  Soon, he was able to sit up and we brought him water to drink.  He was subsequently cleared by the EMT to go home.

I felt a very extreme pins and needles feeling in both my hands and my feet, and my vision began to fade. After about 30 seconds of that and beginning to panic, I stood up and knocked on the doctors door and asked for water and told him how I was feeling. After about a few minutes of sitting and drinking Gatorade my vision returned fully and I began feeling stronger again. Since then I only feel a slight pain around the injection site.

He still appeared disoriented for several minutes. Patient said he hadn&#39;t eaten since breakfast. He was given crackers and water. EMT arrived and took vitals.

The hyperactivity of having the uncontrollable body shaking accelerated my heart palpitations and felt intense pain in my chest. This reaction lasted for about an hour and felt like I needed to go to emergency care.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after my vaccine, I started to feel fatigue and body aches.  An hour after that I experienced intense chills and a sense of dread. I put a heater on myself with two layers of thick blankets, but it didn&#39;t help. My fingers and parts of my face started to tingle and go numb and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep in spite of me doing breathing exercises and lying down. Eventually the chills turned into a fever and my body temperature suddenly shot up. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer, but it was certainly over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite my relief from the chills, I still couldn&#39;t sleep.  I wasn&#39;t remarkably stressed/anxious, I just couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I&#39;m not typically an insomniac, and upon speaking to others who received the same vaccine, they&#39;ve also reported intense chills and an inability to fall asleep.

The next morning (Sunday) I woke up with a fever, chills, sweats, and fatigue that lasted until about 24 hours after I received the vaccine. The following day (Monday) I felt completely fine and had no adverse symptoms or side effects. Tuesday was fine as well until about 2pm after I ate lunch, during a meeting my arm went numb as well as my legs and I had trouble concentrating and could not hold a conversation. Went home and slept until Wednesday morning. Today, Wednesday, I am still not feeling normal and am having trouble concentrating at work, low light seems to help.

Then he began to sweat excessively all over his body. His face turned pale and the pharmacist began taking his blood pressure which dropped very low. He then began to feel nauseated. Then he started to get body chills. We monitored my husband there for another 30min and he slowly was coming back to his normal self. He had a small headache but was fine enough to leave.

                                                Severe body aches, bad headache, bad chills, lack of energy. I woke up at 4:30am the morning after receiving the vaccine needing to use the restroom, but I could barely get out of bed because of my severe body aches and lack of energy. When I did manage to get out of bed, I struggled to even stand up. I took 800mg of ibuprofen at that time (around 4:30am) for the pain, which helped. I spent more than the first half of my day in bed under layers of blankets until about 3:00pm, where I finally felt good enough to get out of bed. I didn?t feel the body aches completely go away until the morning of the 8th, 3 days after receiving the vaccine.

Leading up to the hear rate increasing I was fine and just enjoying my day. No drugs or alcohol or did not do any exercise that day. Felt uncomfortable and with some anxiety I visited a urgent care facility. The visit was about 45 minutes and left. As I am writing this, my heart rate is still a bit above normal but doing better.

Patient was consulted about what to expect, side effects, and asked if he had any additional questions prior to receiving vaccination.  Patient declined and said he wanted to have the vaccine administered.  Patient sat down in the designated waiting area.  Approximately 2-5 minutes later patient blacked out and his body weight caused the chair he was sitting in to flip over, thus landing on the floor.  EMS was called.  Patient came to about 30-60 seconds later.  Patient was disoriented, sweaty, pale, and shaky.  Blood pressure was taken with a result of 143/95.  EMS arrived and evaluated the patient.  Patient admitted to having nothing to eat or drink today and being very anxious previous to getting the vaccine.  There were no signs of an allergic reaction.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was checked about 20 minutes later and was returning towards normal.  Patient declined transport to the hospital, but mother was called to come pick him up.  Patient was advised to get something to eat soon and to rest and be observed for the next 24 hours.

                                                I got th eJassen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at 10:50am. When the needle was removed, blood ran down my arm. That has never happened, but it might have been the nurse. I had nausea for a few minutes afterwards, but I think that was due to the blood. I didn&#39;t feel like eating after the shot. Hours later, around 5pm or so, I started to feel hypersensitive and weak. I also started to have a fever that went up to 102.2 farenheit before decided to take ibuprofen.  I had shakes, a heartbeat of 146, and a headache. It lasted all through the night and into the next day. Around 11:20am, whenever I moved my head, I would feel pain in my head. By the end of this day, I started to feel more like myself. By the start of the third day, all I had was pain in my left arm from the shot. It was strange that the pain got worse from Day 1 to Day 3, but that might be from how the vaccine was given and the blood that ran down my arm at that time. Another thing is my appetite has gone down a lot. I don&#39;t want to eat and when I do, I just want to stop. It&#39;s been a couple days, so I&#39;m hoping my appetite will come back.

                                                So it happened later when I got home, but I suffered from extreme body and muscle pain, heavy fatigue, severe naseua, a fever at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and severe migraines. This continued till about 8 am the next morning when my fever finally broke, and the other symptoms have gradually lessened over the period of today.

                                                Patient had reported previously losing consciousness after vaccination a few years prior.  About one or two minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient lost consciousness and experienced mild convulsions lasting in total about 10 seconds.  His mother was present and explained this was the same reaction he had experienced several years earlier with a previous vaccine.  The patient regained consciousness and reported that he felt dizzy, but otherwise okay.  He appeared clammy and asked for some water.  I gave him a bottle of water, which he drank slowly.  He reported to us feeling the same as he had after the previous vaccine reaction.  As patient was conscious and speaking clearly, I watched him and asked him to wait until he felt comfortable to stand.  At one point he asked to sit on the floor, but was eventually able to sit on the chair again, then move to another chair in our waiting area about 20 minutes post-vaccination.  I asked him to wait for a total of 30 minutes or longer if he felt anything unusual.  At 6:39 approached me and said her son was feeling normal and they would be leaving.

Fever and body aches subsided in the morning, but still don&#39;t feel right and couldn&#39;t exercise.   Brain fog came on about 4:00 after 11:00 am shot. Very difficult to concentrate and do work, found myself walking into rooms and forgetting why. Brain fog is still there today while body aches have subsided, very challenging to focus or work on computer and just feel slow and dumb.

I immediately went over to him, at which point I noticed he was sweating profusely and stated he felt a little light headed. Less than 1 minute afterwards, he stopped talking and his eyes began to roll back, at which point his upper body began to slide over to once side as if he was going to fall. I immediately caught him, motioned for someone to call emergency services  and continued to call him name. He did not respond, was pale and blacked out for about 30 secs. He was still breathing thankfully. When he regain consciousness, he stated that he felt better but he felt some tingling sensation in his forearms bilaterally. Thankfully at this point emergency services were present and upon taking his vitals, realized that his HR and BP were significantly low for someone of his age.

Then regained consciousness but had shaky hands, SOB, and in tears. He was provided with water and asked he may take off the mask if breathing is difficult. Taking the mask ease the breathing a little, but still SOB. Gave him a brown paper bag  to breath into and as him to take deep breath in &amp; out. He did that few times, then regained his normal breathing. Saw him looking down to his phone, which I told him to lift his head up to his eyelevel to decrease the dizziness. Was situated for about at least 30 minutes, then he said he was feeling better and he wants to leave as his friend is outside to pick him up and left.

Things seem to go fine for a while until the day after he received his J &amp;J vaccine in April 28, 2021.  Reports having the usual post vaccine symptoms such as myalgias and malaise but the following day  while at the barbershop he reports having another syncopal episode.  He reports a prodromal phase that includes shortness of breath, numbness of the lips and a generalized warm feeling.  During this episode he denied any loss of consciousness, as he was able to unlock his phone and respond to the people around him.  He denies any myoclonic movements or jerks.  He denies any postictal symptoms.  Patient has been seen in the ED 3 times within the last week.  On 6/10/2021 while at the base clinic, he reports feeling like he was about to pass out and was brought to the emergency department for further evaluation.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, headaches.  He endorses some chest pain when he lays down flat that is relieved by leaning forward.  He denies any recent illness.  Denies any new medications or changes to his diet or hydration status.    The day prior to admission, his ED visit for weakness and presyncope occurred shortly after PT eval at the base.  He felt very lightheaded and he attributes that to not eating and drinking prior to the PT eval.     Work-up in the ED included EKG which showed ST elevation in leads V3 and V4 in a biphasic pattern.  CT chest which showed no PE or consolidation pneumonia or pleural effusion.  CMP was remarkable for potassium of 3.4 serum bicarbonate of 21.  CBC was normal.  CK was slightly elevated at 913.  Troponin was negative.  Lactic acid was 1.9.  UA with no concern for infectious process.  UDS was negative.  Due to EKG findings reported above, patient was discussed with cardiologist who recommended that patient be admitted for observation.   Upon further discussion with patient, it was clear that his chest discomfort improved when leaning forward, and his EKG was consistent with diffuse ST elevation.  With a clinical diagnosis of acute idiopathic pericarditis, patient was initiated on colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily and ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.  He is to continue his colchicine therapy for 3 months and his ibuprofen therapy for 1 to 2 weeks with a gradual de-escalation of that ibuprofen by 200 mg/week.  He has follow-up with cardiology scheduled.  Cardiology mentioned in their notes that they would obtain an echocardiogram to rule out structural heart disease and recommended a 2-week event monitor upon discharge with a 3-week follow-up with tilt table testing and exercise stress testing.  Cardiology had high suspicion for possible vasovagal.  Echocardiogram was unremarkable without pericardial effusion.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

On April 3rd he had non-specific changes in his hands that he attributed to cold weather that led to discomfort when running them under warm water. By monday APril 5th he was having worsening sensitivity in his hands and feet to heat, touch and experienced numbness. he also began to have difficulty walking. He went to the ER April 6th and was discharged April 7th after undergoing MRI of the brain and spinal cord, labs and lumbar puncture, with a presumptive diagnosis of early Guillain-barre Syndrome. His symptoms continued to worse, loss of gait was more pronounced as well as loss of balance and new off sensations in his tongue. He was admitted to the hospital, continued to undergo diagnostic workout. Results from tests on APril 6th came back positive for Anti nuclear antibodies and high protein in his CSF. He was treated with 3 days of infused Immunoglobolin therapy and was discharged on April 11th with a diagnosis of likely GBS.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Starting on 4/11/21 at around 12:00 pm I started to have a numbness on both sides of my face. It felt as though there were pins and needles throughout my face. I would say that it was a 4/10 in terms of intensity. At first I thought maybe it was due to drinking coffee without food or other water (I don&#39;t regularly drink coffee but I have never had these symptoms from coffee before). However, even after eating food and drinking a sugary drink around 4:00 pm, the pins and needles remained. The symptoms began to subside at 6 pm or 7 pm.  The only other normal symptoms that I had were feeling tired on 4/8/21 and 4/9/21. Also, on 4/9/21 I had very slight muscle soreness throughout my body. I have also had difficulty concentrating which may or may not be related.

                                                (Saturday)When I came home after I received the vaccine I didn&#39;t really have anything to do, so I decided to take a nap and rest. I think after I woke up is when I started to feel the side effects. I can&#39;t remember exactly but I started feeling cold. I didn&#39;t think too much of it I just thought it was a cold day (which was quickly turning to night). Later that night I started feelinga bit dizzy and my head was hot but I still had chills. Since I had a had a blanket with me, and I think I was starting to feel what would become muscle aches, I just didn&#39;t want to move from the couch to my room. Feeling chills the rest of the night, I realized it was bad choice, since one of my family members left a window open. The cold air of the night really exacerbated my chills. Despite the cold I was still able to sleep, but the next day (Sunday) I did have a slight cough which I think was from experiencing the cold air of the night and not a side effect from the vaccine. (Sunday) This is when I really felt all the side effects. I felt weak, chills, headache, dizziness, muscle aches,(I&#39;m not sure if I had a fever, I couldn&#39;t think clearly my head felt hot). I haven&#39;t had a hangover but I think that is what it would feel like to have one. I basically slept most of day Sunday ; This time in my room with  3 blankets (light blankets )and heat up (felt like 80°F under blankets). I was sweating under the blankets but it really helped warm me up and alleviate my chills. I woke up later that day to a call to help my sister with some work. I couldn&#39;t drive, felt weak and dehydrated(dark orange/yellow pee), but she insisted so she picked me up and scolded me for not eating anything all day(besides the side effects I mention, I think I may have also lost my appetite because I felt dizzy). I was still feeling my head aching after I woke up, still had muscle aches and a slight cough too. It was raining that day so I put on a winter coat with layers underneath to help with my chills. At her home she gave me a Gatorade (and water) which I think really helped since I was sweating a lot under the blankets when I fell asleep. She also gave me some home cooked meals she made. The combination of drinks, food, and familial concern really helped me recover. By Monday my cough was gone and the side effects had worn off to the point that I could go to work safely.   My mother &amp; father also received vaccine at the same time I got it. My father also experienced side effects but his started later with the most effects felt on Tuesday. My mother did not get any side effects.

The headache went away before the appointment (did not take any medication); however the headache returned about 10 minutes after I got vaccinated. A few hours later the headache converted to a migraine resulting in increased nausea. Overnight I developed a fever. Within 24 hours, all the symptoms were gone. At this time I have fully recovered from all side effects but am monitoring my heath to see if anything else comes up.

The pharmacist immediately went to the aide of the patient.  The patient was laid on the ground and we began to get a blood pressure reading.  We also gave the patient cold pack to place on the skin.  The patient never lost consciousness and was verbal and responding to pharmacist questions the entire time.  We asked multiple times if he needed EMS and he each time told us he did not.  His status continued to improve with deep breaths and cooling the skin.  After 10-15 minutes he felt like he could sit up in the chair and did just fine and continued to recover.  We kept watch over him.

Went to bed around 10:30 and woke up about 3 hours later at 1:30. Had chills and was shaking when I got up. Could not really fall back asleep. Chills turned into a fever. That morning I started to get a headache. I sounded congested at one point, but no runny nose. I also had body and joint aches.  I took Excedrin three times that day. Once in the morning, once in the afternoon, once before bed. I used zquil to sleep a little bit in the afternoon and again at night.

After I administered the vaccine, the patient got light headed and I asked him if he would like to lay down. Before he could respond, the patient collapsed off his chair hitting the side of the plastic trash bin in our patient care room. I caught him before he hit the ground. I asked if he could hear me after saying his name a few times, no response. I assessed his subjective vitals and could tell he stopped breathing. Called for Pharmacy resident to grab and administer an epi pen. Patient responded within 30 seconds of epi pen administration and started breathing again. Proceeded to call emergency services, first responders arrived within 5 minutes and administered IV fluids and oral ondansetron. Patient left with the ambulance and will follow up tomorrow to make sure everything is ok.

Patient was told to remain seated and was monitored by pharmacist and staff. After 20 minutes, he was still not feeling well. He was moved into a different observation area. Based on symptoms it appeared he was having a a vasovagal reaction. He did not want to lie down and elevate his feet. At approximately 1/2 hour, he became nauseous and threw up. We continued to monitor him. He still had a headache and said he felt off. He had no swelling in the face and was speaking without issue. No hives were noticed. Patient said he was having a hard time breathing- I suggested he remove his mask to get more fresh air. After removing the mask, he said it felt better to breathe. In total, patient was monitored for 3 hours. He did not lose conscience, exhibit facial swelling or hives.  Patient went back to work for 1 hour then left to go home.  Prior to receiving the shot, patient showed a lot of anxiety and was hesitant to get vaccine. In the end, he decided he wanted to get it. Per medical staff at his work, he does tend to be high stressed and anxious. I followed up with patient on 6/22/21. He stated that he was feeling a lot better. He did have redness at the injection site- I explained he could ice the area. He still had a headache= I instructed him he could take a pain reliever. He mentioned he had a purple spot on his back. I asked if he had any other spots and said he would have to check. I suggested he contact his PCP and make an appointment to be seen.

                                                About 11 days after receiving the shot, I started experiencing chest tightness/pain. The pain persisted for four days and I went to urgent care. Urgent Care referred me to ER to screen for blood clots. After returning from ER, I started feeling sharp pains in multiple places all over my body?hands, fingers, toes, feet, calves, shins, forearms, back. Chest pain also continued.   The chest pain has subsided, but I still experience shooting pains in arms, legs, hands, feet, toes, fingers, and occasionally my back.  Pain is a 3-4/10 on average, but persistent. Some days are better than others. Some days the pain is mostly in a forearm (sometimes both) and the next day it&#39;s in a leg (sometimes both). Some pain seems to be in/along muscles, some in/along bones. It sort of feels like there&#39;s a small electrical storm in my body.   Movement does not seem to have any effect on the pain.

Took 3 Tylenol at around 3:00 AM when it became clear I was not well. Fell asleep around 5:00 AM after Tylenol kicked in and got super hot instead of super cold. Woke up around 11:00 AM with no fever, but slightly achy. Aches went away by nighttime, and felt 100% the next morning, April 3rd.

Had insomnia all night.   6:00 am: woke up with bad headache, slight fever.   7:00 am: got out of bed and had vertigo and was running into walls trying to walk to my living room, along with the worst migraine I?ve ever had. Also had dizziness, nausea,  chills, 100&#43;degree fever, aches, skin sensitive to touch, and severe tinnitus. All of the veins were visibly popping out of my head.   As the day went on, everything got worse. Any time I moved, my head would throb so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.   3:45 pm:  the headache started to finally go away. It would only hurt if I moved fast. At this point my fever was only slightly high, about 99 degrees. I was still unstable when I walked and dizzy. I went from being super cold, to being super hot and sweaty. And I was alternating between cold &amp; hot and sweaty for the rest of the night. Was also having some memory issues, repeating things when I was having a conversation with someone over the phone.   I was sweating all night when I was sleeping.   Saturday 4/10: 7:00am: woke up with a slight headache; still out of it and dizzy.   8:00am: after being awake for about an hour or so, I looked in the mirror and my whole face (around the lips, cheeks, and jawline, and under the eyes) was really swollen and puffy. My face was even mis-colored. Under my eyes was purple and yellow, and my cheeks were white.   Some confusion persisted throughout the day as well as dizziness.

                                                I experienced all of the listed side effects (except, I didn&#39;t have an actual fever, I felt like I had a fever, but my temperature was normal). The chills and muscle pain were extremely intense 6 hours after I received my vaccine. I could not stop shivering, or get warm enough. That would be followed by a feeling that I was too warm and I would begin sweating profusely. I also experienced a few additional side effects I could not find listed:   I felt especially sensitive to stimuli as if normal sensations were heightened (e.g. hot water in a shower felt painful, running fingers through my hair felt like I was having my hair pulled, I kept my eyes squinted because the sunlight through the windows felt too bright.)  I was extremely irritable and became extremely frustrated easily. I mean frustrated to an embarrassing degree over small things that didn&#39;t matter. It was inconsistent with my day-to-day temperament. It felt like an adrenaline rush came in response to the most minor of inconveniences.

Pt. came to profusely sweating, pale, and feeling dizzy.  We took his BP and kept monitoring it for 45 minutes after we had him lay down.  His BP continued to rise and was normal.  Pt. was nervous before vaccine administration (shaking).  After event, Pt. stated this has happened in the past with donating blood.  Pt.&#39;s girlfriend picked him up, so he did not drive home.

                                                One week after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, several small bruises (6-8) appeared on the back of my left leg. Throughout the day, my leg developed a soreness that, after reading a 10 Feb 2021 story in the newspaper about COVID vaccine recipients developing immune thrombocytopenia caused me to seek medical treatment in the afternoon of 4/6/2020. I first visited an urgent care facility where my high blood pressure (130/98) combined with my slight lightheadedness, soreness in the leg and observes bruising were enough for the tending physician to recommend rushing to the ER for bloodwork to be performed immediately. I was admitted to the ER in the early evening with an elevated blood pressure (~150/111) and the bruising still prevalent. The tending nurse practitioner authorized a complete blood count (CBC) and discharged me an hour later when the results came back ?extremely close to normal,? noting that my platelet count of 194 was no immediate cause for concern. Since then, the bruising and soreness has subsided.

I initially felt really warm in my arm and my heart started to race for a bit. That subsided pretty quickly. Then I got really dizzy, lightheaded and warm and sweaty while waiting the 15 minutes. Then my vision started to blur and I felt tingly in both of my hands and both of my legs. According to others with me, I also went grey. I was given a cool cloth and fanned which helped with a lot of the issues. I also had my legs elevated and was given some slightly sugary food and drink to help the vaccine disperse better. Paramadics and amabulance arrived to assess me. I was improving by the time they arrived and was deemed stable, so I did not go to the hospital for this incident

About 5 hours after that I got chills that made me shake all over because I got a fever of 103. Then 2 hours later my heart started to beat very rapidly and got up to 126 beats per minute, my heart was also not only beating vast but very very hard. Then throughout the night and all of the next day, I had pain in my chest on the left side and also pain in my rib area on the left side. The pain lasted for over 24 hours and because of that I went to the emergency room. It turned out they didn&#39;t find anything life threatening at the emergency room but all the pain I had was very scary and very uncomfortable. It was a terrible experience and because of it, I am telling people not to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

                                                3 weeks after getting the vaccine on 3/26 I started to feel a slight numbness in my fingers. Wasn?t very noticeable and had some bad allergies that day so I chalked it up to that. About a week passes and it only slightly starts to get worse, and i can feel it in my feet as well. I was confused so I started asking about it around my work eventually it had started to affect my walking and it was clear something was wrong, I felt like I had lost balance in my legs and I was losing sense in my fingers. I stopped going to work and went to a doctor on 4/15.

Patient started to seize. I turned him to his side and tried to keep his mouth open in order for him to not bit his tongue. Meanwhile 911 was called. Patient had seized about 15-20 seconds, then suddenly he became calm and conscious. 911 dispatcher told us to keep him laid down on the floor till they get to the store. One of our coworker asked patient few questions to see if he remembered things. Paramedics came about 7 minutes later and took care of him. They let him go after evaluation. I called him later &amp; he had recovered.

                                                At approximately 8pm the day of the vaccination, I felt fatigued. I woke up the next morning feeling like I was definitely sick with the typical symptoms. I was resting all morning on the couch at the house I was dog sitting. At around 11:30am I took my daily Claritin and two ibuprofens. At around 12:15pm, I was getting my haircut and felt like I was going to pass out. I asked the hairstylist to grab water and something to cool me off. I didn&#39;t have much control of my body, ED was called, and paramedics showed up. About 5 minutes into the incident my arms and legs started tingling and felt like someone was trying to twist my skin. An IV was put into me and about 5 minutes later I snapped out of the episode.

                                                Last week Monday - June 14 I worked 1pm-9pm. My opening pharmacist left around I&#39;d say 2pm, or 2:15pm~ish and hadn&#39;t witnessed the incident. So somewhere around that approximate time I was inside the pharmacy working on a back computer by drive thru and I heard someone yell for help in the waiting area. It was the kind of help you just know means something really drastic has just occurred. I quickly entered the waiting area via the pharmacy consultation door and saw patient face down between two chairs and his nose had a consistent drip of blood that was apparent on the floor.   My technician who was in the consultation room told me he had received a Johnson and Johnson Covid vaccine probably within 5 minutes of the incident. With the combination of that information and the visualization of an active bleed, I made eye contact with another staff member inside the pharmacy at will call and told him to call 911 which he turned around immediately and did. The man was alone, but the woman who yelled for help was also calling 911 I believe. At this point I&#39;d say approximately every 3 seconds, a new drop of blood would emerge. There were a couple people nearby including the customer and I asked everyone to stay back a little, I surveyed the scene and it appeared to be safe and I approached patient as I tried to verbally get a response of some sort.  I asked if he could hear me, if he knew where he was and what happened, both with no response. The bystander recommended turning him on his side but with the unknown cause of the bleed and the recent vaccination I didn&#39;t know if it could be CNS or spinal related and since we were on the phone with EMS, we could get their recommendation of whether to move him or not.   Within 15-30 seconds probably, he started regaining consciousness and he was scared at first and rightfully so. He jolted up and back and looked at me like, &#34;why am I face down in my own blood (and probably in a lot of pain i&#39;m sure)&#34;, and it scared me a little to be honest. I told him what we had observed, and I saw the bridge of his nose stuck out beyond what was normal but I&#39;m not sure what normal is to him..?? I saw two small lacerations on the side of his nose and a pair of glasses on the floor. I couldn&#39;t determine if they were broken or not but surmised, he must have fainted and fallen off the chair and landed on his glasses which cut and may have even broken his nose. Or maybe the ground broke his nose. Either way it looked bad. There were several store team members around at this point (those listed in this report), and the patient was given paper towels for the bleeding and bottled water. There was a store use wheelchair we put him in when he was ready and wheeled him into the consultation room where he could be monitored until EMS arrived.  While speaking with the patient before EMS arrived, he rendered all the following information:           Never had a reaction to a vaccine before           Never had any knowledge of high or low BP issues           Doesn&#39;t recall ever feeling lightheaded or dizzy upon quickly erecting           Might have low blood sugar issues                   Reasonings for the above response:                             Hadn&#39;t eaten that day yet before his shot and was feeling a little anxious about it                            Last time he gave blood he hadn&#39;t eaten breakfast and passed out after that                                         This was the only other fainting history mentioned                                        He did say it was within the last 6 months  EMS arrived within another 2-3 minutes I&#39;d say at which time we had already began the cleaning process. We blocked off the area to other customers, we halted the vaccination process until the issue was resolved, I printed the Biohazard Spill procedures, we obtained the bio-hazard spill kit, and proceeded to clean with all the PPE and sanitization materials included within the kit. After the entire process was completed the store team even ran the cleaner over the area to go above and beyond.   The patient refused the ride to the hospital via ambulance due to costs and signed a medical waiver I believe..??

                                                Patient received the Jansen covid-19 vaccine today.   he was fine when he received the vaccine but when he was sitting in the chair in the pharmacy lobby he fainted.   I saw him fall out of chair and immediately ran out the door to assist him.  He fell out of chair face down on the floor.  When I reached him I rolled him over and spoke to him and he responded to me.  I had him remain on the floor for several minutes before I had him sit in the chair.  He bit his lip and there was a spot of blood and he hit his forehead on the floor.   We called emergency number and emergency medical team arrived shortly and took his vital signs and they were normal.   He was a little clammy and sweating a little.   I gave him a bottle of cold water to drink while he was sitting.   The emergency team checked him out and they ask him if he wanted to go to hospital and he declined going.   The emergency medical team left and I had him wait a while longer.   I had him call his mother to come and pick him up so he did not have to drive himself.  His mother arrived about 20 minutes later and I went over with her what had happened.  She took him home and I called to check on him after a few hours and he said he was doing fine.   He also stated while talking with him that he had never passed out when getting other vaccines or the flu shots previously.  He did state that he didn&#39;t like needles but was not afraid to get the vaccine.

I closed door and turned to grab epi-pen and diphenhydramine. When I turned back around, patient fell on the floor and was unresponsive. I asked my technician to call 911. Patient regained consciousness in about 10 seconds and I told him an ambulance was coming. I observed his breathing to be normal. He sat up against the wall in a cold sweat and told me this has happened to him one time when he donated blood. The ambulance and paramedic arrived very promptly. They took him to the ambulance.
