                                                Patient received vaccine in the AM of 3/16/21.  Patient was in his usual state of health when he went to bed the evening of 3/16/21.  He ate dinner normally and his PD was started as usual.  There were no overnight complications with his PD and he got up shortly before 8 AM.  Mom reports the dialysate from his bag was clear and normal and none of his dwell was retained.  She heard a loud thud from the bathroom around 8 AM and the patient was found by his mother having generalized convulsions (bilateral upper and lower extremities) and he appeared to be foaming at the mouth.  He did not respond to her and she called 911. The seizure stopped by the time EMS arrived and his initial GCS was 12, and 15 by the time they started transport.  He had another seizure en route around 9:30 AM and was given 2.5 mg versed and required bagging. Patient was loaded with Keppra and now has been on maintenance Keppra. Patient has not suffered any additional seizures and is currently undergoing an extensive workup by inpatient neurology team. Vaccine adverse effect currently remains on the differential for inciting event leading to seizure however additional labs are pending to rule out other causes (eg. viruses causing PML).  Patient was also diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and started on antibiotics at time of admission.

He convulsed for around ten seconds after about two minutes of being unconscious. Four to five healthcare workers attended to him, asking him to &#34;stay with us.&#34; They called an ambulance, and the medics monitored him for awhile. Heart rate dropped to 34 bpm, clothing drenched with perspiration. Blood sugar was slightly low, although he had eaten a late brunch of two fried eggs, sourdough toast and fruit salad. The last thing he remembers is a cold sensation shooting down his arm and into his left hand. He tried to talk to say he wasn&#39;t feeling well, but he couldn&#39;t form the words, so he raised his arm and then fainted. He felt generally unwell the rest of the day, and today he is still not fully recovered.

                                                After a few hours, developed a low grade headache and some soreness at the injection site.  About two hours later I started getting extremely cold, despite the temperature in the mid-high 70s. I covered up under blankets. I began feeling very tired and a general sick feeling. After about an hour and a half of progressively worse chills and cold sweat, I began to get very very hot and removed all blankets and eventually clothes. I took my temperature, which was at 102 f. At this point I drank some water and Gatorade and waited for it to pass. I also noticed that my Apple Watch heart rate detection was saying my heart rate was in the high 90s to low 100s despite me just laying in bed. This was alarming because my typical resting heart rate is in the low 60s. About two hours later I felt well enough to at least brush my teeth, but upon standing up was greeted with an extreme feeling of weakness and dizziness and it was hard to keep myself up right. I eventually was able to fall asleep, and upon waking up, felt better, but still not great. My heart rate was more normal at this point, I no longer had chills or a fever, but still had a headache and soreness across my body, worst at the injection site.

He was cold and clammy. He never lost consciousness.  It took him a couple  minutes to &#34;come back&#34; to alertness and feel better.   Severe headache, chills starting and began asthma symptoms (wheezing) at 11;30pm the night of the injection.. 2 extra strength Tylenol did not help. He was very cold and the headache did not let up after several hours.  Eventually he had a bout of sweats and he reports he was soaked.  In the morning, at 8 am the headache was still severe...was sensitive to noise, light and touch. He was given 2 extra strength Tylenol at 8 and then 2 Advil at 10am, which finally began to reduce symptoms. He was not hungry, felt weak, and finally by late night he was feeling better.  In the morning on Saturday he awoke with a swollen left eye and blood shot in that eye.

We were able to contact a friend of his and she was able to go to his dorm room and they called the campus on call nurse line. After speaking with her she instructed them to call 911 because she thought he could possibly be having a stroke. Patient was transported by ambulance to ER.

The severity of these symptoms decreased throughout the day but remained in the background for a while.

Subsided largely, but chills started and became more heightened after strenuous exercise later in the day. After 3 hours of sleep, awoke the next day with chest pain and difficulty moving. Heart rate (normally 60) spiked to 140 and could not see fit five seconds, had to call ambulance. Ambulance determined much of it was due to anxiety (multiple exams and significant work were due soon), and recommended medical supervision to ensure it did not escalate. Went to urgent care and was supervised until 1 pm, 24 hours after the vaccination, by which time symptoms had subsided

Pt was placed supine and was unconscious for approx 60 seconds with involuntary movements  of arms and upper body consistent to passing out (not seizure like in intensity).  confused, clamy/nauseas  upon awakening, remained supine for 2-3 minutes. upon sitting up pt became dizzy and laid down again.  paramedics arrived began assessment.  BP, EKG, BG all normal. pt reports not having eaten today, also reports congenital heart defect that was corrected surgically while an infant.  Mother arrived and decision was made in conjunction with paramedics to take pt to hospital for further eval based on his symptoms of lightheadedness/nausea continuing.

                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

                                                Immediately had a dull headache. About an hour and a half just didn&#39;t feel well and became very tired where he was dozing off.  About 7:00 pm started to shake.  This continued to get worse with severe jerking along with the uncontrollable shaking.  Had a rapid resting heart rate over 142 and a fever at 102.4.  Was incoherent, mumbling his words and not making any sense. Went to ER at 8:48 pm they did blood work, urine test and started an IV.  They weren&#39;t sure what was going on and first accused of doing drugs then wanted to do a spinal tap. His father stopped that and again told them it was from the covid vaccine. They finally gave him a shot of Ketorolac 30mg and LORazepan 1 mg. They sent him home and told him to take tylenol for his fever. spontaneous shaking kept on until late 3/11, along with a fever.  Friday 3/12 he is feeling better, fever has broke but not quite 100%.

The next day, I developed a fever of 100.2 and was really cold. For about a week, I would be fine during the day and would get really tired by the evening and extremely cold. I also started feeling tightness in my chest about 2 days after I got the vaccine. I contacted my doctor and she told me to take Tylenol and Albuterol.

An ambulance was called and arrived within less that 5 minutes and took over care.

As I was running to him pt started slipping out of his chair, as a women, who I later found out was his mother and I helped keep pt in chair as he fainted and then seized for about 2 seconds and then gained consciousness. Upon awakening pt said , what  just happened?&#34; The mother answered &#34;oh you just had a little seizure, you&#39;re fine.&#34; To my surprise, I asked the mother is this has happened before and she said yes when he sees needles/get shots.  I told them the ambulance was on it&#39;s why and the mother asked &#34;why?!&#34; I told her because your son just fainted/had a seizure and we want to make sure he is ok.  The pt refused to go to the hospital.  I did go back out there and mentioned to them that it is very important to answer questions truthfully any time they are asked as they failed to honestly answer our questions about ever feeling faint after receiving a vaccine. His blood pressure normalized and once the paramedics left so did they.

I thought nothing of this until around 7:30 where I began to have extreme chills and a headache. Around 9:00, I tried to get some water and I was too dizzy to walk at any normal pace. I took my temperature and it read at 101.9F. I proceeded to take ibuprofen, drink lots of water (about 80 oz that night), and go to sleep as best as I could.

His skin color was pale and when I went up to see how he was he bent over and vomited. After he vomited he said he felt a lot better. I asked him to remain seated and asked for my tech in the pharmacy to call 911, but he then said no and that he was feeling better. He said he felt clammy just before he vomited. I asked him to stay seated and got him some cold water. He remained in the waiting area another 15 minutes after to make sure no further problems. After 15 minutes he was feeling fine and I reassessed and his color returned to his skin and I noticed some redness around inner portion of both thighs, but he said that was from his eczema and that it was there already.  Allowed him to leave at 1:15pm and told him to seek medical attention right away if he felt any issues regarding trouble breathing. I called him an hour later to check up on him at 1:30pm and he was feeling fine. He thanked me over the phone.

My whole body felt as if it was vibrating, or falling asleep (the worst feeling I&#39;ve ever had.)

                                                It is now the next day, and I feel significantly better. I have pain at the injection site, some muscle fatigue, a little bit of a depleted appetite, tiredness in my eyes and head (likely due to lack of quality sleep), and a bit of sweating, but my pain has reduced to maybe a 2/10 or 1/10 (i.e., not even uncomfortable). I did end up getting decent sleep between 2 AM and 12 PM with only a few interruptions of family members checking on me. The only notable pain that is worrying me is abnormal soreness in my right wrist that is not the result of overuse, overextension, etc., although I was able to take care of that pain with another 3 Advil pills. I am considering scheduling a doctor&#39;s appointment, as I know the J&amp;J vaccine got recalled today for blood clots. My assumption is that because I am a healthy 20-year-old, my immune system overreacted to the vaccine, but I want to check to make sure that it doesn&#39;t cause any additional health problems.

                                                The patient had a needle phobia and was very anxious prior to the vaccine. Once the patient received the vaccine, he waited in the waiting area for 15 minutes post-vaccine. About 5 minutes after the vaccine, he notified the pharmacy staff that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and he was feeling faint. The pharmacy staff provided him with a glass of water and was monitoring him. He said he  felt like he fainted and wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he felt warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided him with an ice pack. He then notified the pharmacy staff that he urinated in his chair while waiting post-vaccine. He wanted to be checked out and wanted us to call 911 . The patient began to feel better after about 20 minutes. The EMT arrived and checked the patient. Even though, the patient was feeling better, the EMT recommended the patient be checked further anyways. He was brought to the Triage center and was there for about 1 hour, according to the patient, and was feeling better. He said he felt slightly fatigued that day and the following day, but other than that he was feeling back to normal and no issues. He stated he has severe needle phobia and has experienced these fainting spells and anxiousness in the past. We followed up with the patient and he provided this information to us. He stated he was feeling good and back to normal. He had no further questions or concerns. We told him to follow up with us if questions or concerns came up.

She happened to be off today and was home with her son.  She stated that the seizure was like a Grand Mal seizure that lasted approximately 5 minutes. She stated that he has had a diabetic seizure before when his blood glucose levels were low.  She stated his blood glucose was 71.  She said this was different, he had no residual after effects. He was not incontinent of bowel or bladder and he woke up quickly afterwards.  About an hour after the seizure he ate and only complained of a headache.  She gave him ibuprofen 600 mg and he put an ice pack on his head.  She said he is better. She stated that she is a nurse and this really scared her, since it was so different than any other seizure he has ever had.  She was thankful she was home.  She call his primary healthcare provider and she did  not feel he needed to be seen.

I fell back asleep and when I woke up the fever had broken and the chills had improved but the soreness and headache remained. I took Tylenol in the afternoon and that helped the symptoms but by the time I had gone to bed the chills had returned but not a fever. When I woke up in the middle of the night (night 2) the chills had stopped and I woke up with a moderate headache and sweating profusely. After falling asleep and awaking in the morning I felt much better with the exception of a minor headache.

After about 20 seconds he came to and leaned forward but wasn&#39;t oriented to time and place. As I was talking to him, trying to assess his breathing, he slumped back in the chair and began shaking much more violently.  I asked the store director to call EMS at that point, I took his mask off at that point to better assess his breathing. After about 15 seconds, he came to again. At that point, I had him lean forward with his elbows on his knees, and he didn&#39;t lose conciousness after that. I took his blood pressure (70/22) and pulse (52, light and hard to find). EMS arrived soon after and at that point patient felt much better. EMS decided not to transport the patient to the ER. They instructed patient to follow up with his provider. Patient left the vaccine area under his own power about half an hour later.

                                                The patient started heading towards the pharmacists from the observation area stating that he felt dizzy. We grabbed a chair and had him sit down. Almost immediately he collapsed to the floor before we could grab him. He fell face first onto the floor. He moaned and shook. With the assistance of a medic and police office, he was rolled onto his back and his feet were elevated. He started to regain consciousness. EMTs were called to assess him after his head hit the floor. He was monitored by EMTs for 30 minutes. He refused to go to the hospital and was instructed to call 911 if he had additional symptoms.

At 3 am headache was migraine strength and was having full body aches (except for arms), extreme lower back and lower abdominal pain (he said it must be like what women experience in labor or during their menstrual cycle).   He got up and took temperature (normal) and blood ox (100 %SpO2 on two fingers).  He got a wet rag for eyes and tried to fall asleep.  He said he felt hot with cover on and cold with cover off.   At 5:50 am his father gave him two Motrin (400mg total), applesauce and a ice pack for his head and back.  I checked on him thru-out day and he seemed restless.  He woke up at 3 pm on 4/8/2021 said headache and major back pain/abdominal pains were gone. He still feels slightly achy, but fine otherwise. as of 8:24 pm.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Following the shot was the expected soreness. Then pain throughout my arms like pins and needles  began about 8 hours later. I self treated with Tylenol. After going to bed, I woke at 5am nauseous and in pain. I was freezing  even though I would normally be fine. I was shaking which made the pain in all of my limbs and back hurt more. The day following the injection, the pain and nausea didn&#39;t go away. It hurt to pick up and hold things. It is now two days after injection and I keep fighting nausea after eating. I keep stretching and it barely keeps the soreness in my arm at bay. I can feel my hands starting to cramp just from typing this even though I would normally be fine.

                                                4/8/21: Vaccine Received - 6:oopm  By 9:00pm, patient begins suffering from intense headache, hearing loss in both ears, and blurred vision.  For the ears, it was as if someone had taken ear plugs and coated the ear drum with them, making it hard to hear.  Headache was treated with an ice pack on the temple for immediate site relief.  Began to feel tired and worn out while in bed, loss of vision begins to occur as well.  Body aches begin.  4/9/21:  Patient is woken up from intense body spams throughout the entire body.  Once awake, the entire body was spasming, causing the patient to be unable to control his body, and all extremities.  After sipping some water for about an hour, the spasms subsided in all areas of the body except for the legs and shoulders.   4:00pm patient begins to feel extremely nauseous, begins having increased bowel movements including rapid diarrhea, and extreme stomach cramping.  Deep body aches and pain continue.  4/10/21:  10am: patients body begins to become covered in hives all across his skin, inside his mouth, under his feet, and in his hair.  Hives continued to grow, with no reddening of the skin however.  This was treated with Benadryl for the remainder of the day; hives subsiding around 6:15pm. Dehydration also occurred, and hospital treatment for IV saline bag was soon to be utilized had the patient not been able to rehydrate himself.  Body aches continue

I was walking across my room and passed out waking up on the floor. Muscle cramps and tightness followed this.  I could not move my muscles for roughly 12 hours. After 24 hours from receiving vaccine these extreme symptoms seemed to fade and I was left with fatigue, soreness and fever as expected. This lasted for the next 3 days

                                                The patient (self) felt a soreness around the site of the injection begin immediately and grow throughout the day. The soreness continued to at least April 12 (at the time of this report). The soreness was immediate unlike a tetanus shot but the pain the following days was 2-3 times less that of a tetanus shot. By 4pm the same day, the patient felt fatigue and tired and had difficulty staying awake. Around 6pm the patient took 200 mg of ibuprofen by mouth because of a strong headache. At 7pm the patient was experiencing the following: headache, warm head to the touch, shivering/shaking,  fatigue, mild aching. The patients pulse was consistent 100-104 bpm. The patients temperature at 8:30pm was 100.4 F. The patient then went to bed at 9pm. Patient had trouble falling asleep due to fever, shaking, aching. The patient slept intermittently until midnight. At midnight, the patient noticed the fever and shaking had ceased but the headache and aching were still strong. The aching was all over the body. The patients eyes hurt to move. The aching was constant and at times was throbbing. At 3am the patient could still not sleep well so he took 650 mg of Acetaminophen by mouth. The patient began to notice some relief approximately 30-60 min after. The patient fell asleep after the relief began and slept soundly til 9:15 am, April 11th. The patient awoke feeling much better. All side effects had stopped with the exception of a feeling of weakness and slight dizziness. The patient was able to carry on normally and took no more medications.

                                                I first started developing chills and a mild fever about eleven or twelve hours after taking the vaccine. My entire body felt like burning and a headache came up not long after the fever.  I could barely fall asleep at night due to body ache and excessive sweating. The headache and body pain persisted till the next morning, and as of I am writing this response now, I feel extremely weak and I have no appetite at all.

                                                I took a nap after around an hour of receiving my shot at around 1:40pm. Once I awoke at around 6pm, I had irritated eyes, extreme nausea, extreme dizziness, insatiably low body temperature, extreme shivers, migraine because of my head uncontrollably shaking, and dry mouth. I felt like I was in 20 degree weather and nothing I could do would heat my body up. My body grew so tired from the uncontrollable shaking that I could not get out of bed to get my phone to call 911. Every symptom I was experiencing was not mild and was to the level of extreme. This lasted until around 9am. I have been slowly recovering since then (currently almost 9pm) and feel only 70% back to normal.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  The vaccine was given at 10:45 AM. At 4:00 PM I began feeling nauseous. At 9:00 or 10:00 PM I began feeling both muscle and joint pain on my upper body which made it somewhat difficult to sleep. After one or two hours of sleep at 1:00 AM I woke up with a fever, headache, and worse muscle and joint pain (upper body only). When I woke up I was sweating profusely that the bed was lightly wet and extremely hot from all the heat my body was letting go. An ice pack can relieve the headache and fever. However, I was still not able to sleep. At 4:00 AM I made the decision to consume 800 mg of ibuprofen and it took 20 minutes for my headache and fever to go away. Yet, after being able to sleep for 30 minutes, I woke up again to the same headache and fever. Around 10:00 AM the symptoms were partly gone and was finally able to get sleep after a long night.

                                                Patient had known fear of needles and despite mitigation strategies, once he knew the vaccine was administered, he began to feel weak and look pale. He lost consciousness twice but only for a few seconds and then he &#34;came to.&#34; I helped along with the mother to lay him down to prevent injury. Patient was alert, breathing, and responding, but still appeared pale, &#34;clamy&#34; shaky and sweaty.  Code was followed with store management responding, ambulance arrived to take care of patient within minutes.

                                                Patient was visibly nervous prior to receiving the vaccine. About 5 minutes after administration (during the 15 minute watch period), patient appeared to be slumped over in the chair. He had eyes closed and seemed to be shaking slightly. Pharmacist and tech grabbed the emergency kit and laid patient on the floor. After a few more seconds the patient woke up and was able to respond to questions. He was very pale, sweaty, reported feeling clammy and dizzy. Patient claimed he had not eaten since the morning. We gave him some water and a pb&amp;j sandwich. Patient stated he felt better and he just gets very nervous around needles. The patient sat with us for another 30 minutes until his grandmother and cousin were able to come pick him up from the pharmacy.

                                                Patient was administered the Janssen COVID vaccine at 403 pm. I returned back to the pharmacy to prep his partner&#39;s vaccine and when I came back at 405 pm, he was loopy with his head swaying. He wasn&#39;t responding to verbal communication by his spouse and me nor through touch as I shook his shoulder. He then lost consciousness and so I lifted his head to check for breathing and pulse which he had. I asked my technician to call 911, and asked my other tech to help me transition him to the floor so we can raise his legs to provide blood flow to his head. Mid-transition, he had a seizure. We brought him completely to the floor and just as I was about to turn him to his side, he regained consciousness. Pupils were dilated, breathing normal, pulse elevated. He also was able to speak immediately and confirmed feeling &#34;okay&#34;. I then had my technician remain outside with him laying on the ground as I returned back inside the pharmacy to call management and my technician was still on the phone with EMS. Paramedics and management arrived within 10 minutes upon which patient was then taken to the hospital. Wife followed and we rescheduled her vaccine.

The hyperactivity of having the uncontrollable body shaking accelerated my heart palpitations and felt intense pain in my chest. This reaction lasted for about an hour and felt like I needed to go to emergency care.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after my vaccine, I started to feel fatigue and body aches.  An hour after that I experienced intense chills and a sense of dread. I put a heater on myself with two layers of thick blankets, but it didn&#39;t help. My fingers and parts of my face started to tingle and go numb and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep in spite of me doing breathing exercises and lying down. Eventually the chills turned into a fever and my body temperature suddenly shot up. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer, but it was certainly over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite my relief from the chills, I still couldn&#39;t sleep.  I wasn&#39;t remarkably stressed/anxious, I just couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I&#39;m not typically an insomniac, and upon speaking to others who received the same vaccine, they&#39;ve also reported intense chills and an inability to fall asleep.

The next morning (Sunday) I woke up with a fever, chills, sweats, and fatigue that lasted until about 24 hours after I received the vaccine. The following day (Monday) I felt completely fine and had no adverse symptoms or side effects. Tuesday was fine as well until about 2pm after I ate lunch, during a meeting my arm went numb as well as my legs and I had trouble concentrating and could not hold a conversation. Went home and slept until Wednesday morning. Today, Wednesday, I am still not feeling normal and am having trouble concentrating at work, low light seems to help.

                                                After taking the vaccine husband started to feel a bit dizzy then 30 seconds later his whole body when into a shock and no longer control himself and started to shake a little. He had his eyes open but was unconscious for about 1 minute. Then he released his bladder and peed on himself. The pharmacist noticed and came over then he responded and was consious again. Then he began to sweat excessively all over his body. His face turned pale and the pharmacist began taking his blood pressure which dropped very low. He then began to feel nauseated. Then he started to get body chills. We monitored my husband there for another 30min and he slowly was coming back to his normal self. He had a small headache but was fine enough to leave.

Nausea lasted approximately 30 minutes, trembling lasted about 45 minutes.  Important to note that I previously had COVID-19 60-70 days prior to vaccination. The symptoms from the vaccine were significantly worse; however, they appear to have lasted for a much shorter period.

I woke up at 4:30am the morning after receiving the vaccine needing to use the restroom, but I could barely get out of bed because of my severe body aches and lack of energy. When I did manage to get out of bed, I struggled to even stand up. I took 800mg of ibuprofen at that time (around 4:30am) for the pain, which helped. I spent more than the first half of my day in bed under layers of blankets until about 3:00pm, where I finally felt good enough to get out of bed. I didn?t feel the body aches completely go away until the morning of the 8th, 3 days after receiving the vaccine.

Leading up to the hear rate increasing I was fine and just enjoying my day. No drugs or alcohol or did not do any exercise that day. Felt uncomfortable and with some anxiety I visited a urgent care facility. The visit was about 45 minutes and left. As I am writing this, my heart rate is still a bit above normal but doing better.

                                                Patient admitted to being nervous prior to administration and said he did not like needles.  Patient was consulted about what to expect, side effects, and asked if he had any additional questions prior to receiving vaccination.  Patient declined and said he wanted to have the vaccine administered.  Patient sat down in the designated waiting area.  Approximately 2-5 minutes later patient blacked out and his body weight caused the chair he was sitting in to flip over, thus landing on the floor.  EMS was called.  Patient came to about 30-60 seconds later.  Patient was disoriented, sweaty, pale, and shaky.  Blood pressure was taken with a result of 143/95.  EMS arrived and evaluated the patient.  Patient admitted to having nothing to eat or drink today and being very anxious previous to getting the vaccine.  There were no signs of an allergic reaction.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was checked about 20 minutes later and was returning towards normal.  Patient declined transport to the hospital, but mother was called to come pick him up.  Patient was advised to get something to eat soon and to rest and be observed for the next 24 hours.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Starting on 4/11/21 at around 12:00 pm I started to have a numbness on both sides of my face. It felt as though there were pins and needles throughout my face. I would say that it was a 4/10 in terms of intensity. At first I thought maybe it was due to drinking coffee without food or other water (I don&#39;t regularly drink coffee but I have never had these symptoms from coffee before). However, even after eating food and drinking a sugary drink around 4:00 pm, the pins and needles remained. The symptoms began to subside at 6 pm or 7 pm.  The only other normal symptoms that I had were feeling tired on 4/8/21 and 4/9/21. Also, on 4/9/21 I had very slight muscle soreness throughout my body. I have also had difficulty concentrating which may or may not be related.

                                                (Saturday)When I came home after I received the vaccine I didn&#39;t really have anything to do, so I decided to take a nap and rest. I think after I woke up is when I started to feel the side effects. I can&#39;t remember exactly but I started feeling cold. I didn&#39;t think too much of it I just thought it was a cold day (which was quickly turning to night). Later that night I started feelinga bit dizzy and my head was hot but I still had chills. Since I had a had a blanket with me, and I think I was starting to feel what would become muscle aches, I just didn&#39;t want to move from the couch to my room. Feeling chills the rest of the night, I realized it was bad choice, since one of my family members left a window open. The cold air of the night really exacerbated my chills. Despite the cold I was still able to sleep, but the next day (Sunday) I did have a slight cough which I think was from experiencing the cold air of the night and not a side effect from the vaccine. (Sunday) This is when I really felt all the side effects. I felt weak, chills, headache, dizziness, muscle aches,(I&#39;m not sure if I had a fever, I couldn&#39;t think clearly my head felt hot). I haven&#39;t had a hangover but I think that is what it would feel like to have one. I basically slept most of day Sunday ; This time in my room with  3 blankets (light blankets )and heat up (felt like 80°F under blankets). I was sweating under the blankets but it really helped warm me up and alleviate my chills. I woke up later that day to a call to help my sister with some work. I couldn&#39;t drive, felt weak and dehydrated(dark orange/yellow pee), but she insisted so she picked me up and scolded me for not eating anything all day(besides the side effects I mention, I think I may have also lost my appetite because I felt dizzy). I was still feeling my head aching after I woke up, still had muscle aches and a slight cough too. It was raining that day so I put on a winter coat with layers underneath to help with my chills. At her home she gave me a Gatorade (and water) which I think really helped since I was sweating a lot under the blankets when I fell asleep. She also gave me some home cooked meals she made. The combination of drinks, food, and familial concern really helped me recover. By Monday my cough was gone and the side effects had worn off to the point that I could go to work safely.   My mother &amp; father also received vaccine at the same time I got it. My father also experienced side effects but his started later with the most effects felt on Tuesday. My mother did not get any side effects.

The headache went away before the appointment (did not take any medication); however the headache returned about 10 minutes after I got vaccinated. A few hours later the headache converted to a migraine resulting in increased nausea. Overnight I developed a fever. Within 24 hours, all the symptoms were gone. At this time I have fully recovered from all side effects but am monitoring my heath to see if anything else comes up.

                                                During the observation period, the patient became lightheaded and dizzy.  He complained of sweating and cold skin.  The pharmacist immediately went to the aide of the patient.  The patient was laid on the ground and we began to get a blood pressure reading.  We also gave the patient cold pack to place on the skin.  The patient never lost consciousness and was verbal and responding to pharmacist questions the entire time.  We asked multiple times if he needed EMS and he each time told us he did not.  His status continued to improve with deep breaths and cooling the skin.  After 10-15 minutes he felt like he could sit up in the chair and did just fine and continued to recover.  We kept watch over him.

Less than 5 minutes after recieving the vaccine he stated he was not feeling well, I noticed that he had perspiration on his forehead. I gave him a small cup of water, he immediately vomited both the water and contents of his stomach. I gave him a bottle of water. He continued to sit near the pharmacy for roughly 45 minutes after which he stated he was feeling much better and left for home.

Went to bed around 10:30 and woke up about 3 hours later at 1:30. Had chills and was shaking when I got up. Could not really fall back asleep. Chills turned into a fever. That morning I started to get a headache. I sounded congested at one point, but no runny nose. I also had body and joint aches.  I took Excedrin three times that day. Once in the morning, once in the afternoon, once before bed. I used zquil to sleep a little bit in the afternoon and again at night. I woke up Sunday and felt completely fine except for my arm still being sore.

He was conscious by the time I got to the other side of the counter but was stating he felt very nauseated like he was going to vomit. We got the patient to a sitting position and got him some cold water. Patient remained seated on the floor until his mother arrived and escorted him out about 15 minutes later.

Temperature seemed to normalize around 4 am and then a severe headache followed and has lasted all day.  Slight chills started again approximately 24 hours after receiving the shot.

                                                At the time of injection, I started to go numb everywhere in my body, feeling a tingling sensation that lasted 20-25 minutes. It was difficult to move my extremeties.  The day after the vaccine, I had chills, body aches, a headache, and was very lethargic.

Took 3 Tylenol at around 3:00 AM when it became clear I was not well. Fell asleep around 5:00 AM after Tylenol kicked in and got super hot instead of super cold. Woke up around 11:00 AM with no fever, but slightly achy. Aches went away by nighttime, and felt 100% the next morning, April 3rd.

                                                Thursday 4/8: 3:20pm: COVID injection given in right arm  Friday 4/9: ~1:00 am: woke up shaking with chills and severely cold; had slight headache. Had insomnia all night.   6:00 am: woke up with bad headache, slight fever.   7:00 am: got out of bed and had vertigo and was running into walls trying to walk to my living room, along with the worst migraine I?ve ever had. Also had dizziness, nausea,  chills, 100&#43;degree fever, aches, skin sensitive to touch, and severe tinnitus. All of the veins were visibly popping out of my head.   As the day went on, everything got worse. Any time I moved, my head would throb so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.   3:45 pm:  the headache started to finally go away. It would only hurt if I moved fast. At this point my fever was only slightly high, about 99 degrees. I was still unstable when I walked and dizzy. I went from being super cold, to being super hot and sweaty. And I was alternating between cold &amp; hot and sweaty for the rest of the night. Was also having some memory issues, repeating things when I was having a conversation with someone over the phone.   I was sweating all night when I was sleeping.   Saturday 4/10: 7:00am: woke up with a slight headache; still out of it and dizzy.   8:00am: after being awake for about an hour or so, I looked in the mirror and my whole face (around the lips, cheeks, and jawline, and under the eyes) was really swollen and puffy. My face was even mis-colored. Under my eyes was purple and yellow, and my cheeks were white.   Some confusion persisted throughout the day as well as dizziness.

The chills and muscle pain were extremely intense 6 hours after I received my vaccine. I could not stop shivering, or get warm enough. That would be followed by a feeling that I was too warm and I would begin sweating profusely. I also experienced a few additional side effects I could not find listed:   I felt especially sensitive to stimuli as if normal sensations were heightened (e.g. hot water in a shower felt painful, running fingers through my hair felt like I was having my hair pulled, I kept my eyes squinted because the sunlight through the windows felt too bright.)  I was extremely irritable and became extremely frustrated easily. I mean frustrated to an embarrassing degree over small things that didn&#39;t matter. It was inconsistent with my day-to-day temperament. It felt like an adrenaline rush came in response to the most minor of inconveniences.

Pt. came to profusely sweating, pale, and feeling dizzy.  We took his BP and kept monitoring it for 45 minutes after we had him lay down.  His BP continued to rise and was normal.  Pt. was nervous before vaccine administration (shaking).  After event, Pt. stated this has happened in the past with donating blood.  Pt.&#39;s girlfriend picked him up, so he did not drive home.

                                                About 3 hours after getting the vaccine I started to feel short of breath. About 5 hours after that I got chills that made me shake all over because I got a fever of 103. Then 2 hours later my heart started to beat very rapidly and got up to 126 beats per minute, my heart was also not only beating vast but very very hard. Then throughout the night and all of the next day, I had pain in my chest on the left side and also pain in my rib area on the left side. The pain lasted for over 24 hours and because of that I went to the emergency room. It turned out they didn&#39;t find anything life threatening at the emergency room but all the pain I had was very scary and very uncomfortable. It was a terrible experience and because of it, I am telling people not to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

I initially felt really warm in my arm and my heart started to race for a bit. That subsided pretty quickly. Then I got really dizzy, lightheaded and warm and sweaty while waiting the 15 minutes. Then my vision started to blur and I felt tingly in both of my hands and both of my legs. According to others with me, I also went grey. I was given a cool cloth and fanned which helped with a lot of the issues. I also had my legs elevated and was given some slightly sugary food and drink to help the vaccine disperse better. Paramadics and amabulance arrived to assess me. I was improving by the time they arrived and was deemed stable, so I did not go to the hospital for this incident

                                                One week after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, several small bruises (6-8) appeared on the back of my left leg. Throughout the day, my leg developed a soreness that, after reading a 10 Feb 2021 story in the newspaper about COVID vaccine recipients developing immune thrombocytopenia caused me to seek medical treatment in the afternoon of 4/6/2020. I first visited an urgent care facility where my high blood pressure (130/98) combined with my slight lightheadedness, soreness in the leg and observes bruising were enough for the tending physician to recommend rushing to the ER for bloodwork to be performed immediately. I was admitted to the ER in the early evening with an elevated blood pressure (~150/111) and the bruising still prevalent. The tending nurse practitioner authorized a complete blood count (CBC) and discharged me an hour later when the results came back ?extremely close to normal,? noting that my platelet count of 194 was no immediate cause for concern. Since then, the bruising and soreness has subsided.

Wasn?t very noticeable and had some bad allergies that day so I chalked it up to that. About a week passes and it only slightly starts to get worse, and i can feel it in my feet as well. I was confused so I started asking about it around my work eventually it had started to affect my walking and it was clear something was wrong, I felt like I had lost balance in my legs and I was losing sense in my fingers. I stopped going to work and went to a doctor on 4/15.
