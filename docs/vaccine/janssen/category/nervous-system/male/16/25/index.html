                                                Patient received vaccine in the AM of 3/16/21.  Patient was in his usual state of health when he went to bed the evening of 3/16/21.  He ate dinner normally and his PD was started as usual.  There were no overnight complications with his PD and he got up shortly before 8 AM.  Mom reports the dialysate from his bag was clear and normal and none of his dwell was retained.  She heard a loud thud from the bathroom around 8 AM and the patient was found by his mother having generalized convulsions (bilateral upper and lower extremities) and he appeared to be foaming at the mouth.  He did not respond to her and she called 911. The seizure stopped by the time EMS arrived and his initial GCS was 12, and 15 by the time they started transport.  He had another seizure en route around 9:30 AM and was given 2.5 mg versed and required bagging. Patient was loaded with Keppra and now has been on maintenance Keppra. Patient has not suffered any additional seizures and is currently undergoing an extensive workup by inpatient neurology team. Vaccine adverse effect currently remains on the differential for inciting event leading to seizure however additional labs are pending to rule out other causes (eg. viruses causing PML).  Patient was also diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and started on antibiotics at time of admission.

The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

                                                Immediately had a dull headache. About an hour and a half just didn&#39;t feel well and became very tired where he was dozing off.  About 7:00 pm started to shake.  This continued to get worse with severe jerking along with the uncontrollable shaking.  Had a rapid resting heart rate over 142 and a fever at 102.4.  Was incoherent, mumbling his words and not making any sense. Went to ER at 8:48 pm they did blood work, urine test and started an IV.  They weren&#39;t sure what was going on and first accused of doing drugs then wanted to do a spinal tap. His father stopped that and again told them it was from the covid vaccine. They finally gave him a shot of Ketorolac 30mg and LORazepan 1 mg. They sent him home and told him to take tylenol for his fever. spontaneous shaking kept on until late 3/11, along with a fever.  Friday 3/12 he is feeling better, fever has broke but not quite 100%.

The next day, I developed a fever of 100.2 and was really cold. For about a week, I would be fine during the day and would get really tired by the evening and extremely cold. I also started feeling tightness in my chest about 2 days after I got the vaccine. I contacted my doctor and she told me to take Tylenol and Albuterol.

As I was running to him pt started slipping out of his chair, as a women, who I later found out was his mother and I helped keep pt in chair as he fainted and then seized for about 2 seconds and then gained consciousness. Upon awakening pt said , what  just happened?&#34; The mother answered &#34;oh you just had a little seizure, you&#39;re fine.&#34; To my surprise, I asked the mother is this has happened before and she said yes when he sees needles/get shots.  I told them the ambulance was on it&#39;s why and the mother asked &#34;why?!&#34; I told her because your son just fainted/had a seizure and we want to make sure he is ok.  The pt refused to go to the hospital.  I did go back out there and mentioned to them that it is very important to answer questions truthfully any time they are asked as they failed to honestly answer our questions about ever feeling faint after receiving a vaccine. His blood pressure normalized and once the paramedics left so did they.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the vaccine (around 2am) I had a fever, chills, headache, sore arm, and muscle soreness. I fell back asleep and when I woke up the fever had broken and the chills had improved but the soreness and headache remained. I took Tylenol in the afternoon and that helped the symptoms but by the time I had gone to bed the chills had returned but not a fever. When I woke up in the middle of the night (night 2) the chills had stopped and I woke up with a moderate headache and sweating profusely. After falling asleep and awaking in the morning I felt much better with the exception of a minor headache.

After approx 1 minute patient leaned to his right side, so we decided to place him on the floor. Patient alternated between supine and right side. Patient reported feeling nauseas, so he was given an emesis bag. No vomiting occurred, but there was a fair amount of sputum he expelled. He denied any shortness of breath, heart palpitations, or chest tightness. 911 was called after the patient&#39;s mother requested we do so. EMS responders evaluated patient, and by the time they were done evaluating (approx 30min later) patient was sitting and talking without any further symptoms/complaints. Patient was offered transport for further evaluation via EMS, both patient and his mother declined.  Patient stayed at pharmacy for several minutes (approx 15) after EMS left.

After about 20 seconds he came to and leaned forward but wasn&#39;t oriented to time and place. As I was talking to him, trying to assess his breathing, he slumped back in the chair and began shaking much more violently.  I asked the store director to call EMS at that point, I took his mask off at that point to better assess his breathing. After about 15 seconds, he came to again. At that point, I had him lean forward with his elbows on his knees, and he didn&#39;t lose conciousness after that. I took his blood pressure (70/22) and pulse (52, light and hard to find). EMS arrived soon after and at that point patient felt much better. EMS decided not to transport the patient to the ER. They instructed patient to follow up with his provider. Patient left the vaccine area under his own power about half an hour later.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

Almost immediately he collapsed to the floor before we could grab him. He fell face first onto the floor. He moaned and shook. With the assistance of a medic and police office, he was rolled onto his back and his feet were elevated. He started to regain consciousness. EMTs were called to assess him after his head hit the floor. He was monitored by EMTs for 30 minutes. He refused to go to the hospital and was instructed to call 911 if he had additional symptoms.

At 3 am headache was migraine strength and was having full body aches (except for arms), extreme lower back and lower abdominal pain (he said it must be like what women experience in labor or during their menstrual cycle).   He got up and took temperature (normal) and blood ox (100 %SpO2 on two fingers).  He got a wet rag for eyes and tried to fall asleep.  He said he felt hot with cover on and cold with cover off.   At 5:50 am his father gave him two Motrin (400mg total), applesauce and a ice pack for his head and back.  I checked on him thru-out day and he seemed restless.  He woke up at 3 pm on 4/8/2021 said headache and major back pain/abdominal pains were gone. He still feels slightly achy, but fine otherwise. as of 8:24 pm.

Then the inside of my chest started getting really hot and my vision started going white in both of my eyes, it took about 10 seconds for me to completely lose vision. Then I passed out, I have no idea how long I was out for but when I came too I had a sort of epileptic-type seizure but I do not know how long it lasted. I woke up completely disoriented, had no idea where I was at and had a severe cognitive dysfunction. I still have moments where I just can&#39;t follow or complete a thought or just kind of go blank.

I asked him to sit down and started walking around the counter to check on him and check his blood pressure. At that moment he fainted and lost consciousness. Another patient caught his head and he did not hit his head. He remained unconscious for 30 seconds and we were preparing to start CPR breaths as he had a pulse but was not breathing.  His eyelids were fluttering.  He regained consciousness at that time and we waited with him until EMS arrived. His blood sugar was very low when EMS arrived.

The hyperactivity of having the uncontrollable body shaking accelerated my heart palpitations and felt intense pain in my chest. This reaction lasted for about an hour and felt like I needed to go to emergency care.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after my vaccine, I started to feel fatigue and body aches.  An hour after that I experienced intense chills and a sense of dread. I put a heater on myself with two layers of thick blankets, but it didn&#39;t help. My fingers and parts of my face started to tingle and go numb and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep in spite of me doing breathing exercises and lying down. Eventually the chills turned into a fever and my body temperature suddenly shot up. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer, but it was certainly over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite my relief from the chills, I still couldn&#39;t sleep.  I wasn&#39;t remarkably stressed/anxious, I just couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I&#39;m not typically an insomniac, and upon speaking to others who received the same vaccine, they&#39;ve also reported intense chills and an inability to fall asleep.

The next morning (Sunday) I woke up with a fever, chills, sweats, and fatigue that lasted until about 24 hours after I received the vaccine. The following day (Monday) I felt completely fine and had no adverse symptoms or side effects. Tuesday was fine as well until about 2pm after I ate lunch, during a meeting my arm went numb as well as my legs and I had trouble concentrating and could not hold a conversation. Went home and slept until Wednesday morning. Today, Wednesday, I am still not feeling normal and am having trouble concentrating at work, low light seems to help. No numbness today but still feel dazed and not able to focus

As I approach, patient was coming to as he was peeing himself. Patient reported that he felt lightheaded and then did not realize what happened. Gave patient some water and took his blood pressure. His DBP was a little low around 49. Had the patient sit there for another 15 minutes and took blood pressure again and it was 104/60.

                                                After taking the vaccine husband started to feel a bit dizzy then 30 seconds later his whole body when into a shock and no longer control himself and started to shake a little. He had his eyes open but was unconscious for about 1 minute. Then he released his bladder and peed on himself. The pharmacist noticed and came over then he responded and was consious again. Then he began to sweat excessively all over his body. His face turned pale and the pharmacist began taking his blood pressure which dropped very low. He then began to feel nauseated. Then he started to get body chills. We monitored my husband there for another 30min and he slowly was coming back to his normal self. He had a small headache but was fine enough to leave.

At about 4:50 PM, patient came to the counter and claimed to be feeling dizzy where upon I led him back to a chair. Before he could sit he fell down. We were able to prevent him from falling hard on his head. He was unconscious for about 20 to 30 seconds. H regained consciousness. We called 911 immediately. We monitored him until EMT&#39;s arrived. We gave him water and a pillow to rest his head. He was brought to the hospital by ambulance.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

                                                I experienced slight nausea the night I received the vaccine. The following morning was miserable. I had a fever of 101 all day long, a headache, my body was aching from head to toe, extreme lethargy, and occasional bouts of extreme nausea as well as throwing up twice. As of the following day (March 18), almost two days since receiving the shot, I feel pretty much completely normal again aside from a slight headache and some pain at the injection site still. I experienced some pretty bad side effects that only really lasted a day.

At 3:44pm the patient was waving at me indicating that he felt dizzy so I ran out there and he asked for ice and said he was feeling lightheaded and seeing black spots.  I asked him to lay on the floor with his feet elevated in a chair. He stayed that way for a few minutes and said he was feeling better, and we were able to get him a cool pack.  He sat up on the floor and put the cool pack on his neck.  After a few minutes he was feeling better so I allowed him to remain seated in the chair until 4:10pm.  Store management came to get a statement from him and he ended up staying in the pharmacy area for approximately 1 hour post-vaccination.  He waved and thanked us when he left.

After 10 minutes, the patient said he was feeling much improved. I had the patient wait another 20 minutes before leaving. The patient left feeling normal again.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.

Took 3 Tylenol at around 3:00 AM when it became clear I was not well. Fell asleep around 5:00 AM after Tylenol kicked in and got super hot instead of super cold. Woke up around 11:00 AM with no fever, but slightly achy. Aches went away by nighttime, and felt 100% the next morning, April 3rd.

                                                One week after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, several small bruises (6-8) appeared on the back of my left leg. Throughout the day, my leg developed a soreness that, after reading a 10 Feb 2021 story in the newspaper about COVID vaccine recipients developing immune thrombocytopenia caused me to seek medical treatment in the afternoon of 4/6/2020. I first visited an urgent care facility where my high blood pressure (130/98) combined with my slight lightheadedness, soreness in the leg and observes bruising were enough for the tending physician to recommend rushing to the ER for bloodwork to be performed immediately. I was admitted to the ER in the early evening with an elevated blood pressure (~150/111) and the bruising still prevalent. The tending nurse practitioner authorized a complete blood count (CBC) and discharged me an hour later when the results came back ?extremely close to normal,? noting that my platelet count of 194 was no immediate cause for concern. Since then, the bruising and soreness has subsided.
