These lasted for about 2 hours before decreasing in severity but continued to be present until about 10:30pm, 13 and a half hours after receiving the shot. Nothing was done to treat the symptoms. As of 12:30pm on 3/10, some minor symptoms are still present, such as muscle weakness and pain, severe migraine, and dizziness.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Six hours after I received the vaccine I began to feel full body muscle aches and shivers. I took 2 Advil. I went to bed at 9:30 p.m. and woke up at 11:30 p.m. feeling as though I had slept 8 hours because I had a 102 fever. My face was burning from the heat and I was shaking. I took two more Advil. About 30 minutes later I threw up. I waited 30 more minutes and threw up again. As a result, of having Addison&#39;s disease, I have an emergency steroid injection that I use during crises such as this. I took my shot and immediately began feeling slightly better. I was able to go back to bed and at some point the fever went down overnight. I am currently feeling weak and with no fever. I also have a slight headache.

Advised that it would be best to consult with local emergency facility and if anything worsens she needs emergency care.

                                                Around 8 pm (about 6 hours after receiving the vaccine) I started to feel typical flu symptoms such as chills and aches, and I had some body shaking as well. I was in bed that night and the symptoms kept getting stronger, and around 11 pm I started to feel tingling throughout my body, mostly in my hands and feet. It was very uncomfortable to lay still and I felt I&#39;d never be able to fall asleep if I couldn&#39;t lay still. I took 10mg of Z-Quil around 11:30 pm. My body and skin was also starting to get very hot, I never took my  body temperature but I probably had a fever. I put a cold compress on my forehead. I also took 1000 mg acetaminophen and 400 mg Advil. I got up to use the bathroom and I could walk but my balance was off and I felt tingling up my legs. I laid back in bed with the cold compress again and the tingling in my hands and feet increased. I tried walking around again and again felt tingling up my legs. I sat on the edge of my bed moving my feet around which helped the tingling, but when I laid down again the tingling kept coming back. I took another 10mg of Z-Quil and 0.25mg xanax (prescription for anxiety). I finally decided to move to a chair with lots of pillows so I could sit upright since that helped reduce the tingling. I finally fell asleep sometime after 12:30 am. I woke up in the chair around 2 am and was feeling better - no tingling, no body shaking, chills and aches were reduced and body temperature didn&#39;t feel as high. I was then able to sleep in bed for the rest of the night. The next day I still had aches and chills and a fever but it was manageable with Advil or acetaminophen, and by Monday (March 8) I was able to go to work.

                                                I am 6 months pregnant (28 weeks).   Approximately 8 hours after the injection, I developed a fever of 103 degrees. Other symptoms were severe body aches, tremors, and chills. I took two 500mg Tylenol pills, but the fever remained at 103 degrees for 12 hours. After 12 hours, the fever reduced to 100 degrees for another 6 hours. Body aches, tremors and chills decreased in severity along with the fever. After 18 hours, my temperature returned to normal and tremors and chills subsided completely. I remained very fatigued with some body aches and general soreness for another 24 hours.

                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

About 5 pm, I started to feel really cold and my whole body was shivering and vibrating. My whole body also started to ache and my bones felt heavy. At about 10 pm I started to get really high fever and felt so cold. I could not sleep even with a winter jacket on, I had a really bad headache in the center of my forehead, lower back pain and felt extremely sore and weak. I found it difficult to stand or walk. I woke up at 2:30 am from bed, to get a snack and took 2 ibuprofen to ease the symptoms. Woke up at about 10 am next day, felt slightly better. Fever has gone down slightly but not completely. Still feeling really cold and shivering.

                                                I started to lose mobility in my left arm the evening of my vaccine appointment. The following morning, I could not raise my arm at all. The pain in my upper left arm (where the vaccine was administered) has been severe for more than 48 hours. It is extremely painful to the touch. I can use my left hand, but cannot function/cannot perform necessary daily work and school tasks due to the loss of mobility. I have been in extreme pain and fear my shoulder has been injured.

                                                Received the vaccine on a Thursday evening. 9 hours after I received the vaccine I woke up with chills, fever, headache, body aches, and a sore arm around the injection site. These symptoms lasted a full day (all of Friday) with the body aches being the most intense. When I woke up Saturday, these symptoms were gone with the exception of the sore arm which took another two days before getting back to normal. I took one 500 mg Acetaminophen on Friday to relieve the symptoms which didn&#39;t seem to help.

Her dizziness became worse and I got the Epi Pen ready.   A few minutes later, she asked to lie down due to her dizziness.   I assisted her and had my tech call 911.   She had no trouble breathing but did develop tingling in her hands and a blotchy red rash on her chest.  The paramedics arrived and checked her vitals which they said were fine.  They took her out to the ambulance as a precaution.

By 9pm I had a fever of 104 degrees and was dropping sweat, shaking, and very weak. Within 24 hours, I developed a rash on my chest ans torso area of little red bumps that were itchy and spreading throughout the day. The fever came and went on the second day. Terrible flu symptoms have lasted over 24 hours now.

                                                Patient began with nausea and walked to the restroom because she felt she may throw up.  She returned to the post-vaccine administration monitoring area after about two minutes to sit down again.  At that time, I asked more questions about symptoms.  She was also feeling weak and like she may pass out.  I gave her a cold compress to place on her neck which improved her symptoms very rapidly.  She remained in the area with the cold compress for about 10 more minutes before she felt well and she then left with her husband.

She sat on the floor and immediately passed out. She remained unconscious for 60- 90 seconds. We laid her into the prone position. Her arms were twitching. She regained consciousness. 911 was alerted and responded. Pt refused to leave with them. She sat with un an additional 15 minutes before she left for a therapy appointment.

Patient did not hit the ground or injure herself-she did not lose consciousness she was flushed and sweating.  Pharmacist sat on floor with patient for 2-3 minutes and gave her water, patient was then able to stand up with little assistance and brought to sit down.  Patient stated she felt nauseous and may vomit she was given a trash can but did not vomit she was able to drink a bottle of water and was given a soft pretzel.  After about 10 minutes she stated she was feeling much better was no longer flushed or sweating she called her boyfriend for a  ride home.

For the next hour, I experienced nausea, headache, and worsening fever. I was shaking, had body aches and intense chills. I went to sleep at 10:30pm with a fever of 101.4 and had a fever until 8am the next morning. I experienced a terrible headache throughout the next day and felt extremely exhausted.

Also starting three hours after the vaccine I had extremely painful muscle aches and pains. Bruise at injection site and swollen arm. Excruciating pain in both arms and both knees. When the leg pain started, it started behind my knees. I was in tears for about 14 hours in excruciating pain due to the muscle aches and I am still having random hurts of sharp muscle and joint pain.

                                                Experienced light headedness ( started before time stated but not sure when exactly). Around 6:30pm-7pm I began feeling dizzy, going between dizzy and light headed. I was drinking plenty fluids and did eat. A few people noted that I looked very out of it, and I felt very out of it. I tried staying seated and this did not have any effect on the dizzy feeling. I went to lay down and before going to sleep around 10pm-11pm, laying in bed I felt like the room was spinning. I also had typical symptoms, soreness as injections site and arm (starting immediately the day of vaccine), fever at it&#39;s highest was 102 (starting at 100.5 that morning, not peaking until Motrin wore off*see below*), feeling tired and very heavy.. like everywhere was waited down by something (starting early in the morning).  I was given Motrin by my coworker in the morning as I was had a headache  and was feeling sore and moving sore due to heavy feeling. Wednesday waking up the dizziness  and lightheadedness were gone. A slight feeling of being out of it however, fever was about 99-100 throughout the day (99 being my typical temp). As of today only a feeling of sore arm and tiredness which sometimes feels like I and out of it but I feel both from later yesterday and today is due to the tired feeling that comes common.

                                                About 12 hours after injection, I started feeling achey 13 hours later, I had a spell where I could not hear anything and felt as if I wasn?t in control of my body- in talking to medical personnel they say what I?m describing is what happens right before one passes out. I came out of it within 10 minutes. 16 hours later I had a 102 fever. Took Tylenol Felt fine 24 hours later 32 hours later I started to get a headache and light sensitivity. Fever back to over 99- low grade for me.  35 hours later I had such a bad headache and light sensitivity. I couldn?t watch tv, be on my phone, or look at a computer screen. I also started to get bouts of nausea. 38 hours later, I vomited for the first time. Same symptoms as what I described last. 42 hours later, I vomited again. 48 hours later - 5 days later, light sensitivity and  migraine symptoms continued , but improved slowly each day.               6 days later, all previous symptoms were gone. I woke up with a bump in my inner eye. Slowly went away throughout the day, then developed a itchy, red bump in between my lips and nose, that progressively got bigger throughout the day and made my lip swell. Bump was about 2 inches in diameter at its biggest. Took Claritin, cleaned face with alcohol, and by 24 hours later it was not noticeable.  8 days later, the bump appeared again in between lip and nose on the opposite side of my face.  Took Benadryl, bump slowly went down throughout the day. By 24 hours later it was gone

                                                12 hours after vaccine around 3:30am on Saturday I woke up with sever chills, shaking uncontrollably for an hour or 2. I fell back to sleep and woke up about an hour later burning up and sore head to toe. I threw up and had a migraine that lasted the rest of the day. I was able to fall asleep around 6:30am and when I woke up around 9 I was just exhausted, sore all over, nauseous, with a headache. This lasted about a day. On sunday afternoon my toddler lightly hit my right arm where the vaccine was and it became sore, red, and swollen. By the late evening that day the soreness and redness increased. Monday-Thursday the redness and swelling increased to about 2 inches round and felt very tight with a lump in the swelling and it was warm to the touch. By friday the redness and swelling reduced to about an inch, but there is still an inch small lump at the injection site and hurts when anything touches it. The redness has faded and there is no visual bruising.

Felt lightheaded, dizzy, and hot. I began to black out, so I sat down, which helped for a few moments to subside lightheadedness. I was still feeling hot, so I walked a few feet to my back door and sat down on the steps outside to cool off. Within minutes, my vision blurred completely, I saw stars, and completely blacked out. My mother, who was nearby, heard me fall on the steps. She said my eyes rolled back, my body was completely limp, I was not breathing but rather making gurgling noises from my throat. She propped my head up, which allowed me to breathe properly, and I came to.   If my mother had not been nearby, I am convinced I would be dead right now. I saw the light, saw the other side, saw my relatives. I have had a near death experience once before, and this was exactly like that.

I felt a little dizzy and it was getting harder to breathe. It lasted for maybe 5- 10 mins and I had to try and do deep breathing techniques which helped a little. It has been almost 5 hours since my vaccine injection and I feel fine.

Inexplicable fear of being paralyzed and dying ( somewhat delirious overnight)- inability to sleep the evening after the shot.  The full day after the vaccination, body temperature rose--couldn&#39;t stop sweating and had a searing headache. Took tylenol to reduce the symptoms.   The following day (today) had severe dry mouth and very sore throat. Felt about 60% back to normal health. I am a very fit 26 year old (run and exercise daily)

                                                Within 2 hours of getting the vaccine, I developed a severe migraine, fever(100.1-100.4), chills, dizziness, extreme body aches, nausea and was very weak. Once the bulk of the symptoms subsided, a little under 48 hours after the vaccine was administered, I was able to resume to my daily life. I still have a lingering migraine, arm pain, body aches and a low grade fever of 99.9 now almost 72 hours later, but it is bearable unlike the immediate 48 hours following the vaccine. Over-the-counter medications usually take the edge off of my migraines, though they didn?t even come close to helping the one I currently have. I have been rotating Tylenol and ibuprofen since developing the side effects.

                                                Lost vision like 3 mins after vax at the drive through shot center, paramedics were with me for about 20 mins to  make sure blood pressure was okay and vision was 100% better. Besides the body aches and diarrhea on 4/3 and 4/4, On 4/6 I had the worst migraine ever where I lost 1/3 of my vision for about an hour and my right side of my body went numb for about 15 mins. I&#39;ve been having migraines more frequently than I ever have and unsure if it is vaccine related or just extra stress. I have been trying to reduce screen time as much as I can but hard when I work full-time and in grad school and use the computer all the time. I also have been taking motrin/tylenol for the pain and lay down to let the pain pass.

                                                Had typical post vaccine symptoms right after - nausea, muscle aches, chills, fatigue. 5 days after vaccine those appeared to have dissipated. Went for a light walk in the morning. Completely lost vision in both eyes extremely blurry. Stumbled my way home running into trees, cars. Vision came back, thought it was migraine (had them before but nowhere NEAR as bad, never had vision completely blocked)  Excurtating headache behind eyes and nausea, feels like pressure in head. Worst headache of my life, went to ER. Gave morphine (did not help pain at all which was horrifying) got a head CT scan which came out clear and discharged because clotting ruled out. It is now day 6 and my headache is persistent and still excruciatingly painful. I?m also extremely nauseous. I?m terrified because I know something is very wrong. ER doc said might be lingering side effect from vaccine but those effects felt very different.

I am unable to walk up on staircase more than 3 floors. I don?t know what is going on but this never happened before and the fact that I got  shot recently made me worried. I am young still, used to walk a lot and also did hiking. I never had troubles with my leg joint until recently.

I was extremely tired and the aches had significantly increased so I went to bed at about 8:00pm. When I couldn?t sleep around 9:30pm I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I woke up at around 11:00pm and felt extremely feverish (shivering, entire body extremely soar. My joints hurt so badly that I couldn?t get comfortable) and nauseous. I then had 4 or 5 episodes of violent vomiting throughout the night every 2 or so hours.  After, I would be drenched in sweat.  When I got up *crawled to trash can next to my bed* at around 2:30/3:00AM I took 200mg ibprofin. Felt fatigued and no appetite the next day then was fine

The next morning I woke up with sharp stabbing pains in the left side of my head and numbness/tingling in the left side of my face. As the day went on I started to feel worse  so I went to the emergency room. The doctor there checked me out and stated that I had Bell&#39;s Palsy and prescribed me three different medications.  I am currently on these medicines trying to get better.

It feels like a mild headache where moving makes it worse,  or as if I had a hangover but I don&#39;t. I feel tension in my head. Lying down makes me feel better, as does any position where I&#39;m resting my head. Yesterday I also had a weird feeling in my throat that came and went rhythmically.

                                                The side effects began the night following my vaccine and lasted the entire next day. It began with fatigue/brain fog, then chills and soreness at the injection site. Once the chills began I was very ill with a fever (100-101), severe aches and pains in my body from head to toe, and experienced  occasional shooting pains. Once the fever went away about 30 hours after my vaccine, I still felt pain and heaviness in my body and had a bad headache. The next day (day 3) was much better- I had no fever but still felt some brain fog, drowsiness, and slight muscle soreness (but no pain).   Two weeks after my vaccine (4/20/21)  I had a very similar experience but am not certain it was related to the vaccine. I developed chills, fatigue, and a headache for the majority of the day. In the evening, it progressed to muscle/joint pain, a severe headache, extreme fatigue, and a 100 degree fever. The next day (today 4/21), the fever has subsided and I feel slightly fatigued. Though I am not sure this was related to the vaccine, it mirrored my initial reaction to the vaccine two weeks prior. It is very unusual for me to get a fever in the 100 degree range and typically only happens every two years or so.

The fever and chills lasted through the next day - body ache and soreness throughout both of those days. For those two days I did not work. (Ended the 8th when it was time for me to go to bed.) I did have heart palpitations the night of the 9th that I did go get ER  -they gave me a dose of Ativan and they sent me home. That took care of the heart palpitation symptoms.  I followed up with my provider the following week.

                                                I woke up at 3 am Friday with cold sweats and body aches. Took 1000 mg Tylenol. Woke up again at 10:30 am to a fever still and this odd extremity feeling. Felt like I had a compression body suit on and weight of 50 pounds around my arms and legs, Mild shortness of breath. I felt like I was swollen but did not see any. I called my PCP and vaccine line and both nurses said go to the ER. I went to the ER they ran tests. The time of the ER I started getting leg cramping and spasming. Those symptoms continued to the weekend. On Sunday the weight and swelling feeling went away. I still had bad muscle cramping and swelling. I did telehealth on Tuesday with PCP and was given muscle relaxer which helped some throughout the rest of the week. Thursday night I have a temp pf 99.6 and went up to 100.6 on Friday morning. On Friday I became shortness of breath and fatigued. It became difficult to go up and down stairs or walking about 20 ft without difficulty breathing. I now have a lower right leg muscle twitch/spasm that comes and goes. I switched to a different PCP, he ran more blood work on Wednesday 4/21. And discussed the next steps for treatment and monitoring.

Then a week later, I got a horrible rash all of my body, worse at my hands and feet. The rash included many blisters. Loss of appetite and cannot sleep. I still have the rash now, and it is even getting worse in some parts, while other parts are better due to a steroid cream prescribed by my dermatologist.  On April 26, I felt very dizzy and weak and went to urgent care. I have since recovered from those symptoms.

The pharmacist/doctors at CVS gave me some water and told me to elevate ny legs. After 10 minutes they checked my termperature and blood pressure. I stabized somewhat and when home. I was sure it it was my nerves but something did feel right. I had a slight burning in my chest and felt queezy on/off throughout the day. Chills and hot flashes followed. I was anxious and paranoid about the possibility something serious coukd be wrong with me. I felt shooting pains in my lower left abdomen that nught and the next day. The following day I still felt very weak. My arm hurt. My muscles felt like jello and I?m unhappy. I wish I never got the shot and I?m worried about my body?s reaction to it.

This happened while she was waiting the 15 minutes.   She did tell me she has Raynaud?s , however the room was very warm.  There was a nurse on site who evaluated her, checked BP, listened to lungs, HR. The nurse stayed with her and I checked on her periodically.  After about 30 minutes she felt fine and returned to work.  She did tell me she was a little skittish about getting shots  when I gave her the vaccine.

                                                Around 4 pm I had flu like symptoms. Headache, back pain, fatigue, chills, sweats.  Around 5:30 I started feeling light-headed. I got out of bed and fainted on the floor. Laid there for a few moments. Got water. Laid back into bed and my body completely locked up. It felt like there were pins and needles coursing through my entire body. I couldn?t bend or move my legs. My wrists were bent down and my fingers all locked together. I could not move them at all. I was screaming out in pain. It was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. My roommate called 911. Paramedics arrived and took my temperature and blood pressure. They tried calming me down. eventually I did. And my fingers and legs unlocked but I continued having a severe headache, back pain, muscle aches and nausea. I woke up every hour of the night and threw up several times.  It?s been 24 hours after the shot and I am still having headaches fatigue and muscle spasms.

After about 5-10 minutes the patient stated she was very nauseous. I went to grab a trash can for her and within the 20 seconds or so it took to grab she had what seemed like a single muscle spasm or convulsion then she slid out of her chair onto the floor. She was breathing and coherent right away however she did not remember getting on the floor. Called 911 and EMS came out and took her vitals. She stated she felt fine afterward and did not go with them.

                                                The right side of my body felt completely heavy as we walked out of the pharmacy.  My right side continued to be right side continued to be tingly heavy for multiple hours. My headache was only on the right side as well. I was instructed to go to the emergency room who didn?t even examine the leg that was numb and tingly. Told me to take some baby aspirin, Benadryl and come back if it became hard to breath.  I came home and have had the worse sharp pains in my legs,  there have been some things I expected like headache and body aches, sore site. It?s weird because my site isn?t even that sore it?s mostly my legs, and now back , and ahead.

                                                At 10pm on 5/18/2021 I started having side effects, 9 hours after vaccination. My face and ears were hot and my body was cold, I felt very fatigued. I took Tylenol before bed and woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. I woke up officially at 8am and felt my face and eyes were swollen, I also had chest tightness. I looked in the mirror and it looks like I was punched in the face. My left eye (the side I was vaccinated) is significantly more swollen than my right side. Since 8am, the swelling and puffiness hasn?t gone down in my face, however, the chest tightness went away. I took Benadryl. It is now almost 4pm on 5/19/2021 and I still have the same amount of swelling and puffiness in my face. It?s extreme enough that I can?t go out in public like this or else someone will think I got beat up. There isn?t any bruising, rather, under each eye there are very prominent dark circles with almost a reddish tint. It seems like this possibly could be an allergic reaction but after reading online it seems like allergic reactions would have happened right after vaccine. I noticed this side effect 19 hours after vaccination when I woke up on 5/19/2021. If it?s not better when I wake up tomorrow on 05/20/2021 I will goto urgent care.

                                                During injection, felt pins and needles from injection site to fingertips which faded to tingling and stopped entirely after about 7 minutes.   Intense nausea and sweating beginning 1-2 minutes post injection; unable to sit up. Lasted approximately 7-10 minutes before clearing up  2 hours later (7:10 pm), arm at and above injection site felt hot to the touch and had mild dull pain at every movement. Slightly dizzy and nauseous. Arm periodically ached without movement.  By 7:26 pm, arm pain from movement was a sharp pain, though still pretty mild.  Around 9:30 pm, gently pressed at site of injection and a jolt of pain went all the way down to my fingers  Nausea increased at 10:13, still mild. Decided to go to sleep. Woke up at least 5 times before 12:30 am in various states of pain and discomfort, including nausea when attempting to sit up; dry throat/mouth; pins and needles throughout my glutes and thighs accompanied by pain in my left hip, knee, ankle, and jaw; and mild to moderate arm pain at the injection site. Took about 15 minutes to be able to get up due to nausea and got some water.  Was cold so wrapped myself in a blanket. Nausea and arm pain with movement remained but I was able to go back to sleep around 1:15 am.  Woke up at 2:53 am - arm pain minimal and nausea gone, blanket felt nice but unnecessary, went back to sleep  Woke up at 5:34 am with pins and needles  in glutes and thighs and pain in my right jaw, knee, hip, and ankle (all sites of previous moderate injuries) along with a low grade headache. Went back to sleep.  Woke up after an hour or so feeling relatively normal, arm pain and headache returned after sitting up. Got out of bed but ended up taking another nap.  Woke up after another hour with just a headache and brain feeling fuzzy, but strong tingles began returning to my glutes and thighs  like they had fallen asleep (referred after this point as tingles). Arm hurt. Drank some more water and took another nap.  Woke up around 9:15 am with a low grade headache and slight tingles; fuzzy brain feeling was gone. Legs wobbly when I walked. Realized that tingling got worse anytime I was sitting down or lying on my back.  Around 10:20 am started crying - no known cause. Couldn&#39;t stop for a few minutes. This is not normal for me.  Around 1 pm realized I had a pretty high fever; unsure how high it was or how long I&#39;d had it. Took another nap at 1:30 pm and woke up at 2:20 pm feeling much less hot so I thought it had broken, but I was told by my friend who dropped by that I was still feverish just much lower.  Slept from about 2:45-3:55 pm; headache was much better when I awoke; tingles and sore arm remained.  Realized at 4:13 pm that I&#39;d had no appetite the whole day. I&#39;d also barely been able to force myself to drink water; too cold and it hurt, room temperature didn&#39;t feel right.  No times, but felt periodic stabbing pain in my left ear until about 6:30 pm.  Much else also recovered by 6:30 pm: felt well enough to drink cold stuff, tingles were low grade, fever was present but low. Arm was still sore.  7:08 pm headache was gone.  8:49 pm felt much better and able to do things and take care of myself with minimal discomfort, but felt a little lousy overall - low grade headache, head felt like there was some pressure in it, periodic tingles, achy arm.  9:29 pm felt exhausted and slightly achy but otherwise mostly normal. Felt some hunger twinges for the first time that day but nothing felt appealing (realized I had only eaten about 5 spoonfuls of soup the whole day). Fell asleep getting ready for bed; woke up at 10:49 pm and finished getting ready for bed then went back to sleep.  Summary: Friday: Symptoms: mild to moderate nausea, mild dizziness, mild to moderate injection site pain, pins and needles in glutes and thighs, joint pain  Treatment: drinking water  Saturday:  Symptoms: mild to moderate pain at injection site, headache, fever, nausea, tiredness, glute and thigh tingles, lack of appetite, periodic stabbing pain in left ear  Treatments: ice/cold pack on arm (helped with arm pain while on), drinking water, sleeping

Pretty much over the counter medications. And a migraine that caused me to throw up. Getting more frequent headaches. And also feeling fatigue.

Accompanied by body aches, mild headache. Took Acetaminophen occasionally over 24 hours, but lower fever (100.8) persisted each time after medicine wore off. Limbs are sore. Slight soreness at injection site but more soreness in ankles/lower limbs. About 24 hours in, I noticed 2 faint red splotches on my stomach and chest.

I was also short of breath. I went to the ER and they checked for blood clots. I started to get lower extremity cramps and muscle spasms. Two days after I started to have some shortness of breath and I was out of breath if I walked any length. One week after the vaccine I ended up wit an ear infection in my right ear. The muscle spasms continued especially in my right lower legs with twitching which lasted for five weeks. Two weeks after the shot my Asthma, which is normally controlled  got very severe. My inhalers didn&#39;t seem to work. Three weeks after the vaccine my Asthma got worse and I was having trouble breathing. I went to the ER again and there were more tests done. I was prescribed Prednisone, and I took one week off work. After multiple treatments I was prescribed antibiotics and switched my inhaler which helped. I have been trying to do some Cardio activity this weeks and I feel better after six weeks. I don&#39;t have to use my Nebulizer as much as I had been.

                                                I already suffer from migraines, Tuesday or Wednesday after I recovered from the normal vaccine symptoms my face went numb , my right side of my body went numb and tingling like as stroke and I had a migraine, I called 911 , Paramedics said I wasn&#39;t having a stroke, later that I went to the Urgent care because the symptoms did not go away , they referred me to ER to get an MRI.

Injection site still painful and swollen today. If it is relevant, I also experienced more common effects like severe body body pain and hot flashes beginning several hours after receiving the vaccine, lasting 48 hrs.

Vax site swelling (Left arm) increased to size of palm of hand and developed pain shooting down legs (R&gt;L) over the next few days.  Today is 5 days post vax.

                                                Leg pain. Started in left leg, moved over into right leg as well. Got xray on left knee- nothing came back. Got ultrasound on leg leg- nothing came back. My legs constantly hurting. Mainly behind my knees, side of my knee, and front of knee . My calves and ankles are also hurting. I feel pain, weaknesses, and throbbing. They are very tired. I visit a sports medicine doctor tomorrow.   Also visiting a cardiologist tomorrow. I?ve been having chest pains (which are normal for me prior to vaccine). However, now my heart is feeling like I?m having palpitations. It starts beating faster then normal. I can feel my heart beating now, which I?ve never been able to notice prior. I?m having to catch my breath often, and have to take really deep breaths.  This is the first time I?ve ever experienced these heart issues.  Visits since vaccine- 2 visits to PCP, 2 visits to urgent care, ultra sound, upcoming sports medicine visit, upcoming cardiologist visit

                                                Patient walked into the pharmacy trying to get vaccinated for Covid. Before anything patient was concerned about her previous Covid positive case (not a severe reaction, was eventually tested negative in April) and also her family history of asthma (Patient herself never had an episode so far). I told the patient it would be okay to get vaccinated, per CDC guideline.  As patient filled out the consent form, I checked the screening questionnaire, which she answered &#34;no&#34; to everything except &#34;don&#39;t know&#34; to asthma related questions.  As everything was set I brought patient into the consultation room, explained what vaccine she is receiving, how long it takes for the vaccine to be fully incorporated into her defense system (2-3 weeks), and what kind of side effects she can expect (muscle pain, elevation in body temperature, redness around injection site). I took extra moments to explain risk vs benefits for blood clotting issue.  At this point patient was ready to get vaccinated. I wore gloves, asked patient to roll her sleeves up so I can proceed to wipe the right upper arm area with alcohol and give her an injection. she followed promptly so far to this point.  As soon as patient received the vaccination, her body started to slide down the chair. Patient reported to feel dizzy and also reported that she had some &#34;dreams.&#34; Fortunately while everything was happening patient&#39;s head did not hit anything and patient was in sitting position the whole time of the event. I asked patient if patient was feeling okay three to four times but I did not get any straight answer from the patient. I asked for help, and pharmacy technicians and store manager offered help.  Patient wanted us to call her husband and 911, which we proceeded. In the mean time I also reached out to my district manager to report what was going on. Store manager offered a room temperature water to keep her fluid balanced, as she was sweating heavily.  Once 911 got to the site, they measured her BP and HR, and it was a bit low. 911 offered a choice to take patient to ER, which PT and her husband first decided to use their own car, and later decided against going to ER. Husband reported that patient is feeling much better, drank a few ounces of fluid and taken a banana.

Within a few moments after administration patient stated &#34;Oh. I&#39;m going to faint.&#34;  Pt. was assisted to supine position and observed to be unresponsive to name calling, appeared pale and slightly diaphoretic with a weak thready pulse. Clinic staff was notified of vasovagal syncope, patient self-revived within 30 seconds. Afterwards cool compress was applied to forehead and pt. provided with water for hydration and was also offered crackers and juice, which she declined. Pulse re-checked approx 2 minutes after pt. revived found to be approx 65bpm and strong, 2&#43;  color returned to pt. face and she stated she felt much better. pt. was observed by clinic staff for full 15 minutes following vaccine administration and vasovagal episode without further issue.

I woke up at 11:55p (8 hours post vaccine, two hours after falling asleep) due to full body chills and shaking. I took two Tylenol. This lasted about 45 minutes. I felt cold but didn?t have a fever.  I kept waking up throughout the night clammy.  I woke up at 5:30a (30 mins earlier than normal) because I couldn?t sleep and had a headache.  I felt sore and achy and very fatigued all day. I took the afternoon off work and came home and slept 3 hours. Still felt groggy and sore after. Felt more normal the next morning. My left arm is still sore two days post vaccination.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I slept okay, the next morning about an hour after I woke up I had severe chills, body aches, and nausea. I had to go home from work due to these feelings. Eventually, developed into a fever. I went home and the chills and aches worsened. I could not get warm not matter how many layers or blankets I had. I took tylenol and fell asleep after several hours. When I woke up, I was profusely sweaty, my fever  broke. I was able to eat a small lunch and continued to lie down the whole day. My symptoms lessened and were more minimal 24 hours after. After going to sleep the second night, I felt back to normal upon wake up.

                                                I noticed a very mild headache and slight coldness within 2 hours of my vaccine.  Onset of my severe symptoms began around 10PM on 03/12/2021 with a stabbing headache (Felt like someone took an air pump and kept &#39;blowing up&#39; my head. My eyes felt achy and heavy and every time I looked in a different direction I would get a zapping/electric feeling throughout my head that would cause my head and neck to spasm (longer duration) or twitch (quick jolt). This also caused dizziness). I got really cold and had intense shivering and shaking. Around midnight, my skin started feeling bruised all over my body (very sensitive to touch, including my bed sheets against my spine felt like rubbing up against a wound). At the same time, my joints (especially my neck, hips, and knees) got hot to the touch and were incredibly painful (induced tears). My muscles developed a deep ache that also caused significant pain. I felt very weak and confused. I didn&#39;t take my temperature until the early morning, and it was 102.9 at that time. I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen throughout the day, but my temperature stayed between 102 and 103.1 for about 24 hours, as did the previously noted symptoms.   I noticed a gradual improvement of my symptoms over the next two days. On the evening of 03/14/2021, my headache worsened some, and I had an unexpected episode where I nearly passed out (dropped to the floor but stayed conscious). I also had intermittent foot tingling (very noticeable, not mild) over the course of a few hours.   For 3 full days (but by far the most severe within the first 24 hours), I experienced some strange sound processing. Things like the sound of a car driving by or the ceiling fan felt like it echoed throughout my whole body and gave me an uncomfortable shivering feeling.   As of today (03/16/2021), I am mostly recovered. I am still experiencing fatigue, a very mild headache, and some mild pain. My nausea has completely resolved, though that was never a chief complaint of mine.   I realize that some of my symptoms are to be expected with this vaccine. But especially the level of pain I experienced throughout my entire body was very concerning and not something that I was aware could happen as a result of the vaccine.

My muscles were very achey, and my heart was racing. I was slightly nauseous but still able to eat a little. By 24 hours after the shot my fever was down to 99f.  I started to get diarrhea beginning the second day and has lasted until now the third day after vaccination day.

                                                About five hours after the vaccine injection, at around 11 PM, I began to feel cold and achy, which soon led to body chills all over. It felt like I could not get warm no matter how many extra blankets I added. This soon led to a fever. I was in an out of sleep for the next few hours and woke up around 2:30 AM. At that point the fever had broken and I was sweating. I still had body aches, which I think was due to my body being tensed up for some many hours, and I had a splitting headache, as well. At around 4:30 AM, I woke up again, with a very sore arm a terrible headache still. I got up and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. At 7 AM my alarm went off and all adverse effects seemed to be gone other than a sore arm. The sore arm last for about 6 days.

                                                Vaccination appointment was at 1:30 pm on Monday, April 5. I received the shot at around 2:00pm in my left arm. It hurt going in, but quickly dissipated as I moved my arm. I felt fine for the rest of the day. I felt normal the following morning (April 6), but started to feel tired in the early afternoon. I took a nap around 3:00-4:30pm, and woke up feeling slightly hungry. I went to bed around 11:00pm. I woke up the next day (April 7) with a headache. I called in sick to work and stayed in bed as my headache grew worse and nausea began to appear. I threw up for the first time at 11:00am, then again around 11:30am. I emptied my bowels in between these bouts of vomiting, and my stomach was very obviously empty after the second bout. I took a nap from 12:00-2:00pm, after which I threw up at 2:30pm and then again at 3:00pm and again at 3:30pm. I took another nap from 4:00-5:00pm, then threw up again around 5:30pm. I threw up a seventh time around 6:00pm and saw  a couple flecks of blood in my vomit. Each bout was sudden in onset and violent but quick. I think I burst some of the blood vessels in my throat, because it was sore. I called a friend to take me to the ER, and threw up once or twice more while waiting. On the way to the ER, I threw up for the last time. The ER gave me Toradol, Zofran, and two bags of IV fluids. This improved all my symptoms. The next morning, April 8, I felt much better until 12:00pm, when I laid down for a nap and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until 4:30. My headache had returned so I took Advil, then ate some rice. I felt better from 6:00pm onwards.

                                                I received the vaccine at around 5:23pm, and then about 11pm the same night I was awoken from sleep by terrible body shivers. I managed to doze off for about an hour before I was woken up again by a migraine at midnight; dozed off again, and woke up at around 2 am with a mild fever (around 99.3 degrees). Sometime between the migraine and fever I began to develop terrible body aches as well. The first 24 hours were the worst as I was completely bedridden. The next day, 4/8/21, was better, but the body aches and migraine persisted all day while the fever broke late morning. The third day (today, 4/9/21) everything is feeling better but the migraine is still a persistent issue.

Throughout the night my body became extremely sensitive and sore especially in my lower back and neck. My temperature also continued to rise to 103.0.  Throughout the day of 4/9/21 I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen on a rotating schedule. My temperature went up and down throughout the day spiking at 105.7 and dropping down to 101.2. Around 10:00 PM it was around 102.9 and my body was becoming even weaker. This morning, now 36 hours after my symptoms started, I can barely lift my arm, my headache has worsened, my total soreness and weakness is no better and my temperature is 102.3.  I have also had trouble with staying hydrated because my skin hurts if it is not covered from the air and I get heavy chills,  but when I cover up I am profusely sweating constantly. The sweat is so bad, I constantly have to lay on a towel and change my clothes.

At around 4pm, a mild headache started, and I was experiencing cramping from my chest down to my stomach. I had no appetite that evening. By 8pm, I had a 101.0 fever, and by 9:30pm the cramps were severe in my lower stomach. I was sweating profusely and shaking until I vomited, which helped to relieve some of the stomach pain. Before I vomited, I was in intense pain- possibly some of the worst pain that I have experienced in my life. The sweats and chills alternated throughout the night, and the headache was intense. The next day, the chills, sweats and headache persisted until mid-afternoon, in addition to the occasional stomach pain and diarrhea. The side effects slowly subsided, and I was feeling better by 4/9. The sweating was the longest lasting side effect.

I went to sleep around 9pm but my body was so pain that I couldn&#39;t really fall asleep. The whole body was pain. I didn&#39;t have short breathe but I had to breathe heavily to catch myself. Until 2am my arms, legs, face and head started numbing and I couldn&#39;t even grab anything. My hand were like sprained. That&#39;s when my hunsband has to go buy pain killers for me. He also bought thermometer. I checked my Temperature it&#39;s was ~96F. I took ibuprofen and some milk, bread and egg. The pain and numbing was getting off after ~40min after I took Ibuprofen. Then I was able to sleep on bed.

                                                Around 6 PM (after receiving my shot at around 12:30 PM), I started to feel very tired and slightly achy.  By around 9-10 PM, I had a fever of about 100.5 degrees with pretty severe chills, and my arm had started to hurt VERY badly.  For almost the entire rest of the weekend (from Friday night-Sunday), I was very fatigued and achy and could not lay on my left side due to the soreness in my arm.  The fever seemed to pass by mid-day on Saturday, though, and I was able to go back to work on Monday.  It was not pleasant, but it was totally worth it and a million times better than actually being sick with COVID!

                                                Was administered covid vaccine J&amp;J  on left arm felt a burning sensation just after it which i knew it normal you just got a vaccine. Walked to the observatory area where we are supposed to wait 15min until you are released to go. Well less than 10 min in the observation area that?s when i started to feel un well my body started sweating excessively and thats when i felt numbness on my right side of my head with a tingling sensation couldn?t hear with my right ear and i freaked out when i started to get blurred vision thats when i knew something was wrong i got up to ask for water once i got up i felt like i was going to faint and felt really dizzy. Once i got to the lady that was there in the observation area  she was shocked at how i looked she told me to go sit down and brought me water as she called the ambulance. Once i was sitting down and was brought water i drank like more than half of the water and the numbness was going down from my right side of my head but still had blurred vision and just felt disoriented and not my self. The ambulance took me to the ER once i got there i felt a little better but still disoriented and dizzy. So disoriented that i left the hospital with me actually realizing i had to stay there to get checked because they kept saying i was fine.

                                                I got the J&amp;J vaccine around 2:30pm on a Saturday and by 6 or 7pm I was experiencing a really bad headache. This headache extended down my back and around the back and top of my skull. By 8pm I had began experiencing chills, body aches, and nausea. By 9pm I had a fever and could not stand up without feeling like I was going to vomit. Walking to even get water in the other room gave me motion sickness. I was shaking and sweating with a fever all night, was unable to sleep, and experienced hallucinations due to the high fever. The next morning I still had a fever but could finally sleep. I still had a bad headache, body aches, and nausea. I slept most of the day and my fever went down but was still &gt;100 degrees all day. On Monday, I had a mild fever in the morning which went away by afternoon. I  felt weak all day Monday and still experienced body aches and a headache. By Tuesday, I was only experiencing fatigue and brain fog. This lasted about a week.

I continued to have fever and chills and body aches.   At 9:30am, I had body aches and felt only slightly feverish. I took acetaminophen for the rest of the day and had no problems.

As of 4/15 hard lump remains at injection site. 4/6- 12:15pm hives, redness, itching, burning on sides of upper thighs, buttocks, within 2 hours hives spread to backs of arms, all the way down legs. Went to quick care facility at 2:30pm. Waited in waiting room until 3:50pm checked legs with doctor at 4:00pm and little red dots appeared in random clusters down both legs. Doctor assumed folliculitis, prescribed Cephalexin. 5:00pm took 50mg Benadryl while waiting for prescription. Picked up antibiotic around 6:30pm. When I got home around 7:00pm both legs were burning. Discovered huge painful red patches all over both legs. 10:00pm took 50mg Benadryl again. Went to bed 4/7- 9:00am red patches still painful, burning. Took 50mg more Benadryl. Spent most of the day sleeping 4/8- hives gone due to benadryl. Red patches slightly less painful. New red patches/dots appeared on ankles and tops of feet 4/9- red dots spread over tops of feet/toes, new itchy bumps with red dots appeared trailing down the backs of calf area on both legs. 8:30am went back to quick care facility. Saw new doctor who instructed to stop taking antibiotic and switch to cream form of &#34;triamcinolone 0.1%&#34; twice daily. Also referred to dermatology specialist. 3:30pm first application of steroid cream made legs burn and feet/ankles swell. Determined too much was used 4/10-4/13 smaller amount of cream applied twice daily as directed. Burning stopped but feet/ankles still swollen each day 4/13-original large red patches mostly cleared. New red dots on backs of calves and tops of feet still prevalent. 4:00pm saw dermatology specialist who determined red dots were a form of vasculitis. Ordered blood and urine analysis to determine if other organs have been affected. Scheduled appointment with laboratory for 4/17 at 11:00am Other symptoms: dizziness, abdominal pain/pressure, diarrhea at various points throughout the day from 4/9-current

Sunday was dizziness, aches, nausea and cramping in left leg. Monday was nausea, aches, tingling in hands and feet, headache, brain fog. Tuesday I woke up with major imbalance and needed to use walls to walk without falling over. Dizziness subsided after some time to only rapid movements. I had a warm burning sensation in left leg with tingling hands and feet. Moderate headache. Reports came out of stopping the Janssen vaccine so I contacted my doctor with my symptoms and they ordered blood tests for clots.

Just minutes after sitting down patient lost consciousness, fell from chair, hit her head on the floor, seize for a short moment, only to momentarily regain consciousness,  and faint for a second time.  EMS were called and patient was transported to Emergency Department for testing and observation. Patient believes she fainted the first time due to not having eaten much by that point in the day and due to anxiety about receiving the vaccine, and she was told she fainted a second time due to hypotension. She states she has a history of previously fainting during other medical procedures, though no similar previous reactions she can recall after vaccines.

Fever, aches and chills subsided within 48 hours. Weakness and fatigue lasted for 7 days after vaccination, then went away. General dizziness (constantly feels like when you have a cold/ear infection and get up and are dizzy) persists through date of this report (day 12 after vaccination). I feel completely better except for the dizziness.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                I began to feel shortness of breath when walking, tightness in my chest, for the same reason any physical effort made me feel like I was short of breath. (The day before I had presented the common symptoms such as fever, chills, arm pain, muscle pain) however this symptom was off the list, at 11:30 in the morning I had to go to an emergency clinic, they checked me with blood test, urine tests, medical exam, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. The doctor told me that everything was fine that I could leave. I had to pay a high bill at the hospital. The following 7 days the sensation was disappearing very slowly. However from day 8 it started again, until now on day 13, I still having sensation of shortness of breath when doing physical exercise, it is something that lasts and does not disappear.

                                                After the shot I had a pasta lunch and then took a nap for about one hour.  When I woke up ( 3-4 hours after the shot) I had a fever.  I could tell because I was very hot and sweaty even though my room was air conditioned.  I drank water and immediately was nauseous and vomited.  I continued to have sweats, chills, and after about another hour body aches set in.  My whole body was cramping up and my hands were shaky.  I was very short of breath over short movements like to get to the bathroom, I would be out of breath and dizzy.   Around 1700  (6 hours post shot) I took Tylenol and continued to take it every six hours.  I was able to keep ginger ale and crackers down but didn&#39;t eat much else until the next morning.  I think the fever broke in the night.  The next morning I was just really tired and sore, but much less achy than the day prior.   I was able to eat light meals  and I stopped taking Tylenol sometime that mid-morning.  I felt fine the next day (about 48 hours after the shot).

                                                a 27 y.o. female with a history of Covid infection December 26, 2020, positive covid test December 29, 2020. She had approximately 2 weeks of symptoms including generalized body ache and generalized weakness.  Fatigue and some headache.  Had some persistence of symptoms after that time.  Had some benefit from ibuprofen.   Was seen at emergency room on January 27, 2021 stating that she felt that all her symptoms of Covid had resolved except for some chest pain which awoke her on January 27.  She presented to the emergency room.  Had sinus tachycardia at 113 but otherwise unremarkable physical exam, laboratory studies with white blood count elevated 16,004-20, hemoglobin 13.7 g hematocrit 41.8%, MCV 87.1, RDW 12.7%, platelet count 329,000, segs 72.8%, lymphs 20.6%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 1%, basophil 0.6%.  BUN 10.1, creatinine 0.8, AST 24, ALT elevated 56, alkaline phosphatase 68, total protein 7.6, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.6, globulin by subtraction 4.0, troponin less than 0.02, D-dimer quantitative 0.22, urine pregnancy test normal.  Chest x-ray normal.  Chest pain appears to be musculoskeletal and was reproduced by palpation of her chest wall.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  D-dimer was normal.  Heart rate returned to normal after some intravenous fluids.  Patient discharged on Zithromax 500 mg day 1 and then to 50 mg days 2 through 5.  Also continued on ibuprofen.   Received Johnson and Johnson vaccine April 5, 2021.  Over the next week patient started having increasing soreness.  Her joints hurt more than usual and her headache was worse.  She had a sensation that her legs were &#34;numb and tingly&#34; starting at her buttocks and extending down her leg.   Because of reported incidence of cerebral sinus thrombosis or cerebral vein thrombosis patient appropriately presented for screening in the emergency room and was sent for appropriate imaging.   April 16, 2021 CT scan of head with and without contrast no acute intracranial hemorrhage, no mass-effect or midline shift.  On contrast-enhanced images there appears to be a lobular nonocclusive filling defect in the far lateral right transverse sinus.  Lobular occlusive filling defect is also likely present in the mid to central right transverse sinus.  Short segment filling defect in the medial left transverse sinus.  Remainder of sinuses and internal cerebral veins are patent.  Focal lobular filling defect within the confluence of the right and transverse sinus most likely related to arachnoid granulation.  No edema hemorrhage of the cerebellum or cerebrum.  No other significant findings.   April 16, 2021 confirmatory MRI angiogram of head without contrast with no restricted diffusion to suggest acute or subacute infarct.  Contrast void in the middle to central right transverse sinus consistent with occlusive thrombus.  Nonocclusive thrombus in the far lateral right transverse thrombus.  Narrowing of the medial left transverse sinus without complete occlusion.   April 16, 2021 2345 hrs. inital hematology consultation.  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels have been requested stat and are still pending.  If fibrinogen level is low will replace with cryoprecipitate.  If D-dimer is elevated barely confirms diagnosis of possible vaccine related thrombosis.  The fact the patient is not thrombocytopenic at this time is encouraging, however despite the lack of thrombocytopenia she still has clearly documented symptomatic nonocclusive and occlusive thrombus in her cerebral sinus.   From UPtoDate.com Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, also referred to as the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine) ? On April 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended pausing administration of AD26.COV2.S  to further investigate rare cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia [33]. As of that date, six cases had been reported, all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination; during this period, 6.8 million doses were administered (with 1.5 million doses in females of that age range) [121-123]. Since some vaccine recipients have not been followed for longer than the time frame over which these symptoms develop, the incidence may change with additional follow-up. Initial symptoms included headache, backache, chills, and fatigue, and progressed to focal neurologic deficits. Intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboses at other sites were also seen in some patients. All of the five patients who were tested for the anti-PF4 HIT antibody tested positive. Another case, in a young male who was a vaccine recipient in one of the pre-emergency use authorization efficacy trials, had been previously reported. These cases appear similar to those reported following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, another adenovirus-vector vaccine. Although rare, the observed number of events exceeded the expected rate among females &lt;50 years old. Given the extreme rarity of these events, the FDA and CDC acknowledge that they recommended the pause out of an abundance of caution and to ensure awareness of these rare events.    ?Evaluation and management of possible thrombotic complications ? Recipients should be aware of the possible association and seek immediate care for signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombocytopenia (eg, new petechiae or bruising) or thrombotic complications (including shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity edema, persistent severe abdominal pain, unabating severe headache, severe backache, new focal neurologic symptoms, and seizures) [117]. In such cases, some experts suggest evaluation with complete blood count and differential (including the platelet count), quantitative D-dimer, HIT testing, and imaging of any suspected site of thrombosis [113,114,125]. Onset 4 to 20 days after vaccination, platelet count &lt;150,000/microL, elevated D-dimer, and a positive anti-PF4 antibody (HIT antibody) suggest the diagnosis. Treatment with a non-heparin/non-warfarin anticoagulant (eg, argatroban or direct oral anticoagulant) and intravenous immune globulin has been suggested. The CDC recommends not using heparin in individuals with thromboses following receipt of Ad26.COV2.S unless HIT testing is negative [126]. (See &#34;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&#34; and &#34;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Terminology and HIT variants&#39; and &#34;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Role of IVIG&#39;.)   As stated above all the 6 cases were &#34;all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination&#34; this would certainly fit the timeframe that we are seeing in this case.  Recommendations from national guidelines would be to start treatment with dexamethasone immediately while awaiting intravenous gammaglobulin.  To pursue intravenous gammaglobulin treatment at 1 g/kg over 1 to 2 days.  It is recommended to avoid heparin and instead use direct factor X inhibitor such as Eliquis, which this patient is already been started on.     There is unfortunately considerable risk that even though patient&#39;s symptoms appear mild at this time, that she may deteriorate in the very near future and I would recommend treating her aggressively at this time with dexamethasone and intravenous gammaglobulin while we are awaiting further testing.  Patient clearly has had unusual thrombosis, especially in a 27-year-old.     With the fact that she had headache dating back to January, it is impossible to determine the acute versus chronic nature of her venous sinus thrombosis. Covid infection does cause increase in coagulation as well.  However, given the small risk of tragic outcome with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis in the setting of Covid vaccinations, we will proceed aggressively with treatment starting tonight with intravenous gammaglobulin and intravenous dexamethasone.     Will require rapid fasting glucoses to evaluate possible hyperglycemia from high-dose dexamethasone.  Will consider stopping dexamethasone at 48 hours.  Current recommendation for gammaglobulin would be single 1 g/kg or 500 mg/kg over 2 days.  No recommendations for treatment beyond this point.  Current recommendations for gammaglobulin dosing would recommend using an adjusted dose for patients with greater than 125% of their ideal body weight.  This patient at 122 kg on a 5 foot 2 inch frame does qualify for adjusted dose and her orders reflect that.   I appreciate the opportunity see this patient this evening and consultation requested by Dr.  We will follow patient in hospital.  Hopefully she will have gradual improvement and avoid any serious or tragic complications of her cerebral sinus thrombosis.     We will have pharmacy report possible adverse reaction to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to the FDA as required by law.   April 17, 2021 follow up. No new events.  Laboratory studies remained excellent.  White blood count is further elevated, however, this may be secondary to high-dose dexamethasone with a white blood count of 16,060.  Hemoglobin 14.0 g hematocrit 42.8%, MCV 86.8, RDW 12.9%.  Platelet count is actually increased slightly at 374 as of 9:10 AM this morning.  Differential shows left shift as expected with dexamethasone.  Results from yesterday showed fibrinogen normal at 369 (180?415) pro time normal at 10.4 seconds with INR of 0.97, PTT 26.7.  D-dimer 0.23 (0.19?0.50).  With platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer normal I am inclined to believe that this is not an acute post vaccination HIT-like phenomena.  If it were I would still expect to see some degree of thrombocytopenia elevated D-dimer and perhaps low fibrinogen.  The other explanations for her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are either idiopathic spontaneous and merely coincidentally associated at the exact same time as her Covid infection or more likely, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulable state secondary to her Covid infection from December 2020.  Unfortunatly there is no way to accurately date the acuity of the venous thrombosis in her cerebral sinus.  HIT Testing is still pending and most likely will not be available for 3-4 more days despite being ordered stat.  Have called the laboratory and asked them to check with our outside reference lab what the expected return time is on this test. (LabCorp says &#34;Tuesday April 20, 2021).  Patient refused intravenous gammaglobulin infusion which has been ordered last night.  Patient has been receiving dexamethasone which was a bridge until intravenous gammaglobulin could be administered.  Current guidance from the expert hematology panel (EHP) on Covid vaccine induced thrombosis dated April 7, 2021 from the  public health would state that a patient who has a reduced platelet count without thrombosis with a D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen or thrombosis with a normal platelet count and D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen are &#34;unlikely cases&#34;.  They recommend for probable cases who have D-dimers that are elevated to send HIT assay and then give immediate intravenous gammaglobulin while awaiting results.  They recommend fibrinogen supplementation, if needed.  They recommend a direct acting antithrombin agents such as the Eliquis this patient is receiving.  They recommend steroids particularly if there is a delay in getting intravenous gammaglobulin delivered.  With the fact that we now have 24 hours in the hospital with no evidence of thrombocytopenia, no evidence of increased fibrinolytic activity or active thrombosis, and no evidence of hypofibrinogenemia, I would argue that her presentation is subacute.  In this setting, I do not feel intravenous gammaglobulin would be necessary and does involve a small risk as well as considerable cost.  Dexamethasone also involves small risk and negligible cost. I have discontinued both of these medications.  My overall impression would be that this was not related to her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination which was recent, but rather her more distant Covid infection.  It is impossible to definitively answer the question however.  The next question is duration of anticoagulation.  Risk of recurrent cerebral sinus venous thrombosis is relatively small but the morbidity can be high.  Studies have been performed showing medications in the same class as Eliquis have been associated with a decrease in incidence of the recurrence.  Most hematologist recommend 3 months of anticoagulation for provoked venous thrombosis including cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.  I feel this patient&#39;s thrombosis is &#34;provoked&#34;, with her association at the same time of her Covid infection (and possibly vaccination).  I would recommend Eliquis (apixaban) 5 mg twice daily or Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 20 mg daily with food. I would feel comfortable in discharging patient for outpatient follow up IF Dr and other speciality services agree. Plan 3 months of full dose anticoagulation with direct factor X inhibitor.   Circulation 2010 Jun 29;121(25):2740-6 &#34;Long-term evaluation of the risk of recurrence after cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis&#34;, Background: The clinical course of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis (CSVT) is largely unknown because prospective studies with a long follow-up and with the goal to assess thrombosis recurrence rate and predisposing factors for recurrence are lacking. Methods and results: One hundred forty-five patients with a first CSVT were followed up for a median of 6 years after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. End points were recurrent CSVT or other clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism. CSVT recurred in 5 patients (3%) and other manifestations of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism) were seen in 10 additional patients (7%), for a recurrence rate of 2.03 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.14) for all manifestations of venous thromboembolism and 0.53 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 1.10) for CSVT. Nearly half of the recurrences occurred within the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis were male sex (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.86 to 32.7) and, for thromboses other than CSVT, severe thrombophilia resulting from antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency, anti-phospholipid antibodies, or combined abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 16.5). Conclusions: The risk of recurrent CSVT is low and is higher in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment and among men. Mild thrombophilia abnormalities are not associated with recurrent CSVT, but severe thrombophilia entails an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism.   April 19, 2021 Follow up, no change in condition. Discussed case with Dr, will order Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, anti phospholipid and anti cardiolipin antibodies, if she will allow draw. Expect Heparin Induced Thrombosis testing result tomorrow, but with no thrombocytopenia after given heparin, expect will be normal. Will await result. If discharged, would recommend 3 months direct thrombin inhibitor (Eliquis/Xarelto/Pradaxa) at full anticoagulation dose. Then stop, no taper. Overall still feel &#34;provoked&#34; thrombosis due to December Covid, unrelated to J&amp;J Covid vaccine, but can not definitively prove that..

I got a bad fever and started to uncontrollably violently shake for an hour and a half. I had sevier leg pain and soreness. I also had a terrible headache. The symptoms eventually eased after taking Advil and Tylenol after a few hours. The next day I still had all of those reactions again, but the shaking was not as bad and didn&#39;t last more than a half an hour. Symptoms continued to fluctuate, but generally got better over 4 days.

I went to the movies with my sister and had a seizure some time while at the movies.  I went to the hospital and at the hospital I had a second convulsion seizure at the hospital which lasted 10 minutes and something that I had low blood count. They kept me at the hospital for 2-3 days. I also had migraines and taking anti convulsion medication. They performed MRI, EEG&#39;s, CT scans and all my exams came back within normal limits. I am not epileptic.   I believe I am now stable and taking my medicine as prescribed, I am still out of work and I have not had a seizure since being at the hospital.

I was unable to walk in a straight line.  I was also very emotional.  I took a nap and woke up with a headache, chills and sweating, I had body aches and pain in my back. My skin was hot to the touch.  I was nauseous and weak with no fever. The next day I was having shortness of breath and I thought I had blood clots.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, my left arm and left side of my neck and back became very sore and I felt very light headed and dizzy. 7 hours later, the back pain worsened and I started sweating a lot. Soon after my skin all over my body began to tingle as if I had bugs crawling all over my body and it was very uncomfortable. During the night I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was sweating so much, the back pain was getting worse and worse, and the tingly skin feeling turned into very intense skin sensitivity and hurt any time my body touched something or rubbed against my clothing. At some points I would be extremely hot and sweating a lot and then some points I was freezing cold and shaking uncontrollably. These signs all lasted 24 hours and slowly started going away after 48 hours. After 48 hours, I felt much better and back to &#34;normal&#34; but couldn&#39;t help but notice some strange reactions that I still have today, 3 weeks later... I have had acne which is uncommon for me. I have had period cramps and mood swings but am not on my period. I also have had crazy bloating in my stomach and all over my body... swollen legs, feet, hands, etc. I also have been experiencing brain fog where I loose my train of thought in conversation, I can&#39;t remember where I put things, I can&#39;t remember if I took my eye contacts out or not, or fed the dog... very strange and uncharacteristic of me to be so aloof and forgetful but to the point where I have zero recollection of doing such activities.

                                                I took the vaccine around 8:15 am at Hospital. They had a special event for Employees. After I was home I felt extremely tired and that improved after i laid down for a bit. However, around 7 PM I became very cold and had a temperature of 100.3 with chills/shakes. It has lasted into the next day with chills being on and off. I experienced muscle cramps as well has some chest discomfort.

I did notice my Raynaud?s symptoms became way worse.  At about 5:30pm I started to feel extremely cold. By 6pm I was having horrible pains and spasms in my lower back and hips. My muscles and joints became very stiff. This moved to my neck/shoulders, and down my thighs. I lost feeling in my feet and started struggling to be able to take in a full breath. I felt like my whole body was locked up. I started feeling nauseous, but part of that may have been from the nerves. The next morning I felt a bit more mobile but still nauseous and stiff. I have slowly gotten better throughout the day, but am still stiff and exhausted

                                                About 7-8 minutes later I started feeling pressure in the  right side of my head. It went away a bit. I was walking after the 15 minutes and started feeling weird in my face, I just sat in my car and waited because I had to drive.  I started feeling numbness under my eye and down the rest of my face. The thing that worried me the most I had so much pressure under my eye like it was inside my brain.  The numbness and pain caused me to freak out.  I went to back to the convention center to let them know, they brought the Paramedic to me they started checking me and doing a work up. They told me I wasn&#39;t a life threatening emergency and my vitals were ok. They offered to take me to the ER and I declined and I decided to leave because I have been there for 1hr 45mins. I felt like my symptoms were at 70%. When I got home I freaked out again because the numbness didn&#39;t go away and my face looked like it was a little lower and had a panic attack and went to the ER. They checked on me and told me I didn&#39;t have a stroke. They told me It was a side effect to the vaccine. They told me to follow up with the Neurologist if I have any more symptoms, I have an appointment with them in a couple weeks. I&#39;m a little concerned because there is a minor pain that I didn&#39;t have before on my right side and it worries me.

My husband stacked 10&#43; blankets on top of me trying to get me to warm up.  I was running a fever of 103, and my heart rate was at 104 all night long.  My fever didn&#39;t break until shortly before 8:00 a.m. on Monday, March 15, 2021 but my heart rate stayed between 95 - 102 most of the day.  The body aches weren&#39;t too terrible, but I did have those.  I have bruising, puffiness, and swelling at the injection site.

I slept from 3:45 to 4:30 pm but was still tired and felt weak. I did feel hungry and made dinner over 30 minutes. However, this wore me out. I was even more tired and started getting dizzy. I almost fainted as I made my way to a chair to sit down. I couldn&#39;t eat because of slight nausea and cold chills. I was shaking for about 20 minutes. Eventually, I made it to my bed to lay down, but my legs were shaking as I walked up the stairs. At 6:00 pm, my temperature was 98.8 F. I was freezing a shivering for the next hour in bed under 3 blankets. My hands and feet felt like ice. At 8:00 pm, I had a fever of 100.2  F that lasted all night. My body ached all over, especially at the hips. I couldn&#39;t sit still and couldn&#39;t sleep until 4:00 am. I woke at 8:30 am with some milder aches and fatigue with a temperature of 97.6 F.

                                                I awoke at 6:45 a.m. feeling a bit sore in my arm, but relatively okay.  I was up for approximately ten minutes and then extended my arms over my head to stretch out some of the achiness and immediately regretted the action.  I began to feel dizzy and nauseous and saw black spots encroaching on my peripheral vision.  I washed my face to relieve some discomfort with no change.  I walked toward the bedroom to grab my glass of water when the black spots increased, clouded my entire vision, and I collapsed on the bed.  I then began to hyper-salivate and after waking my husband and catching my breath, I returned to bathroom, experienced diarrhea, and simultaneously vomited into the trash can.  The vomit tasted chemical and extremely acidic.  My body was also shaking uncontrollably during this time and I kept switching between chills and being too hot.  After I felt comfortable leaving the bathroom, I crawled back in bed but was shaking so much that I couldn&#39;t stop my teeth from chattering and could not get warm no matter that my husband placed an extra blanket over me.  I had taken my temperature before while I was in the bathroom and it read 94.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  I took it again in bed about twenty minutes later and it read 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  My head was splitting and my arm ached, but I was eventually able to go back to sleep.  I felt better after sleeping for a few hours and drinking more fluids.

                                                Around 4 pm I was starting to feel a little sore. By 4:30 pm I had some major chills that turned into hot flashes. At around 4:30 pm I took 400mg of Ibuprofen. For 1 hour I was fighting a fever and chill spells that rapidly changed during that 1 hour time period, ending at 5:30 pm. Within that time I had major acks in my back and neck. I also experience sinus pressure and pins and needs in my ears and behind my ears. After 5:30 pm I did feel significantly better and now are 8:00 pm I feel exhausted, my head hurts and my ears feel like they weigh a pound each. Hope that was helpful. Thanks for doing what you&#39;re doing.

About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

Later that day (around 6:00pm) I started feeling lightheaded, chills and a headache. My hands, feet, nose and hands were freezing but other areas of my body were warm. I also felt body aches- my lower back started with the aches and it spread up to my upper neck. Around 9:00pm I started feeling very hot and this hot/cold changes continued throughout the night. This morning of 4/9/2021 I have less of a headache however, my body is still very sore and I continue to experience the hot/cold changes.

Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

Convulsions reduced significantly and patient was coherent without post-ictal state. EMS was called and she was taken to nearby hospital for further evaluation. Patient had reportedly taken ativan and depakote this morning prior to arrival.

PT with her mother, became light-headed and dizzy while walking from vaccination site back to vehicle for 15 minute wait. PT became unresponsive with mother and fainted.  Parking staff alerted rapid response team, PT regained responsiveness and was given chair to sit on, water to drink.  Rapid response team arrived to a responsive, A&amp;Ox4, pale female who was still feeling weak and light-headed.  PT was transferred to a cot (in the shade) where she was placed in supine position with legs elevated on a chair.  Pt was given water and hard candy to suck on while vitals were taken,,  Airway, breathing and circulation were all WNL.     PT states she presently has a strep infection (throat area)  and has been afebrile, and is to begin oral antibiotics once she picks RX up from pharmacy.     PT began feeling significantly better over 10-15 minutes of laying down in the shade.    EMS LAFD was called and transfer of care to EMS Station 93 for further work-up was instituted.  PT felt much better and was able to stand and ambulate from cot to EMS vehicle without issue.    PT chose to go home with her mother instead of being transported by EMS to medical facility.      Exam (update as needed): GEN: Alert and oriented x 4, relaxed in appearance.

After layering up it took about 30 minutes for shaking to fully subside and maybe 2-3 hours for body temperature to feel hot. Had headache and dry mouth the rest of the night into the early morning.   Took 400mg ibuprofen after having a morning meal and experienced no other side effects going forward except some tiredness from not getting a full nights rest.

                                                I had the usual fever that began in evening around 8pm, but before that I started developing leg cramping like growing pains behind my left knee. The growing pains persisted behind the left knee for two full days (requiring me to take Tylenol to sleep), then it began behind my right knee, as well. That lasted another 24 hours before the growing pains expanded to both calves, as well. The pain persisted for an entire week and would wake me up in the mornings. I began stretching and working out and now the soreness from my work outs mostly masks the growing pains. I believe today is the first day I am not experiencing the growing pains.

The shaking (extremely bad, could not control my own muscles at all and I had to lay on my arms so they wouldn&#39;t flail out) and racing heart lasted about five hours. The headache and all over muscle pain finally eased up last night. Breathing aches and I am still experiencing muscle weakness.

My muscles stiffened and my hands/thumbs were cramping inward. My hands were also red and blotchy during this time. My face was tight and hard to move or talk. This entire incident lasted in total around 20 minutes or so. I seem to be okay since that incident, I have had a headache off and on. Not sure if it?s related to the vaccine but I haven?t experienced anything like this before.

                                                I was fine for the most part after the vaccine. The only thing that hurt was my arm at the injection site. I started feeling nauseous about an hour later. Then at about 9:00 pm, I started to feel really sick. I felt very tired and my whole body hurt. I had a low body temperature, 95 degrees. Chills, fever, shaking, nausea. Very SEVERE symptoms. Felt very disoriented. I thought I was going to pass out and faint. Vision blurry and seen white.  Pounding headache. Ears ringing. I could hardly walk that night, I was crawling on the floor. I felt out of breath. My heart was beating very fast. My left side of my chest hurt by my ribs. When I did wake up from sleep, I woke up with blood in my mouth and dried blood on my lips.

                                                On Sunday an Monday after the shot I had muscle weakness. I felt fine by the end of Monday night, but then on Tuesday morning I started to feel weird brain surges and getting shaky like I was on drugs or something. I went to the ER and they said it&#39;s vaccine related and that I just wait it out.

I was wearing a fitbit and then noticed my heart Rate went up to the 90s and fluctuated between 90-110 bpm all night into the next morning.  I woke up every 2 hours  to a new symptom on top of what I was feeling already. It started with chills, then sweating, nausea and  a headache. I had a fever of 99.5 at the highest. And then the last time I woke up at 5 my heart hurt so bad, my whole chest muscle hurt with a sharp pain and It hurt to breath.  The next day I had a little headache and my body hurt, and I had cramping in my legs for a few days, but I also started my menstrual cycle on the 13th.  The leg cramping continued for a few days but only when I sat on my legs for too long.

                                                I received the shot on Saturday, March 6th. Flu-like symptoms developed 12 hours after (aches, chills, extreme fatigue) and lasted about 12 hours -- pain in left arm lasted a full five days. On Thursday March 11th I started to develop a cold sore on my chin which was followed by malaise and swollen glands. I treated it with Zovirax. On Wednesday March 17th I developed what looked to be a pimple in the middle of my left eyelid. There was a small white/ fluid filled head about the size of a pin head. Over the next three days, three more fluid-like blisters the size of a pin-head began to develop on upper eyelid. By Tuesday March 23rd, I had over half a dozen fluid filled blisters that were painful and began to crust. The blisters extended from upper eyelid to below the brow (only on left side of face). On Tuesday March 23rd I went to the eye doctor. The eye doctor had asked if I ever had shingles (I have had the chicken pox vaccine, but never had chicken pox nor shingles). I have had HSV-1 since childhood and get the yearly cold-sore when stressed or immunity is low, but I never have had cold sores appear anywhere else other than lip/chin area. The doctor had suspected the eye blisters were a form of herpes and prescribed me 14 days of Valacyclovir. The blisters only affected the skin-- not the cornea or inside eye. Within a day and a half of the antivirals medication, the blisters were fully crusted over and started to clear up.

I laid down to go to sleep at 8:30 PM and dosed in and out of sleep. Around 10:30 PM I had a fever of 100.7 degree Fahrenheit. Around 12 AM my fever broke and by 1:30 PM I started feeling better. I had a really bad headache all night and into the morning, so bad I could feel throbbing in my teeth. I still have some soreness in my left hip joint and shoulder/neck. I have also had diarrhea once around 12:30 PM today. I did have COVID-19 at the end of December 2020 into January 2020. Not sure if that makes a difference.

So I went to the ER and I got blood work done and I was told something about my CK levels were extremely high and that&#39;s when I was admitted. The day that I got the vaccine I got really dizzy during that 15mins that they make us wait and I felt very sick While I was admitted my CK levels kept going up the doctors told me that I had something rhapdomysosis , the pain got worse and the doctor increased my level of fluids and they did and ultra sound on my legs to check for blood clots and they kept increasing my levels of fluids and once I was let go from the doctor I did have to keep going back to keep getting my blood check. I did continue to feel muscle weakness in my legs while I was home. I did go back to the doctor 05/14 for muscle weakness I was given as bag of fluid.. After that any time I stand too long or I am working out I can no longer work out for as long as I can. I can no longer work out for longer then 15mins because of the pain in my legs. I suffer at night time now with muscles spams now they happen all throughout the night. I had very low potassium

She first noticed pain when streching the arm shortly after the IV infusion but didn&#39;t pay attention to it, then 5 day later she noticed localized swelling and redness.  Patient was sent for US doppler which left cephalic vein thrombus detected on duplex US. Was treated with aspirin and had follow up doppler of UE for follow up on LUE cephalic vein thrombosis-negative 5/13/21.

                                                The patient was very nervous before the injection. Approximately 5 minutes post-injection, the patient felt very anxious and reported feeling cold. Her parents had her lay on the floor. I held an ammonia inhalant close to her. She was breathing normally, but visibly nervous. I asked about her medical history and parents reported a history of seizures.  They said she normally experiences flashing lights before a seizure; but she did not report a prodrome. I called for an ambulance for her to be assessed. The parents asked for her to be hospitalized for a workup.

I took my rescue medication Ubrelvy 100 mg at onset of migraine, it didn&#39;t work. I took another one two hours later. I sat in the shower trying to relieve the pressure. It took about 48 hours for it actually go away. It was lingering though. I could go about my day to day but there was this constant pressure in my head. That went on for about a week. I work with my physicians and he confirmed it was a migraine. Rest was what helped.

My vaccine symptoms started at 9pm with severe chills, body muscle aches, severe headache, pain everywhere. Then by midnight I was crying in severe pain, everything worsened plus I had severe nausea and diarrhea. My neck and back and every limb was throbbing, I was sweating profusely and had the chills, my headache has still persisted even now. I had to call out of work today. I stayed in bed until 11am and finally was able to shower. I?ve been lethargic, and in pain all day. Today more in my hands and head.

                                                I had side effects starting one hour after the vaccine - headache and nausea. Muscle pain started 12 hours after and it spread to my other arm - my entire upper body ached. I was nauseous and peeing a lot for 2 days. I did have a few hives, 2 on my arm and 1 on my face and I had not eaten anything high in histamine. The weather that week was stormy and lousy. On Friday-Saturday, I had an intense bought of allergies (plugged dripping nose) and that is very rare for me, regardless of the weather. By Sunday, I had shortness of breath, nausea, and shaking. I tried eating and playing a game to get my mind off it and that didn&#39;t help. Usually with my anxiety, I can just tell myself I&#39;ll be okay. I told myself I would be okay and if I got a blood clot I would be perfectly fine. It did not work at all. This kind of anxiety was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever experienced. Nothing I did helped and it felt like everything was going a mile a minute.   I decided to take a benadryl, telling myself that this was just the &#34;impending sense of doom&#34; that happens with food allergies. I slept for 12 hours and felt exhausted when I woke up, like I had just been through something tough. I tried to just move past it, but the anxiety got worse and worse. I saw a doctor 06/23/2021 and have started taking Prozac.

                                                On 7/2/2021, 28y.o. female patient presented to the pharmacy with her husband to receive their COVID-19 vaccines. Patient was checked in, screened and requested Janssen vaccine.  RPh stepped outside to speak with patient about the potential side effect risks with Janssen due to her age group but told patient ultimate decision of which vaccine to receive was her choice.  Patient stated she wanted to stick with Janssen and RPh then proceeded to review the questionnaire with patient that she had filled out online.  Patient answered no to all questions including the question about ever having a reaction, fainting or feeling dizzy after a vaccine. She was counseled by the pharmacist of potential side effects and how to treat at home or seek medical attention , v-safe program reporting, vaccine card, waiting 15 mins in pharmacy area to be monitored, etc. Her vaccine was administered at approximately 10:12 by rx tech and a wait time of 10:27 given to pt.    Work continued in the pharmacy and the patient and her husband were in the waiting area chairs in front of the pharmacy talking (per him, they were joking about side effects when she started to slump over and he thought she was playing around until she started falling backwards and he tried to catch her by her shirt). At approximately, 10:19, the pharmacist and techs heard a loud noise as patient experienced syncope falling backwards hitting the back of her head on the cement floor and the chair fell out from under her and crashing against the floor. Husband was by her side as RPh ran out to assist asking techs to close the pharmacy down for the medical emergency and to call 911 ASAP, call in around 10:19. Code white was called as well.    Assessment following Adv Events protocol: Patient was breathing and awake with dazed/glazed eyes as pharmacist started trying to ask questions to assess her conscious level.  After about 30-45 seconds pt came back around and answered name and DOB for pharmacist who was talking back and forth with 911 operator.  Patient answered that she felt hot, dizzy and anxious to rph who immediately had cold compresses (cool, wet paper towels) for patient&#39;s face and neck. Patient also stated that she had not had anything to eat since 7/1 PM as they had planned to grab breakfast after their vaccines.  Store managers arrived as well.  Local firefighters from the station just down the street were in the store doing their daily meal shopping and heard the call come across to EMS so they came back to the pharmacy to help.  They already had equipment in hand and recorded vitals while RPh was still attending to pt and 911 operator. at 10:24; bp:124/92, pulse 70, O2 sat: 98.  Patient stated she felt well enough to try to sit up in the chair again and get off the hard floor and was assisted up by firemen and husband.  One of the firemen and RPh assessed the back of the patient&#39;s head and no blood or knot was located, patient able to ambulate head and neck and no blood was found on the floor.  Patient still able to answer questions, knew where she was, what she had done except in the moment of fainting and knew who her husband was.  Patient refused to be transported to the hospital and EMS was cancelled by firemen to 911.  Firemen left scene.   Rph, rx tech and Assest Protection completed initial questioning for VAERS/SCRT, Incident and EOC contacted while patient and husband still present.  Patient asked for some water and was provided her wishes.  Rph continued to ask patient questions about how she was feeling as reports were being gathered. Patient stated she thought not eating and her anxiety got to her causing her to faint and still reported no previous issues with receiving vaccines.    Also counseled on signs/symptoms of a concussion, soreness to be expected over the next few days and to seek help immediately if any conditions worsened.  Patient was given RPh&#39;s card and told that she would be followed up with Friday PM at COB and Monday, but if anything changed between then to call RPh at the number on the business card.  Upon finishing reporting and standing, patient stated back of right knee was hurting from tangle with chair upon fall; otherwise felt fine just a little tired and laughing.  A wheelchair or electric cart was offered to patient upon leaving but she asked to walk out assisted by husband and was released.    Reporting: Pt meds tri-sprintec and lexapro 20mg, no allergies, only medical condition is anxiety, no PCP

                                                At the time of injection, it was pretty painful and thus sent my body into a shock less than 5 mins after receiving my dose. My vision went white and I was very light-headed and hot/sweaty.  A nurse came with me outside to monitor and I was feeling back to normal in 15 minutes. This is something that happens when I experience a high amount of pain, so just reporting for others who maybe have low blood pressure issues.  At about 8pm, other side effects started to set in. I first experienced a headache, then experienced soreness/ache-y-ness  in my back. Around 8:30, I started to feel light headed again and soon my whole body felt ache-y. I quickly developed chills where I felt so cold that I was uncontrollably shaking and felt very sore/stiff. I have been laying under a heated blanket for the last hour and a half and am finally feeling better with no more shaking  or chills. I still have soreness throughout my body and a headache, but I took ibuprofen around 8:30pm.

Around 9 pm I started experiencing extreme body aches all over that felt like my body was &#34;fighting&#34; against itself. I also experienced chills. I had a hard time sleeping from the pain. The next morning a headache started and progressed into a migraine. I could not get up or open my eyes from how bad the migraine was. I took extra strength Tylenol for the pain with little relief. On Saturday evening the symptoms started to get better and turned more into a headache. I still had the headache on Sunday but it was better after taking the Tylenol. On Monday my arm is now sore (it wasn&#39;t sore prior).

                                                Around 3:15 in the afternoon, I began experiencing severe aches and muscle pains, combined with a growing migraine. Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

Fever is continuing today (3/11/2021), but is lower at 100.4F. Tingling fingers on hand from vaccination arm (left), swelling from vaccination injection site, headache, and neck pain all developed on 3/10/2021.  Headache and neck pain could be due to head trauma from vasovagal syncope. Tingling fingers were not observed on 3/11/2021.    *I have had vasovagal syncope in the past, but never with vaccines. It always occurs when I see my own blood.

                                                I started feeling subtle flu-like symptoms about 6 hours after receiving shot. At first I thought it was in my head but by the early evening I felt like I had a full blown fever even though I never actually had a fever at any point.  I had chills, muscles aches, head aches, and extreme fatigue. My back hurt especially and overall I felt very weak. I also had pain at the injection site that got worse the following day. I had trouble even lifting my arm to reach a drink just a few feet away from me.  The arm soreness lasted through the Monday following my vaccination (I received it on a Friday). All my symptoms were at their worst on Saturday. I felt much better on Sunday but still had the arm pain through Monday. Motrin did help relieve the worst my symptoms. I thought that was the end of my symptoms but that last week I have noticed what I believe to be a lingering fatigue from the vaccination. While it&#39;s not usual for me to feel tired at points throughout the day, I have been feeling a heavier and more full body fatigue than I usually experience. I have had to take naps more often, sometimes multiple times in a day.  During these bouts of fatigue, my whole body feels heavy and somewhat weak. It&#39;s similar to the exhausted feeling someone might have after they&#39;ve been crying for a while but I haven&#39;t been crying or emotionally taxed in anyway.  Normally when I wake up in the morning, I might feel tired for the first 30 minutes to an hour but once I get moving, I feel better and more alter. I have been having a harder time feeling rested or awake in the mornings and even if I get more sleep than normal, I still feel exhausted. I did not change my routine or diet which I why I think this is related to the vaccine.

                                                Around 8 hours after the shot I started to experience fatigue, body aches, uncontrollable body shakes, blueish lips and sweating (which to me indicated I had a fever). After taking some Advil my lips returned to normal and the body shakes stopped although it was hard to regulate my body temperature. I was sweating but felt cold. The worst of the symptoms seemed to last around 13 hours after they had started (so about 7pm on 3/25 to about 8am on 3/26). It&#39;s now been around 30 hours and I&#39;m feeling better but still fatigued and have soreness in my left arm where I received the injection.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

                                                On Monday 3/15 or Tuesday 3/16 I started developing a rash on the knuckles of my right hand and fingers. It first looked like small burns, and then started swelling to look more like spider bites. The rash spread over the course of the next two weeks, and also showed up on my left hand. Eventually, the one on my right hand looked like a blood blister. The rashes itched at first, and then started hurting to the touch. They were especially sensitive to sunlight. Now, as of 3/30, they seem to be clearing up.

I already imagined that the fever was starting. 3 hours later I got home and took my temperature, it was 101 F.   the fever lasted more than 15 hours. I didn?t  take any medication. I put cold cloths on my head, bathed and rested. the headache was very intense. So far I have discomfort from that but the fever has already stopped. The most striking thing was the allergic reaction that I began to have around midnight and it continued until today. they were hives all over the body. swelling and itching and redness. Finally after 24hs after vaccine I took an anti allergy called levocetirizine  cause itching won?t stop.

All other symptoms gone 4/8 - Inflammation of welt partially faded but red irritation spread out like it was dispersing.

Doctor diagnosed the welt as Cellulitis and immediately issued an antibiotic.

Breaking a bone hurts less. Actual COVID hurt less. This is agony.

She drank some water and sat down for a little bit and started to feel better.

The fever got worse overnight and I woke up repeatedly with a higher than normal heart rate and a severe migraine that lasted throughout the next day. I took Tylenol (two doses, 12 hours apart) to some relief.

By 7pm I had no energy, small cough, fever (unknown), chills, and headache. This lasted until 10 AM the next day. Headache lasted until 5 pm the next day.

Fever would not break until later that evening even when taking one Tylenol every four hours. Day two I couldn&#39;t tell if I was actually looking at myself in the mirror. I was dizzy and felt high. I could not remember simple tasks I just did like washing my face in the shower. I felt like I was hallucinating. I went to urgent care and they had no recommendations. I was to take the LSAT today, Saturday, April 9. I had to cancel it because I&#39;m still not fully coherent. I still feel dazed and out of it. I tried to go to work yesterday and old lasted an hour. I had a COVID test performed yesterday on my own accord, not per the request of urgent care, just in case I caught it prior to the vaccine without knowing, and it was negative. I can remember things now at least but I&#39;m still not mentally coherent. It&#39;s a scary feeling. I am about three and a half days post vaccine and slowly becoming myself again. I still feel dazed but I am able to have a conversation and remember it.

                                                I started shaking uncontrollably approximately 9 hours after injection. My teeth were chattering so badly they hurt. This maintained for 20 mins. I then had severe flu like symptoms overnight, including chills, and feeling hot and cold at the same time.  I woke up with a headache. I had muscle pains through the entire ordeal.  At 7am the next day, I took 600mg of ibuprofen and took a walk. I then felt fine.

                                                My daughter, although has cognitive issues, has not ever displayed any adverse behavior.  We first noticed some unusual behavior on March 31st 2021.  Three days later, on April 3rd, her behavior became more noticeable and unusual for her.  She was saying things that didn&#39;t make any sense and wasn&#39;t sleeping well or not at all.  On Sunday April 4th, her behavior intensified into delusions and hallucinations.  She was talking to people not there and making bizarre statements.  She was taken to emergency hospital late Sunday night and given a blood and urine test and sent home.  By Monday morning, she had not slept the entire night and was shouting out, trying to leave the house and her hallucinations and delusions had intensified.  We took her to Emergency room, where she was diagnosed with psychotic behavior and was admitted to the psychiatric ward.  She is expected to be released today, April 11th, 2021.

After I slept that night and about 7 hours the next day I finally started to feel better.

Then at 7pm of the evening after getting my vaccine, I began to feel weak, get chills, and run a low grade fever. At midnight, my fever had increased to 101 and I began taking Tylenol (recommended by Pharmacy). I had sever body aches, muscle fatigue, joint paint, chills and nausea through the night and the next day. In the morning, I had excruciating pain in my abdomen and began vomitting. Later that  day, my fever increased to 102.7 (with Tylenol) and I called my regular doctor. She told me to continue to monitor and if my fever did not decrease by 7pm to go the hospital. Finally, my fever decreased to 101, muscle aches, chills and joint pain continued. I began vomitting uncontrollably for a short period of time. I was very dizzy and weak the remainder of the day. Saturday, my fever finally broke (I sweated all day) but my body was still weak and sore. I also had dizzy spells on and off. Sunday, I felt much better but was still very tired compared to my normal self. I had abdomen pain and burning on and off. I also got hive on my hands Sunday afternoon. After Benadryl, the hives went away but I still felt itchy all over.  Today (Monday), I still don&#39;t feel like myself, but it is the best I have felt since receiving the vaccine. I have never experienced anything like this and was miserable Thursday night, Friday and some of Saturday. It truly was a terrible experience.

It?s unclear if shortness of breath was a direct result of the severity or the shaking or something else underlying the shakes. Walking or standing for any period of time was nearly impossible. I felt too warm and too cold at the same time and felt myself sweating but also shivering. My temperature was 99.6 (high for me - I?m usually low, around 96-97 on average) which persisted until around 5:30-6am the following morning. A severely painful, throbbing headache was present until well into the next evening. The symptoms of the headache did subside with use of OTC extra strength Tylenol (2 oral every 6 hours, taken twice totally 4 over the course of 24 hrs) but the headache was still felt somewhat even with use of Tylenol. Moderate fatigue was present all of 4/9 and until around mid morning of 4/10. Pain at the injection site was present but only noticed if laying on the affected arm (left) or if the site was accidentally touched. Dull aching at the site was felt on occasion until the following Monday, 4/12. All other symptoms had fully subsided by 4/10. As of today, 4/13, I am symptom free but I have noticed that I am taking deep breaths every once in a while (maybe several times an hour) as if I?m trying to catch my breath/I can?t catch a full satisfying breath. It feels somewhat like breathing through a straw for a few moments and I breath in until a full breath ?catchs?.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt bad enough to go to the Emergency Room, I did not go because I was hoping it would pass,  I felt 100 times worse than I did when I had Covid.  I had full body chills, I was shaking back and forth, my head was pounding so hard it felt like someone had a hammer to it, I got in a hot bath and it felt ice cold to me, I was throwing up, couldnt lay down because every part of my body that was touching something was in terrible pain.  Could not sleep.  The next day I had all of the same symptoms except I was sweating a lot along with everything else.  These symptoms lasted three full days.  It has now been exactly three week, I still have pain in my arm the shot was is, it hurts to raise it.  I also still have an incredibly awful headache that will not go away, I hadn&#39;t had a headache is years and years prior to this, I overall have not felt well ever since I got the shot and my reaction was incredibly awful.  Now I have concerns about my headache and body aches that still are not subsiding.

                                                Headache (turned into a migraine), extremely drained of energy, lack of appetite, and felt off all day (4/9/21). The next morning (4/10/21) felt the same as the day before, however, had several episodes where I would get really light headed, dizzy, and nauseous. Went to Home Depot at 2:15pm (4/10) and while there my vision blurred and started to fade, I had ringing in my ears and couldn?t hear out of the right and barely was able to hear out of the left. I got very nauseous and I couldn?t breath. I managed to sit on something and put my head between my legs that helped. Fortunately my step- dad was with me and helped me outside while I could barely see and hear and he stated I was very pale. I was having a hard time talking or being conherent. Once outside the symptoms slowly cleared over about the next 6-7 hours. At 4:45pm my mom decided to take me to the doctor but the walk in had just closed and I went to the ER. They stated I had elevated d-dime and did a chest CT scan  to check for blood clots around 7:30pm (I believe not sure exact time) doctor stated they came back clear but when asked if he suspected that the episode and symptoms were due to a dissipated blood clot he would not directly answer it. I overheard him dictating his notes and he started he beloved as such. I have never experienced anything like this before. I still felt drained, headache (migraine), occasionally dizzy, and lack of appetite (4/11/21, 4/12/21) and still currently feel the same drained, migraine, lack of appetite, and occasionally dizzy.

                                                It started slowly with feeling extra tired and light arm soreness. Then rapidly became extreme shivering, a fever, headache and full body muscle aches. In the early morning I also got stomachache cramps and felt hungry, but food didn?t help. It actually made me feel nauseous. By 6am the next day I had a serious migraine too - sensitivity to light. My eyes hurt. It actually was so bad I caved and took 2 liquid Advil?s to help with the pain. From there I slowly got better over the day but still had the above mentioned symptoms, just less intense. Around 8pm the fever came back and I called it a night.  Next morning I felt better, but still tired. Still had a headache but not a migraine. And occasional stomach aches. It?s now 2 days later and the head aches, arm soreness and occasional stomach aches have not gone away.

My left arm was tingling , this lasted the rest of the night. The next day i experienced numbness/tingling and dull aching pain in my elbow, down my arm to my palm and two fingers (middle and ring). This has been intermittent for a week now, really effecting me while i drive and work as a travel nurse.

                                                Got my vaccine on Monday in my right arm. On Thursday morning I had blurry spots in my eyes that lasted a couple of hours. It almost felt like i had something in my eyes. I kept rubbing and checking them. I called my primary care doctor and the office told me he would call me back. An hour later the blurs went away but the right side of my face down my neck had a numbing sensation. My right ear also felt like it need to be ?popped? like when on a plane that wouldn?t go away. Wasn?t completely numb but felt numb. When my doctor called me back i told him my symptoms and he told me to go to the emergency room. They ran blood work and did a CT and saw nothing abnormal beside my iron was a little low but I?m pregnant so that wasn?t surprising. I left not really knowing why I?m feeling this in my face. It still has that numbing feeling. And Friday i had a 10 minute nose bleed on my right side where I?m feeling the numbness.

                                                Headache that night of the shot (within an hour or two of the shot). That lasted until Thursday evening and going into Friday. I didn&#39;t wake up with it. I took 600 mg of Ibuprofen at bedtime on Wednesday. Didn&#39;t wake up with the headache Thursday. I started getting  body aches all over my body on Wednesday and they got worse until about 2:30 and I took a 15 min nap and woke up and felt a little better but I had them all the way to bedtime. And I was cold. That was until 1:00 PM on Wednesday. Wednesday night at 06:00 pm, on my left foot from arch to my toes I had a hot sensation. I thought one of my pets had pied on my foot - hot and wet feeling. But they didn&#39;t. That  has been happening frequently and intermittently and I am still experiencing them. The level of heat has decreased - it it warm and wet instead of hot and wet feeling. Happens frequently throughout the day. On Friday, I noticed, I had a rash on my left forearm. I noticed it on Friday evening and that went away on Thursday of last week after I was able to be hydrocortisone ointment on it for a few days. The rash was really itchy.

                                                My first side effects were fatigue and feeling ?out of it?, which started about 2 hours after the injection. At 7 hours after my left leg became numb and a little sore. I started to notice a feverish, tingly feeling on my skin and this would last at least 24 hours. These symptoms quickly spread through my whole lower body. The chills and intense body aches started at 11 pm. I woke up at 2 am that night and had a low grade fever 99.9 F. I took 2 pills of Tylenol. The fever broke around 3:30 or 4 am and I slept through the rest of the night. The next morning 3/09, I felt fatigue, slow, and woozy. I still had chills and muscle aches, although the intensity was less. Halfway through the day the chills intensified, the muscle aches became more severe, and my eyeballs felt like they were burning in the back of my head. By that evening, the fever was back and I couldn?t think straight. My legs ached with a pain that I?ve never felt before. I did not have a severe headache, but I felt that if I exerted myself too much I would get one. My partner said I could barely form coherent sentences, and I was so weak I couldn?t sit up straight. I took 2 more Tylenol that night, went to bed and slept through the whole night. The morning of 3/10 I woke up feeling tired but my skin did not have that feverish feeling. I was no longer sick. On 3/11 I woke up and did my normal morning routine. I ate an egg, some of a Nutella stuffed scone, and drank coffee and water. I took my 3 pills, loratadine, omeprazole, and a probiotic, and I had a severe allergic reaction within 5 minutes of taking the pills. For the next 10 minutes my breathing became labored and wheezy. I experienced severe eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms. For the next week, my EoE symptoms were heightened. I had a reaction after drinking a seltzer water, which does not usually affect me. Within 2 weeks I was back to normal and to my knowledge have not experienced any other related side effects.

                                                Upon getting the shot, it was extremely painful, so much so that I cried out in pain. I have gotten many shots in my adult life and have never done this. About a week after the vaccine, the normal shot soreness began to turn into extreme stiffness. I experienced weakness and loss of range of motion as well as pain in my left arm.

                                                Initial injection site felt a lot of pressure and at first there were mild symptoms of ringing in the ears and mind fogginess. Within 5 minutes after receiving injection I got up and walked less than 10 feet when I began experiencing extreme dizziness, ringing in the ears, lightheadedness, felt warm, and began to feel chills/tingling throughout my whole body but especially in my head.  I ended up passing out and was unable to sit up in a chair without assistance. For about 10 minutes I was profusely sweating all over my entire body, had continued chills/tingling, difficulty breathing and was semi coherent. The nurse at the pharmacy had me sniff ammonia salt and gave me water to help. I waited for 20 more minutes before finally feeling able to get up and walk around the store. Body chills and cold sweats continued for a while but no further symptoms at this time (2hrs after vaccination).

                                                After receiving the COVID19 vaccine on Friday, March 19th at 12:30pm, I started feeling the normal side effects around 5pm. I had a low grade fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea and low energy through Saturday night around 7pm. When I woke up on Sunday morning, those side effects I no longer felt but instead I had pain in my vagina. All day, I assumed it was a yeast infection and would go to the store Monday to pick up Monistat. Monday morning, the pain had gotten worse.  My labia was very swollen and irritated and hurt when I urinated. At that point, I decided to look and found 10-15 lesions on my labia (both right and left side). I immediately called my primary care physican&#39;s office to make a same day appointment. My primary doctor was unavailable so I saw another doctor instead. She swabbed several of the lesions as she seemed to think that it was a herpes outbreak (which would have been my first). She wrote me a prescpription for Valacyclovir (10 days) and submitted my vaginal swab for HSV 1 and HSV 2 testing. Two days later I received negative test results for HSV 1 and HSV 2. I asked her for further testing as I was still in pain. I went back in for blood work: Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, CBC with Differential, Epstein Barr Virus AB Panel, Herpes Simplex Birus Antibody IGM, Herpes Simplex I/II IGG. All came back normal. I didn&#39;t have any old or new Herpes antibodies. This lead both her and my gynocologist to question whether or not this was a side effect of the vaccine.

                                                Patient was very nervous about getting any shots and we discussed ways to help with her anxiety as well as side effects.  The patient immediately complained of feeling dizzy within seconds of completing the vaccination.  She slumped in her chair and was nonresponsive to me for about 45 seconds.  Color was very ashen. We treated patient by leaning her in the triangle position and she continued to talk to me at that point.  At 10 minutes patient felt fine and was drinking water.  She was observed for about 45 minutes total and felt fine when she left the pharmacy.  She kept stating she hates shots and was really worked up about getting the vaccine.

My muscles hurt and a body felt very fatigued. Also, a little bit nauseous. I think my fever got to 100 degrees. By noon, I broke my fever. By three pm I was fine again.  The following days, I had soreness at injection site. I had a couple of headaches. There was one  episode where two weeks later, I did get a panic attack and went to urgent care. I went because it lasted longer than normal. This panic attack lasted for 30 minutes that is why I went to Urgent Care. Usually my panic attacks last for 3 minutes - but I also had personal things going on that could have caused it. No treatment, they just said to relax.

Tuesday night, high fever,  chills &amp; sweating, arm has a huge swollen lump at injection site, body aches (legs) and a headache. Took 500mg Naproxen and went to sleep. Woke up next day with all symptoms gone except the swollen, painful lump in my arm at the injection site, which I still have as of today, June 10th.  It&#39;s not getting any smaller. If the lump and pain doesn&#39;t go away by Monday, I will be visiting my doctor again.

                                                4/8: Immediate injection site numbness and dizziness. As day wore on, I felt fatigued and later developed a fever ranging around 100.5°F. Throughout the night, I had body chills, muscle and joint pain as well as skin sensitivity. 4/9: Fever ranged from 100.5°F to 101.1°F. Dizziness, fatigue, headache, chills, muscle and joint pain, skin sensitivity and nausea. 4/10: Fever ranged from 99.8°F to 100°F. Dizziness, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain with mild nausea. 4/11: Fever ended. Mild dizziness, fatigue, muscle and joint pain. Around mid-day, both arms went numb with tingling/prickling pain from shoulders to fingertips. Could not open and close hands well. Could not hold, grasp, text or type/weakness in hands. Pain: 7-8/10. 4/12: Severe numbness. Noticing pain radiating from behind both elbows and going up to the shoulders as well as down to fingertips. Weakness in hands. 4/13: Went to school clinic and referred to ER for testing. Was given ibuprofen and told to take OTC painkillers. 4/19: Issues with insurance/unable to schedule follow-up with neurology in home town due to insurance based in nearby city but I am unable to drive and school is still in session. Telehealth call with PCP to go over options. Left arm is slightly improving but still going numb/tingly/prickly occasionally with pain radiating from behind elbow. Pain: 5-6/10. No improvement in right arm with pain and numbness being constant. Noticing slight pain behind left knee. Pain: 3/10. Purchased hand brace and arm sling for right arm. Taking Advil but noticing little to no relief. Use of warm and cold compresses as well as massage instead to help alleviate pain. 4/29: Attempted performing everyday tasks and school assignments for ceramics. Exasperated both arms. Severe numbness and tingly/prickly pain. Pain: 8-9/10. Left knee pain has not dissipated/becoming more and more noticeable.  Pain: 3-4/10. 5/4: Intense pain decreased back to usual pain levels. Noticed swelling behind left knee and pain going down to calf muscle. 5/6: Appt w/ school clinic again. Referred to ortho doctor on 5/13 and prescribed Celecoxib 200 mg. 5/12: Appt w/ school clinic. Saw ortho doc. Diagnosed with potential Baker&#39;s Cyst. Sent to ER to double check for blood clots. There was none. Diagnosis is potential Baker&#39;s Cyst or Meniscus Tears. Was prescribed Diclofenac Sodium 1% Gel and told to wrap knee. 5/13: MRI of full cervical spine with and without contrast done at Radiology at another city. 5/26: Left arm is almost completely recovered. Pain: 2/10. Still slight pain behind left elbow. If overused, however, more pain and numbness. Right arm is constantly in pain but it is not as severe as previous month. Pain is 6/10 and runs from shoulder to fingertips but more prevalent around shoulders to behind left elbow and wrist. Shoulder pain feels like burning pain instead of usual tingly/prickly pain like the rest of the arm. Left knee gives out randomly and I feel pain from behind knee to calf whenever standing for long periods of time or walking for more than 20-30 minutes. Pain 2-3/10. 6/1: Telehealth appointment with PCP to go over test results. Referred for neuro consult. Was prescribed medication for neuropathy but currently meds are with mother in a city. Unable to drive from city to city to pick it up. 6/8: Telehealth appointment with neuro consult. Waiting on referral for nerve conduction study. Pain has not changed for right arm or behind left knee. Decreased walking due to more frequent moments of knee giving out.  Overall, due to constant arm pain in dominant arm (right arm),  I am unable to do most activities without assistance such as cooking, cleaning or driving. Right arm/shoulder get exhausted fairly quickly or nerves become inflamed when attempting to use it more. Shoulder feels like it&#39;s burning slightly. Sometimes hand/arm will shake and feel a spike of pain when overused. Must do things more with left arm and can not walk far without falling down randomly due to left knee giving out.

                                                Headache for first 24 hours and feeling achy. I felt sluggish around 8:00PM. My mom woke me up in the morning because I was burning up and I took a Tylenol. When I woke up, I had a massive headache and feeling achy all over. Had the headache for about 24 hours and feeling achy.  I did go to work later that day, still, I was just a bit sluggish, brain-foggish and achy. I had the brain fog for a few days. I have been having a headache most days - not every day though. Right now she has me taking some magnesium and some Riboflavin to see if that will help. I hydrate quite a bit. June 8th, Rash on my neck - itchy and burning sensation. I applied Cortisone but it wouldn&#39;t go away. On the 11th, I called doctor because it was getting bigger and going across my neck. She told me to stop taking that and she prescribed for me some  Clotrimazole  but I stopped taking it - it seemed to make the rash worse and one day my throat was closing  up and I went to the ER and I took Benadryl before I went in. By time that I got there to see the doctor, it wasn&#39;t so bad. Diagnosed at ER with Contact dermatitis - is diagnosis - and they prescribed a medicine for it - Prednisone and to continue taking Benadryl until the rash disappeared/healed. After about 3 days of that, it seemed to be going away. Right now, it&#39;s healed but there&#39;s still marks from it. There is still a small patch of the rash that is on my neck (where it originated)  there and my doctor said to leave it alone for right now. Recently, I have been experiencing some leg pain on my left leg. It&#39;s been hurting lately. Doctor has prescribed an ultrasound to look at my calf and my foot.

By morning the symptoms were gone except a felt very week and still had a mild headache. The headache got bad again by 10:00AM. And grew worse and worse until it was excruciating. I took 800mg of Advil, a muscle relaxant, and 2 hours later a Norco. Nothing reduced the pain. I stayed up and cried all night. I asked a relative to take me to the ER, but they were unwilling. In the early hours of the morning, it started to reduce. The next day I was weak, and I had a mild headache for the next 2 days.

                                                Began having chills, fever spiked up to 100.7, muscle aches and pain, headache, night sweats. These symptoms lasted approximately 36 hours. Felt lethargic and fatigue for approximately 48 hours after the vaccine. Also had some menstrual bleeding which was brief on 3/5/21, which was the date of the vaccine, and this was not expected. Alternated Tylenol and Ibuprofen after vaccine to help lower fever, and drank fluids.

                                                Received the covid19 vaccine at 11am. Started feeling very cold around 2pm (nail beds were turning purple). By 4pm I had a headache, body aches, upset stomach, tired, fever, and chills. My fever would go up and down, highest was 103.2 reached that temp 3 times. By 2am my mother drove me to the ER. I was diagnosed with a migraine and was given IV fluids and an IV migraine cocktail. After receiving the fluids and meds I felt much better and was released back home. I periodically have pain in the injection site.

Around 8:15pm, I started to develop chills. From there, I developed a fever, headache, neck soreness and body aches in my joints (particularly wrists, knees, elbows). I contained the fever with extra strength Tylenol taken according to the box instructions. The fever broke overnight.  I had a 99 degree temperature the next day (3:00 pm) after the vaccine, and experienced fatigue and body aches. Those symptoms largely subsided by the morning of 3/21.   I still (as of the PM on 3/22) have no appetite and a persistent feeling of &#34;fullness&#34; in my stomach.

I pulled down my visor and used the mirror to look at my face and chest area and noticed red splotches all over. The rash quickly moved to cover my whole body within minutes of receiving the vaccine. Ochsner had me pull over by the EMT tent and I waited 45 additional minutes to see if I had any other effects. The rash didn&#39;t go away but I didn&#39;t itch and I wasn&#39;t uncomfortable. It was just a surface rash. The rash was completely gone by 10PM that same night. I woke up at 2AM that same night/early the next morning and the whole left side of my body was numb and felt very heavy. I also had a very mild fever and cold like symptoms. These symptoms included chills, dizziness, fatigue, and headaches. All of my symptoms, including the pain and heaviness on my left side, were gone the following morning which was about 36 hours after first receiving the vaccine.

A few minutes later she fainted and fell out of the chair onto the floor. We helped her up to a sitting position and gave her a bottle of water and an ice pack.  The right side of her forehead appeared red from apparent hit on the floor when she fainted.  We had her wait on the floor for about 30 minutes to ensure she remained conscious.  Patient reported an ache on her forehead at site of hit.  She was also sweating and reported feeling hot. Patient had a partner with her who agreed to escort her to an urgent care clinic in the same building as the pharmacy. Store manager in charge took the patient to the urgent care clinic by wheelchair to be examined.

I went to a dark room and about 30 minutes later it stopped where a wasn&#39;t seeing a flashing line.  I took melatonin and went to bed figuring I was starting to get tired.  I woke up at 638am. Arm super sore, a red spot over the size of a quarter at injection site. Low grade 99.1 and my entire body hurts and a small headache. Called in to work to rest for the day.

Restlessness and chills continued throughout the night. At 1:30am I finally took OTC flu/cold liquid medicine. (NyQuil) and then continued DayQuil and NyQuil for the next 48 hours.  Fever began and continued until end of day the following day. Although not as serve once fever reducer was being taken. (24 hours) Body aches that night and continuing into the next day. (24 hours) Headache began the next day and continued for almost 48 hours post injection.  Fatigue that night and continued for two days post injection (48 hours) All around would categorize day one after the inject as &#34;flu-like&#34; although this was a bit worse than when I&#39;ve had the flu. Day 2 post injection was more &#34;cold-like&#34; but higher fatigue than I&#39;m used to.  I normally never get headaches, and I had a dull headache for the two days post injection.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 vaccine EUA;  I received the one shot dose around 1pm on 04/01/2021. Through the evening starting around 7pm typical drowsiness started to occur along with body stiffness and soreness throughout the shoulders and lower back. Around 11pm I was awoken with shooting pains throughout the entire body; toes to head. At this same time I was experiencing full body chills, unable to get warm, headache, and a fever of 101.2. After about an hour of pain and three Tylenol quick release tablets, the fever broke. The full body  pains and lethargy lasted around 30 hours in total.

Around 6 pm the night of my shot on April 1 I started with a headache, that progressed into a migraine, chills, fever. Tylenol was not helping. The next morning I called my doctor because the tylenol was not helping and they prescribed fioricet to bring my fever down and take the migraine away. Migraine went away later that night April 2, 2021 but felt weak that night into the next day.

                                                Arm hurt very badly immediately during and after vaccine in similar sensation to ulnar nerve being struck in arm, bled only a little but caused swelling and then a large bruise developed over the evening of 4/4/2021 and is still dark today (4/7/2021). Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

                                                30 year old femail received Janssen vaccine Lot# 1808982 exp: 6/23/21 at approximately 3pm in the left deltoid.  Immediately after being vaccinated, pt. requested to remain seated.  The nurse noted that the pt. was getting pale so she suggested the pt. take off the surgical mask to get some air.  Before pt. had a chance to take off the mask she lost consciousness.  Together with another nurse patient was lowered onto the floor.  Pt. regained consciousness for 30-45 seconds and then began to have seizure like activity.  Her eyes rolled back and her body became stiff and began a jerking motion.  911 was called. This seizure like activity lasted 4-6 seconds at which time pt. regained consciousness and immediately sat up.  Pt was pale and diaphoretic.  BP 98/64, HR 78, Pulse Ox 99%.  Pt vomited multiple times.  Ice was applied to the posterior neck and a cold compress to the forehead .  EMS arrived and took vitals: BP 78/40.  Pt. was aware of person, place and situation.  Pt. was taken to Hospital accompanied by her husband.  Pt was called by me Friday and she was home.  All tests showed no sign of having a seizure.

I also had a high fever which was 104.8 degrees Fahrenheit. I also threw up twice and had body aches in my arm where the nurse injected the vaccine, my lower back, and calves of my legs. When my temperature did not go down, I went to Emergency Room at around 12:00 a.m. April 10, 2021. I was placed in isolation. The nurse took my vitals and the doctor ordered covid test for me and a urine analysis. The covid test came back negative and my urine analysis was in the normal range. The nurse gave me Tynenol at  around 1 am and ibuprofen at around 2:30 am. I was discharged at approximately 5 am on April 10, 2021 with a 98.4 degree temperature.

                                                30 minutes after shot, I was dizzy and headache. Starting at midnight until 9am my heart was racing between 114-124 bpm all night long while laying still in bed.  Normal sleeping heart rate is low 60&#39;s.  Chest pain and racing was obvious.  Extreme headache, pain in legs, etc. lasted for 2 days.  Fever hit 100.5

Woke up with severe chills / teeth chattering / uncontrollable shivering, my husband said my body was warm but I felt chilled to the bone.  Finally got warm enough to fall asleep around 2am.  The next day, more chills, headache, fatigue, and general malaise all day.  Started feeling better on the third day.  Today, tightness in right side of chest--not sure if related, will be calling the doctor.

                                                Two days after Johnson &amp; Johnson, my body launched into an involuntary fit of twisting and flailing movement at bedtime that I now think to be dystonia(?). I sweated terribly. It lasted an hour and a half of screaming and crying. Ehlers Danlos makes my joints and muscles very sensitive to being popped and torn, so it was very painful and remains painful, and now I&#39;m noticing unusual pockets of abnormal memory loss and confusion. Today I ran a red light. I have records of phone calls I don&#39;t remember making, evidence of chores around the house that I did not do. Very odd.

                                                When I got the shot, moderately severe pain immediately radiated down my arm and into my last two fingers on my left arm as well as up into my shoulder blade area. It was a lot more painful than I expected based on previous shots. I went to bed with only arm pain and a small headache. Around 11pm that night I woke up in severe pain that was much worse than my chronic pain. I have prescription narcotic pain medication and that did not help. I was unable to leave bed and called my doctor at his home around 7am. I had a very bad headache (and I am used to headaches) and all of the areas of my body that normally hurt hurt much worse. My fingertips started tingling. I was miserable and in bed for about 3 days before starting to feel better, at which point I noticed that my arms and hands were off. The last two fingers on my left hand lost grip strength for about a week. The muscles In my arms kept getting weak. My fingers and the palms of my hands continue to tingling uncomfortably but the weakness is improving.

                                                Around 5:30 pm in the evening following my vaccine I started having chills, headache, nausea, and fever of 101. Chills got worse, whole body was shaking and shivering. Nausea progressed into constant dry heaving. Head was pounding with the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, worse than natural child birth and worse than running marathons. The nausea was so bad and I could feel my fever burning and getting worse. I was about to vomit so got out of bed to go to the toilet to vomit and the whole room started spinning completely out of control. My heart was racing and I could hear it and feel it pounding rapidly through my ears. I couldn?t walk and was so disoriented I crawled to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. My husband heard me and came and picked me up off the bathroom floor and carried me to our bed. As the night progressed fever got worse, head was in almost unbearable pain, severe body aches over my whole body, heart racing and horrible nausea and dry heaving.  I made it through the night. For two days after I had a headache and fever  and nausea and body aches and couldn?t get out of bed to care for my children. By the third and fourth day I was able to get out of bed at times and still felt fatigue, nausea, headache and body aches. Anytime I would stand up for 10 days after the vaccine it felt like I was rocking on a boat. I am almost at 2 weeks and still feel fatigue and dizziness at times. On April 15th, 9 days after my vaccination I had symptoms of a blood clot in my leg. I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a superficial blood clot of the leg as well as swelling in the vein. I am thankful to be alive!

                                                Almost immediately after the vaccine at the injection site I  got a real bad hot sensation.  For about 2 days it was swollen and had localized pain for about 9 days.  I was very fatigued.   And I developed a severe headache the next day that was so bad I could barely stand it.  4/11 I  went to the Primary Care and saw a  dr who took bloodwork and prescribed some iron because she said I was anemic.  But for about the first 3 days after the vaccine the headache pain intensity level was at a 10, then it lowered on its on to about a level 3 but was still there for about 3 more days and after about day 6 the headache intensity returned to a level 10 and on day 8 I went back to the dr because nothing would relieve the pain and the pain was so intense I couldnt bare it.  I had an MRI on 4/21 which came back normal with sinus pressure present and finally about 4/23 the headaches finally subsided.   I also notice  the next 2 menustral cycles  after I had severe cramping and my breast got really tender and sore and I bled longer than usual which is abnormal for me and I also noticed I had developed a cyst in my right breast and had a mammogram performed which did show that I had a large cyst in my breast

Continued monitoring her and rash receded. Patient said she felt better. I offered further medical attention. Patient declined. I instructed patient to hydrate and minimize activity for the rest of the day if rash returns take a benadryl. Seek medical attention in the event of any tightness in chest or throat. patient remained in store over 45 minutes and stated she felt fine and departed

                                                I received my vaccine at 11:30 AM and had a 102 degree fever by 6 PM. I began to shake very hard and had significant chest pain in my left side by my heart. The shaking and fever subsided by that Sunday night. However, it is now 6/1/21, and I had to go to the doctor today for my chest pain. While the ECG came back clear, the doctor determined that I have Costochondritis. As this is nothing I ever encountered before, I know that is was caused from the COVID vaccine inflammation response during my fever. This is when it was first noticed. It also causes back pain since it is between the breast bone and rib cage.

Then respiratory symptoms (cough runny nose, sore throat) for 14 days (this is possibly from child&#39;s daycare). During this te, Intervals of hot and cold sweats for 2 weeks follow vaccination. On day 14, extreme fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea every 30 min for 12 hours.  Nausea and diarrhea continues  through day 17.  Day 18, another vomiting episode. Swollen painful lymph nodes armpit on side of injection. Heightened anxiety since vaccination (potentially from my fear of vomiting). Today is day 18.

Since day three I started experiencing an increase in my arterial tension; the usual values are between 110/70 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg, currently it has been above 130/85 mmHg up to 145/95 mmHg.  Along with my increased TA I&#39;ve been experiencing headache whenever the values go up.

                                                After receiving my vaccine, I began to feel fatigue and significant brain fog. I could not drive. My husband drove home. I had a headache. By 1:00PM in the afternoon, I had aching joints and a low fever, by 3:00PM, my fever was 100 degrees and my movement was impaired with global joint pain. I managed with some ibuprofen and had to still take care of my family. By 9:00PM, my fever was 102 degrees and I could not move. Every joint in my body was burning, inflamed and aching. I could feel ever vertebrae in my spine. The headache was significant and if I moved the pain would increase. I called the hotline to try and reach my GP, it was the weekend. The nurse that answered did not know what to do with my position. My neurologist called me around 10:30PM and he didn&#39;t think I was in any danger, but seemed a bit helpless to know what to do for me. He encouraged me to continue using ibuprofen and wait it out. I was trying to go to the ER, and the only ER that can handle my health condition is very far away. Plus I didn&#39;t have child care. I ended up not going to the ER, but I&#39;ve learned that I should have gone. I managed with Tylenol, as much as I could, and it took about 16 days for the joint pain and aching to subside. I had a series of tests already scheduled that showed on a deeper lever the reaction that I had. I had to see my neurologist and my rheumatologist. My arthritis had returned after being in remission for at least 6 months. Prior to the vaccine, I had energy, no brain fog, no joint pain and no mast cell reaction. I used to be able to walk 2 miles per day and since the vaccine, I have not been able to do that nor have I been getting better. I had not had headaches before, but now I have them every day, in spite of medication. I cannot exercise or even do basic chores anymore. I am constantly thirsty. My blood work showed dehydration, regardless the amount of fluid intake. POTS went crazy. My blood work with rheumatology came back with a positive ANA and BSNA (double stranded DNA). I had to start taking hydroxychloroquine and get regular IVF infusions. I think that in the grand scheme of things, I have been getting back to stability, in just this last week. I have more tests coming up to see if the inflammation has come down. I won&#39;t know until my blood work comes back if I&#39;ve gone into remission or if I&#39;ve developed a new condition.

Almost immediately after receiving the vaccination, the patient started looking flushed, and woozy. About a minute after receiving the vaccine she fainted while sitting in the chair, her spouse and myself stabilized her to make sure she didn&#39;t fall. She was drifting in and out of consciousness for about a minute. When she came out of it she seemed confused as to where she was.  She spit up a little bile in our trash can. after a few minutes she stated she was ok so we got her up and to the floor with her feet raised, an ice pack on her neck, some water, and some gummy bears. She rested for about 20 minutes on the floor. She eventually felt good enough to get up so we helped her up and made sure she wasnt feeling dizzy and was feeling ok. She walked to our observation area on her own and waited another 15 minutes and she was doing good so she left the pharmacy.

                                                Mild headache and nausea set in shortly after the injection on Friday, but went away after rest and eating/drinking. My arm was sore for the entire evening. I woke up around 2am Saturday morning and became dizzy. I fell to the floor and passed out for a short period of time. When I woke, I was extremely nauseous to the point of nearly vomiting. I had chills and fever. I could hardly move due to weakness - I needed help getting back into bed. When I woke the next morning, I had 100.3 fever, I had a headache and my entire body was sore. My fever went away late Saturday afternoon, but I still felt mildly nauseous. It is Monday and I still have mild nausea and light-headedness. My arm is only slightly sore.

I woke up at 12:25a.m (Sunday March 7th, 2021) with a fever of 104.3 and was experiencing extreme neck and head pain. My hands hurt as if I had arthritis and couldn&#39;t make them feel better. I was very short of breath and dry coughing. I took Tylenol and tried to lay back down and was able to go back to sleep around 3:00a.m. I got up at 6:10am and my temp was 101.6. I took Ibuprofen at this point and by 9:30am my temp was 99.8. I was still experiencing a very bad headache and my neck and back were achy. I felt a lot better by about 11:00am, took a hot shower and laid down for a nap around 2:00pm Sunday. When I woke up around 3:15p.m I had spiked yet another fever of 102.0 and was having bad body aches again in my neck and head area and it continued to get worse though my back over the next hour. I was experiencing a dry cough again also but this time it was more constant. It took over 3 hours for my fever to go below 100.0 with alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen. It finally broke around 7:00p.m. I had a lot of pain in my neck and head the rest of the night. I woke up Monday March 8th, 2021 with a moderate headache but it went away throughout the day. No fever returned Monday. The only time I experienced coughing and shortness of breath was while I had the fever.

                                                I am currently pregnant. This is my first pregnancy.  My due date is August 29, 2021.  My pregnancy has thus far been really easy with no complications.  I had a low grade fever that I took Tylenol to treat.  I had pretty bad muscle and joint pain, chills, and could not stop shaking.  I just felt freezing.  Once my fever broke I felt extremely hot all night.  The next morning I was exhausted and had a lot of the muscle and joint pain still.  I marked on my report that it would&#39;ve stopped me from going about my normal daily activities, as I could not have gone to work and spent most of the day resting.  For the next few days I was tired and my eyes ached.  On Monday and Tuesday I had a headache in the afternoon.  Yesterday afternoon my eyes finally stopped aching and everything seems to be back to normal.

Could only sleep short spurts after taking 400 mg of Ibuprofen. 24 hours after the vaccination, my body is still achey, sore at injection site, and uneasy stomach.

I took Aleve and it eventually helped, but this morning my legs are still feeling weak down to my bones. I am afraid I have nerve damage.

Then later around 10:00am a feeling of tiredness came over my whole body.  Around 12:00pm I felt even more tired, lightheaded  and my eyeballs felt as if with high pressure in them and are feel sensitive to the sunlight.  Also, at 12pm, I had lunch, which was my first meal of this day and felt the necessity to lay in bed and take a nap for 20 minutes before returning to work.  While taking the nap I felt tingling on my feet, arms, hands and neck along with certain sudden muscle contractions on the same parts.

Additional symptoms: chills and headache. Chills were mild. Headache felt like an 8/10, pain irradiated throughout my entire head. I took a total of 1500mg of acetaminophen and tried to go back to sleep. I awoke at around 11:30 am, and I have had a mild headache since then; I have not taken any more medication. I have been drinking water and eating soup. Chills have been random and sporadic throughout the day. I tried to log into the v-safe app, but it would not let me submit today&#39;s report. I will try again, and if I have any other symptoms and can&#39;t submit them through the app, then I will report them here. Thank you everyone for your hard work!

                                                About 6 hours after vaccination on 3/8, flu-like symptoms: chills, weakness, fatigue, headache. That lasted into the following ~1.5 days and was relieved with Tylenol and bed rest. Mild nausea on 3/9-3/10. The most concerning possible adverse event started on the evening of 3/12. I noticed my achilles area was itchy after taking a shower that night. I woke up the following morning on 3/13 VERY itchy on my left arm and ankles. I started to break out in hives on my lower legs and bilateral arms into the afternoon. I took Benadryl as directed on the package to try and relieve the hives. In the evening on 3/13 I tried taking a lukewarm bath with 1/2 cup of baking soda and epsom salt. After soaking for about 30 minutes, the hives had worsened and about 65% of my body was covered in hives. I called my primary care&#39;s emergency line that night and was prescribed 40mg Pepcid x 7 days and a Methylprednisolone pack to take in addition to the Benadryl. I took the 40mg Pepcid along with Benadryl and was able to relieve most of the hives. I did not take the methylprednisolone at all. I did wake up in the middle of the night with a scratchy throat and took another Benadryl to relieve that. The following morning on 3/14 I woke up and had some hives on my hands that disappeared that early afternoon without having to take Benadryl. In the evening on 3/14 at around 6pm the hives started to reappear on bilateral arms as well as legs. I took the 40mg Pepcid as well as Benadryl and the hives did not completely disappear before bed. The following morning on 3/15 it appears that the hives had disappeared. They did not reappear the following evening but I still took the 40mg Pepcid the evening of 3/15. Today is 3/16 and I have continued to be hive-free. One other detail to note, on 3/15 at around 4 in the afternoon I took an old supplement - Cranberry with Vitamin C. So I am not sure if this reaction was related to the expired supplement, the vaccine, or both.

On March 11 I broke out in hives on both arms, both thighs, neck/clavicle, and lower right leg this started around 8am. After work I went to Pharmacy to their consultation window (2:15) and they recommended benadryl and to call my PCP. I took my first dose at 2:30pm and followed up with a second one around 9pm. I called and  spoke with my PCP over the phone, she had me take benadryl at night for the next 3 days and claritin in the morning for the next 3 days.  The hives and redness were gone by the morning of the  12th. My skin was still sensitive throughout the 12th but was back to normal by the time I went to bed on the 12 (10pm ish)

Patient had numbness on left arm, limited mobility, and redness at site of injection. Vaccine given by nurse. She initially couldn&#39;t move her arm after the injection. We called 911 afterwards, and stayed with patient. We gave water/Benadryl and stayed with the patient until they arrived. They checked on her vitals. BP 104/60, pulse 72. No SOB, or tightness in chest, no other areas of redness, and patient had more mobility after given Benadryl. EMS said she was fine to leave, and to follow up with PCP. No history of allergic reaction to vaccine.

                                                I received the vaccine at 36 weeks pregnant. I am estimated to deliver April 16th.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I noticed general bodily discomfort and achiness, as well as a loss of appetite and a headache. About 30 minutes after that I developed chills but no fever, and was fatigued enough to fall asleep an hour before my usual bedtime. I slept terribly in the night due to the achiness and pain at the injection site making it hard to lay on my side, which I have to do for pregnancy. I went to bed with chills but woke up sweating and discovered a fever of 100.2 around 12:45 AM. By 5:30 my temperature was down to 98. The following morning I continue to experience achiness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and a headache. I seem to have felt some pelvic cramping associated with pregnancy but it may be unrelated.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

                                                I received the Janssen (J&amp;J) vaccine at 11:12pm on 3/5/2021. I went to bed with a slightly sore arm. I woke up the following day 3/6/2021 with a slight headache and feeling a little achy. At around 11:00-12:00pm on 3/6/2021 I started having a fever, chills, aches, an increasingly bad headache. For the next 18 hours I had a fever, shaking, aches, bad migraine headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. I felt increasingly sick and my lowest point was at around 9:00pm on 3/6/2021 when I vomited. Around 5:00-6:00am on 3/7/2021 I felt considerably better and no longer had a fever. I was exhausted and still had a headache. I was very fatigued for the next two weeks.   I was menstruating when I received the vaccine. My menstruation stopped when I was having side effects for about 2-3 days and then started again.  In addition, I have psoriasis and on 3/7/2021 my skin looked noticeably better than it had looked before I received the vaccine. The psoriasis I had on my hands almost completely disappeared. A few days later, my psoriasis looked worse than I had looked before I received the vaccine. Today 3/29/2021, my psoriasis is back to how it looked right before I received the vaccination.

Had a sore arm for a couple hours right after vaccination which did go away and didn&#39;t return. Around 3:15 pm the same day, I started to feel rundown - fatigued and slight elevated temperature. Around 2 hours later, I started feeling feverish and my temperature was around 99 degrees F. I took a tylenol which helped bring my temperature down temporarily, but around 9 pm it was a lot worse and I was feeling chills as well. I took my temperature and it was 102 degrees F. I took more tylenol and this helped bring my temperature down again. I went to bed and started feeling chills again around 3 am so I took another tylenol and when I woke up again around 8 am, I did not feel feverish anymore, but had a headache and still felt rundown and fatigued. On 4/2 (day after vaccine), I started feeling better as the day went on and fever did not return.

                                                I felt the vaccination spreading through my body as I got really heavy and lost consciousness. I woke up to my husband holding my head and yelling my name. I had been seizing and had bitten my tongue. I was very white and nauseous and cold and shaky. They gave me water and a cold pack. The seizure probably only lasted for 5 seconds but it&#39;s hard to say. I felt very fatigued afterwards. I stayed for 10 more min and drank water and then they sent me on my way.

I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

                                                I began feeling lightheaded about 5 minutes after receiving the injection. The feeling continued to get stronger and I began sweating and feeling nauseous. I felt like I was going to throw up and/ or pass out. I was about to go get someone and let them know, but then it started easing back off again. It came and went all within about five minutes. I hung around the site a little longer than instructed to be safe, but felt fine and left. Two hours later, I&#39;ve had no other symptoms besides soreness in my arm and a slight headache.

                                                Within about 30 mins of the shot I became extremely lethargic. Hard to keep my eyes open. The injection site was extremely hot to touch and very sore. While the rest of my body was of normal temperature. Shortly after, I?d say about 45 minutes after injection, came the cold chills. I was freezing cold and shaking  fallowed by a fever. I became very foggy. It was hard to keep a conversation and had extreme waves of nausea. My mouth would salivate like the vomit was coming. I never actually vomited. But that continued  for the next 36 hours. I had to call out of work yesterday. Starting 24hrs after injection. I could not get out of bed. My body was very weak. Aches everywhere, I was freezing cold shaking with chills yet waking up in my bed covered in sweat. I was extremely restless and kept waking up to put a cold towel on my head to try to break my fever. At this point my headache was so severe. Any movement felt like my head would explode.  It?s now 48 hours after the injection my head is still pounding and my body still full of aches. Left arm is still really sore. I truly regret taking the vaccine. And would recommend others to not take it until further testing goes into this product.

                                                Re: Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Received vaccine at about 10:21am. Developed possible adverse effects at about 4:00pm. Initially I noticed weakness and feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. I was grocery-shopping at the time, and pushing the cart, standing upright, etc. was becoming difficult. Sometime between 4:00pm and 5:00pm I became delirious and also was no longer able to stand or sit upright. In my altered state I believed that my muscles, especially those in my legs, were turning into goo and then turning into normal muscles again. I experienced fever dreams. I had hot flashes and chills. I had the worst pain that I have experienced in recent memory.  I think that I may have had a migraine episode in addition to, and triggered by, these experiences. I had nausea (no vomiting).  Most of these events lasted until about between 12:30am to 1:00am, which was when I fell asleep. When I woke up the following morning (today as I am reporting), I still had a mild headache and exhaustion but the other events had resolved.

                                                Within about 12 hours of getting the vaccine, I started having chills, fever and severe body aches. I took extra strength Tylonol and those symptoms subsided within about 48 hours. The symptom that worries me is the tingling in both my arms that seems to get worse when I lay down. Each night since I received the vaccine, my arms have gone completely numb in the middle of the night. Once I move them repeatedly for about 5-10 min, the numbness goes away. Before the numbness starts, my arms usually begin to tingle.

Then a couple of minutes later we could not distinguish what kind of reaction was occurring and had another patient call 9-1-1. The patient jerked at that moment, but the paramedics arrived within 8 minutes and checked her out, she is fine. It turned out that she has a history of fainting when needles are administered with blood draws or vaccines. She drank some juice and recovered without incident. The paramedics released her home and no other concerns arose.

I called over a doctor and explained what was happening. He got a wheelchair and brought me to a room to lie down. During this time, my vision continued to get worse (seeing more spots and less peripheral vision).  Upon laying down, the doctor put my feet up and a nurse took my blood pressure. If I remember correctly, it was 90/58. My normal blood pressure is around 112/68. A nurse also put ice under my neck. Immediately upon laying down, I started feeling better. I was observed for a while more and then a nurse took my blood pressure again (both laying down and sitting up). My limbs still felt weak when seated and my blood pressure was better but not normal yet, so I was told to lay down a bit longer. Then, a nurse checked my blood pressure again (laying down, sitting up and standing up). It was back to normal and I was feeling better. I was cleared to leave the vaccine clinic. Since leaving the clinic, I haven&#39;t had any abnormal side effects or reactions.

                                                The following day after my vaccination, I had a severe headache all over the top of my head and eventually only the left side of my head and face felt intense pain. It felt kind of like a stabbing or shooting pain down into my head. Then I started feeling a lot if pressure and pain in my left eye, eye brow, and the sinus area. I could hardly open my eyes. My left side of my face also tingled with tiny sharp pains or numbness. This pain intensified for about 5 days so I started taking aspirin. It would feel slightly better but then would feel even worse.  I decided to use a netti pot to remove pressure. After about 5 days of using that I started to feel better. I would say I started to feel back to normal two weeks after the shot.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I began by feeling stiffness and soreness in my joints and muscles, particularly my back and lower body.  The pain and stiffness worsened, and I began to feel ill similar to a common cold. Approximately 12-18 hours after receiving the vaccine, my symptoms worsened so much that I could hardly stand or move around, and began throwing up. This continued and worsened as my entire body felt pain and stiffness, I felt very weak and fatigued, and I was throwing up violently with frequency. I threw up so much and with enough force that I started to see bright red blood in my spittle and vomit. I had a severe headache accompanying these other symptoms.  I also had problems with homeostatic temperature regulation  and was simultaneously sweating profusely and very warm to the touch while feeling like I was cold.  I was shaky and experienced tremors and twitches in my hands, arms, legs, and feet. I kept throwing up and experiencing these symptoms for approximately 72 hours after recieving my vaccine.  I was virtually incapacitated for those three days of severe illness-like symptoms.

                                                Six hours after injection of vaccine, I experienced nausea, moderate chills, headache, and a low fever which lasted for 6 hours. I also had numb fingertips which lasted for around 20 minutes right after the chills really set in. I&#39;m not positive its related but two nights after my vaccine injection, I woke up at night because my feet were itching and hot. They also had the pins and needles sensation and these symptoms lasted around 20 to 30 minutes. I have never had that happen before so I assume it was vaccine related.

Following days I felt tired and had a headache on the top of my head ranging from a seven to a ten in pain. I tried Tylenol but no help because body rejected it. I tried Excedrin migraine for headaches but still no let up. I am still experiencing headaches and Fatigue.

Headache, fatigue, chills, sore throat, body aches persisted. Patient did not take any medication until 4/12 (Excedrin for migraines), which reportedly made it worse. Patient was advised to go to ER on 4/14/21 in the morning, where a CT scan and blood tests were done with no remarkable findings. Patient was discharged that evening with instructions to hydrate, rest, and take ibuprofen and Tylenol.

After about 5 minutes they subsided, but the same thing happened a few hours later and were so overwhelming I had to crawl on the floor to move. I felt achey and exhausted, with heavy night sweating. The next day, symptoms included  light sensitivity, headache, chills, sweats, body aches, fatigue and a 101 degree fever. My symptoms subsided by the next day, about 36 hours after the initial injection.

My body shook, and it appeared that I had a seizure. Immediately upon waking I started vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements for about an hour. I felt confused for about 30 minutes and was unable to speak for a few moments upon waking. When I arrived at the hospital I was still vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements. I was given fluids and zofran and sent home without further testing.

On the 5th day (Apr 16), I started to feel pain in my right hip to the point that I feel pain in every step walking, which has never happened to me.  Note: I didn&#39;t exercise since I got the vaccine and maintained pretty good routines for ensuring enough sleep. Today is the 3rd day since that symptom appeared, while I do feel better, the pain hasn&#39;t disappeared.

I was shaking uncontrollably with a very high  fever and chills for two hours.  I couldn&#39;t eat.

I am on day  8 now  and still  feel extremely tired.

Fatigue increased dramatically, though it was present prior. Dizziness, sharp pains in left ear in skull, nerve issues. The following is a log from when the symptoms became most intense, so significant I have not been able to drive myself and been working from home due to balance issues, no feeling in feet, and neurological symptoms. After different a week and a half,, i sought medical care and began logging daily as follows:   Fri 4/9: fatigue was high, neuropathy present. Balance was off.

Noted increase in joint pain and popping in wrists elbows hips and knees. Needed white noise to cover ear ringing to sleep.   Sun 4/11: feeling a bit better. Able to eat. Gastric issues after eating.

Immediate strong increase in the pins and needles in my hand concentrated in finger tips but now radiating up forearm too. .numbness in feet and part of my face. Whole body aching. When trying to sleep kept getting head rush static attributed to Benadryl to sleep and staying up too late.   Saturday: very tired. Back hurting in morning. Felt better after getting up. Kept feeling head rush like static in forehead continuing on and off throughout the day into the night with dizziness almost like I might pass out. Nausea and low appetite Fatigue higher than normal.

                                                On Wednesday May 12th around 615 pm I started having symptoms of a stroke. I was scrambling my words, couldn?t talk right and my left side of my face wouldn?t move when I spoke or smiled. When I smiled my whole smile shifted to the right.  I had my girlfriend call 911 because I knew I was having a stroke. The symptoms lasted about 6 or 7 minutes. By the time the emt got there I was talking fine and my face was back to normal. I went to hospital where a cat scan was done on Wednesday night and came back fine. The doctors decided to admit me because they wanted me to get an MRI in the morning, which I did and came back that I had a minor stroke. The doctors think the stroke had something to with me being on an estrogen birth control as well as some family history but my primary care doctor recommend me report this because I did get the Jansen vaccine and it could have triggered what happened. I was discharged on Friday 5/14/2021 and I know have to take aspirin every day for the rest of my life, plavix for 21 days, and Lipitor until my doctor thinks I can come off.

                                                I am currently lactating and breastfeeding for 11 months. The afternoon that I got the vaccine I got a fever, lethargy and extreme fatigue. I was nauseous and I had diarrhea.  My fever was 102. I started to feel better after three days. I also got aa headache that was similar to the Migraines I used to have. I hadn&#39;t had a Migraine for 18 months and I had  a Migraine daily for five weeks. I went to the care facility eight days after the vaccine because I thought I had a UTI. The UTI was positive and I was told I had some Streptococcus B at the time. I was also experiencing confusion, and tiredness.  One month after the vaccine I went back to the care facility because I was have having cramps in my lower abdomen and circulating to my lower back as well as my legs. All tests were negative but I was given multiple antibiotics. After eight weeks I still have lower abdominal cramping, vaginal discharge and headaches. Some of the symptoms were relieved by the antibiotics but they have returned.

When I woke up my teeth were chattering from a fever of 100, I was throwing up and had spasms, back pain, body pain, and I was shaking. It lasted all night, at least 5-6 hours. The next day was similar. I called my doctor a week later because I was hoping the symptoms would go away. My tongue was swollen which made it hard to talk. The doctor advised me to take Tylenol. I feel like I have had the flu everyday since April 10.

In the middle of the night I had a fever of 103 and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, it was so painful. That was the weirdest thing I ever experienced in my life. I had three blankets and a robe on and couldn&#39;t stop trembling. There was pain all over my body, I had to wear a dress to the hospital because I couldn&#39;t put on pants because of the pain. At the ER, I was given an injection of Toradol and the pain was gone within 20 minutes.

My temperature about an hour later was 105. I took 1000 mg of Tylenol right away and put a cold rag on my head and tried to go to sleep. A couple hours later my fever started breaking, when it was 102.7 I was a sweaty mess and extremely hot and puked a lot.  My fever and other symptoms went away within about 7 hours after my fever started breaking.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Mid Saturday night I woke up to chills and was shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep even after adding another layer of clothes and blanket. Sunday morning I was still very cold and tired from not sleeping. I developed body aches but they were everywhere not just my arm. I was very fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. The worst part was getting a migraine with extreme light sensitivity. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around any windows without blinds. I spent the day in my bedroom sleeping with the curtains closed and an eye mask on. By that night, the migraine had subsided but I was adding hot flashes to the problem list. Had a pretty restless night again on Sunday. Woke up Monday to the light sensitivity back but not as severe. I took the day off work because I couldn&#39;t handle looking at a computer screen all day. By about 1pm I was feeling mostly back to normal. My arm is still sore near the injection site and I&#39;m a bit fatigued at times but those are the only things remaining.

                                                I?ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before.  Received the vaccine at around 9:55am on 03/08/21.  Pain while the vaccine was being administered but it healed within a few minutes. I started getting a mild headache at around 3:30pm while at work. When I got home at around 6pm I started having severe chills, the headache became intense, my mouth and eyelids felt hot, my hands and feet felt very cold and when I checked temperature it was 102.4.  By 9:00 pm the headache became excruciating like I?ve never had it before, as if my head was being squeezed or pressed. Eyes and the back of my jaw hurt too.  Had light and sound sensitivity. Took 200mg of Advil but pain was still almost intolerable until I was finally able to fall asleep at around 4:00 am.  Was still in pain the day after but not as bad as the night before. Only mild pain today but started feeling itchy tonight and noticed some rashes on my body.

I started to develop a low grade fever 8 hours after the shot. 13 hours after the shot, I had a 104.1 fever. Along with the fever, I experienced severe body aches and chills, nausea and a horrible headache. I couldn?t walk as my body was so weak and my vision was blurry. About 15 hours after the vaccine, my fever went down to 102. I was able to get up and walk to my kitchen to take some Advil. My fever broke 20 hours after the vaccine with the medicine. I?m still experiencing severe body aches, headache, nausea and chills and it has been about 30 hours after vaccine. I did have covid 3 months ago, and the symptoms from the vaccine were much worse than the symptoms I had with actual covid.

Chills lasted for hours and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, so took Tylenol at 12:15am. Around 1:00am the chills subsided. Around 2:00am fever burnt off, sweating and hot. Couldn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night. Slept from 8am-10am and woke with just headache. Took Tylenol around 10:30am to help with headache and it did start to subside. Was mostly fatigued and muscle aches the rest of the day until 6pm when I started to get cold again. Feels like the fever and chills are coming back and it&#39;s currently 7:30pm, so assuming it&#39;ll be another night of this.

                                                3/6/21  This is a 32-year-old female who is receiving her first Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine and shortly afterwards developed some throat itching and tightness.  She was given a milligram of epinephrine by intramuscular injection by retired emergency physician there and then transported by ambulance here for further evaluation.  Says her tongue felt a little swollen as well but she denies any respiratory symptoms.  Her voice sounds crackly to her.  She denies any pruritus or rashes.  She has had multiple allergic reactions to medications in the past but never having to be admitted overnight.  One episode however did occur while she was hospitalized and receiving treatment.  She has never had to be intubated.  She has had isolated urticaria without oral or throat symptoms and vice versa.  At this point she says she does feel somewhat better. She is given IV dexamethasone and observed here.  At 1 point she complained of it complaint complained of it feeling like a tightening in the back of her throat was worsening.  She is given an additional intramuscular dose of epinephrine with epinephrine and on reexamination had no significant change in physical findings or her phonation.  This occurred again and she was given viscous lidocaine with minimal improvement in her symptoms.  After several hours of observation without objective worsening but continued complaint of feeling increasing tightness in her throat, CT imaging of the neck is performed to assess the soft tissue structures.  No abnormalities or indication of significant retropharyngeal or paralaryngeal edema or airway compromise present. Given the possibility of some laryngeal muscle or parapharyngeal muscle spasm as him, she was given Flexeril.  After some discussion with her I did indicate to her that I felt it would be safe to return home but offered admission for observation as well.  She indicated she was comfortable returning home for continued observation.  She will be continued on steroids and antihistamines and is given additional Flexeril by prescription if this does seem to help her symptoms.  If no improvement over the next 2 to 3 days and follow-up either with her primary providers through facility or Dr.  3/7/21: Return to ED. The patient is in no respiratory distress.  She has no wheezing.  On physical exam her throat lips and tongue look fine.  I think she is not a had another allergic reaction, rebounded from yesterday.  She is not on any type of steroids sinus syndrome with some Decadron.  And she is allergic to Benadryl but she can take Claritin if she wants.  Her CBC and chemistry were normal.  I went back to evaluate her and she still getting fluids and now she is complaining of shooting pain down her left leg from the EpiPen.  Again she has this regional complex pain syndrome that could be part of that but there is nothing I can do for this at this time.  In terms of her allergic reaction she feels much better her throat feels normal.  We will send her out with prescription for Decadron and EpiPen and if she gets worse she will come back and will follow up admit her.

The highest fever I ever recorded was 100.6 but it felt much higher. I had nausea, body aches, headache, and exhaustion for a full 24 hours. Within 48 hours, my chills and aches were mostly gone, but a sore throat, cough, and congestion developed. As of this morning, Friday 19 March, I?m still exhausted, but  all other symptoms have finally resided.

                                                Currently pregnant due May 31. I got the vaccine at 4 pm on Wednesday. At around 6pm I started to get a headache, I took 2 tylenol but it continued to get progressively worse. By 7 I was starting to get really fatigued and fell asleep. I woke up around 8 or 9 still fatigued with body aches and a headache. The body aches and headache continued to worsen, but due to pregnancy I could not take any more tylenol. Around midnight I got out of bed to use the bathroom and immediately started violently shivering. It continued for a few minutes after I got back into bed, it did cause a lot of pain in my joints and muscles. A few hours later I woke up very hot and sweaty. The next day (Thursday) I continued to feel very fatigued with body aches and a headache to the point where I had to stop working even though I work from home. The following day (Friday) I was still mildly fatigued and had some body aches, and my brain felt very foggy so I took off work again. I regularly checked my temperature during this time and did not have a fever.

                                                I was fine from 10am until 3:30pm on the day of injection. I started to feel feverish and chills at 3:30 and it progressed into a 99.2 fever with all over body aches and a headache and chills. I took alkasletzer cold medicine with Tylenol in it to help with the fever. It got the symptoms down where I could move and stood in the hot shower for 30 minutes to help warm me up. I felt slightly better and still had fever symptoms and severe body aches. I started feeling unable to move due to the fever symptoms again around 9pm and took 2 extra strength Tylenol that eventually worked and I had some nausea with that. I hadn?t been able to eat because of the symptoms and the nausea could have been from taking meds on an empty stomach. I finally felt able to eat around 10pm and had some food and went to bed. I could barley sleep all night and was tossing and turning due to fever. My nose started to get runny around 10pm before I went to bed. I woke up the next day and still had the fever symptoms, body aches and the worst headache I have ever had, a 10 on the pain scale. I took another 2 extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep for 2 hours. I woke up and could tell the fever had broken and my head was still in pretty severe pain- about a 7 on the pain scale.  I was incredibly fatigued the entire day and felt hot and cold throughout the day. I was incredibly weak and needed a lot of rest. I still didn?t sleep well through the night and woke up friday feeling fatigued. I expended some energy in the am at the dog park and had to sleep for 3 hours during the day which is atypical for me. I woke up Saturday morning (today) still feeling a headache and exhaustion. I will see how the rest of the day goes and am hoping to feel better and don?t know when the symptoms will stop.

The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

The strength in the right arm has also decreased. I have not injured or worked out my arm since I received the vaccine. I have tried to ice, heat, and move the arm gently, but nothing seems to lessen the pain and soreness. I have no injury history on my right arm or the right side of my upper body.

RN was by the side of the patient, was instructed to check VS: BP 140/70, T 97.9, O2 Sat 98% RA, RR 20, HR 87. Patient was awake and alert in the sitting position with her husband. 6:42 pm, unable to contact command center (1-888-634-1130), 911 was called. Per EMT instructions, patient was able to life her both arms in the air, able to smile, and ale to repeat the sentence as stated y the EMT staff on the phone. EMT arrived at 7 pm,  he explained to patient that she would not be charged since patient was nervous of the charges that might be imposed to her. He performed assessment and VS: BP 154/101, HR 98, O2 Sat 100% RA, RR 20, patient stated her tingling and numbness sensation on her left arm was gone and she would not want to be escorted to the hospital for further assessment and treatment.

A nurse educator reported with the incident. Suggestion was made to have a form that patient/family can sign to refuse further treatment and able to be discharged with their decision.

                                                Woke up at 4:00 am (13.5 hours after vaccine) with muscle aches, chills, and shaking. Took 2 Tylenol at 4:45 am, ate a snack, and wrapped up in blankets. Significant relief from symptoms at 5:20 am. Went back to sleep. The following day, I had a mild headache, mild arm soreness, mild sinus congestion, and moderate tiredness.

By night time around 10PM, I had fever of 100F. The next day, Saturday, April 10th, I got my period in the morning. I had migraine and felt weak all day. Felt fine by 6PM. On Sunday, April 11th, I woke up feeling good but then around 12PM I got a heavy nosebleed.

                                                Immediately after injection at 10:20am, I felt hot and light headed. I have passed out from shots and IVs before so I brought my own smelling salts to my appointment, and I used them as soon as I felt faint, which kept me from passing out.  I felt ok after waiting 30 minutes. Later that day around 5pm, I started getting chills and felt a little achy. At 6pm I checked my temperature and it was 99.9, at 7pm it was 101.9, at 7:30pm it was 104 so I took ibuprofen 400 since I had severe chills, headache fatigue and muscle and joint aches. At 8pm it was 102.7 so I took another 400mg of ibuprofen. At  9pm it was 101.7, and at 10pm it was 100.4 and then I went to sleep.  On 4/12: it was 98.7 when I woke up at 9am, then 99 at 10:30 so I took ibuprofen 400, then 100.1 at 11:30 so I took ibuprofen 400 again. Since noon, the fever has subsided and the fatigue and aches and headaches have become mild so that I could work from home.

Light headedness increased over the next few minutes and I began to feel faint.  My activity device indicated my heart rate took a sharp drop.  At this point, I thought it best to lie down. I spent the next 5-7 minutes on the floor until I was able to sit up without feeling faint. I waited an additional 15 minutes before leaving.  I felt somewhat shaky, but felt better by the minute.

                                                That evening I had a headache and I was achy. After going to bed I developed chills where I couldn&#39;t get warm and I was shaking, and then it turned to sweating. The next day I was weak, achy, nauseous. That night I developed a fever too. My injection site it still warm to the touch and a little red and swollen, but is looking better. I also had stomach pains in the evening Friday and Saturday night that happened when I was nauseous too.

Later that evening came muscle pain, chills, high fever, nausea, vomiting, and migraines. The next day, most side effects went away except for the looming headache. Since the vaccine, patient has been experiencing episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness. There was an article that came out today as it relates to blood clots being a possible side effect of the vaccine and to report any feeling of headaches or possible symptoms that may be related to that.

Each time I took the medicine, it made me feel hazy and didn&#39;t help my headache much. I still had a migraine on the 12th. Today, the 13th I feel much better.

                                                I received the vaccine at 3:50 pm and by 9:45 I had the typical side effects --muscle aches, minor pain at the injection site, and chills.  Within an hour from that I also had a terrible headache, nausea, and my skin hurt to touch.  I slept most of the next day, save for 5 or 6 hours.  Starting on 3/30/21 (exactly two weeks from receiving my vaccine) I started having sore skin.  No rash, red marks, itching, just hypersensitive to touch, even with clothing.  This started on my right arm right above the elbow.  The following day the pain had moved to inside both arms right above the elbow.  The day after that, the pain was more intense and was straight across my stomach at belly button height, and across my lower back at that same height.  It was more intense for two days and hurt whether anything was touching my skin or not.  It was very uncomfortable.  In the days following it continued to move to different places on my body.  Legs, bottom of feet, palms of hands, ankles, hips, groin, lower back.    Sometimes it just hurts, sometimes it&#39;s like a prickling, sometimes the skin in that area aches -- especially when on my hands. It&#39;s also very sensitive to anything cold.  Again, if you look at my skin though you can&#39;t see anything.  There&#39;s no visible signs of something being wrong.  It also stopped for a day or so, or just lessened so much that it wasn&#39;t that noticeable, but then returns.  That&#39;s happened twice where I thought this was finally over, only to have it return the next day.

                                                This was Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine.  I had the normal symptoms but it still felt very severe. I think there should be emphasis shared that symptoms might be severe. I believe the public should have a clear idea how severe. From 7pm to 12am I experienced extreme temperature changes, burning hot to very cold. I had the shakes. Headache. I took Advil which helped endure.  Buried myself in blankets with heater and heat on.  Drowsy. Experienced some dizziness. Now 3 days later I have some &#39;pings&#39; here and there but uncertain if from vaccine. I feel these in my ovaries and my legs and my side. These are very subtle &#39;pings&#39; (bit of pain but not much). Unsure if worth reporting but I think all this is important. Also, I have anxiety about the effect on this vaccine on the health of women and think it is very important that this is clear before pushing people -- more specifically young women, girls, babies -- to take this, and perhaps, any vaccine. I have been told from 5 friends they experienced heavy bleeding after taking the vaccine. They may have not all taken the J&amp;J vaccine to be clear.  I do not feel great about having taken this vaccine.  I feel like i&#39;ve put myself at risk of some other complications but of course, this is based on news and fear.  I just wanted to share this experience, and I hope that, if anything, the severity of symptoms might be more broadly shared.

She went to an emergency room and was given acetaminophen, prednisone, diphenhydramine, and famotidine. Her symptoms did not significantly improve and was discharged. The burning sensation and allodynia did resolve overnight and have not reoccurred, but these symptoms are the adverse event I am reporting.

                                                About 5 hours after shot, I started feeling weak, tired, and nauseas with a slight headache.  I had discomfort trying to fall asleep. I woke up at 12:43AM with a throbbing headache. I was hospitalized at 18 for viral meningitis, and this was a similar, intense pain. It felt like I had a crown on,  and that crown on my head caused a very intense, throbbing, debilitating pain. I also had chattering teeth, shaking with a freezing fever. I eventually fell asleep and woke up again at 2-something. My fever and headache still intense, but now I was drenched in sweat and burning up. I wanted to get up and find my thermometer--I remember digging through my drawers and closets around my apartment,  I remember speaking but no recollection what I was trying to say (I live alone), and I remember seeing my reflection looking glazed over. I don&#39;t remember getting back in bed but woke up again after 5AM. I still had a bad headache, though less severe, and felt my body was alternating very hot sweating and very cold freezing--like it was mix and matching. I eventually fell asleep again and woke up around 7:45AM. I was fatigued with a fever and chills all day.  I found my thermometer and went to sleep with a 100.3 fever that night. I was much better next day, just slight fatigue.

                                                I?m addition to the flu like symptoms (severe cold chills, severe headache, weak/fatigue, fever, body aches and soreness at the injection site). The flu like symptoms were so severe I had to take an ibuprofen to nurse my baby. I, then, experienced tingly, numb legs followed by pain. I got up to try to walk it off and had shortness of breath. Put on compression socks but the restless leg and shortness of breath continued for 3/4 hours.

                                                The first 24 hours were very difficult for me. I have never been so sick in my life. I got the typical muscle aches, chills, etc. In fact I got every side effect listed plus more. I want to discuss the other side effects. On day 3 I started to develop extreme chest pain and pressure. It is a dull pain as if someone if sitting on my chest that will not go away. I also started to experience sudden bouts of dizziness and vertigo. It will not go away. Today is Day 7 and I spent the night in the emergency room because my chest pains got so strong. However, all the work up came back okay. I also have this strange feeling of electrical shocks running thru my head, those last about .5 seconds and go away, but it is a very weird feeling I have never experienced. I also have a strange desire to constantly burp, when I do my chest pain feels better. If I don&#39;t burp my ears start to feel full and sometimes they ring. Its Day 7 and I still feel SO miserable. Why id no one speaking about these chest pains? I know 5 people who have experienced the same.

The fever and muscle aches lasted until the following morning. Around 12pm is when I began expecting some stomach discomfort/sharp pains on the upper left hand side of my stomach. It began to increase in intensity around 4pm when I began to get nauseous. 5-6pm is when I began vomitting, and decided to go to the ER after the pain reached a level 8-9 and my face and limbs felt numb. I was admitted to the emergency room at 11:30pm and was given a CT Scan where it was discovered I had appendicitis. Wednesday evening I underwent surgery, and was discharged Thursday 4/15. I am still experiencing a slight fever and soreness at the injection site on my left arm.

I had a slight droop on the l eft side of my face, mostly noticeable around the corner of my mouth. I also experienced itchiness around the injection site. The symptoms started with numbness in the tip of my tongue about 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine and slowly spread to the rest of my face. Approximately 5 hours after receiving the vaccine the entire left side of my face was numb. I called a nurse hotline to find out if I should seek medical care that night or wait until morning. They urged me to go to the ER.   I went to the ER, underwent a plethora of tests, received positive results on all of them, and was sent home with instructions to return if my condition worsened. The doctors said I had Bell?s Palsy but had little insight as to why it had occurred.  a nurse hotline

Day 6 (3/12/21): severe head pain like an ice-pick in the back right radiated to the front left, heard a loud humming inside my head, it felt like my head was gyrating, AND my vision in my right eye became distorted and I couldn&#39;t move my legs I couldn&#39;t feel them - I thought I was having a seizure. After the Day6 event I have had persistent tremors, muscle twitches, weakness in legs, phantom sensations on my left side hand/arm or left leg,  forgetfulness, memory problems, word retrieval problems, constant ringing in ears and nausea.

I began to feel dizzy and light-headed to the point I was considering pulling my car over.  After a few minute the dizziness began to subside, but the sensation in my arm continued for approximately 45 minutes.

As the next few days progressed my leg began to get numb and go cold as ice. I have lost my ability to walk and my leg still has shooting nerve pains, gets numb, and twitches. I have gone to the ER, the doctor twice, and a neurologist. Nobody seems to have any answers for me. It is not a blood clot but that is the only thing that has been ruled out.

                                                Pt was given the vaccine. Within less than 5 minutes, she said she was feeling light-headed and proceeded to pass out. She fell to the floor, and I went out to assist her. She was able to keep her head from hitting the floor, and I supported her head as she regained consciousness. She tried to sit up but lost consciousness again and appeared to convulse (arms and legs drawn up). She regained consciousness again, and was completely lucid. We called 911 and EMT arrived and continued their usual procedures including checking blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose. Her BP was 130/80 laying, and 80/60 sitting. Her pulse was 50. Her blood sugar was 56 before consuming glucose and 71 after. She was given water as well. She declined a ride to the hospital but did have a friend give her a ride home.

                                                Within 17-20 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I felt a burning, hot sensation in my throat. I let paramedics know and sat for about 10-15 more minutes. My mouth and throat became extremely dry and I had a tingly feeling in my feet. I also experienced high anxiety. An ambulance came and proceeded to bring me to the nearest hospital. In the ambulance, I began coughing, which caused tightness in my lungs and moments of needing to cough. My vitals were normal in the ambulance and I was given IV fluids.  I arrived at the hospital around 4:30 pm. When checked by triage about 2 hours later, the nurse reported my vitals were normal, and that I shouldn&#39;t need epinephrine or lab work. She reported that &#34;hopefully a triage doctor would be able to see me soon.&#34; I continued to cough into the evening, and began wheezing from coughing. I waited in the ER waiting room until just before 10pm. Triage could not give  a time estimate of when I could be seen. I needed an inhaler or nebulizer treatment long before.  I left the hospital after the nurse removed the IV port. At this time, the nurse reported my &#34;rash on my chest was gone,&#34; although she did not mention a rash earlier in the evening and I did not notice it (had a jacket on). I did not need to sign or receive discharge paperwork because I was never seen by a doctor. I took Benadryl and gave myself a nebulizer treatment once I got home and all adverse reactions were gone the next morning. I experienced flu-like symptoms the next day.

                                                The day after the vaccine I had a low-grade fever and felt bad. I was extremely fatigued and I felt weak. It almost felt like the flu. I had nausea at night and I felt flushed. I consulted with  Urgent Care and they asked me to come in and get a COVID-19 test which was negative. Those symptoms lasted a full week. My period is also out of sync and it lasted longer than usual for a total of two weeks. It kept coming and going. It normally only lasts five days and it is consistent. I was also having cramping on my left lower abdominal region.

This went on for several hours before finally falling asleep. The day following the injection, more and more symptoms began to arise such as muscle soreness, cold/hot sweats, low-grade fever (99.5%), chest pain/pressure, sweating, dizziness/disorientation and a headache. Monday night I experienced the low-grade fever however after going to bed, woke up around 5AM barely unable to stand, very disoriented and upon taking my temperature, I took note that I had a fever of 100.9%. Today, Tuesday May 11th, I am experiencing chest pain/pressure, low-grade fever, headache and am lethargic.

                                                About 2 minutes after receiving the vaccine, while parked, I started getting very light headed, felt dizzy, and my heart starting beating extremely fast, and then slowed down and started beating very very hard, and felt like it was going to pound out of my chest. I then had a warm sensation in my throat and started feeling like it was getting harder to breathe. I rolled down my Window, and looked for someone to wave over for assistance, but there were cars in the way, so I closed my eyes and focused on breathing deep and slowly to see if that would make it any better. After about 5 minutes my heart rate went back to normal, I felt I could breathe normally, and wasn&#39;t so light headed anymore. I should have reported this to someone when they told me I could leave, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it was an actual allergic reaction. Or if it was just a stress reaction. I felt like I should at least report it here, because I was completely fine before the injection, during the injection, and right after, until about 2 minutes after being parked.

Throughout the day tingling turned to numbness as if leg were asleep, and feeling in foot turned to strong pain. Had ultrasound in the leg to check for clots (although they did not check foot) and nothing was discovered. After this pain escalated and a week after I was unable to keep my foot still for more than a minute without the intense pain rushing back - the feeling was as if my foot were cramping to an extreme. Elevating helped somewhat but for the most part if I wasn?t moving I was crying in pain. The numb feeling is still there as of over a month later but I?m able to hold still without feeling as if my foot is rapidly atrophying.

I went to check on her and she said she was hot and started to close her eyes. I helped her to lay down and had technician get her a wet rag. Once she said she was ok we moved her out of the main aisle and let her lay with cold compress until she was feeling ok and her mother came to make sure she was ok.

                                                2 weeks after the shot I had a scary night where I had severe chest pain. I sat up for a few hours hoping I wasn&#39;t having a heart attack and taking water and tums. I have never had chest pain before or since. I was very concerned and wondered if it was the vaccine. I didn&#39;t have anything unusual to eat or drink. I was happy when it finally resolved that same night.  I also experienced Bell&#39;s Palsy 2 months after the vaccine. (~June 1st) I have never experienced Bell&#39;s Palsy. I am not sure if either of these events were related to the vaccine, but I have no intention of getting a yearly covid or flu vaccine now that I have Bell&#39;s Palsy. It is terrible, and I&#39;m not taking ANY chance of getting this again even if that means I get the flu and covid yearly. I placed my trust in science, and not I am not sure I made the right choice. Although I hope my facial movement and ability to use my lips and face come back, I realize that some never recover.

                                                The same evening I received my vaccine I started experiencing the normal side effects of the vaccine - sore muscles, chills, nausea, headache, fatigue, and my skin hurt to touch on my thighs.  I had a fever and muscle aches the following two days, but then felt pretty normal.  I had some fatigue still, but was ok.  Two weeks to the day after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine I started having hyper-sensitive skin to the point that it was unbearable to have clothing or anything touching me.  It started on my right arm just above the elbow.  The next day it was on the inside of my arms and elbows.  The next day it was my lower back and across my stomach at that same height, then it affected my hands, bottoms of my feet, and ankles.    The hyper sensitivity gradually spread on my body, but lingering the longest on the trunk - stomach and back.  However, it did affect skin on my entire body.   It would prickle or burn sometimes too.  When it&#39;s on my hands, my hands will ache too.  I saw my primary care physician for that after a month of having the persistent symptoms.  It&#39;s important to know that there was no visible reaction - no rash, redness, etc.  To look at my skin, you wouldn&#39;t have known there was anything amiss.  On April 19 I noticed in addition to the hypersensitivity I also felt like my hands weren&#39;t getting proper circulation.  I could feel it from my elbows down to my finger tips.  My hands felt cold and like a minor burning feeling.   On May 3rd my joints started aching (felt it in butt /hips).  I started taking ibuprofen and tylenol to try to ease symptoms and ibuprofen seemed to help a little bit with joint pain, but also helped a little with the skin hypersensitivity.  It did not eliminate symptoms, but gave a little bit of a relief.  From there I had that hypersensitivity down my legs, feet (also ached), chest, back, knees, stomach.  In the middle of May I was having joint pain in my hands too.  Around May 25th I started feeling a numbness sort of feeling in my knees, fronts of thighs, and feet.  Less so in my hands at this point.  Started feeling tingling, prickles, and like my feet were cold from in the inside.  Felt like they weren&#39;t getting enough circulation either.  On June 7, I noticed some balance issues.  Since then, the balance issues have much worsened, and in addition,  I&#39;ve lost muscle control, experiencing weakness especially in my legs, having a lot of trouble walking, that stiffness is still there - I have trouble even bringing my knees up while standing.  Having issues with going to the bathroom- urinating more often than usual, have had fecal incontinence, and feeling like my feet all the way up to halfway up my stomach are partially numb.   My PCP referred me to a rheumatologist.  I&#39;ve had bloodwork done and the rheumatologist is now referring me to a neurologist.

                                                I was diagnosed with guillain-barre syndrome. After receiving my vaccine 3/19/21 i started to feel tingling in my feet around 4/30/2019 that made my feet hurt to walk on. The tingling than started to turn into a numbness at the tips of my toes and traveled throughout the rest of my feet making then feel hard to walk on. After about a week the numbness started to travel up my legs causing a decreased sensation on my legs where i started to feel tingling  sensations. Once it was almost to my knee and had already been to two doctors that werent sure of a diagnosis i went to the er where they were able to diagnose and treat me.

Foot and legs cramps at night, swollen red toes.  Around 6/1/21 toes on both feet became extremely red and painful, as well as the pads of my feet (hot to the touch). Walking and driving became painful and difficult. Nothing could be touching my toes/feet because of the severe pain. Random Jots would go from my feet up through my body. Sleeping became impossible because of the pain. 6/7/21 contacted a Dr. prescribed me METHYLPREDNISOLONE 4 MG DOSEPK. This had no affects to the pain swelling went down in toes. I then scheduled an appointment with a podiatrist 6/21/21. She prescribed another METHYLPREDNISOLONE 4 MG DOSEPK. Followed back up and feet were more red. She advised me to get labs done. Later that day I had acupuncture to treat toes. next two appointments for acupuncture 6/24/21, 6/28/21. Pins in needles were gone other than my feet, toes, right fingers. As of now my left foot /toes are not as painful. Numbness/pins&amp;needles. Right toes and pad of foot are still numb with pins&amp;needles.

                                                Around 3:00pm on 3/7/21 I began to feel a little tired. But 3:45pm I was experiencing muscle pain through my body at only continued to get worse. At 4:30pm I took 400mg of ibuprofen since sitting, walking, and lying down were all painful. Relief came around 5:30pm and I was able to nap for an hour. At 6:30pm I awoke and attempted to eat, as I was beginning to feel nauseous. At 8:30pm I laid down again, my symptoms returning and worsening. I was now experiencing chills with my muscle pain and a headache. Pain was located throughout my body and my skin was sensitive to the touch. At 10:30pm I began shaking violently and struggled to feel warm, despite my skill feeling hot. My temperature was not taken. Another 400mg of ibuprofen was taken and one 350mg chewable of Tums anti-acid was eaten. It was not until 12:30am that I was able to sleep again.  The morning of 3/8/21 I was still fatigued and sore. Moving was difficult and painful and nausea was still present, and my headache returned. I was unable to eat despite trying. At 10:00am I took two tablets of Excedrin Migrain and napped for almost two hours. Currently, my muscle aches are minimal and my headache has improved. This may however be due to the medication.

I delayed taking Ibuprofen to not reduce the efficiency of the vaccine but couldn&#39;t endure the chills and shivering as well as the massive pain all over my body. I started with 200 mg Ibuprofen, which helped with all 3 symptoms at least as far as I was able to sit instead of lie all the time.

At midnight I woke up extremely hot, as if I had a fever (I didn&#39;t confirm this with a thermometer, I was just extremely hot and sweaty) and I had a very severe, painful headache that lasted at least 30 minutes until I took two acetaminophen pills. I also experienced the usual muscle pains. All symptoms were gone by Saturday morning upon waking.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

She was evaluated in our office on 3/17/21- no respiratory distress, or perioral edema. Advised to use antihistamine and hydrocortisone and reviewed red flags. Returned on 3/19/21 with improving symptoms.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

                                                From probably 9pm till 8am I was freezing cold with crawling skin and flu-like symptoms. I wasn?t tired though, just so freezing cold and sore all over. I couldn?t sleep because the discomfort was so bad. I was probably 70 degrees in my house and I was in fleece pajamas and had 3 blankets and was still freezing all night. No fever though, oddly.

I woke at 3am with severe chills and shaking. I had a fever of 101.5. I took Tylenol Extra Stength and that helped.  Had trouble sleeping but managed to fall back asleep for a little bit. Upon waking, I had a head, muscle aches, and a fever. I kept taking the Tylonel every 6 hours throughout the entire day. My fever got as high as 102.1. It broke around 7pm on March 18th. My shoulder where the vaccine was injected was sore through Saturday, March 20th. I had muscle aches and weakness through Saturday, March 20th.

Started experiencing fogginess and feeling cold at 1:00 am 20Mar2021. Went to bed at 1:00 and dreamed of being sick until waking up at 8:30 am 20Mar2021. Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

But the exhausted next day - I went home from work early that day. Friday, I got a rash  - very itchy and sore  (it felt very tender when touched)- on my left side (abdomen). It spread around the left side on my back and to my stomach. I say my doctor on this Tuesday (virtual appt) said it was Shingles - Valtrex - to help it heal faster. The rash is starting to scab over and is peeling now.  It&#39;s getting better.

                                                Starting the around 10 pm the evening of my vaccine, March 6,  I had chills. When I woke up in the morning I had a headache, muscle aches, slight difficulty breathing with chest heaviness, and fatigue.  At 2 am on March 8 I awoke with dizziness and room spinning, sweating, weakness and lightheadedness, and nausea. Later that morning most of the symptoms subsided except for slight lightheadedness. By March 9 all side effects had resolved.

Treated with iburprofen and odansetron at approximately 3:30 AM. Fever, nausea, and vomiting subsided due to medication. Muscle/joint pain remained at a lessened level. High levels of fatigue emerged in the early morning hours. Took sumatriptan for migraine at around noon and again later that evening. Fever resurfaced when ibuprofen wore off around noon. Had to leave work early due to fever, muscle/joint pain, and migraine. Took another dose of ibuprofen around that time and again in the evening. Fatigue lasted until approximately 48 hours later. All other symptoms subsided within 24 hours.

                                                The day after the vaccine my right hip locked up. It was very stiff and sore and there was a sharp pain while going from standing to sitting and in the sitting position. It was a very sharp pain that was shooting down my leg and it wrapped around my hip. It was a constant pain. I also had a little soreness in my neck and shoulders and it lasted two days. I went to see my chiropractor the next afternoon. It was better after that visit and it is still a little stiff after two weeks. I took Ibuprofen as needed since then.

She fell off of her chair onto her left shoulder. Pharmacist was there immediately trying to assist her. Her eyes were open but patient was unresponsive. Approximately, 10-15 seconds later she came back to it and tried to get up. I asked her to stay down and relax. patient was asked if she was aware of where she was and time and she responded properly. Then she mentioned she has had panic attacks previously. Emergency services was notified immediately and Market director.  Patients vitals were taken and her blood pressure started at 135/95 mmHg 85 hr. 5 minutes later her vitals were done to 127/87 mmHg 82 hr.  By the time, emergency services arrived she was sitting done on her chair and feeling much better. She refused Emergency services. She sat in the observation room for 20 minutes after and was checked on by the pharmacist. She was stable and in good spirit when she left.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after I received the vaccine, I started to feel extremely fatigued and experienced some muscle aches. I took an Aleve and laid down for an hour long nap. At approximately 7:00pm, I woke up with more extreme muscle pain. By 8:00pm, my muscles were so tight and painful that it hurt to move, lay still, or go to the bathroom. It felt as though all of the muscles in the back of my body (from my back to my butt and legs) were spasming, Over the next few hours, my temperature rose to 102.7 and my heart rate spiked to 140-150 bpm. I also experienced chills and a headache. We sought the advice of a 24-hour nurse, who let us know these symptoms were likely normal side effects. I went to bed around 12:00am, and my temperature had dropped to 99.9 around 3:00am when I woke up to check it.  My heart rate eventually dropped below 100 bpm around 8:00am. I woke up around 10:00am on Saturday feeling much better than the day before. My temperature was around 99.1 when I woke up, and my symptoms included mild muscle aches, a moderate headache, and moderate fatigue. I continued to feel better throughout the day, with the headache gradually subsiding and a minor sore throat toward the end of the day. On Sunday, I felt back to normal, other than experiencing some mild-moderate fatigue.

By midnight, I had a fever of 100.2, nausea, intense headache (specifically around the eyes) and overall significant discomfort. The fever lasted overnight. Vomiting occurred on several occasions shortly after midnight for a few hours and again around 6 am. The following day, my fever did go down yet I maintained a headache and some nausea. After 3 days, adverse events were resolved. Treatment consisted of tylenol and fluids. I did not contact my a physician, so no medical tests/lab work was completed. For background, I have never experienced a serious event with a vaccine, besides general fatigue.

I soon had a 103.7 fever with chills and a terrible splitting headache. My symptoms lasted through the night. I took one 200mg Ibuprofen at 03:30 saturday morning/it didn&#39;t seem to help much. Most of the day saturday I had a headache that was manageable and 100.2 degree fever. Saturday evening I was fever free and had a dull headache. Sunday, I was exhausted.

Fatigue lingered in day to day activities for about 1 week.

                                                Almost immediately, I had pain in my arm that shot into my shoulder when the vaccine was being injected into my arm. I did not mention it to the pharmacist since I figured it was normal. I sat for 15 minutes as instructed, but  other than feeling sore, I was normal. So we left. After about another 15 mins, My head started for feel &#34;drunk&#34;. I contemplated pulling over since I was driving home, but decided to get home asap.  As time went by, my head felt more and more cloudy, fuzzy, heavy and as if I&#39;d been drinking alcohol. That night, I couldn&#39;t sleep. I even took hydrocodon with tylenol (the pain was that bad) and an ibprofin. It helped a little. I finally got to sleep at 3am, Just to wake at 7am for work. All day, I could not focus, my head was super fuzzy. I had a bad headache, I felt super sick. My stomach also hurt and I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I tried taking a nap half way through the day because I kept making mistakes at work. It did not help how I felt. Since then, my symptoms have eased but now I seem to have a bad case of acid reflux, which I didn&#39;t used to get randomly.   I have not been to my dr yet and I haven&#39;t done anything else for it. I was informed that I should report my symptoms by a family friend.

                                                Tachycardia.  I had the expected side effects of headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and fever (102.6 F) but began to experience symptoms of pounding/racing heart that worsened through the evening. By 10:00 pm my heart rate was bouncing around between 130 bpm and 155 bpm, and I was beginning to have pain in my lower legs/ankles.  Was told by a on call nurse for my clinic to go to the ER. I was in the ER for about 5 hours, roomed the whole time as they worked to get my heart rate down and checked to make sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot. They performed an EKG and CT Scan of my chest, both were fine. I was eventually allowed to leave after 4 am on 4/10/21 after my heart rate got into the high 90&#39;s with only small spikes into the 110&#39;s with slight movement and once my fever had broken.

                                                Started with chills pretty shortly after the vaccine was injected.  After about 6 hours I could tell I was not feeling great.  My husband said I looked very pale and out of it all of the sudden.  I became extremely tired and disoriented.  I don?t remember driving myself home that evening after picking up my kids from dance.  By the time I was home it was now around 8 pm.  I was so cold my entire body was trembling.  I kept taking steaming hot showers but I couldn?t feel it, I was still freezing and shaking.  I was very weak and started having extremely horrible body aches and pains.  Specifically my legs were hurting the worst, I remember my hip joints felt like they?d buckle underneath me.  I got a headache that was unbearable.  It felt worse than a migraine.  It hurt to move my head or use my eyes at all.  I went to bed and was under several blankets and a heating pad while also running a space heater right next to me.  I still could not get warm at all.  I hallucinated that I could see each ache and pain on my body and watched them move through me.  By 4 am I was now hysterical and crying.  I was in so much unbearable pain and so scared.  I had to call off of work for this day.  I was so out of it I called my daughter off of school but also called for my mom to come get her and take her to school.  I kept my youngest home with me.  My head was still the absolute worst headache I have ever felt in my life.  I couldn?t open my eyes and it hurt to move at all.  I had to call a friend to come pick up my youngest daughter because I was unable to take care of her, I could barely stay awake and alert.  I tried another hot shower and everything still felt cold.  I was now nauseous from the head pain.  Around noon on this day I finally had the strength to drink some water and was able to take Tylenol.  I laid on the couch for hours still shivering and in unbearable pain.  I was still very scared that I was having such a bad reaction that I would die.  I called my husband to come home from work and be with me because I was scared.  I took more Tylenol a couple hours after the first dose.  Around 6 pm I started to feel better.  I was able to eat again that evening.  I had a headache though for about 3 weeks after that gradually weaned away.

Then my head starting hurting and I felt extremely hot. My legs and chest were pink and hot to the touch. Very high fever, head pain , nausea and heart palpitations. I took Tylenol which helped with the fever. The next day I had some minor aches and dizziness. Later the same day, I had  sharp aches/pains down my back and an upset stomach. That night I had a fever again but not as high. Today, two days later, I feel back to normal with the occasional ache or cramp.

I was in bed.  3/20?got period 3/21?I was gushing blood like never before in my entire life. I went through a menstral cup in 1.5 hours.    This excessive cycle lasted for days. My period is normally 3/4  days and this one was 6/7 days. I also passed 3 golf ball sized blood clots. I have never in my life passed a clot, let alone three that size.  The next cycle I had a tiny bit of break through bleeding the day I ovulated?that never happens. Then this cycled I have felt crampy and bloated. Like I am going to start my period at any minute but do not.  I am expecting my next period in less than a week. But this cycle has been completely abnormal and nothing changed but getting the shot two days prior to it starting.

Patient notified this PCP&#39;s office with these symptoms on 4/13/21 at 10:28 at which time patient was referred to the hospital ER due to  6 known cases of women who had received Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and developed rare type of blood clots and patient&#39;s above symptoms to rule out deep vein thrombus. At the hospital ER provider did physical exam and ordered lab which confirmed patient had no deep vein thrombus. Patient was discharged home with diagnoses of left calf pain and dyspepsia. Patient continues to have abdominal intermittently but left calf pain has been resolved.

On Saturday (4/17/2021), the patient had &#34;the worst headache I have ever had&#34; along with severe inner left ear pain. Patient took an ibuprofen which helped with the pain for about an hour then the pain came back. Pain got worse 2 hours later when she drove home from work. She called the RN line and was told to take ibuprofen and follow up in the AM. The next day 4/18/2021, patient went to urgent care and received Toradol and was told it was a migraine. Today 4/20/21, patient still had pain and noted feeling left sided facial numbness and blurry vision that correlated with when she got the headache. Patient went to an urgent care today and CT scan revealed a blood clot. She was then sent to the ED for evaluation. In the ED, she has no headache and facial numbness and has minimal left ear pain. Her headache is localized to the left side of her head. Patient denies fever, chills, and COVID symptoms. Patient was started on argatroban drip per hematology recommendation.

I have experienced sinus pressure headaches as well. My legs and arms feel tingly and numb at times - more often my left side which is where I got injection. I feel weakness and fatigue most afternoons. My body didn&#39;t feel this way before the vaccine and it seems as though my body hasn&#39;t fully recovered from the shot and has flared up these symptoms. I feel all of a sudden that I have arthritis.

                                                Patient initially experienced muscle aches, fever, and headache for 3 days starting 1 day after vaccine -- within 3 days the muscle aches resolved, but then she continued to have severe headaches. The headaches became migraine like in quality with photosensitivity and a one-sided pounding that was debilitating and associated with nausea. The headaches respond to migraine treatment (Sumatriptan) started after the vaccine, but she has never had migraines before. The migraines continue almost every day until today, 4/27/2021. Due to the onset of new migraine-like headaches with no prior history, a workup and neurologic exam was done twice which was normal both times (see below). However, it seems significant that someone has new daily migraine headaches for longer than 3 weeks after the vaccine was given so we are reporting it.

                                                I was very ill on Friday night after receiving the vaccination. Flu-like symptoms, high fever, shortness of breath, pain in my abdomen, horrible headache, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness and leg pain (both legs). The flu-like symptoms passed on Saturday, but by Tuesday, April 13 I was continuing to have a terrible headache, abdominal pain and leg pain. I saw my primary doctor on the 13th and was sent over to the hospital for an ultrasound of my leg. No clots were found and I was told to continue trying to recover at home unless it got worse. I was seen at the emergency room on April 14th for abdominal pain, leg pain, dizziness and headache. The nurse told me I was probably hysterical over the vaccination being pulled, and I told him this was not the case. They performed CT (without contrast) on my abdomen and head, then released me with instructions to return if I was worse. By the 16th I was unable to walk as my left side was completely numb. I went back to the ER. I had a CT of my abdomen and head with and without contrast. I had a lumbar puncture and several labs. I was given IV antibiotics for some infection they found in my urine. I was given fluids and pain meds, and my BP was shooting up to 145/94 (which is very high for me), when standing. My vision was blurry and I was unable to remember much of the last week. I was admitted from the 16th through the 20th and had an MRV, 2 MRIs, more lab work and medicine for my headache. I was released on the 20th and the headache was unbearable and I was still numb on my left side, going back to my doctor on the 22nd. He suggested the ER, and the ER admitted me back to the stroke unit. I was released on the 22nd with a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine that could cause stroke-like symptoms (ZERO history of headaches previously). I was sent home with a walker and home health services. PT visited on April 30th and ordered two visits per week for the next month. I am unable to walk without a walker. I cannot shower or use the stairs without assistance. My memory is still foggy. I am unable to concentrate for long. I often stutter and can&#39;t remember basic words. I have also stopped and forgotten where I am at a given moment. I am on Depakote nightly for the headaches, and they have lessened slightly, but when they flare up it is debilitating and I often vomit. I have instructions to follow up with my primary tomorrow morning and see what the next steps are.

Two weeks ago, symptoms started again, including headaches and pain to Lt upper arm. No vision changes or neurological changes. Pain level at this time is zero.

I gave the vaccine and pt said she was okay. a couple minutes later she said she was feeling very warm and asked for something to fan herself with. I asked another pharmacist is get her a cold compress. When she came back with it and went to give it to the patient she fainted and slumped in her chair; she did not fall out of the chair. she was unconscious for less than 30 seconds and lost bladder control. I continued to rub her wrists and neck with the cold paper towel and she regained consciousness and said she was okay. we observed her for at least 20 minutes more and then she left. she said she did not require any further medical attention.

                                                Patient experienced sudden dizziness and nausea within 5 minutes of receiving Janssen COVID-19 immunization. Gave her water, crackers and cold/wet rags for her forehead as she felt hot. Took her temperature, returned normal. Gave her a trash can to keep near. Kept an eye on the patient and realized she was getting red in the face and more dizzy than she had been. Went out and stood next to patient, with her mom on her other side. Began to experience light sensitivity, feeling like the room was spinning. Patient almost fell out of the chair while sitting still. Mom used a personal pulse oximeter on patient, all results normal. Asked the patient about other symptoms, such as chest/abdominal/leg pain, headache, shortness of breath. Patient reported a headache, dizziness, nausea and leg numbness roughly 30 minutes following the vaccine. I recommended going to the ER, mom believed it would pass with time, but insisted she never responds this way to immunizations. Patient began to experience stabbing chest and abdominal pain around 45 minutes. Patient&#39;s mom was still hesitant to take her to the ER immediately on her own and asked us to call her PCP. He wanted the patient to go to the ER. Patient believed she would fall if she stood, offered to get a motorized cart, wheelchair or call an ambulance to transport her. Both patient and mom requested the ambulance. Asked a technician to check patient medications and allergies for EMTs, retook the patient&#39;s temperature which was normal again. Stayed with patient until EMTs arrived, reported all symptoms patient was experiencing.

                                                Patient was given her shot, she got up and sat down in the nearest observation chair, then immediately said she was dizzy and thought she was going to pass out. I went to her and she repeated that she was about to pass out. When her head started to roll back I was able to hold her by her shoulders. Her eyes rolled back and her head dropped back and she started convulsing. She lost consciousness for about 10 seconds. When she came to she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She was very sweaty by this time. I asked if she had a history of seizures or had ever fainted before and she answered no. EMS was called. I checked her BP and it was 84/41. The patient tried to stand to assist with finding her husband in the store but I told her she had to sit until EMS arrive. We offered her water and orange juice and she asked for both. When the husband got there we asked him if she has a history of fainting or seizures and he said this has happened multiple times, mostly as a result of seeing blood. He said she hasn&#39;t had seizures but she has had tremors when this has happened. I checked her BP again and it was 116/88. She was feeling a lot better. EMS arrived and she was stable by that point. They recommended that she go to the hospital, but patient opted not to go.

The only thing different in my body was the Janssen Vaccine. Midway through my IV I started itching, numbness in my fingers, lips, and feet. My face was on fire and my tongue was swelling and I could feel my throat closing. My arms turned red and blotchy and swelled. My nurse stopped the Benlysta and started Benadryl and a saline flush. The symptoms then went away.

Some days the swelling has been severe some days and less severe, but the swelling has never fully gone away in the last two months. The swelling can include the eyelid, the skin between the lid and the brow, and below the eye . The eyelid and skin near brow will often turn pink/purple. Beyond the swelling pain, no major main. Some pain on outer eye bone for both eyes.  The swelling seems to get worse when I  sleep longer or lay down horizontal.  When I go to sleep propped up, the swelling is less severe. Or, if I sleep for 7 or less hours, sometimes the swelling can be less.

Symptoms continued and I was seen at Urgent Care on 5/29 where they prescribed an antibiotic and steroid due to cellulitis at the site.  5/30 I began having headaches which have continued non-stop.  Hot flashes, chills, and neck soreness have gone away.  Fatigue, cellulitis at the site, and arm soreness have continued.  I&#39;ve had symptoms for 13 days. I saw my nurse practitioner due to headaches on 6/2 and was told to use heat and tylenol for headaches.

                                                A month after receiving my vaccine my menstrual cycle has not been the same. In April it was very light and I didnt have any breast tenderness and cramping that I normally get. And my cycle only lasted for 4 days instead of the normal 7. In May I still didn&#39;t get any of the normal breast tenderness. I did experience mild cramping throughout the month of May. My period was also late it came at the end of the month. My May period was also short it was 5 days. For the Month of June I didn&#39;t have a period at all. I had mild cramping that lasted for 2 weeks. The cramping started in the middle of June then stopped. And it came back at the end of June and then stopped.

I laid down for another 10 minutes while drinking water and I felt much better. Have general malaise for 4 hours now since the shot, but that seems standard. I was surprised I felt the effects  right away.

                                                About a week or two after receiving the vaccine, my period started getting heavier than usual. The next period was even heavier. My most recent period started on June 19th and got extremely heavy (1 pad per hour, heavy clotting) in the past two of three weeks. I had my Mirena IUD removed on June 27th, because I thought it was affecting my period. My period slowed for the 3 days it was out, then started heavy again after starting the mini pill. I was bleeding so heavy that I was dehydrated and hospitalized on July 9th. I was drinking a lot of water that day, but eventually threw up and felt like I was going to pass out. I had tingly and cold fingers and toes.  After stopping the mini pill that night, my period has slowed but not stopped.

                                                Had all side effects within 24 hours of vaccine- went to bed with a headache and chills, had body aches and slight nausea the next day. Then it all went away aside from some lingering arm pain.  A few days after the shot I had tingling and numbness in all 4 limbs. I also had random sharp pains in my right leg. I woke up Friday morning and my right arm felt like ice cold water was dripping down (but wasn?t). My husband took my blood pressure and it was really high and my chest felt tight. Given that the vaccine was just paused for blood clots we went to the ER. They ran labs and said I didn?t have any clots.  Here is the timeline of what happened after:  Saturday &amp; Sunday &amp; Monday: Felt normal again  Tuesday: Felt short of breath  Tingles started to come back  Wednesday: Leg and arm numbness   Thursday thru the next few days were the worst:  Thursday: Random sharp pains, back, thigh, ab  Right calf felt a bit swollen and more sensitive  Tingling on back of head Tingling in leg and arm  High anxiety pain in chest  No appetite High blood pressure   Friday: Muscle twitching in thigh, sides and random places  Random tightness/sharp pain in thigh  Blood pressure and heart rate went back to normal  High anxiety pain in chest before bed  Didn?t sleep well keep panicking awake (not normal) No appetite   Saturday: Right calf slightly swollen after walking around  Still had muscle twitches and it?s always in the same spot in my thigh   Did a teledoc appt which was totally unhelpful  High anxiety pain in chest- felt like I was going to pass out at one point and we took my blood pressure in that moment and it was high ?happened after dinner No appetite  Note: anxiety is not something I?ve ever had   Sunday: Swelling in leg returned Sharp pains randomly A little heavy to breath at times  Tension in my head ? felt cold After I ate dinner chest heaviness returned Sensory overload- watching tv couldn?t do. Sound of humidifier plus tv  gave me major anxiety. Turned humidifier off and it  instantly got better  No appetite   Next few days Leg feels numb tingly in morning  Slightly tingling in my right hand Light headache  Some random twitches and sharp pains in thigh still  The next month all seemed fine. It wasn?t until I got a small cold that the tingling flared up again. Right leg continues to be a problem-tingling and numbness comes and goes daily. I?ve also had a few episodes of chest tightness out of the blue.  Last night I woke up to find my right arm also tingly and numb.

                                                I received the vaccine at 9am on Saturday, March 6th. My arm was immediately very sore throughout the day. Around 9:30pm that night I began to feel nauseous. As the night progressed my symptoms got worse. I experienced intense chills and by 11pm had a 100 degree fever. Sunday, March 7th my fever had decreased, but I continued to feel nauseous and have chills throughout the day. Additionally I felt extremely fatigued, weak, and had a throbbing headache. Completing simple tasks were difficult and exhausting. Monday, March 8th I continue to experience significant fatigue, headache, and muscle weakness, but at less intensity. Also, my right arm where I received the injection is very sore. I have also been somewhat dizzy today. I have been taking Advil, drinking fluids, using an ice pack, and resting as much as I can as part of the treatment.

At around 9:00 PM I had chills, migraine, bodyaches, burning sensation in my joints, neck pain, and a low-grade fever. I took some Tylenol at around 7 PM. But the pain did not subside and I was able to use the bathroom the next day at around 4 AM and was still in severe pain. That day at around 1 PM I was able to set up and felt 30% better. On day two I am feeling better but I still have minor body aches I do get fatigue while doing light work around the house and no appetite and loss of taste is the newest symptom. I am not 100 percent better but close to it.

                                                The evening of injection day, I started feeling severe muscle and joint pain. It was comparable to a Fibromyalgia flare but worse. Walking and moving was severely painful. This morning I was still in severe pain. As of this afternoon, the pain is finally starting to subside. It felt as if my body was attacking itself as well as building up my immunity to Covid. OTC pain medication helped ease the pain, but only by a little.

                                                I had some sort of reaction to the vaccine about 1-2 minutes after receiving it, and it was super scary and they had to call the paramedics.   After the pharmacist injected me, I felt the arm pain right away. No big deal. I walked over to the chair to sit for my 15 minutes. I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it&#39;s working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn&#39;t hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now. But I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s some sort of reaction because I already had COVID-19.

When I woke up two hours later I was freezing cold and my body was very achy. I ended up sleeping the rest of the day and night.

Throughout the night it got worse and my body got very hot to the point where I had to sleep naked with fans on me. I?m lightly short of breath, exhausted, and am still having diarrhea now (Sat).

Once I came to my hand and arms were numb and tingling. I was sweating but cold. Ambulance was called and they took my vitals and blood sugar. Everything was normal. After about 10 mins I was able to stand and felt better after getting all of my color back. I have felt fine the rest of the day besides some fatigue and body aches.

I broke out into a cold sweat all over my body and could barely see anything or move my body and I felt very nauseous. I was nearly unconscious and barely able to talk. This lasted for about 20 minutes and then slowly started to recede after that. I felt able to stand after about 40 minutes, and was eventually able to walk out of the store and be driven home.   I am very very healthy and have no major medical conditions.

                                                Around 5.5 hours after I got the shot my blood sugar bottomed out. I had a hot flash, started sweating and my vision went blurry. I couldn?t walk 3 feet without having to sit with my head between my knees. I passed out in a 5 foot walk but luckily i sat down on my couch as it was happening. I?m not diabetic, haven?t ever been hypoglycemic. Ibuprofen and food after about 2 or 3 hours is a must.

                                                I received the J&amp;J one-dose vaccine on Thursday, April 8, at approx. 1600. Within an hour I had a mild headache and was nauseous. I went to sleep around 2130. At 0030 (or 30 minutes past midnight) I was awoken to the sudden shock of feeling very cold. My temperature was 91, within 15 minutes I spiked to 100 degrees, and then 15 minutes later I was at 102. I was shivering but felt like I was on fire. I had intense pain throughout my entire body. Internally and topically (skin) my entire body felt like it was on fire -- a burning sensation. Clothes -- even a soft hoodie -- felt like a steel wool scrubber was brushing against my skin and my skin was very hot to touch. I continued to feel nauseous.  After 90 minutes of this, I was able to take acetaminophen (2 x 500 mg). After another 90 minutes, my temperature dipped to 99 and the horrible pain mostly subsided.   From 0530 to 1830, in three-hour increments, my temperature continued to spike and fall between 99-101 degrees and the pain came in the same waves. Nausea continued. So, I continued an acetaminophen regimen throughout the day to help with the symptoms and took a few tums to help too.  After 1830, I felt very weak and tired. My temperature stabilized at normal. Nausea continued.   On Saturday, April 10, I was mostly just tired and had minor body aches/soreness. My shoulder bruised where I was vaccinated. Food did not sit well and my stomach was quick to turn.   Sunday, April 11, mostly back to normal. Although, still fatigued. No major side effects or symptoms.   Monday, April 12, seems to be the same as Sunday.   Note: I had COVID the first week of February 2021.

At 4:30pm I began to feel lethargic and by 7:00pm I had chills so severe that a heating tower, 2 blankets and a comforter did nothing to warm me. I pulled muscles in my neck and back because I could not stop shivering. Around 9:30pm the shivering stopped and I became extremely overheated - I took tylenol every 4 hours (which was all I could take because I am breastfeeding) and my temperature still reached 103.8 and I threw up several times throughout the night. My fever broke around 4am. I have had stomach pain every day since then and do not know when it will stop or what to do about it.

                                                4/8/21:  I receive the injection at 1:50pm on my left arm.  8pm: I begin experiencing normal side effects: soreness, body aches, and headache.  9pm: In addition to the soreness, body aches, and headache, I start having chills, which last on and off throughout the night. 4/9/21:  7am: I feel fatigued, with headache and body aches throughout the morning and afternoon. 3pm: I begin to have some itchiness on my forehead and both ears. My right knee cap feels hot and bruised, but there is no mark. 5pm: Visible hives appear on my forehead and right knee cap, and my ears are red. All of these spots are very itchy and uncomfortable.  9pm: The hives begin to be much more noticeable and itchier. I take one Benadryl before going to bed which helps the itchiness somewhat. 4/10/21  3:30am: I am woken up by pain in my ears and they have gotten incredible swollen, red, and hot. They are very tender to the touch. I take another tablet of Benadryl.  7am: There are more hives on my forehead and cheeks, as well as my knee and now on two of my fingers. A few spots also appear on my feet and on one toe. My ears are less swollen but still not back to normal, and they are still red, hot and tender.  9am: I have a video call with a Physician?s Assistant who determines it is most likely not an anaphylactic reaction (no swelling in my throat or eyes or any of the other red flag symptoms. I also take my blood pressure with a home monitor and it is normal). He prescribes me a steroid pack.  12pm: The hives begin to be less and less itchy and red.  8pm: The hives are almost completely gone, save for a few spots on my feet. As I am breastfeeding my 14-month-old daughter, I had waited to begin the steroid pack until after our last nursing session of the day (around 7:30pm). As the hives seemed to be going away on their own, I decide to not take the medication. I do take one dose of Zyrtec. 4/11/21:  7am: the hives are completely gone

The fever and chills lasted around 5 hours. The following day I was weak in my hands and joints were sore.   I am a breastfeeding mom and my son broke out in a rash the following day. He was brought to the doctor. No data to show a correlation though.

Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

Back started to hurt and couldn&#39;t get comfortable. Then the whole body started to ache. Quickly the whole body and skin hurt and food and drink tasted bad. Started becoming cold and had to wrap a blanket around. Went to bed and had to take Tylenol every four hours to sleep. Woke up and body aches and feeling cold continued the rest of the day. There was also nausea and headaches on and of the whole day. Went back to work the following day but felt heavily nauseous for most of the day and couldn&#39;t eat or drink much of the day.

Almost 24 hours later I?m still experiencing cold chills. I also developed full body aches to where my bones feel like they are breaking and weak. Around 10 PM I started vomiting and that lasted for a couple of hours. At 2 AM a headache started and is still going on as of 9:46 AM. My bones pop and feel weak.  At other times my body will become extremely hot and soaked in sweat just to go back to cold chills.

I couldn&#39;t stop crying I was so miserable and had to have my ex boyfriend come take care of me because I didnt have anyone else to, but it got so bad I was strongly considering going to the emergency room...I tried to sleep but my body was so restless. I took ibuprofen and it broke my fever but today I still feel achey and weak. I definitely wasn&#39;t expecting that because the guy that did mine said it&#39;s rare and if they do happen they are mild...I would consider my symptoms higher than mild. There  was nothing else that could caused it..everything was the same and the only different factor was the vaccine so I&#39;m 100% sure that it was the cause.

After administration of the vaccine she appeared relieved afterwards and recieved a card with a note to wait for 15 minutes for any reactions. Her mother escorted her to her car, 10 minutes later, her mother came in saying &#34;she&#39;s having a seizure!&#34; We had a certified nurse that was administering the shots that went out to check on her and we had a technician call 911. Patient appeared disoriented in the car and clammy to touch. We checked her blood pressure, and the nurse reported it was a little low. After paramedics arrived was being treated as a vaso-vagal response and she was transported to the nearby hospital.

The muscle pain and weakness was so bad I would loose balance when walking. I then started to menstruate clots, not my normal cycle timing,  which lasted about 2 days. The clots subsided but I am still bleeding today. I was in bed for 4 days with severe immune response symptoms. After those symptoms subsided the fatigue was so extreme it was hard to function.

                                                I was given the vaccine at 11:10am and by 5:30pm I was beginning to feel tired and unwell. At 6:45 I had a fever, body aches, pain in my arm, headache, and chest pain. These symptoms continued for three days and my fever reached 102.7.  After three days the fever and body aches subsided but the fatigue and chest pain continued. The chest pain has continued with increased heart rate during small bursts of activity. I called the clinic that administered my shot on April 9th and was told chest pain was normal up to 10 days and if it continued to be a problem to go to the ER. After 11 days of chest pain I went to the ER on April 13th and they did an EKG, CT with contrast, and blood work. They concluded I was fine. I was told it could be esophagitis so to take 2 15mg Prevacid a day which I have done with no relief. I was also informed it could be muscle related so I have iced, taken anti-inflammatory medication, and have not exerted myself.  It is now April 19th and I am still experiencing chest pain and racing heart rate with minimal exertion.

One the redness went down the injection site was hard and continues to feel as though there is a marble under my skin.  It&#39;s about the size of a Nickle and now bruised.    This might be normal but wanted to report it in the event that it&#39;s not.

I went to see my doctor six days after vaccination, and she did blood work which came back normal. I am still feeling fatigue after two weeks it is a constant feeling of tiredness.

Scheduled appointment.   4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     She has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   Patient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  Advised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   Today, patient presents states he feels &#34;a lot better&#34;. Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    She was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    Her mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   Phone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient&#39;s history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   I did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning for another state by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.

                                                During my menstrual cycle I usually have no symptoms other than tender breasts. So these symptoms were very unusual. Leg pains, pain and pressure in pelvis, clitoral pain, pain around vaginal opening, stinging like acid during urination that sent a shock through my entire body, uncontrollable bladder, nausea, large blood clots, lower stomach pain, flank pain, hot/cold chills, if I touch my belly button the pain radiated to my vagina, ovaries hurt, cervix pain, dryness, unable to get comfortable, crawling out of my skin, and constant urge to urinate, depression.  I landed myself in the ER where they told me to take Tylenol and Motrin and sent me on my way. These medications were not able to control the amount of pain I was in. I have now reached out to a couple specialists.

                                                4 days after the vaccine I started having periodic sharp pains in my uterus which made me think my period was coming. 6 days post vaccine I started bleeding lightly and the periodic sharp pains continued. 8 days post vaccine I woke up in the most excruciating pain of my life. It was the most severe menstrual type cramps I have ever experienced. I also had a severe headache which I never get. I took 600mg of ibuprofen. The pain continued for hours and I tried my best to breath through it. When I went to the restroom there was only a little blood but large amounts of fleshy tissue began discharging from me. Later that day when the tissue seemed to slow down the pain began to subside to a tolerable threshold (although still more severe than normal). I then began to bleed heavier than any other previous cycle. Normally I have a medium bleed for 2.5 days. This heavy bleeding lasted 6 days. I felt extremely dizzy and weak. Finally when the bleeding stopped I started to feel myself regain strength over the next few days although the sharp intermittent jabs of pain in my uterus lasted about three days after the bleeding stopped. I now am feeling back to normal and recovered. I never went to the ER but came very close to going during that time.

                                                Three days the vaccine I got very short of breath with confusion, dizziness and light headed and disoriented.  I felt like there was pressure in my chest and I had some brain fog. I felt like I had water in my lungs. My right arm bicep was contracting and twitching. I had Vertigo which made it very hard to sit down without feeling off balance. I was unable to drive. I tried to hope it would pass but I went to the ER on 4/14/2021. The dizziness was getting worse after five days and the pressure on my chest was unbearable. I was advised to drink some water and take Tylenol.  My blood pressure was lower than normal. I finally felt better on 4/21/2021. I could finally get out of bed and not feel like I was going to fall down. I could not drive for about two and a half weeks. I still feel a little out of breath and my brain is a little foggy but it has gotten a little better.

It&#39;s tiny now - I can still feel it but for the most part it&#39;s down to just a little lump. Went to   Urgent Care - about two weeks after the vaccine. Topical ointment was given to me and was told to take Benadryl. I took it for two days and then went to see the other doctor and he said that the ointment wouldn&#39;t do anything and it hadn&#39;t so I stopped taking the Benadryl and using the ointment. That doctor wrote down how big the lump was. It was a few cm around. His

The emotional effect lasted for three days but the fever and fatigue especially worse at night, it was present for a full week. I gradually felt better and after a week I felt fine.

The first week was basically fever, loss of appetitie and lack of energy.  By week 2 I started having headaches so I went to the healthcare facility and was prescibed Naprozen but it has been ongoing since.  I was diagnosed with a URI and was prescribed Mucinex which did help with the flim that I begin coughing up.  I have been struggling with my appetite and has noticed about a 5lb weight loss.  It is getting better but still not fully back to normal yet.

Her head fell backwards and husband saw this-he pushed her head forward and yelled for help.  When I got to the pt she was unconcious and unresponsive.  I tried to revive pt and she initially did not respond. We called 911.  I lifted her head and she started to gurgle and seemed like she was going to throw up.  She then came to.  When EMT arrived they checked vitals and blood sugar.  All was fine.  Pt refused any other help.  I spoke with pt today and she is fine

I visited my doctor and they assessed me visually. I was also getting Migraine headaches. I had ocular issues on the left side with the headaches which were a daily event. They were consistent for the whole day.  I went back the next day after being called and I went to the ER. My D-Dimer was elevated but my other tests were normal. I felt very bad, and I was having flashes of pain across my body. Those continued for four to five weeks. The Migraines also persisted during that time. Over the counter Tylenol and Advil did not work. A growth in my right thigh was discovered during that time. It was about the size of an Almond.  It was identified as a Hematoma. I feel better now after eight weeks and I am starting to work out again. I am scheduled for a follow up on the Hematoma in my thigh.

                                                My Rheumatologist suggested I report this:: I had no side effects other than a sore arm and some tiredness up until approx 6 hours after the injection. At approx 8:30 PM, I was lying in bed and both of my legs from the hips down started to shake violently. It did not feel like the chills as I was not cold and the rest of my body was unaffected. The shakes felt completely involuntary as if my brain was short circuiting. My legs shook so violently that my hip joints began to really hurt. Shaking lasted less than 30 minutes total. I am not sure what stopped the shaking, but I had tried to put my body weight over my legs  (body folded in half) to try to stop the shaking and took 1 regular strength tylenol.  After the shaking ended, up until I went to sleep (maybe 3-4 hours later) I felt some numbness and tingling in my finger tips and feet.  The next day, I felt fine but emailed my Rheumatologist to report the shaking and she directed me to report it here.

Body began to ache to the point I was in tears. Checked fever again and was at 99.9. Took more Tylenol and Ibuprophen and went to bed as much as I could. Woke up and took Tylenol the next morning. Checked temperature because I still had a pounding headache and was at 100.2, started sweating and shaking as in cold sweats. No appetite. Spent most of the day resting with most symptoms still accruing. On 3rd day I have no fever. I?m not as weak and I?m able to get around a lot better. Still a little nauseous but definitely feeling better then the previous days.

Intense started in early evening in upper arms and neck and spread through entire body.  Felt as if bones hurt.  In bed 10 hours but got little rest.  Chills and sweats.  Note that the pain is the exact same I had when I had COVID several months ago, which has flared up on and off since.  Next day symptoms are mostly gone, some tiredness and soreness remains.

The day after the injection I was exhausted, was nauseous and had a headache. 48 hours after injection I woke up with a strange headache. I could look to the right pain free, but if I looked to the left or left/up, I had a piercing pain near my right eye. Excedrin/Tylenol did not relieve this headache. On Hour 72, the headache is still present, though to a lesser degree.

My head feels like it is going to explode, it feels like there is so much pressure.  5pm-10:15am (Current time) - cough, scratchy throat, shortness of breath going up stairs, hot cold flashes, mild headache, still haven&#39;t felt hungry.

Was able to sleep until about 3:00 a.m., at which point I woke up to changing temperatures from hot to cold, headache and muscle aches. Most of the aching is occurring in my legs and arms. The back of my thighs are the worst, then my valga, and lastly my biceps and triceps. The headache is mild.

Hard to sleep that night because I was so achy. By the morning I had a fever of 99 (never went higher than that), headache, sore joints and muscles that lasted through the whole day/felt like a mild flu. Waking up on 3/28/21 (day two after shot) my low grade fever was gone and symptoms are mostly gone. Just a slightly sore arm.

Monitored for a total of 30 minutes, numbness spread through mouth yet did not progress further.  Dizziness upon standing.  No additional symptoms.  Healthcare providers noted that if any progression of symptoms occur to report to the emergency room, however, no additional care was needed.     8-10 days post vaccine severe stomach pains after each meal.  Possibly related to skipping dose of methotrexate.  Pain alleviated within hours once methotrexate injection was administered.  Discussed with rheumatologist at scheduled appointment.

First day after felt slightly better, still tired and slightly light headed. Second day symptoms worsened, feeling like I was going to pass out/faint, hot/cold chills, clammy, no fever, shortness of breath, culminating in numbness and tingling in arms, legs, then chest and then hands freezing up which resulted in a panic attack. Have never had a panic attack before. Emergency services called and after checking gave a sedative and went to the ER.

                                                I got the vaccine, then was asked (due to having previous allergic reaction to Levaquin in the past, I was asked to wait 30 minutes) I got up and walked a total of 30 feet to sit in a chair. I felt completely normal, up until this point. I sat down and began to text my Mother that I had just got the vaccine &amp; I was told to wait 30 minutes, at this point (2 mins in) I felt normal. I sat my phone down on my lap and was just looking about. I began at that point (2 1/2-3 mins mark) seeing the tile floor morph; the blue tiles and the green tiles kept merging together and forming one color. Then my heart raced, immediately and I started having hot flashes that shot out my ears. My heart raced even more and at that point I had realized something wasn?t right. A National Guards member came up to me and had asked if I were okay, I explained I was not and something was not right. They took me to a medical area and made me take deep breaths, and made me drink some water. My BP was high, and my Pulse Ox had dropped slightly, and then went straight back to normal once they had asked me to stick my head between my knees and keep breathing deeply. Also, both of my ears had turned deep red/purple and they were VERY warm to the touch. They felt as if heat were tunneling out of them. The only way I can explain truly how I felt, and I have NEVER done it fully, I felt as if I was fainting. Out of nowhere I felt as if I was going to pass out ? but it didn?t happen. The entire ?spell? lasted about 20 mins? I was monitored for an additional 40 minutes and was allowed to leave.

Patient was anxious even before administration.Patient came back to pharmacy drop off at about 7.20/7.22pm stating she was not feeling good. She was flushed, her face was pale, patient was alert and communicating. She was really dizzy, so I had her lay on the floor. Requested my technician to get get wet towels and wiped patient&#39;s face. Within 3-4 mins she was feeling much better. But still dizzy. Had her take a few sips of Gatorade and remain laying on the floor for about 45 mins

Felt a little nauseous immediately after shot. Flu symptoms came on around 10pm and lasted until about 5pm on 3/21/2021. Worst period of symptoms was overnight (about 12 hours.) Took 2 Tylenol 2-3 times while I was experiencing side effects which helped some with symptoms.  Had pain with injection and sore arm for about 48 hours after. It was a much more severe, deeper muscle pain than with other vaccines.

Pulled over and called 911 because I thought I was going to pass out and couldn?t breath normally. I was by myself.  Lasted about 3-5 minutes. I started to feel better while on the phone with 911 dispatcher. I was able to walk to the ambulance. Still felt a little woozy, but could breath fine. My chest got a little heavy while in back of ambulance, but not as severe. Was transported to ER.  Discharged same day Diagnosis- vaccine reaction; syncope near-vasovagal reaction

Several hours after injection body aches and extreme fatigue.  12 hours after injection restlessness, chills, sweats, body shaking that lasted for an hour.

Started with 800mg ibuprofen almost immediately after injection and onset of headache, and then continued to alternate 1000mg acetaminophen and 800mg ibuprofen for 48 hours after injection.

                                                Brain fog approximately one hour post vaccine. Approximately 4 hours after the vaccine, chills started, approximately one hour after chills (5PM) temperature began to rise. After taking temperature, it was 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Took tylenol to attempt to lower temperature, however it did not minimize temperature significantly. In addition to the fever, the onset of intense migraine and severe dizziness occured. Took a second dose of tylenol and the temperature did not reduce- and raised to 104.9 degrees fahrenheit. I was unable to sleep the night the vaccine was administered as my head was throbbing and spinning so intensely. I may have had an increased  heart rate- which likely prevented my body from being able to settle, despite other side effects. I also had loss of appetite due to fever, and was able to eat normally until approximately 2 days after the vaccine. The fever broke approximately 24 hours later, however fatigue set in afterwards and lasted through the following week (felt mostly normal the Thursday after receiving the shot 3/18/2021).

Then my whole body started to ache. By 5pm I was shaking from the chills and was very nauseous. By 6pm my entire body was in the worst pain I have ever felt. By 8pm it felt like all the bones in my legs were breaking. This all lasted through till Wednesday evening.

                                                My shot was around 12 noon. I didn&#39;t eat before so they gave me crackers and juice at the site. Afterwards I ate a real meal and two hours later I got dizzy. It was tolerable.  At 9:30 PM I got a fever. Then I felt pressure all over my body, pressing me down; I felt so heavy I could barely move. That&#39;s when my joints started to ache and I had piercing pain in my right knee and the bones in both hands. Then I got really dehydrated. No matter how much water I drank, it wasn&#39;t enough. Then I got chills, then a headache. It felt like I had sold my soul to Satan and he was sucking it out through my limbs, very slowly. I thought I might be an anomaly that died from a bad reaction. I tried to sleep so I wouldn&#39;t feel the pain anymore. That attempt took 3 hrs. The next day my migraine and joint soreness persisted. I felt so weak I didn&#39;t get up for hours. Thr second night I still felt unquenchingly dehydrated. Third day I only felt soreness in my arm from the actual shot.

Immediately after she had a syncopal episode and was unresponsive for about 1 minute. We immediately called 911, lay her flat and raised her legs. She became responsive and was alert and oriented X  3. We were unable to get a BP reading but her color was improving and she remained alert. We repositioned her in a supine position and she had another syncopal episode. We raised her legs again and she improved immediately. EMS arrived shortly after. She remained alert and responsive  and was evaluated for about an hour and released to her spouse. She didn&#39;t want to be evaluated at the hospital. She made record of having a similar episode during a procedure at her doctor&#39;s office.

My body felt very hot but I was still cold. Went to bed without taking any pain relief. I woke up at 2 AM, took Tylenol and went back to sleep. I woke up again at 3 AM, felt very hot and turned on my fan. When I woke up in the morning at 7:30 AM, my body still aches and I still had a headache. I took more Tylenol. Headache went away but for the rest of the day I felt very lethargic, a little foggy in my brain, slightly achy. I took Tylenol again when I went to bed at 9 PM and when I woke up at 4 AM the next morning I felt better. All symptoms are gone.

                                                approximately 5-6 hours after vaccination I developed a severe migraine that was unresponsive to tylenol and ibuprofen.  I had chills, body aches, and general malaise. The migaine remained severe throughout that night until around 5 AM the next morning when I took Tramadol which finally relieved the migraine which then became only a mild to moderate headache. I stayed on the tramadol for another 24 hours which during this time my additional symptoms were improving. By Monday morning (approximately 36 hours after receiving the vaccine) my clinical signs were almost completely resolved. After this there was only a mild headach and lethargy for an additional few days.

                                                I began (and continue to feel) tingles stemming from my elbow to my ring finger and pinky finger on my left hand. The feeling is similar to when you bump your funny bone, but more muted. The sensation began about 10-15 minutes after the injection. It is relieved with Aleve, but returns once the effects of the medication subside.

                                                After receiving the vaccine I went and sat in a chair for the 15 minutes following the vaccine. Approximately 4-5 minutes later I started feeling really hot. Then I started getting nauseous and dizzy. I tried to get up and walk to the pharmacy desk (vaccine occurred at pharmacy) but fainted midway there. I was out less than one minute and after sitting down and having some water and putting ice packs on my face I felt better. I have never in my life fainted before. I wasn?t nervous or scared to have the vaccine.   I followed up with my regular doctor on the Monday following the vaccine and had an EKG and bloodwork done all of which came back normal.

Symptoms I think are not part of the vaccine side effects include cough (mild mucus), sinus pain, stuff/runny nose (painful burning sensation when I blow my nose), some scratchiness in ears and throat, and loss of taste and smell. The last one (no taste/smell), is the most unusual, I&#39;v never had this before.

This was followed by headache, nausea, joint and muscle aches, and shaking from the chills.  I had difficulty sleeping overnight and the next morning, I had a fever of 101-degrees and was still very fatigued.  The symptoms all went away within 24 hours.

In the 5 minutes waiting for paramedics, the numbness spread to the right hand and up to the right elbow. Dizziness became intense. Once in the ambulance (5-10 minutes after onset), legs experienced light numbness, and chest tightness increased, with what felt like spasms / clenching of the heart muscle. Chills and out of body feeling occurred as well.   Paramedics examined heart, pulse, oxygen, with all being normal. IV was inserted and Ativan was given. After 10-15 minutes symptoms subsided.

Instead of beginning to wane, my period started to get extremely heavy and I started passing clots again about 24hr after the injection. On the night of 4/12 I passed an unusually large clot, roughly the size of a hockey puck and felt very faint and weak. I continued to bleed quite heavily until this morning (4/19), for a total of 14 days. I called my obgyn on Tuesday of last week to report the excessive bleeding and that my cervical lymph nodes had become so swollen that it was bothersome to swallow. My Dr said to go to ER if I experienced typical blood clot/PE symptoms and had received no guidance about the effects of this vaccine on menstruation.  I have had mild headaches, sore throat, mild fevers and fatigue as well since the injection

                                                I received the vaccine at about 9:30 AM. From about 8:00 pm - 8:45 pm I experienced a pattern of 30-90 seconds of normal vision, then 1-2 seconds of only being able to see light/colors/shapes (I had lasik in 2016, my prescription was -4.75, the 1-2 seconds of bad vision I experienced was like when I removed my glasses before having lasik correct my vision). This pattern of 30-90 seconds normal vision then 1-2 seconds of bad vision repeated for about 45 minutes. During this time I was also very dizzy and lightheaded.   My other side effects were as expected (fever of up to 102, chills, VERY sweaty, did not have energy to remove my sweatshirt when I was hot, headache).  I am only reporting this in case it is important/helpful for further studies/development of the vaccine and public health.

I had fever chills and aches within the first 24 hours after the vaccine. The body aches were there till Thursday. Once the body aches started subsiding, I felt the numbness and tingling in the legs on Thursday. Then it spread to my arms. Stays in the legs. Then I started feeling in back of arms and upper back. Certain things make it worse, laying and sitting is worse. Standing helps it. I have no swelling.  I have never had a reaction before to a vaccine.  No problems ambulating, no breathing problems, no wheezing.  I would also like a refill of my headache medication and inhaler today.

I also have Raynaud&#39;s and I do not know if that ties in to my symptoms at all.  My nipples have also been abnormally hard and sensitive.

I refused further medical care because I felt better once the ambulance arrived. I visited my primary care doctor on 4/13/2021 to follow up.  He said it was likely an occular migraine.  A blood test was ordered and results came back as essentially normal.  I have been continuing to have dizzy spells, headaches, blurry vision and light sensitivity. An MRI of my  brain and spinal cord has been ordered for 4/29 to rule out other conditions.

                                                Within about 2 hours, I felt really tired. A couple hours later I got body aches and tingling sensation on the left leg.  That night it got worse, hurt and some numbness. The following day I had abdominal pain and still had leg symptoms. On Saturday I needed up going to Urgent Care .  They did a Urine test, that was negative, but did see traces of blood but she wasn&#39;t concerned and did I send it our for a culture test. She sis an exam and a little concern because she wasn&#39;t aware of the side effects and ordered an ultra sound. She told me to take Tylenol and sent me home. I was still experiencing all everything the next day and developed a headache. The Urgent care Dr had called me the next day asked me to go in and get the Ultra sound.  They didn&#39;t find anything. I did have another ultra sound scheduled and had it done, I got the results and it was fine. She thinks the vaccine effected my nerves.  I also seen my Primary Physician because I had a fever as well, she did an exam and ordered Blood work and CT scan (abdomen). Everything came back normal.  My OCO believes it&#39;s my nerves as well. I believe it effected my mensural   cycle as well because it&#39;s earlier and heavier.

Called DR to speak with nurse about this as didn&#39;t feel normal to have this reaction, went into dr for appt on Tuesday, April 20. 10. Tuesday: Saw Dr.  at 7:30am about tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back. Possible reaction to vaccine or more? Took labs/blood work: Vitamin B-12 (82607), Folic Acid Serum (82746), CBC / Platelets &amp; Aut Diff (85025), TSH (Tyroid Timulating hormone) (84443), Metabolic Panel (80053), Quest blood draw (36415), Sed rate erythrocyte (85651) - ALL came back normal. 11.

Felt more like when your hand falls asleep and blood comes rushing back into it, thats how my legs felt this day, so more soreness than pain. 11. Friday: Symptoms same as the past 1 days, feel like tingling is getting a tad better.

It has been weeks and it is still very sore and a little swollen, which is right above where I received the injection. It is causing my shoulder to lock up, I cannot move it in certain direction or lift items at times. I have taken ibuprofen every day since then. I finally went to the doctor and they has me taking  2400 mg of prescription ibuprofen and on flexeril muscle relaxers for 2 weeks to see if I get any relief.

It wasn&#39;t especially severe and I figured it would go away.  It did. -- At 10 PM, just after dinner, I noticed my heart was racing, but I also felt tired at the same time.  Both hands were kind of numb feeling, but I&#39;d been laying on the right: I figured it&#39;d go away.  It didn&#39;t.  Heart racing and fatigue continued but right hand was noticeably pins &amp; needles.  Took a very hot shower around 11 PM and felt better, but right hand continues to be &#39;cold.&#39; -- Reporting this because I&#39;d never heard of any neurological(?) effects.  Probably just vaccine doing its thing and interacting with my slightly odd biochemistry.  Hopefully will be better in the morning!  ~ Also, an older member of the household received same lot of vaccine at same time: 0 side effects.

Woke up around 9:30pm with flu like symptoms, lethargic and didn&#39;t feel like I was able to move, but was not comfortable laying in bed. Got chilly shortly after waking up around 9:30 pm. Was able to feel warm with a hoodie, sweatpants, thick socks, and a blanket on.  Was not hungry but felt like eating was not a good idea. I didn&#39;t feel like I had the energy to eat. I was drinking water as I felt it was necessary. I went back to bed around 11:30pm and woke up the next morning feeling fine. My arm was sore for 2 days, afterwards, ached near the injection site, and when I used the upper arm muscles to move my arm. I&#39;m not sure after that because I was taking ibuprofen and Tylenol for cramps.

                                                That evening I had developed a pretty bad headache by that evening but it didn&#39;t go away. I went in to ER on April 19 for migraine because my that time news had come out to seek medical help and nothing was helping my migraine. They gave me via IV - migraine cocktail -  Pregnancy - I think I became pregnant right after the vaccine but I&#39;m not sure. I didn&#39;t know but at the time I was pregnant - and I&#39;m not pregnant anymore. I had a miscarriage about two weeks ago.  Now my headaches are gone. I&#39;ve also been put on between my pregnancy doctor and the two doctors at the hospital - steriod pack pills; Migraine cocktail at first ER; anti-inflammatories at second ER and then Primary Care Dr put me on Prescription nasal antihistamine/steroids  nasal spray and headaches have slowly stopped happening. (My allergies flared up majorly after getting the vaccine. I have) Follow up is still needed on both the head pain - need an MRI and follow up is still needed on the miscarriage - I may still need further medical intervention.   I have had two previous pregnancies - were abortions - both were confirmed to be fine before that. I was scheduled for my first sonogram for my pregnancy - I&#39;m estimating I was probably about 5 weeks.

Patient also stated that she had a bad headache. Directed patient to stay hydrated, use cool cloth/ice pack on arm, and to take Tylenol or Ibuprofen to help with pain and headache. When she called back and said those weren&#39;t helping we directed her to go to ER if she thought she needed to. She said she would try to hold out and see how she felt later.

My head would hurt and I always had some type of congestion and high bpm. When I received the shot, my congestion and runny nose dried up. It felt as if the shot was pulling something through my veins and drying up the congestion instantly and clearing up my head congestion as well.

                                                Within a couple hours after, I was super super tired and by 05:30 am in morning, I had severe chills and a fever - 102.5. I had severe body cramps in my legs. My legs hurt so bad I could hardly work. Through my telehealth with insurance they said to: Drink water and taking a fever reducer and if that didn&#39;t help to go to ER. I took Advil and I took that every couple of hours and that helped. They suggested ice packs on my legs and alternate with heat - I drank tons of water and slept a lot. The next day, in the morning, was when the symptoms went away. I had that fatigue for a week and a half. On April, 28, I called my doctor again. I have migraines (from before I have chronic migraines - they are agitated by allergies - and by vaccines or any medications ) and my allergies were really, really bad and were having migraines and I had fatigue. They suggested that I do a sauna and try to get talk to my my system to get in somewhat in a balance. Those symptoms have resolved for the most part.

                                                On May 2, 2021 I started to feel weird. I started to feel weepy and emotional. My body started twitching. I kept having involuntary movements in my legs, arms, and head. I went to the ER, and they told me I was having a panic attack. It happened again 2 days later. So I went back to the doctor but I just left because I waited for 5 hours in the waiting room. I am also twitching in my sleep. My doctor referred me to a neurologist for a MRI scan.

                                                The day within 10 minutes I started feeling hot and feverish. Then I started to feel lumping and cramping in my left breast and it persists and it turned in to nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. I also felt body cramping and both of breasts became extremely hard and was not comfortable. I also had muscle aches along with a mild fever for about a week. The pain was persistent. Then on day 2, the headaches started and I couldn&#39;t sleep because every time I moved the headache would cause me to vomit. So, I couldn&#39;t. My vision was blurry and I was not sure if it was due to the headache or the vaccine. I ended up going to the ER on 05/16/2021  for cramping in my left leg which was down by my ankle and was bruised. I&#39;m still experiencing heart palpitations, tiredness, cramps still happen in my breasts,  and there are still moments when my vision goes in and out.

                                                The vaccine overstimulated my thyroid, which produced chemicals, creating sever tachycardia producing 170 BPM&#39;s. When my bloodwork was tested, my thyroid levels were over doubled the limits. I also had high blood pressure. Four days after receiving the vaccine I went to the hospital because I was experiencing a fast heart rate, I was extremely shaky (to where I could hardly stand) and I was having trouble breathing. After multiple tests at the hospital, the conclusion is that I have to let all of the thyroid hormones leave my body. So, basically, I&#39;m just waiting.

                                                I got Johnson &amp; Johnson ?Janssen? on May 3. For reference, I have moderate to severe ME/CFS and vestibular migraine. I had COVID in December, was bedridden for two months, and almost recovered to baseline before the jab. Here?s my V timeline:  Day 1: May 3   Several mins after J&amp;J: Huge hot flash and vertigo spin that went away immediately   30 mins after: Felt drunk  Rest of evening: Extra sleepy  Day 2-3:  Extra dizziness and fatigue, mostly in bed. Definitely felt like I was fighting something.  Day 4: Vertigo attack.  Days 5-11: Felt better than I had since before having COVID! Less dizziness, more energy. My post-Covid symptoms such as orthostasis had greatly improved.? My resting heart rate was sometimes in the 70s!?  Day 12: ADVERSE EVENT: I felt like I got COVID all over again, but less severe. Nevertheless, my feeling of breathlessness was enough to send me to urgent care. I also had chest pain/heaviness, extra dizziness, and increased heart rate (117 resting). EKG at urgent care showed abnormalities similar to EKG I had in December when I first had Covid. So, I ended up in the emergency room. No clot or heart blockage. Doctor seemed to think either I was having a delayed reaction to the vaccine, or this was somehow Covid related.???  Day 13: Woke up feeling better until I had breakfast and had to poop. After doing that, I got so exhausted I landed back in bed all afternoon. This was another problem I had during Covid.? At least my resting heart rate was more normal, 98.  Day 14: ??Vertigo kicks in on top of everything else. Xanax is the only thing that helps my vertigo so I took that and was in bed all day.  Day 15: Didn?t sleep well but a little better.  Day 16: Chest pain and breathlessness are worse again. They got worse after I took a shower upon waking up.???  Day 51 (Today, 6/22/21): Chest pain and breathlessness are much better. Still have extra dizziness. Resting heart rate is usually between 88-100 now. Orthostasis has improved but not gone.

At the time she was doing light cardio exercise including jumping jacks and lunges.    On arrival stroke scale - 3 for facial palsy, left arm drift, and mild dysarthria. CT H  demonstrated hyperdense R MCA which corresponded with a filling defect in the R MCA (M2/M3 segment) c/w thrombosis; her CTa neck was normal and there were no e/o hemorrhage. Furthermore, this same CTa showed extensive bilateral PE. An extended stroke alert was called and she was given IV tenecteplase at 1250pm and underwent thrombectomy.   2 weeks ago (6/2) she was seen in clinic for sudden onset shortness of breath, thought at that time by that clinician to be most likely exercise-induced asthma vs less likely ACS. She was advised to use her already written albuterol and had follow up in 2 days (6/4). At that time it was noted she had more SOB with exercises and increased chest tightness that were both relieved with inhaler use.   She has a family history of strokes: Maternal uncle and maternal aunt strokes in their 40s Recent surgeries/immobility/travel: No surgeries, no more than a 2 hour car ride Smoking history: Dialy cannabis smoking but no tobacco smoking Age appropriate cancer screen: Yes  Family history of cancer: breast cancer in grandmother   Baseline functional status Full IADL&#39;s and A&amp;O x4.   At time of ICU consult, temp 98, BP 140/89, HR 88, RR 18.  Patient received: intraop NS, Versed, fentanyl, tenecteplase for thrombectomy Labs notable for All labs wnl  35 y.o female with no significant PMH on OCP presented with shortness of breath and slurred speech and LUE weakness found to have acute right M1 occlusion. She underwent thrombolysis with successful recanalization. Deficits resolved. She was also found bilateral PE and non occlusive DVT. Repeat imaging stable. TTE with evidence of small PFO. Today, she is feeling well, denies shortness of breath or new neurological complaints/deficits.    1. R MCA infarct s/p TNK and thrombectomy 6/14 with no residual deficits - secondary to paradoxical embolism. Appreciate neurology recommendations. Small PFO found on TTE, appreciate cardiology evaluation for closure.  2. Bilateral PE/non occlusive DVT - mildly elevated homocysteine level. Rest of hypercoagulable workup pending. Continue heparin gtt, transition to Pradaxa with Lovenox bridging.

My ears were swollen also developed redness, rash on my chest. I ordered Benadryl through delivery for what looked like hives to me. On 06-14-2021 I also developed new allergies that I did not have. My face swelled up and went numb, had tingling sensation to my hands. I went to see my PCP who referred me to an allergist doctor. I also had an allergic reaction to a skin care product that I use. I went to HCF to see a doctor who performed a physical exam. The doctor at the HCF felt my breasts which are so tender to touch, the doctor also could feel the swelling of my lymph nodes in my breasts and also my menstrual cycle is 6 days early this month. To this day the swelling in my lymph nodes are still present and painful. I still continue with fatigue, nausea as before but now I feel its more constant. I do not have my lot# to provide.

                                                48 hours post vaccination, knuckle pain in all fingers and at day &#43;14 pain/inflammation has not subsided.  Due to other rare side effects of Janssen vaccine, have avoided over the counter medications that may increase risk of blood clotting. However, have taken aspirin and/or tylenol during these 14 days and neither seems to assist in decreasing pain/inflammation.   Knuckles are not swollen but are sore/sometimes tender and painful to make a tight fist.   No physical injury occurred to any knuckles at or around the time of the vaccine, so the only connection to this pain/inflammation is the vaccine itself.

She reports feeling well when she developed scalp itching which progressed to diffuse intermittent hives and angioedema 2 days after receiving Covid J&amp;J vaccination. She has been taking oral steroids, antihistames and h2 blocker for weeks. She reports no improvement in symptoms with these interventions. She also reports itching, but this has progressed to burning and stinging skin. She notes her palms and soles have been sore, and have purplish blotches. Evaluation in the ER was non revealing for a cause but as the patient has been so miserable, admission was recommended for IV treatment. Currently she is standing in her room,

                                                Starting about a week after vaccination started to see unexplained bruising on extremities, then a few days later (about a week and a half after vaccination) an unexplained spontaneous hematoma appeared on right arm (vaccination was given in left arm). The hematoma grew to about 3 inches in diameter, pain and swelling associated.  Later that evening stiff neck and sharp in point headache appeared. The headache would last maybe around 10-45 seconds and then would dissipate. Headaches were sharp and frequent but did seem to resolve overnight.

While driving home my muscles seem to shut down. My face was numb I couldn?t move my hands or my legs to drive. I had to pull over on the highway for 20min until my hands legs and face regained mobility.

It felt like a muscle spasm or like electricity was being pulsed through my body. First it would happen in one leg, and then the leg would curl up under my body. Then it would spasm in my chest and my arms would be drawn inward. Then the other leg, or sometime multiple locations at once. I didn&#39;t feel cold at the time. This lasted for 40 minutes total. I took 1000 mg Acetaminophen at  3:00 am.  Then, as the shaking lessened, I became very cold. I put on lots of clothes and laid on a heating pad under my comforter. Sometime later, I became very hot. Throughout the night into the morning, I felt feverish and chilled back and forth. At 6:00 am I took 200 mg Ibuprofen. I then spent the rest of the day with fever, chills, and body aches. Everything was achy and I was very tired. I slept well that night. The next day I was fatigued.

They eventually after monitoring me for awhile sent me down to ER, by then my voice was raspy and scratchy, my lower lip was big, my tongue still felt big. I still felt nauseous. The dr asked me if my eyes are usually swollen and red and I said no. My extremities were still numb and tingling. I got epi and other drugs, zofran, benadryl, pepcid, I think a dose of steroids. The symptoms continued so I ended up getting a 2nd dose of epi. I went home around 5pm. When I woke up that evening to do a neb treatment I was nauseous, my lower lip again big, my tongue felt thick and this time my upper throat felt swollen, I gave myself epi and took myself to ER, they monitored me for 3 hrs the dr was gonna hospitalize me if I got worse, I still felt nauseous and the numbness and tingling feeling in my hands and feet when I left but was not having any airway issues when I left. Not sure if the numbness/tingly is gonna go away in my hands and feet.

Soon they started again and I piled on a weighted blanket to get them to calm down and eventually fell asleep. I also had a lot of head heaviness and pressure during this time. The next morning I woke up with body aches from all the tensing up and felt week and still had head pressure. By midday I was back to normal. Still some injection site soreness and swelling her today, Monday 3/15.

                                                started with drowsiness and no appetite, chills came on but nothing serious but within 1 hour the chills became very intense and I couldnt  warm up or take it. I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

                                                I had the usual symptoms of a vaccine reaction like extreme muscle pain in my upper back/neck, chills, and fatigue.  But then on Monday I noticed a very tender left armpit, and I also have very itchy eyes, something I never have.  I also developed a small purple patch on my leg, and a little skin sore on my left arm.  It looks like more may be developing.

The technician held the pt up and supported her head and neck while asking pt if she was OK.  When pt came to she was happy and said &#34;hi&#34; to the technician.  Soon after she laid on the floor and started crying and saying her hands were cramping and in pain.  She also stated she was very nauseous and felt like she was going to throw up.  Pts husband agreed that we should call an ambulance which we did.  When paramedics arrived pt was feeling better and refused a ride to the ER.  Pt&#39;s husband took her to the car and drove her to the ER.

A few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient walked up to the counter and said she wasn&#39;t feeling well.  When I went over she said she was really lightheaded and was sweating and felt like she was going to faint.  I had her lay on the floor and elevate her feet.  I put an ice pack on her forehead.  She never lost consciousness and felt better after a few minutes. She eventually sat back up and stayed in the waiting area for a while longer to be monitored.  She did state that she felt a cold rush in her chest right before she became lightheaded. She ended up feeling fine and went home.

I got hot and sweaty and horrible tunnel vision, I almost fainted. I laid down on one of their medical beds to recover while the sweet nurse fanned me.  I was observed over 30 min before leaving.  I woke up yesterday and felt weird along with bodyaches, chills, joint pains, random stinging sensations throughout my body (almost like a pen prick), sporadic short headaches and muscle cramps.  I left work yesterday and didn?t even go in today.

I went to bed and had difficulty sleeping because I felt so hot. When I woke up the next day, I had a fever of 99.7. I took Tylonol, but still had body aches, chills, a headache, fatigue and some nausea, as well. I slept most of the day, ate bland foods and continued to take Tylonol every 4-5 hours. I began to feel better around 6pm the day after the shot.

                                                Received vaccine at noon. Injection site pain was manageable. Started to feel tired around 4pm and took 500mg Tylenol. Took an Epsom salt bath at 6:30pm. At 8pm got hit with chills, fever of 100F, entire neck and back started to ache and have pain, mild headache, and both hands and fingers felt weak and had a burning sensation. Took another 500mg Tylenol then laid down and fell asleep around 9pm. Woke up at 11pm drenched in sweat with same symptoms. Changed into dry clothes and woke up again around 3am drenched in sweat again, but fever was gone. Woke up on April 9 feeling lethargic, a tire body was achy and sore and had a headache. Fever never came back and the weakness and burnings ends ruin in hands was gone as were the chills. Throughout the day I rested and had physical therapy to loosen my muscles in my neck and back. By the end of the day I still had a headache and sore back and neck. Woke up on Sunday april 10 and back achy ness is tolerable, headache is still present, but manageable. Took 600 mg Advil in morning.

I stabilized her and directed my staff to call 911 and store management. Within 15 seconds of its inception, she regained consciousness. We ended the phone call for next level care. We gave the patient an ice pack for her neck and a bottle of water. Once aware again, she mentioned that she hadn&#39;t eaten anything today. We got her a candy bar as well. Within 20 minutes, she was able to walk out of the store under her own power.

Still have the rash and itches off and on. Cannot wash hands with warm/hot water because it burns, Part of my hand felt slightly swollen yesterday and skin is sensitive, feels chapped.

                                                I have a 9 month old daughter. I breastfeed her on a regular basis, every 4-5 hours. Twelve hours after receiving the vaccine along with the usual expected side effects -- fever and chills - I experienced a decrease in milk supply. My daughter was latched on the right breast and then on the left for a total of 15 minutes, there was no let down and no milk was flowing (I was intently listening and she was not swallowing which means no milk was coming out of either breast), let down usually happens after 2 minutes for me. The milk returned the following feeding, about 2 hours later although the let down took longer- about 10 minutes after she was latched on, and there was definitely less milk because my breasts were not full and at this point after 9 hours of no breastfeeding my breasts would have been very full and I would be experiencing some pain because of the fullness. My breastmilk supply is back to normal now.

                                                I got the vaccine at 4pm at the pharmacy where I work. I had no symptoms except for very mild local injection discomfort but was able to do my usual normal activities. At 2 am that evening, I woke up with  a lot of pain in my legs, I felt they were so heavy to move around in bed. My lower back was extremely painful too, I tried to stand up to walk a bit, the pain was very severe and I couldn?t stand straight, it was very hard to drag my feet, they felt very heavy and my muscled were painful to the touch even. So went back to bed, and was in agony. I had to go to work in the morning to open the store I work at until they find me coverage. Driving was very hard with my painful legs. J reached the store and I was walking very slowly, I couldn?t have a full control over my legs, they were painful waist down, and felt very heavy, when I sat down my muscles were painful wherever pressure was applied to them (from the chair).  Lightheadedness: I felt lightheaded when I woke up from bed at night to try to walk and ease the pain. So decided to go back to bed to prevent falls. At work, while walking and sitting, I had episodes of very light headidness and sat often on the floor and lifted my legs. Measured my blood pressure on 3 occasions it was 90/50  then 100/50 then 110/60. One time only I fainted where my colleagues put me down and lifted my legs.  At 8am (morning of 3/9/20201) I had a feeling of  heavy breathing. Needed to take deep breath as if my lung muscles were tired and needed to take deep breath to fill them with enough air. At work and because of the increased intensity of muscles pain, I started to breath faster and deeper coz I was in agony   Headache: severe and excruciating headache started from 6am to 12pm on 3/9/21.   Throughout the symptoms, I refused to take medications to let the vaccine run its course. My family drove me back from work coz I was weak and lightheaded and in severe pain at 10.30am. Came home, took one Advil 200mg at 11am. I was completely pain free  at 12pm. Lungs still felt weak, needed to breath deeper for two days but then got better.

It lasted about 24 hours. LEG PAIN:  About 5 hours after my vaccine, both legs were very sore/painful.  Both legs have been sore every day since the vaccine. Pain/discomfort is worse in both calves than in upper leg. Pain/discomfort is least in the morning when I wake up. It gets worse throughout the day and with movement.  After 15 minute walk, my calves are tingling/crampy. I get some relief by laying down and putting my legs up the wall.

But then by Tuesday (4/6) of the next week I started feeling pain in my right arm and then sometimes I would get the sensation of it falling asleep.  I havent felt that sensation anymore since Sunday (4/11).  By Friday (4/9) I started feeling pressure in my chest in the mornings.  I have been having these two discomforts till today.  Yesterday was the worst feeling it was morning and then all of a sudden everything went white and I was about to faint then my heart started racing so fast.  I have never experienced any of these symptoms in my life.  I am not a person that gets sick or is sick of something.

                                                Felt fine at time of shot, a little achy afterwards but nothing concerning. My legs ached some a few days after but got better. About 3 days ago I started getting a major headache on the right side that also arrived with blurry vision, mental fog and mild dizziness. Nausea yesterday and today except the headache was much worse. I cried from the pain and this is when I became more concerned. My eyes, mainly the right side and a pressure in my sinuses were very difficult to bare with, subsided some with multiple doses of ibuprofen and Advil sinus but not by much. The headache is unbearable, painful to stand out bend over or move.

                                                On March 13th, 2021 I was given the opportunity to receive the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid 19 vaccine so I decided to go ahead and get vaccinated.  Within 1.5 hours of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel unwell. It started with my left leg going numb. From there symptoms continued to increase. I got very tired could hardly stay awake. Then the chills hit. I could not get warm.  By the next morning (Sunday day 2) I had developed a low fever, headache, body aches and whole body weakness. I could still hardly stay awake still. When I was awake, I was very dizzy and I felt like everything around me was moving but I was not. My left leg still felt numb but I thought it would pass on its own.. Because of how I felt, I just laid around and rested. My injection site was swollen, Red and extremely hot to touch.  Next comes Monday (day 3), I got up that morning, still not feeling well. I made my way to work. That did not go well. The more I moved, the worse I felt. I was completely unbalanced and looked like I was drunk. I couldn&#39;t walk straight, I had to randomly grab onto chairs and sit down. I was feeling weaker by the minute. I left work at that point and went to see my primary physician that afternoon. At this point I could see straight to drive myself, could hardly walk as my left leg now dragged. I had no balance and having lots of dizzy spells at this point. He suggested I head to th ER but eventually decided we could wait until morning to see if things improved at all. If no improvement,  I was to go to ER. Tuesday Morning (day 4), my husband took me to the emergency room. I had reached the point of not being able to walk unassisted. At this point, the weakness and numbness I had on my left, had spread to my right side. We had no idea what was happening. We got right in and discussed what was going on. What lead up to me being there, etc. The ER ran blood work, xrays of my chest and 3 different MRIs trying to figure out if something happened like a stroke. NOTHING was present on any test they did yet there was something obviously wrong with me. My arm was still very Red and hot.. I had developed a lump in my arm where the vaccine was given. After ruling out everything the doctor could think of, he consulted with the on call neurologist since it was obvious to him something was happening with my neurological system. The diagnosis...my body was taking the vaccine as a toxin causing my neurological system to react and shut down. They felt that I should be starting feel better in the next few days as the vaccine settles into my system. I was told to follow up with a neurologist and my primary. I was then discharged from the hospital in the condition I had arrived.  Wednesday (day 5) I spent the day at home, not able to do anything. I napped most of the day. I still felt like crap and had no idea when I would start feeling better. No improvement that day.  Thursday (day 6) I woke up feeling a bit better. My right side was beginning to feel normal again but I was still feeling weak and unbalanced. This is also the day I meet with a neurologist to follow up. I don&#39;t know that this appointment had accomplished much as she didn&#39;t have access to all my medical records. She ended up prescribing me a medication to help with nerve pain I was having in my left side and referred me to do physical therapy. I am to follow up in 2 months.  Friday (day 7) my right side is back to pre-vaccine stage. My left is not. I feel pretty good except the occasional dizzy spell and the fact my left isn&#39;t working yet.  Day 8 and beyond...I&#39;m feeling ok. I went back to work but still have issues with my left side and residual dizzy spells. I began physical therapy 2 days a week to work on strengthening my left side however it has yet to help.  I am now just over 4 weeks post covid vaccine. I am now using a cane to help me walk as my left side has still not returned to normal. It is unknown if it will. I&#39;m in Physical therapy 2x a week still. The lump at injection site is now the size of a pea. I still have moments of unbalanced feeling and dizzy spells.

I felt weak with chills.  This began the consecutive 7 day cycle of fever, chills, and sweats.  During this time, my fever would range from 101.1 to 103.  After taking two extra strength tylenol it would come down but then go back up before the 6 hour mark to take the next dose.   The chills were the worst of the symptoms as they were full body spasms curling me into the fetal position.   As the Tylenol would kick in, the chills and fever would subside and I would begin to sweat. This was a full body sweat that soaked my clothing and bedding.

On the left leg I had leg cramps - that would came and go,  I slept a lot the whole day  - in the evening I became feverish but not bad. Those symptoms were gone after 24 hours. The rash I had on my back became worse the day of the shot. Rash continued to get worse - I went to the doctor because it was itchy and annoying - dr- 14th of April  - did a biopsy  - I have an appt on Monday to talk about it. My rash is gone now. Treatment: I took Ibuprofen for the symptoms that I had the next day after the vaccine. Cream for the rash: Clobetasol Propionate

                                                Patient had a reaction immediately after the JJ vaccine. Patient passed out for 10-15seconds, her body stiffened up, she felt hot and then cold and started sweating excessively. Patients eyes closed briefly and then opened. Patient then became conscious and was unware what had happened.  Patient is not on any medication and had not eaten all morning. After administering the vaccine a small amount of blood came out. I gave her a cotton ball to apply on the area and to hold. After 20-30 seconds she said she felt faint and hot all of a sudden. Her body then went limp and her eyes began to close. Her body then stiffened up for a few seconds. After shouting her name a few times she regained consciousness and was able to talk. she didn&#39;t realize what had happened. Her body was fine again but she had urinated during the episode.  Upon speaking to the patient I learnt that she was nervous about the vaccination and she had felt dizzy in the past when giving blood. I observed the patient over the next 45 minutes. Her speech was fine, she was still a little light headed. She was in her seat for 40 minutes, then I asked her to stand and to move a little to see how she was. She was able to walk a bit but then sat down as she still felt light headed. She than sipped on water and continued talking and seemed to get some energy back.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was told that my arm might be sore. I felt sore right away and as soon as I got in the car to drive home I was extremely tired and I slept for the entire six hour car ride home. I was very fatigued that night and then I got a bad headache, fever and it lasted for 48 hours. After that, the headache was less intense and they were intermittent but my arm still hurt and I couldn&#39;t lay on it. I was still fatigued for a week. On the fourth day I started to get a weird feeling of vibrations and twitching all over my body. It is especially worse in my temple. It has been a month but I still get the twitching in different parts of my body. My face, arms, legs and temples. It is in different places. It happens less often now, it is not all day but it is still daily and mostly in my head and my legs. I had it happen in my temples last night.  I had my menstrual cycle since the vaccine and it was about three days later than expected. I had a lot of blood clots which was unusual for me. I have had flu like symptoms this week and I have a cough, runny nose and headaches but I am planning on trying to go to the doctor this week.

                                                Over the week after my shot I started to get a headache which isn?t abnormal for me but by Sunday April 18 I was having the worst headache I have ever had in my life. II was bed ridden and in tears and unable to function. I went to the ER to make sure I was not having the blood clot issue seen after some j&amp;j shots. I was not having one they said and I was sent home to have further testing done and visit a neurologist. By Tuesday April 20 I began having neurological symptoms such as pain and numbness in my left side. I feared I was having a stroke so I went back to the Er where I was admitted and they ran many tests including multiple brain MRI. They found nothing and said that I was having a complex migraine. I saw a neurologist shortly after my hospital visit and he has been treating my headache with gabapentin and fiorecet for emergency medication.  The whole duration of symptoms lasted weeks after my shot and I still struggle with this headache episode today.

                                                I was taking a shower the night of 04/28/21 and I had a bad pain in my right leg. It felt like it could be a blood clot. The area was swollen and I was in a lot of pain. My blood pressure started getting high and it kept going up. On the way to the hospital, I started getting a headache and shortness of breath. I tried to elevate my leg on the way there. I took an aspirin. I had to sit in the waiting room for 2 1/2 hours and my pain in my leg and headache continued. Once I was taken back, they ran a few tests. I was told that my D-Dimer was elevated which indicates a blood clot. I was checked for a pulmonary embolism and that was negative. I was given a blood thinner because an ultrasound technician was not on duty. I went home at 4 am. I went back for an ultrasound the next day for my entire leg. Everything came back normal. The pain slowly went away.

Had a CT Scan and Venus Doppler- all came back clear. I still have pain in rib area where I feel like a pulled something. I am afraid to exercise, I still have pain in back and side. Will follow up with one more d dimer then hematologist if still elevated.

Arm soreness was worse and was now affecting my whole right arm and not just injection site. Hurt to move right arm any at all and chest felt like an elephant was sitting on it. Fever at 6am was at 102.5 F. Treated pain and fever with Tylenol. Temp went down to 101.9 at next check. Continued running a fever all day, shifting from sweating to shivering and being cold. Was very tired and stayed in bed most of the day.  Temp was down to 100.5 when went to bed. Arm is still sore today and woke up covered in sweat. Temp was at 99.9. Still very tired but chest tightness has gone down.

I become overheated and had to sit down and fan myself from fainting. After 20 minutes, I was able to drive home. That evening, I wasn&#39;t able to sleep. My entire body was in severe pain, had a bad headache, and sweated through the sheets. The following day at work, I ran a low grade fever, was pale and felt like I didn&#39;t sleep for weeks. Ran a low grade fever all day. The following day, I took off work and tried to rest. On Friday morning, experienced chest pains. Took Ibuprofen and it subsided. Still have pain in left arm.

I tested positive for COVID-19 on June 15th with worsening symptoms, however, mild respiratory issues. I began having issues with double vision on June 17th and contacted the emergency nurse hotline on June 18th as I had lost the ability to walk/stand, experienced waves of paralysis, numbness in hands and feet, rapid heart rate, and vision and hearing impairment. I was directed to the ER by the on-call Dr to test for possible encephalitis and have an EKG. I was discharged after a few hours. These symptoms align with Guillain-Barre Syndrome, however, I did not receive a spinal tap to confirm.

                                                I started getting fatigued and achy around 5 pm. By 6 pm I started to feel chilled and a fever began to form. By 6:30 or so I was shaking intensely and my fever was climbing quickly. By 8 pm I had a fever of 102.7 F. I took two Advil around 7 pm. My fever stayed that high for less than an hour, but it stayed at around 101.5 throughout the night. When I wok up at 6:30 it was still over 101. It took until early afternoon to go all the way back down to my normal temperature of 97.6 (that has been my normal temperature throughout the pandemic). I had a pounding headache throughout the night (with a fever) and for most of the next day. Today, on the 3/8, I will have some joint and muscle achiness. The most intense aching was in my hips and low back. FYI, I am marking that I have recovered from my adverse reaction in the field below because I am considering the high fever and intense headache and bod aches to have been the adverse reaction. My mild aching right now would not have been worth reporting.

                                                I got the shot Saturday afternoon. My side effects started around 9:30 with chills?I just couldn?t get warm. I drifted off to sleep all right around 10:30, but by midnight, my legs were on fire like I?d just run a marathon. I?m pretty sure I had a fever because I was sweating and tossing and turning for what seemed like hours. By 4:00, I had a massive headache and felt like I was going to throw up. I took Advil and Zofran at 4 and went back to bed. Sunday I still battled headache, aches, and fatigue. The fatigue is what&#39;s still lingering yesterday and today.

I started getting very cold and shaking around 10:00 PM. My finger nails and lips started getting pale and my temperature started rising. The shaking stopped around 12:15 AM, but my fever continued as high as 101.4 throughout the night and into the morning. I continued taking Tylenol and the fever went away the morning of 3/12/21, but slight chills returned around noon that did not last long. I took more Tylenol that evening for a headache and noticed I had an on and off throbbing pain in my right ear.

                                                Janssen COVID-10 Vaccine EUA  About 5- 10 minutes after the vaccine, I started getting numbness in my left hand and my ears began getting hot. By the 25 minute mark, I noticed numbness in my cheeks, around my mouth and my forehead. I turned around and went back to the Health Department for observation. I sat with a nurse until I passed the hour mark for after the vaccine had been given. By that point, the numbness was gone around my mouth and forehead, but the numbness remained in my cheeks and they were visibly red where they were numb. At this point, I left the health department because my symptoms were getting better. It took about 2.5 hours for the numbness to gone in my cheeks.

                                                I felt okay until about 9pm last night when I started experiencing an intense headache, then I got chills, then feverish feeling and really hot, then nauseous and couldn?t handle eating. I put an ice pack on my head because it feels swollen and there?s a lot of pressure that it?s painful. This morning I tried to eat crackers so I could take ibuprofen but I threw up immediately. I?m currently still experiencing a lot of head pain/ache and nausea and muscle tightness.

                                                04/02/21 12:45 pm ? At approximately 12:45 pm I was called to vaccine tent #1 after reports from staff that a patient was feeling sick after receiving her Janssen injection. I discovered the patient slumped in her chair, head back with eyes closed, skin clammy and cool. Alert and oriented x3, speaking slowly but clearly. Per vaccine nurse, she administered the Janssen injection to patient at 12:41 pm  (Lot 1805020, exp 5/25/2021, Left Deltoid) and a few minutes later the patient started to close her eyes and leaned back in chair requiring assistance to sit up.  Nurse was able to stabilize patient in chair and then called for help and that is when I came to assist. Patient remained in this state for several more minutes. Activated EMS for further evaluation as patient did not stabilize immediately. Measured vital signs ? Blood Pressure 98/62, O2SAT 97, Pulse 68.  I continued to monitor the patient until EMS arrived. EMS evaluated patient and cleared but advised to continue to monitor for an additional 15 minutes before leaving the site. Patient verbalized understanding and agreed with plan. Patient remained in observation for an additional 15 minutes with no incident.

                                                I went to a community event (held at a church) for the COVID vaccine. After the vaccine, I wanted the 15 minutes and felt ok - just hot. I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

Patient then ate a snickers bar in her purse and felt better, stating she must have felt uneasy because she had not eaten and was also a bit anxious after getting her shot. Patient walked out of the pharmacy at the end of her observation period saying she felt fine and was going home. Upon calling the patient 12 hours later on her cell to see how she was doing, the patient said she was fine, and no change since she left the pharmacy this morning.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

I also got dizzy and lightheaded. The girl in the car next to me had waved over one of the attendants as well because she was feeling weird too. I got home and had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had and felt flu like symptoms and very weak. The next day at work I was so sick I had to go home. I was puking and had diarrhea  over and over for a few hours. I also felt lightheaded and dizzy and weak. Also had the headache. I was getting chills as well once I got home. Today I just feel very weak and just &#34;off&#34;.

She was told to sit down for further observation and given a bottle of water.  About 5 minutes later, she said she was still feeling really bad.  She said she was not thinking clearly and didn&#39;t feel right. She was also experiencing moderate pain down her spine.  She said her thinking was so affected that she wanted to seek treatment.   Patient declined offer to call EMS, and proceeded to an urgent care clinic next door.  Urgent care later called the pharmacy to inform us that patient had been transported to the hospital by ambulance.

                                                Later in the evening after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I developed a 103 degree fever, severe chills, headache, fatigue, and mild nausea/upset stomach.  I tried to hold off for a bit from taking any pain relievers, but did take tylenol about halfway through the night which helped quite a bit. The next day I only had a low grade fever, fatigue and minor stomach upset. I also had some arm pain starting that evening post vaccination and it lasted for about 5 days. I felt mostly fine though within a couple days. I am one week post vaccination and currently feel pretty good. I have been sleeping heavier/more this week but I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s related or not.

Administered the vaccine, gave the patient and her timer, she sat down to be observed. Before her 15 min. was up, she said she was clammy, hot and felt faint. We offered to call an ambulance. She did not want one.  We layed her down in the floor, with legs elevated, took her bp 117/73 (normal), but she was hot. Got her a cold pack and she placed it on her forehead. She layed in the floor for several minutes, but said the cold pack made her feel much better. Waited, we asked her to sit up, took bp again, it was 117/75, she felt better and wanted to go home. Her husband was with her, he drove her home.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Directly after the shot I felt arm pain. At 6:30pm I began to have uterine/abdominal cramping, vaginal pain, lower back pain. At 7:30 I began to feel extremely overheated and a little fatigued. At 9:00pm I felt chills, extreme fatigue, all over body ache and joint pain. At about 2:00 am overnight I again felt extremely overheated. The following morning I continued to feel fatigue, abnormal temperature swings, body ache and joint pain. This lasted until night (about 30/36 hours after the injection). About 48 hours after the injection, I felt some dizziness and abdominal upset.

Noticed  a bit of a red rash on back that looked like &#34;pimples&#34;. Two days later noticed red streak under left armpit and painful to touch along with some swelling.  (not sure if this is still there) Did not miss work due to these side effects.

I have never experienced a hormonal change the way I did when my period began. This would have been the first cycle after receiving the vaccine. The first day it started, (4/9/21), I felt like I was having a panic attack, anxiety attack or something similar. Now, I do not actually know what these attacks feel like, I am just stating that I assume this is what it feels like. I was not able to focus, felt like I was freaking out, almost as if I had taken some sort of pill that sped up my heart and made me jittery. I just wanted to report, incase others were experiencing the same issue. It lasted only the one day.

The male nurse even looked at the needle. After the 1st 24 hours after shot i had a mild fever and tired. After 2nd day after receiving vaccine my arm  was very swollen and red.  Its been almost 2 weeks and  i still have a small knot at the injection site.  I occasionally feel a sharp pain in my arm from time to time.

I generally only experience mild PMS symptoms, and that also for only one day before my period starts. One week before my period was to start I began to experience excruciating PMS symptoms (heavy cramping, excessive mood swings, breast pain). My period did not start on the day that it was supposed to, and I am now four days late. The symptoms have only intensified since then, and over the counter medications have provided no relief. There&#39;s no chance I&#39;m pregnant.

I was given Pepcid, Benadryl and an Epi. I was released after a few hours and I went home and slept for two days. The guy that gave me the shot must have hit a bone and I was in pain for weeks. I am still experiencing some issues from it. My doctor has me stretching every morning due to my shoulder feeling tight. She says it could be a nerve issue.

                                                On Friday I woke up with swelling around both eyes and in my forehead. Swelling increased progressively so that by Sunday my left eye was nearly swollen shut. I saw a nurse practitioner on Monday and she gave me some steroid eye drops. This helped reduce inflammation a little bit but the swelling and redness continues. The skin was stretched, red, thin, itchy, and crusty. It has now been 15 days since my vaccine. The worst of the swelling has subsided but my eyelid and the area under my eye are still puffy, itchy, and red.  I am concerned based on the area of the reaction that this was related to an adverse interaction between the vaccine and dermal fillers I had Injected in February of 2020.   In addition to this reaction I had extreme fever, shakes, lethargy, and random superficial bruising. The bruising appeared in places where I had had no injuries 6-9 days after the vaccine and looked similar to those you see on people who do cupping - not round but like tiny red dots with pooled blood à stippled bruise with no pain.

                                                I started experiencing skin rash in face and flushing about two weeks after the vaccine about three times and had to take a Benadryl each time for the reaction even while being on Zyrtec on a regular basis. I started having under eye puffiness and body rashes right after these reactions that didn&#39;t go away even with regular allergy medication. I then started having a reaction similar to a nut allergy even though I ate something I made at home that had no nuts. I had some swelling on the right side of my face and eye. I also had some minor lip swelling and itching along with throat tightness. I had to take a Benadryl as well with this reaction. I have experienced episodes of this type everyday after eating or just in general and I&#39;m on a high histamine regimen as prescribed by the doctor. I was placed on steroids Prednisone for three days with no results after that. I have episodes where I feel my throat swelled and tightness along with itchy swelled lips, nasal pressure and itchy body.  I&#39;m still taking the his histamines as prescribed and Benadryl when the bad reactions occur. I have a epi pen.

About 2 weeks exactly after the vaccine I got very very sick and went to the  in , ER - I didn&#39;t have a fever but everything hurt on my body and I was nauseous and Had blurred vision. My hearing was off - ringing in my ears.  I was pretty sick after that for about two weeks. I did a follow up with Dr. and he said it sounded typical this J &amp; J vaccine. He said there was nothing he could do. During those two weeks,  I kept taking lots of fluids and ibuprofen as needed. Headaches, body aches c hills, night sweats, blurred vision and I couldn&#39;t sleep - had insomnia. The night sweats were very weird - I never had that before and I could literally ring my clothes out they were so wet every night. I felt like I had a fever but I didn&#39;t the entire time. I felt like I was burning up but I had chills but there was no fever the whole time.   Lately now, I have been feeling a little bit sick for about a week. It&#39;s a little strange because I have a cough and phlegm and very congested in my head.

                                                I was diagnosed with Lupus at 10 years old and experienced many symptoms between ages 10-20. In my early 20&#39;s, my symptoms lessened and I had not had a flare in over 15 years.  The first day after vaccination, mild soreness in my left arm...no big deal, just a vaccine.  By the third day after my vaccination, I realized I was having pain in multiple joints, left wrist, hand and shoulder.  As the days passed, the pain and swelling in my joints continued and spread throughout my entire body.  I tried to wait in out in hopes the issues would resolve themselves.  Finally, after 6 weeks, I realized I was having a flare and made an appointment with my doctor who said she had other autoimmune patients experience the same thing but since it had been so long, she could prescribe steroids (which I had used during other lupus flares in my childhood) and that should resolve things.  I have since had 4 rounds of steroids of varying doses and am on hydroxychloroquine but, as soon as the steroid round ends, the pain and swelling increase again.  I cannot open bottles, have difficulty sleeping due to pain, cannot perform many of my duties at work and am overall able to do minimal physical activity.  My knuckles have turned into dimples and my fingers are 2 ring sizes larger than normal.  Prescriptions listed below.  This is the most expensive free vaccine I&#39;ve ever received and also has had the most negative impact.  I sincerely hope we can stop the Lupus which remained dormant for the last 15 years before vaccination.  This has the potential to have major long term health impacts.  4/29/21: 20mg prednisone for 4 days, 10 mg for 3 days 5/10/21: 20mg prednisone for 4 days, 10 mg for 3 days 5/28/21: 40mg prednisone for 5 days 6/8/21: 5mg prednisone for 14 days

Bloody diarrhea that&#39;s started 20 minutes after the initial stomach pain. I had about 6 bloody bowel movements during that day, the pain disappeared that same day during the evening, the bloody diarrhea stopped during the night and I had two more bloody bowel movements  between 7 and 9am on the 10th of June.

Over a week later and I still have that but slowly getting better. Constipated since I?ve gotten the vaccine, can?t go without laxatives and even then it?s just a little. My body odor has been very bad since I got the shot,. Shooting pains in organs throughout lasting a few seconds at each time off and on during the day, has subsided since day 1. Light Kidney pain since the vaccine that hasn?t gone away.

                                                The vaccine administrator didn&#39;t listen when I told him he stuck the needle into the wrong place, and proceeded to insert the injection despite my protest. I felt an immense pressure in my shoulder, and the sensation of something cold trickling down my arm. The administrator was standing over me during this process while I sat in a metal chair and I&#39;m not sure he wanted to even touch me. My fiance and I received the shot together, however only he experienced a slight fever. I only experienced increasing pain when moving my arm. No other health changes. The pain was immediate and progressively got worse.  My primary care provider assessed me, and agreed that the injection was indeed pumped into my shoulder joint, instead of the muscle. My PCP is also worried about the efficacy of the vaccination, and whether or not absorption was successful. There is possible rotator cuff damage, and chronic pain when performing NECESSARY routine daily activities. I&#39;ve been ordered on pain medication, as well as physical therapy and have been advised that many vaccine related shoulder injuries never heal, or require surgery.

                                                Tuesday, June 8, 2021 - J&amp;J 1-dose COVID-19 vaccine administered at 12:45 pm During injection - immediate pain at left shoulder injection site. Extreme throbbing and burning sensation; felt like being stabbed with a hot rod. Was advised by pharmacist to move around and ?shake it off? - indicated that was common feedback for the vaccines.  Injection triggered an underlying sense of anxiety - hard to explain, because have never experienced anxiety issues, but felt body going into ?flight or fight? mode. Has had this feeling since; with no prior experience or conditions pre-vaccine. Experiences daily and sometimes comes on in stronger bouts.  4:00 pm  lower &amp; mid back pain. Severe muscle aches. These symptoms lasted for ~7 days. Worsening from onset for the first ~48 hours. 4:30-5:20 pm Extreme fatigues. Initial bout of narcolepsy. No prior condition or tendency, this has since occurred daily post-vaccine with immediate, rapid onset. Daily bouts last from ~20 minutes - ~2 hours per day, with time of day varying. Even after a full (8&#43; hours) nights rest; patient still becomes narcoleptic.  Has negatively affected patient?s life &amp; ability to sustain their pre-vaccine lifestyle routine. 8:15 pm start of a headache, which lasts ~3 days. It feels like a migraine with similar symptoms. Patient has a history of migraines, is very familiar with the symptoms. 8:17 pm extreme back pain. Feels like someone is stabbing burning knife in mid-back (isolated spot, just to left of spine) - comes on very sudden &amp; intense for a minute or so, then goes away. This happened a couple times in the following ~20 minutes.  Wednesday, June 9, 2021 5:22 woke up - hard to move (literally unable to get limbs to respond), entire body aches, back feels like it?s thrown out, did not sleep well, experienced a subconscious sense of anxiety throughout night; hot and dizzy and very nauseous. 5:50 am finally able to physically get out of bed, very painful to move, every muscle aches and feels like it?s seizing, even holding the phone hurts. Could barely make it 20 feet to the kitchen, almost passed out, had to go lay down again. Could not remain standing, too dizzy and nauseous. Started to rapidly get light headed. Went to lay down for a few minutes again.  6:00 am returned to the kitchen, but could not remain standing, so had to drink some water while sitting on the floor. Feeling miserable &amp; am unable to remain standing without being about to pass out. Even sitting upright is a challenge.  6:10 am experienced the equivalent of a hot flash, extremely dizzy &amp; nauseous had to lay down on kitchen floor tile to avoid passing out. Laid on tile floor in a puddle of sweat 6:30 am sudden onset of chills - could not stop shivering. Crawled to couch to lay down with a blanket - Inside temp is ~79F, should not be cold. Laid shivering under blanket for 5 hours, experienced extreme fatigue and passed out for ~5 hours. Challenges thermal regulating the next ~48 hours (alternating between hot / cold, but not to those extremes). Difficulty standing and being upright for ~36 hours, frequent lightheaded sensation. Extreme fatigue with rapid onset narcolepsy for ~4 days after - only being able to stay awake for a few hours at a time. The rapid onset narcolepsy has lingered and still occurs daily, but typically only lasts 20-120 minutes in total duration at a random interval each day (no existing pattern or triggers). Sense of anxiety and dread also has occurred daily since - lingering symptom that has no pre-existing conditions; has triggered stress eating, bouts of extreme introversion, pulling away and other negative  subconscious coping mechanisms. Both these lingering symptoms are extremely concerning to the patient, have occurred daily for a month now, and have negatively impacted the quality of their life &amp; relationships, personal/work.

                                                I got the vaccine, and within a couple of days, I started having chills, fatigue, nausea, muscle and body aches, and headaches. It got continually worse, and I eventually developed a migraine, blurred vision, tingling, severe nose bleeds, weakness (like peripheral neuropathy). The symptoms all got worse and worse, and I eventually went to the neurologist. They did a CT venogram; the results were normal. The BP was elevated, and they noted I had a really high heart rate. My blood work had abnormalities on the CBC and metabolic panels. I was sent back to my PCP and he found abnormal results in my blood work, plus he found abnormalities in the test for thyroid stimulating hormone. I still had elevated BP. A PCR COVID test was done, and I tested negative. They also tested for antibodies to see if I was responding to the vaccine; no antibodies were detected. They said it was weird and that I probably had lingering vaccine side effects that would go away, and in case the COVID test was wrong, I was advised to self-isolate. They plan to conduct further thyroid tests and blood work in the future to see if there are any changes. I am still having all the symptoms, and on 7/13/2021, I developed symptoms that are consistent either kidney stones or kidney infection. I plan to see my doctor to have this looked into.

Blood test collected 5/13/2021 showed positive Absolute Nucleated RBC (72H) and postiive Nucleated RBC (1H).  No other abnormal test results at that time other than postitive ANA that has been positive for many years without autoimmune disease or issues.  Further tests and followup with hematologist have not shown any reason for the postitive Nucleated RBC.  Hematologist diagnosed patient as having possible allergic drug rash.  Abdominal ultrasound was also performed and showed no abnormalities.  Patient feels weak but no other test abnormalities.  New cherry angiomas are still appearing.

                                                Most concerning reaction was: on Wed., 3/10/21, at approx. 9:30am, I fainted. I had just had a couple bites of food then felt really warm and nauseous. I fainted at table, then my spouse didn&#39;t know when he came downstairs, he thought my head was just resting at the table. He asked if I wanted to walk to the couch to rest, and as he helped me do so, I fainted and he caught me and carried me to the couch. Recovered within 1 minute but my hearing was  fuzzy for a couple more minutes, sounded like static in my ears.  Other reactions were:  Standard ones I read could happen- Fever of 100.1 that lasted less than a day, chills, aches, warm feeling and fatigue.

                                                Received shot around 2:10 pm. Experienced some stinging at injection site within a few seconds that became uncomfortable for several minutes then disappeared.  At 2:40 texted spouse that my face was tingling.  Started in cheeks and upper lip and spread to nose. A few minutes after that I started having hot flashes and my face was flushed.  Hot flashes lasted for an hour and subsided, tingling has mostly subsided except for area of cheek closest to my nose (it is 6 pm now).  Did not formally check into the urgent care facility but did contact them to see if this was normal.  Was advised to take antihistamine and, and if symptoms worsened to go to ER.  Symptoms did not get worse.

Woke up 20 min later, chills and body symptoms continued to worsen. Got very bad, could not get off the couch, in lots of pain. Nausea started. Light headache, Lasted for about 6 hours until I decided to take Tylenol and a bath. This helped immensely! After the bath I got very warm, burning up. Slept some and the next day felt significantly better. Light body aches and headache, tired. Back to almost 100% two days later/48 hrs.

                                                Starting in the afternoon after my shot I started feeling extremely cold. I had chills and my teeth were actually chattering at one point it was so bad. This gradually got worse as the evening went on. With it I also started feeling weak and fatigued. By 8pm I started to have a headache. Throughout the night symptoms worsened and I had a fever and more serious headache. My head was pounding so badly. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I also had a couple hot flashes to where I woke up sweating. Then I would feel frozen again. The nausea started during the night too. I thought I would throw up but didn&#39;t. At one point my heart was racing so fast I was a little concerned something bad would happen to me and contemplated going to the hospital. By morning I felt a little better, still nauseous and with a bad headache. My body was a little weak. These symptoms lasted all day Thursday. By that Friday morning I only had a little weakness and slight headache. By mid day Friday I was pretty much back to normal.

Few hours later developed typical &#34;flu like symptoms&#34;.  Next day woke up and both arms, hands, legs and feet and side of face had pins and needles and felt numb. Heart rate sky rocketed and went to ER. Felt like I was going to pass out.  Took blood work at hospital and doctors reassured that the feeling should come back in my legs and arms. When I left  6 hours later my legs were still pins and needles and my joints began to hurt.  A week later and this feeling continues to come and go, but is not consistent.  My joints still randomly hurt and I am an active 38 year old with three kids.

These symptoms are consistent with what I experience during a migraine. Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine the pain expanded to my neck and face on the left side, soon after followed by a mild headache.   Over the course of the day, within a couple of hours of vaccination, my headache remained mild but expanded to a general head pain that wasn?t confined to just one location. Also around this time I began experiencing neck muscle soreness and became very tired.  It is now approximately 10 hours post vaccination and I still have a mild headache. Migraine symptoms still present but not as notable. I feel run down, tired, an overall sense of malaise, and have full body mild muscle soreness.  No medications or treatments used so far to treat these symptoms.

EMS was called, she was evaluated.  She was not transported and was released to go home after evaluation and complete resolution of her symptoms. I spoke with her today, she states she had a similar episode after her nasal piercing 2 years ago and she believes related to anxiety.  She states other than arm soreness and muscle aches today, no other symptoms persist.

A few hours after, I felt flushed and slightly feverish with generalized body aches. 6-7 hours after the vaccine, I experienced extreme fatigue, extremely high fever that registered as &#34;err&#34; consecutively on the thermometer numerous times (min of 5 times checked), severe headache, worsening body aches, left flank pain, GI upset with nausea, congestion, dizziness and many heart palpitations. The high fever broke around 11pm and my temp was 102 when checked then and I was drenched in sweat. The fever continued to decrease throughout the next 12 hours. The extreme fatigue, severe headache, dizziness , GI upset and nausea continued throughout the day Saturday and most of Sunday.  I also experienced burning in my chest that radiated into both shoulders, anterior/posterior neck and between both shoulder blades in my back all day Saturday. The burning has decreased over this past week, but I am still experiencing it with some exertion, but not consistently.  Fatigue continues some and SOB at random times.

My stomach hurt, I was nauseated. I went through hot &amp; cold sweats &amp; chills. I got really light headed &amp; disoriented. I began to get a fever.  I felt far from flu symptoms. My heart was racing. I had to get into my shower repeatedly &amp; just lay. I cried. I dont recommend this to anyone! It has been 2 days &amp; i am still experiencing symptoms. I read the fact sheet for the Janssen shot. I am going to get a check up by a doctor. I feel like I am having an allergic reaction. I never felt so much pain in my life; my side effects are far from the flu symptoms.

Starting at 8 hrs after the vaccine was administered. When I breastfeed my baby for 36 hours after it felt like razor blades when the milk passed through my nipples and I had clogged ducts. Normally it is not painful and I don?t experience clogs. I got temporary relief soaking in Epsom salts in a hot bath. Even in the hot bath my nipples wouldn?t flatten or go smooth. I?ve never experienced a totally body reaction like this. It really get like every pain receptor that ever had activated reactivated. After 6 hours it subsided and I felt fatigued. During this time my temp was 102.5 I had a fever for 8 hrs. The second day at hour 28 the muscle aches returned but not as bad. While I don?t have a temperature I still feel warm and flushed and had trouble sleeping the second night my back is still sore.

                                                Around 2 hours after the vaccine I had diarrhea for 2 hours (so from about 12:30pm-2:30pm). After that I felt flushed, and around 5:30pm I had a fever and my heart rate began to rise and blood pressure drop.. My heart rate continued to rise until about 9:30pm, and then it began to fall. I also experienced a terrible headache, moderate body aches, and chills and hot flashes. But the diarrhea and rapid heart rate were very concerning to me--I felt very sure something was wrong. This morning I have a low heart rate and low blood pressure and I feel very weak, but other symptoms are gone. I don&#39;t have a primary care doctor and read that the diarrhea and heart symptoms could be signs of a severe reaction and I wanted to report it.

Numbness lasted about an hour. 40-50 minutes post vaccine nausea would come and go. 4 hours post vaccine the typical flu-like symptoms began: extreme fatigue, mild headache, muscle weakness, painful skin, lack of appetite.

                                                April 7th about 6:30pm: I became very confused, having trouble remembering where I was or answering simple questions.  Around that same time my vision became blurry, and my face in and around my mouth became numb, I began to slur as a result.  The numbness and slurring increased over the next hour or so.  After that hour or so, I realized I was exhausted and my head hurt so I went to sleep. I also had a strange emotional response to all of this, I behaved giddily and as though it were funny.  April 8th about 8am: I woke up and the confusion, blurry vision, numbness, and slurring were gone.  I had a mild headache, brain fog, and was still more tired than usual.  Later that evening the headache developed in to something more like a migraine, intense pain focused behind my right eye and blurred vision.  At this time I again decided to go to sleep.  It would have been about 8pm.  April 9th about 8am: I woke up still feeling a moderate headache focused on the right side, still tired, and brain fog.  The symptoms weakened throughout the day and by the evening I was feeling mostly normal again.   I have felt healthy and normal since.

I woke up at 1am the the next day (4.10.21) with a severe migraine and my heart racing. The migraine was so severe that just bending down made my head pound with extreme pain. I felt very hot and was sweating profusely and my clothes were soaked. I was also very thirsty and drank several glasses of water. I took 4 ibuprofen as it had been 8 hours since my last dose and laid back down in bed and tried to relax. I fell back asleep within 1-2 hours. I felt fine the next morning but did have a slight headache, but it was nothing compared to what I woke up to during the night.

                                                * Arm was very sore for about the first 10 minutes.  Moving it reduced it pretty quickly and was no worse than a minor ache for most of the next day or so. * Had a mild headache before the shot (believe due to not having had caffeine that day yet) * At about 6 pm on 4/10, lost appetite due to mild nausea (just enough to not want to eat but not enough to vomit) * At about this time I noticed I also started to feel a little winded, akin to walking just briskly enough that you have to breath harder than if you&#39;re just sitting / resting.  It did not get any worse than this however, so I opted to keep a close eye and see if it eased (which it would by end of Sunday, 4/11) * At about 8:30 pm on 4/10, noticed I felt warm, had a fever between 100.4 to 100.8 * Also around 8:30 pm I noticed that pain I normally feel from my herniated discs and pinched nerves (L4/L5 L5/S1) just ACHED and was more painful than normal. * Started feeling tired (I&#39;m usually up until around 1-2 am, and I was ready to go to bed by 9pm on 4/10)  Also felt a little forgetful / hard to concentrate on anything * When I went to bed, I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to the white light from my monitor.  This is usually a sign of a painless migraine with auras that essentially blind me for about a half hour.  I did not have auras, though my headache was steadily getting worse to the point I suspect it might have actually been a migraine) * At about 12:30 am on 4/11, the headache got to the point where I could no longer ignore it (best I can describe is it felt like someone was trying to peel my skull of like you would an orange) so I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen.  I also by this point had a fever of 102, though it would drop to 100.5 or so within a few minutes of taking the Ibuprofen. * At about this point the arm starting aching a lot more, I assume because I wasn&#39;t using it while sleeping.  It felt like someone had punched me multiple times hard in the same spot. * I felt much better on the morning of 4/11.  However as the day continued I felt more and more tired.  My temperature was higher than normal but very mild; it stayed around 99.8 for most of the day that I took it.  By Monday, 4/12 I felt mostly fine aside from my arm aching worse than it did when I first got the shot.  Now on 4/14 its pretty much no longer achy.

                                                Around 6 pm on the ninth, I started to feel lethargic; really lethargic. 8:30 pm - 100.5 fever. 09:00 pm I had chills that shook my body. Very intense. Extreme body aches and especially legs which prompted me to use a weighted blanket. That was all overnight and excessive sweating overnight. That may have been from the fever. I had nausea that started around midnight. That was mild. I did notice a little bit of a headache at that time as well which was mild. Saturday, fever all day, fatigue. Overnight that night - a little achy; but the chills had gone away. Tuesday night the body aches had gone away - they had diminished Saturday- Monday. I had body aches until about 6 or 7 pm on Monday. The fatigue -all this week I&#39;ve still been dragging - I&#39;m still tired. The fever would go up and down with Tylenol but I needed it until Sunday night. Headache - the first one was gone Saturday morning. I had a headache  Sunday evening and Monday morning. It was gone about lunch time.  The injection site was tender with the delivery of the shot until Sunday when I went to bed. It was not pain but just tender to the touch. Usually that happens with any shot for me but usually it doesn&#39;t stay tender for that long. April 13th - Televisit with a Physician&#39;s Asst in my doctor&#39;s office.

I have had pain and tingling in my hands and feet ever since, along with sensitivity. I also have pain in my joints and legs similar to what I imagine arthritis would feel like. I also have throbbing chest pain and pain in my legs since vaccination.

These symptoms lasted for 48 hours. The sweating continued for 5-6 days throughout the day and was worse at night.   The week after the vaccine, a bump developed on my wrist. It&#39;s believed to be a ganglion cyst, but I won&#39;t have confirmation until after I see a specialist. About a week or two after the vaccine I also developed burning in my feet and it became uncomfortable to walk.

My normal cycle is at the same time every month and I rarely spot/bleed between cycles. I now have cramps and blood/spot daily which is extremely uncharacteristic. This has been a horrible experience and there does not seem to be an end in sight.

I also experienced tingling sensation to my scalp, face, hands, arms and legs. I also experienced an immediate muscular type pain.  I also had one episode of palpitations with pause on the vaccine of the three week window and that is what prompted to go see a doctor. I had EKG, holster monitor which my tests were normal.

As I was instructing her to remain seated, she passed out and was unresponsive.  She appeared to be having a seizure immediately after that lasted about 1 minute.  Once this episode passed, she became responsive and could talk.  EMS arrived and took over.

                                                1. Received J&amp;J shot in Left Deltoid- told ahead of time &#34;People say it burns&#34;. It did burn incredibly bad--unlike any shot I have ever had-it burned like the time I had knee injection. I assumed this was &#34;normal&#34; for COVID.  My arm ached/hurt to move shoulder -could tell it was painful/stiff driving back again, I knew many were having &#34;reactions&#34; so I presumed this normal--thinking ROM issue/pain was &#34;normal&#39; despite my whole arm feeling such.  By 1800 that evening, my entire arm was throbbing, and starting swelling-although right handed--could see entire arm bigger than other. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep/get arm in comfortable position.  I thought this was a normal reaction-had patients to see-but touching/moving my arm hurt as bad as time I torn my meniscus.  Over next several days, swelling went down--I could painfully move my arm, but it was weak-unable to function as usual. I still thought this was normal and struggled through week as April 4-9 was Spring break.  I had trouble even leaning forward on bike because should STILL hurt--and it tapped on shoulder it would hurt incredible bad/couldn&#39;t carry daughter. Since I have higher pain tolerance- I was able to push through-however, by following week, this was no longer working--arm started swelling again.  I felt the injection was high and was talking with my mom whom  in primary care NP, and she mentioned shoulder injuries could happen if injection given too high--which is when I realized that my shoulder pain was not &#34;all in my head&#34;.  S/p vaccination day 19 forward, it has seemed to flare as bad as initial day one and not gone back.   This is when I looked up and discovered there was also a condition called &#34;SHOULDER INJURY RELATED TO VACCINATION&#34; that described exact symptoms I had.     It also mentioned that damage isn&#39;t necessary should from needle--- although it was a year ago-- I had probable COVID April 2020---which could have made my immune system hyper-reactive.      I have had to call out sick April 16th because shoulder was causing pain, flushing and warm feeling.   April 19th I saw Dr-- he drew blood (I don&#39;t know what)-- didn&#39;t do full shoulder exam and referred to orthpedicc.  APril 30th I ended up calling out again as when arm would swell it made focusing at work very difficult. I saw my PCP via telehealth and she prescribed Prednisdone dose pack.   May 2nd, I  started treatment with cryotherapy machine and this was only thing that relieved pain and swelling enough to help relieve pressure.      May 7th---I saw Dr.-unfortunately, he didn&#39;t do anything because he stated a vaccine couldn&#39;t cause such type of damage to rotator cuff, didn&#39;t believe there was a condition called SIRVA and declined to treat with cortisone shot &#34;This whole thing started with a shot-that would be inappropriate&#34; .  He was willing to refer me to Physical therapy whom HAS heard of condition and knows how to rehab

                                                About a week after being vaccinated I started experiencing bad headaches, chest pains and pains in my leg. I went to the emergency department at Hospital to get checked out. They took blood and I had a high d dimer test result. They did an Ultrasound of both legs, and a CT with contrast of the lungs and a CT of the head. No blood clots were evident at the time. Over the next couple of weeks my left leg has continued to swell and hold fluid. On 5-11-2021 I had another ultrasound of the left leg again to rule out a possible blood clot. Again they did not find anything. After reviewing blood work from a coag profile all results were elevated but not worrisome per the dr. I continie to have more swelling in the left lower extremity, muscle aches and pains in that leg along with more busted blood vessels. I have experienced pains in places that I have never had before. Example a sharp pain started around my left pelvic area and shot up to the left shoulder and then burned for several minutes.

On 23-MAR-2021, she had a COVID 19 test because she was travelling to other country and the test came back negative. On 16-APR-2021, about 3 weeks later, she had major surgeries including Tummy Tuck and Breast Implant. She thought she was taking a big risk especially after hearing on the news about blood clots. Her surgeries went well with no complications. She didn&#39;t have any symptoms of blood clots. She was now recovering from the surgeries and was doing great so far. She wanted her case to be useful for Janssen to help with research. She was willing to share the documents and reports from her surgeries if needed.

Sever periods of chills followed by sweating and feeling hot. Nausea, headache. Took Excedrin, Aleve and tums. Worst of the symptoms subsided by 24 hrs post vaccine administration. Slight nausea and headache still persists at time of filling this report out. I feel it&#39;s important to note that I had COVID in December and feel the adverse reactions were due to having sufficient antibodies against COVID. Perhaps it shpuld be recommended that people get antibody titers to determine if the vaccine is necessary as is done to determine if HepB boosters are necessary.

I had been out of my migraine medications. Rested all day. Pattern continued.  4/13 My BP had increased (200/140), racing heart, not well. I went to urgent care. They gave me migraine cocktail. I was having all over global pain and concentrated pain. Lidocaine Q-tips in nostrils as a nerve block to help with pain. The rest of the night I was ok but the next day the migraine was back. The medication was for onset of migraine but it was already there and didn&#39;t work.  4/13-4/18 migraine persisted 4/18 contacted PCM. They told me they needed to see me. I was having high BP due to the increased pain per dr. They did the same migraine treatment that day. The BP medication stayed same as they felt it was a migraine issue. They prescribed oxycodone that day. They couldn&#39;t give Toradol because I had had within 24 hours. I went home, slept and didn&#39;t work for 2 weeks.  4/18,4/21 I went to ER. Repeat of treatments for migraine. Was never fully gone when discharged.  The migraine was always there, the night of the 20th I was throwing up, 21st my eyes were twitching and shaking which was new symptoms to my migraine.  *This has triggered my history of migraines to flare up again since giving birth to my daughter 4 years ago.

It was a bad headache on left side of head. I was just not feeling well. On the 19th day, it went away. I still from time to time I do still feel pain in the head on the left side. I had a lot of tightness in my left leg. In  previous years, I have had blood clot in my leg and after birth in my stomachs - so with the pain in calf I called a doctor and went. They did a visual. After a lump appearing in my leg, an ultrasound was scheduled. I went  Urgent care on May 10 - she ordered an ultrasound but her office didn&#39;t ever follow up with me. On 17th, I saw my Primary care and she sent me straight to get an Ultrasound - on the 18th, it revealed I had a blood clot.

Sore arm... extreme sore arm, hard to lift. Immediately after receiving the shot.  No other symptoms the rest of the day (except sore arm) I felt I got lucky but then...  3.  Next day around 11am I felt extremely tired, arm was still sore.  4.  Rashes (hives) started appearing on my left lower leg, minutes later, rashes on right leg. rashes started disapearing 5.  Hours later (next day), rashes on lower back, hours later rashes on side of stomach (below armpits). Rashes disappeared. Hours later rashes on upper back. 6.  Next day rashes on stomach. Rashes would disappear after half hour or so and would start appearing again on different part of my body, but they started on lower legs and little by little started going up my body. 7.  Tired for a whole week. 8.  It&#39;s been a while and last time I got rashes was about 3 days ago. Not sure if I won&#39;t get them anymore.

                                                I experienced heel pain and then a swollen bruise on the side of my left leg, which radiated heat. I had internal thigh pain and left side groin pain. I made a doctor&#39;s appointment. There was a concern that it may be a blood clot. I had an ultrasound and took blood tests. I was diagnosed with having an inflamed vein called phlebitis. Since the diagnosis, I&#39;ve been experiencing severe uneasy bruising. Pain in the leg has subsided, but I am still dealing with some bruising.

Called doctors offices, but had a wait time to get seen for following week.   3/13- 6am- muscle spasms continued in legs on and off through the day, slight headache, but chest tightness barely noticeable. 3/14- 10:00pm- check tightness and shortness of breath begins again; this time more constant.   3/15- 5am- chest still tight, no other symptoms.

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

                                                Immediate injection site pain including stinging and burning.  Site continued to sting for over an hour post injection.  Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

The patient&#39;s weight was 132 pounds, and height was approximately 63.5 inches (5&#39;3 and half). The medical history included: no family history of disease or no allergies. The patient was not pregnant nor breastfeeding at the time of vaccination. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26,cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029) dose was not reported, administered on 07-MAR-2021 10:40 for prophylactic vaccination.

I shivered and sweated for 12 hours overnight with a severe headache. I tossed most of the night and had to get up to pee 3 times throughout the night - which is extremely uncommon. By 24 hours after the injection, I still had a strong headache and was mostly able to regulate my body temp. By 36 hours after, I felt tired but no longer had a headache or chills. My injection site is red, raised and very tender.

I had the most severe pain throughout the night, unable to move my left arm and nausea from the pain. The fever and chills continued into the next day. Ibuprofen relieves the pain and fever, but it all returns when the medicine wears off. I have a high pain tolerance, and this pain was worse than natural childbirth, and I have given birth twice without any pain medication.

Then I noticed I was sweating real bad and I was so weak it took all my energy to just lift my head off my pillow. Small burst of energy like sitting up became  quite a challenge. All I have done is sleep none stop and when i wake ive noticed a bit of confusion. For example I thought i woke up at 7am tomorrow and then kept falling back asleep on and off till about 8:30 when i realized it&#39;s still today. The body aches and pains were very rough too. My husband went at the same time for the same shot and what Im experiencing vs him is not comparable! He has mild discomfort mine is extreme. Also Ive had a headache a pretty bad one  since about 10pm yesterday as well. Ive been unable to even think about food Im too tired to care even. I have not ate since I was vaccinated yesterday. Ive never reacted to any vaccine or shot of any kind till now.

When I looked over, I saw patient experiences minor convulsions. She was still in her chair. Episode lasted not even 10 seconds. Patient awoke and said she blacked out. She was coherent and responsive. We called 911. Patient said she has no history of seizures or low blood sugar. She said she tends to faint when giving blood or during vaccines due to the needle. Paramedic checked patient out and cleared the patient. No ambulance was taken. Will call patient tomorrow to follow up.

All thru that night I was in pain.  Next day still felt like my head was in a vice with a migraine.  The chills had gone away. still had body aches just not as severe.  Day 3 after vaccine.  SLight headache (nothing  like the vice headache) , arm is still very sore. body aches have subsided considerably.   I treated with taking Tylenol and using a heating pad on my arm and back to help with body aches and pain,.

I have also had a sore arm since receiving the vaccine. Also, I went to this vaccine clinic with 2 of my neighbors that also had the exact same reactions.

                                                The shot was administered by a young woman at pharmacy, who I later learned was an intern. She injected the shot less than two fingers down from my shoulder bone, much higher than I have ever had an injection given before.  I immediately felt intense pain, and the intern had trouble pushing the syringe down fully.  She said ?I need help!?, and her male manager ran over, and quickly jabbed the syringe further into my arm, and pressed extremely hard down on the syringe, forcing the remaining contents into my arm. I immediately felt a shooting, searing pain down my entire arm, into my wrist, and  my arm went numb, felt heavy, and tingly by my hand.  The manager pulled the needle out of my arm, and said ?you must have hit bone, the needle is bent?.  I then felt extremely nauseous and woozy, and my vision started going in and out.  I fanned myself and after about five minutes my vision stabilized, and I felt less nauseous.  It is now 9 hours later and I have intense shoulder and neck pain, and limited range of motion of my shoulder.

                                                On March 10 (the day after my vaccine) I felt the normal body aches and had a pretty bad headache. That all went away in the evening on March 10. Since that day I have had off and on dizziness/lightheadedness. On March 19 I fainted in my kitchen. I hit my kitchen table and had a huge knot on my head and bruises all down my left side of my body. My left shoulder still hurts from the fall and I still have a small knot on my head (left side just above my left eye on my forehead). I went to my primary care doctor on  March 24 and reported the event. I asked if it could be related to the COVID vaccine and she said she wasn&#39;t sure since the Jansen one was so new, but that she had seen these effects from the other two vaccines.  At the doctor&#39;s office my blood pressure was on the lower end (110/60). My normal blood pressure runs about 118/70. They ran some blood work and that all came back normal. They did an EKG in the office, but my blood pressure stayed pretty close to the same as it was the first reading. They then sent me to get a CT scan on my head, which also came back normal. She did diagnose me with a concussion. I was out of work the entire week (March 22-March 26) due to this. She also ordered me to have an echo done. While at the office for the echo, my blood pressure ran 99/46 (this was on March 31). The results of the echo came back normal.  I also got a monitor to wear for 72 hours on March 31. I took that to the doctor on April 5 and I am still waiting on results from that.  Since the event on March 19, I have had headaches and body aches. I have also had slight lightheadedness off and on.

                                                After the immunization was administered to the patient, she was asked to have a seat in the waiting area for observation.  A few minutes after she sat, she told her husband who was seated with her she didn&#39;t feel well (he did not inform us).  The technician observing her noticed she passed out and reported to the pharmacist (myself).  I designated a team member to call 911 and ran out to the patient.  She was extremely pale and her lips were blue.  With the assistance of her husband I laid her on the floor, had him elevate her feet and checked for pulse and breathing.  I couldn&#39;t immediately find her pulse but within 30 seconds she began to come to.  She appeared to tremor a few times as she came to and her color began to return.  She was extremely confused and did not know where she was upon awakening.  EMS arrived on the scene approximately 10-15 minutes after the event.  They did standard patient evaluation which was unremarkable and proceeded to bring her to the local ED,  According to the patient, the ED visit yielded nothing and they said &#34;she couldn&#39;t be more healthy&#34;.  One note, that was revealed in conversation with the patient while waiting for EMS to arrive is that the patient had very little to eat or drink prior to being administered the vaccine.

I still felt a &#34;coolness&#34; around my chest but otherwise felt &#34;fine&#34; so I was permitted to leave. As the day went on, I felt my chest (lungs &amp; area around my heart) feel tighter &amp; tighter &amp; my breath grew more &amp; more &#34;shallow&#34; like I couldn&#39;t take deep enough breaths &amp; I was short of breath. In the evening, it intensified. I was very fatigued (couldn&#39;t go up our stairs or talk in complete sentences without feeling &#34;winded&#34;). The tightness in my chest was worse &amp; was accompanied by periodic acute pain in my heart. I also had pain my lower back. I went to the emergency room around 10PM that night. An EKG, blood tests &amp; chest X-ray were conducted. The ER doctor said all tests came back &#34;normal&#34; &amp; they weren&#39;t sure what my issue was. I went home &amp; rested. I woke the next morning with the acute pains gone but the tightness still lingered. I did not feel &#34;normal&#34; until almost 72 hours after my vaccine.

My lower abdomen and back also hurt and was cramping as if I was in labor.  I took two Tylenol PM and 10mg of Cyclobenzaprine. Then the chills started, I have never been that cold in my life while I was shivering that is when the sweating started and a basically sweat through three pairs of pajamas last night. Woke up around 3am with a pounding headache. By 10am I was feeling wrung out, but a lot better. I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep. Woke up around 3:30pm took a shower and was able to take my daughter to soccer. I am still weak and have some achiness in my knees and ankles.

At 12:30 AM that night I woke up to what felt like electric shocks going through my body (painful zaps) and in a full body sweat. No fever. I then started shaking uncontrollably and my heart rate increased to the 100s. The shaking and rapid heart rate lasted for 30 minutes. Woke up again multiple times with body sweats.  In the morning still lethargic but all symptoms resolved by noon.

                                                After receiving my vaccine on March 14th, I started experiencing pressure in the left side of my head and severe headache.  As the days progressed, I was continuing to have severe headaches for the next couple of weeks.  I was taking exedrin Migrane medicine to try and calm it down.   When I would try an work out it was worse, it was like the pressure on the left side of my brain was expanding and it would be worse.  My legs and body did feel weak.  It has slowly gone down with less and less of these headaches over the last couple of weeks.  They were definitely different than what a normal migrane feels like and very specific type of feeling.  I don&#39;t know if I have had any clots or not, but I am currently trying to get into a neurologist to get looked at to make sure there is not something else going on.  I am going to try and contact Johnson and Johnson to see if they can help refer to a neurologist because I currently do not have health insurance.

                                                Took the vaccine at  3 PM. Around 6 PM had lower back and left leg pain. This increased a lot during the next 2 weeks. Then visited my physician on Apr 02. The doctor prescribed Meloxicam 15 mg. since I also had seasonal allergies for which the Dr prescribed Fluticasone 50 mcg and Azelastine 137 mcg nasal spray. The Dr also requested for lower back MRI.  I have scheduled the lower back MRI for 04/16. I did let the doctors office know today about the vaccine.

Has gotten slightly better beginning 4/12/2021, but remains unresolved as of this report.  4/15/2021: woke up with severe headache again.

                                                Immediate arm pain when the injection was administered, was painful to raise arm after the shot, for hours. Made effort to continue to raise the arm and engage the muscle to alleviate pain, which helped by the end of *that day*, though tenderness persisted at the injection site for the following 4 to 5 days, including feeling pain when sleeping on that arm. Also, on the day of receiving the vaccine and dealing with the initial sore arm, I experienced a surge of energy lasting into the evening, that is common to me right before I fall sick ( for example as a runner, it sometimes manifests as a PR and then soon after that I get sick). The morning after the vaccine, I woke up slightly queasy, ate breakfast,  went for a bike ride and hike, then headache &amp; nausea appeared near lunchtime (1 pm). I pushed through the rest of the afternoon but headache/nausea worsened, and by late afternoon (maybe 5 pm) I also had developed body aches, chills (with sweats), and low-grade fever.

                                                First I had a funny taste in my mouth - 2-4 hours after vaccine. 8-9 hours after the injection - I woke up with the first of what would become extremely severe body aches. I took some Aleve - that helped some with the symptoms - but not efficacious. It turned into bone deep pain that made me cry. I would say 7 on the pain scale. That lasted two days. It started slow and then it got big. It was very bad for 12-16 hours. I didn&#39;t leave bed and I cried a lot. Worse than childbirth. I was left with another two days after that with some severe fatigue and then I started recovering. About 10 days after vaccine,  on the morning of the 17th, I thought I had a spider bite but it was the beginning of a rather severe shingles outbreak which I haven&#39;t had before.  I had a telehealth appt with employee health -  I was treated  with anti-viral - Valtrex generic on the 19th. The rash was mostly gone with the  medicine - everything is scabbed over but the nerve pain is still here to this day. I still missed work this week.

                                                The 1st day I got dizzy, nauseous and experienced chills. The next day, I started experiencing migraines and I&#39;ve been having them for about 3 days a week since then. I&#39;ve also been experiencing vertigo for a little over a month, but it has worsened over the last month and has caused me to miss a lot of work. I&#39;ve also been having blurred vision and trouble focusing. I went to the urgent care before I was able to see my doctor, but I&#39;m currently working with her on getting them resolved.

                                                The day before she got her vaccine she had started her menstruation cycle.  She is not on any medications, everything was normal, went to work and went to get her vaccine.  She got her vaccine and around 4:15 she started gushing, which is abnormal for her and having clots the size of a half dollar and covered in blood.  This is not normal for her periods, and she is now in the bathroom every hour and a half and looks like a murder scene.  Her normal menstrual cycle is heavy for one day and then gradually lessens and only lasts a few days.   She does occasionally have small clots with hers, but this are large and bleeding profusely.  The only side effect she has is that she is extremely tired.  She slept from 4:30 yesterday to 2:00 AM and feels like she could sleep the rest of the day.   Her arm is a little bit sore, but otherwise fine from the injection site.  Is concerned due to the heavy volume of bleeding, which is extremely abnormal for her.   She has taken Tylenol and drinking a lot of fluids.

I had a rash on my shoulders, ankles and forearms. It was little spots about six inches. Those symptoms lasted for 36 hours. After that point I had very low Oxygen levels and my Asthma was very severe. My Nebulizer and rescue inhaler were not very effective. It has been almost nine weeks and my Oxygen levels are still lower than normal at 96 or 97.  Before the vaccine my Asthma was controlled and I rarely used the rescue inhaler. I use my rescue inhaler once daily. I am using my Nebulizer once daily. Immediately after the vaccine I was using my Nebulizer four times daily. It is still not near the level of control I had before the vaccine.

My underarms, genital area, head, and eyebrow area was severely itchy. I went to the hospital where they gave me a 12 day steroid taper, steroids in the hospital and monitored me until my skin calmed down. They also gave me hydroxozine and Pepcid. Two days after the steroid taper was over the rash returned and my primary care gave me 7 days of steroids. The day that ended I felt itching in my head  and eyebrows and my skin began peeling, and I saw a dermatologist that day who prescribed a 21 day steroid taper. I have just finished this medication today. I have missed work due to symptoms. The second time the rash came back my face looked like I had shingles and was painful to the touch.

                                                Several hours after the shot I started getting a numb feeling in my feet.  the next morning there was a &#39;rushing&#39; feeling flowing through my legs. About a week or so later I began experiencing numbness in my hands as well.  At times I would also experience numbness on my face as well.    As the weeks went on, the numbness in the legs and hands continued and got more intense.  At times I have had difficulty sleeping due to the numbness I experience and on occasion, my hands a feet had a &#39;pins and needles&#39; painful feeling about them which made it difficult to sleep.  Prior to this shot I was a normal 39 year old with absolutely no pre-existing  neurology issues.
