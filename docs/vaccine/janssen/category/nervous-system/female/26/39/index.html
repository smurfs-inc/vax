Muscles began tensing up, tunnel vision started, extreme dizziness, vomiting, severe weakness in muscles, and fainting. These lasted for about 2 hours before decreasing in severity but continued to be present until about 10:30pm, 13 and a half hours after receiving the shot. Nothing was done to treat the symptoms. As of 12:30pm on 3/10, some minor symptoms are still present, such as muscle weakness and pain, severe migraine, and dizziness.

I went to bed at 9:30 p.m. and woke up at 11:30 p.m. feeling as though I had slept 8 hours because I had a 102 fever. My face was burning from the heat and I was shaking. I took two more Advil. About 30 minutes later I threw up. I waited 30 more minutes and threw up again. As a result, of having Addison&#39;s disease, I have an emergency steroid injection that I use during crises such as this. I took my shot and immediately began feeling slightly better. I was able to go back to bed and at some point the fever went down overnight. I am currently feeling weak and with no fever. I also have a slight headache.

                                                Around 8 pm (about 6 hours after receiving the vaccine) I started to feel typical flu symptoms such as chills and aches, and I had some body shaking as well. I was in bed that night and the symptoms kept getting stronger, and around 11 pm I started to feel tingling throughout my body, mostly in my hands and feet. It was very uncomfortable to lay still and I felt I&#39;d never be able to fall asleep if I couldn&#39;t lay still. I took 10mg of Z-Quil around 11:30 pm. My body and skin was also starting to get very hot, I never took my  body temperature but I probably had a fever. I put a cold compress on my forehead. I also took 1000 mg acetaminophen and 400 mg Advil. I got up to use the bathroom and I could walk but my balance was off and I felt tingling up my legs. I laid back in bed with the cold compress again and the tingling in my hands and feet increased. I tried walking around again and again felt tingling up my legs. I sat on the edge of my bed moving my feet around which helped the tingling, but when I laid down again the tingling kept coming back. I took another 10mg of Z-Quil and 0.25mg xanax (prescription for anxiety). I finally decided to move to a chair with lots of pillows so I could sit upright since that helped reduce the tingling. I finally fell asleep sometime after 12:30 am. I woke up in the chair around 2 am and was feeling better - no tingling, no body shaking, chills and aches were reduced and body temperature didn&#39;t feel as high. I was then able to sleep in bed for the rest of the night. The next day I still had aches and chills and a fever but it was manageable with Advil or acetaminophen, and by Monday (March 8) I was able to go to work.

                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

                                                I started to lose mobility in my left arm the evening of my vaccine appointment. The following morning, I could not raise my arm at all. The pain in my upper left arm (where the vaccine was administered) has been severe for more than 48 hours. It is extremely painful to the touch. I can use my left hand, but cannot function/cannot perform necessary daily work and school tasks due to the loss of mobility. I have been in extreme pain and fear my shoulder has been injured.

Her dizziness became worse and I got the Epi Pen ready.   A few minutes later, she asked to lie down due to her dizziness.   I assisted her and had my tech call 911.   She had no trouble breathing but did develop tingling in her hands and a blotchy red rash on her chest.  The paramedics arrived and checked her vitals which they said were fine.  They took her out to the ambulance as a precaution.

                                                Received the vaccine on a Thursday evening. 9 hours after I received the vaccine I woke up with chills, fever, headache, body aches, and a sore arm around the injection site. These symptoms lasted a full day (all of Friday) with the body aches being the most intense. When I woke up Saturday, these symptoms were gone with the exception of the sore arm which took another two days before getting back to normal. I took one 500 mg Acetaminophen on Friday to relieve the symptoms which didn&#39;t seem to help.

By 9pm I had a fever of 104 degrees and was dropping sweat, shaking, and very weak. Within 24 hours, I developed a rash on my chest ans torso area of little red bumps that were itchy and spreading throughout the day. The fever came and went on the second day. Terrible flu symptoms have lasted over 24 hours now.

She returned to the post-vaccine administration monitoring area after about two minutes to sit down again.  At that time, I asked more questions about symptoms.  She was also feeling weak and like she may pass out.  I gave her a cold compress to place on her neck which improved her symptoms very rapidly.  She remained in the area with the cold compress for about 10 more minutes before she felt well and she then left with her husband.

She asked if it was normal that her arm hurt really bad, then she stated she was getting dizzy and light headed. I instructed her to sit on the floor so she would not fall down. She sat on the floor and immediately passed out. She remained unconscious for 60- 90 seconds. We laid her into the prone position. Her arms were twitching. She regained consciousness. 911 was alerted and responded. Pt refused to leave with them. She sat with un an additional 15 minutes before she left for a therapy appointment.

Patient did not hit the ground or injure herself-she did not lose consciousness she was flushed and sweating.  Pharmacist sat on floor with patient for 2-3 minutes and gave her water, patient was then able to stand up with little assistance and brought to sit down.  Patient stated she felt nauseous and may vomit she was given a trash can but did not vomit she was able to drink a bottle of water and was given a soft pretzel.  After about 10 minutes she stated she was feeling much better was no longer flushed or sweating she called her boyfriend for a  ride home.

                                                Experienced light headedness ( started before time stated but not sure when exactly). Around 6:30pm-7pm I began feeling dizzy, going between dizzy and light headed. I was drinking plenty fluids and did eat. A few people noted that I looked very out of it, and I felt very out of it. I tried staying seated and this did not have any effect on the dizzy feeling. I went to lay down and before going to sleep around 10pm-11pm, laying in bed I felt like the room was spinning. I also had typical symptoms, soreness as injections site and arm (starting immediately the day of vaccine), fever at it&#39;s highest was 102 (starting at 100.5 that morning, not peaking until Motrin wore off*see below*), feeling tired and very heavy.. like everywhere was waited down by something (starting early in the morning).  I was given Motrin by my coworker in the morning as I was had a headache  and was feeling sore and moving sore due to heavy feeling. Wednesday waking up the dizziness  and lightheadedness were gone. A slight feeling of being out of it however, fever was about 99-100 throughout the day (99 being my typical temp). As of today only a feeling of sore arm and tiredness which sometimes feels like I and out of it but I feel both from later yesterday and today is due to the tired feeling that comes common.

                                                12 hours after vaccine around 3:30am on Saturday I woke up with sever chills, shaking uncontrollably for an hour or 2. I fell back to sleep and woke up about an hour later burning up and sore head to toe. I threw up and had a migraine that lasted the rest of the day. I was able to fall asleep around 6:30am and when I woke up around 9 I was just exhausted, sore all over, nauseous, with a headache. This lasted about a day. On sunday afternoon my toddler lightly hit my right arm where the vaccine was and it became sore, red, and swollen. By the late evening that day the soreness and redness increased. Monday-Thursday the redness and swelling increased to about 2 inches round and felt very tight with a lump in the swelling and it was warm to the touch. By friday the redness and swelling reduced to about an inch, but there is still an inch small lump at the injection site and hurts when anything touches it. The redness has faded and there is no visual bruising.

I came out of it within 10 minutes. 16 hours later I had a 102 fever. Took Tylenol Felt fine 24 hours later 32 hours later I started to get a headache and light sensitivity. Fever back to over 99- low grade for me.  35 hours later I had such a bad headache and light sensitivity. I couldn?t watch tv, be on my phone, or look at a computer screen. I also started to get bouts of nausea. 38 hours later, I vomited for the first time. Same symptoms as what I described last. 42 hours later, I vomited again. 48 hours later - 5 days later, light sensitivity and  migraine symptoms continued , but improved slowly each day.               6 days later, all previous symptoms were gone. I woke up with a bump in my inner eye. Slowly went away throughout the day, then developed a itchy, red bump in between my lips and nose, that progressively got bigger throughout the day and made my lip swell. Bump was about 2 inches in diameter at its biggest. Took Claritin, cleaned face with alcohol, and by 24 hours later it was not noticeable.  8 days later, the bump appeared again in between lip and nose on the opposite side of my face.  Took Benadryl, bump slowly went down throughout the day. By 24 hours later it was gone

Inexplicable fear of being paralyzed and dying ( somewhat delirious overnight)- inability to sleep the evening after the shot.  The full day after the vaccination, body temperature rose--couldn&#39;t stop sweating and had a searing headache. Took tylenol to reduce the symptoms.   The following day (today) had severe dry mouth and very sore throat. Felt about 60% back to normal health. I am a very fit 26 year old (run and exercise daily)

                                                Had no side effects whatsoever for many hours. Felt completely fine until about 7:30 pm, while I was making my plate of dinner. Felt lightheaded, dizzy, and hot. I began to black out, so I sat down, which helped for a few moments to subside lightheadedness. I was still feeling hot, so I walked a few feet to my back door and sat down on the steps outside to cool off. Within minutes, my vision blurred completely, I saw stars, and completely blacked out. My mother, who was nearby, heard me fall on the steps. She said my eyes rolled back, my body was completely limp, I was not breathing but rather making gurgling noises from my throat. She propped my head up, which allowed me to breathe properly, and I came to.   If my mother had not been nearby, I am convinced I would be dead right now. I saw the light, saw the other side, saw my relatives. I have had a near death experience once before, and this was exactly like that.

                                                I had a reaction within 25 mins of J&amp;J vaccine injection- my heart rate quickly went from 100 to 160 which is very abnormal for me and both of my hands were tingling (as were my feet). I felt a little dizzy and it was getting harder to breathe. It lasted for maybe 5- 10 mins and I had to try and do deep breathing techniques which helped a little. It has been almost 5 hours since my vaccine injection and I feel fine.

                                                Within 2 hours of getting the vaccine, I developed a severe migraine, fever(100.1-100.4), chills, dizziness, extreme body aches, nausea and was very weak. Once the bulk of the symptoms subsided, a little under 48 hours after the vaccine was administered, I was able to resume to my daily life. I still have a lingering migraine, arm pain, body aches and a low grade fever of 99.9 now almost 72 hours later, but it is bearable unlike the immediate 48 hours following the vaccine. Over-the-counter medications usually take the edge off of my migraines, though they didn?t even come close to helping the one I currently have. I have been rotating Tylenol and ibuprofen since developing the side effects.

It started with my body freezing and then I started shaking because I felt so cold and I covered up in blankets and a heating pad and still felt extremely cold. Then, the body aches began, and my whole body was very tired. After an hour of sleep, I took my temperature and it was 100.8. That is the highest that it rose to. My normal body temperature is 97.4. This lasted all through the night up until Saturday afternoon around 3:30 PM on 4/10/21.

Besides the body aches and diarrhea on 4/3 and 4/4, On 4/6 I had the worst migraine ever where I lost 1/3 of my vision for about an hour and my right side of my body went numb for about 15 mins. I&#39;ve been having migraines more frequently than I ever have and unsure if it is vaccine related or just extra stress. I have been trying to reduce screen time as much as I can but hard when I work full-time and in grad school and use the computer all the time. I also have been taking motrin/tylenol for the pain and lay down to let the pain pass.

I was extremely tired and the aches had significantly increased so I went to bed at about 8:00pm. When I couldn?t sleep around 9:30pm I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I woke up at around 11:00pm and felt extremely feverish (shivering, entire body extremely soar. My joints hurt so badly that I couldn?t get comfortable) and nauseous. I then had 4 or 5 episodes of violent vomiting throughout the night every 2 or so hours.  After, I would be drenched in sweat.  When I got up *crawled to trash can next to my bed* at around 2:30/3:00AM I took 200mg ibprofin. Felt fatigued and no appetite the next day then was fine

                                                Had typical post vaccine symptoms right after - nausea, muscle aches, chills, fatigue. 5 days after vaccine those appeared to have dissipated. Went for a light walk in the morning. Completely lost vision in both eyes extremely blurry. Stumbled my way home running into trees, cars. Vision came back, thought it was migraine (had them before but nowhere NEAR as bad, never had vision completely blocked)  Excurtating headache behind eyes and nausea, feels like pressure in head. Worst headache of my life, went to ER. Gave morphine (did not help pain at all which was horrifying) got a head CT scan which came out clear and discharged because clotting ruled out. It is now day 6 and my headache is persistent and still excruciatingly painful. I?m also extremely nauseous. I?m terrified because I know something is very wrong. ER doc said might be lingering side effect from vaccine but those effects felt very different.

                                                Around 8:00 pm on Tuesday April 13, 2021 I started to get a really bad headache that was like sharp stabbing pains that would come and go. The next morning I woke up with sharp stabbing pains in the left side of my head and numbness/tingling in the left side of my face. As the day went on I started to feel worse  so I went to the emergency room. The doctor there checked me out and stated that I had Bell&#39;s Palsy and prescribed me three different medications.  I am currently on these medicines trying to get better.

I feel better now though.

It feels like a mild headache where moving makes it worse,  or as if I had a hangover but I don&#39;t. I feel tension in my head. Lying down makes me feel better, as does any position where I&#39;m resting my head. Yesterday I also had a weird feeling in my throat that came and went rhythmically.

                                                The side effects began the night following my vaccine and lasted the entire next day. It began with fatigue/brain fog, then chills and soreness at the injection site. Once the chills began I was very ill with a fever (100-101), severe aches and pains in my body from head to toe, and experienced  occasional shooting pains. Once the fever went away about 30 hours after my vaccine, I still felt pain and heaviness in my body and had a bad headache. The next day (day 3) was much better- I had no fever but still felt some brain fog, drowsiness, and slight muscle soreness (but no pain).   Two weeks after my vaccine (4/20/21)  I had a very similar experience but am not certain it was related to the vaccine. I developed chills, fatigue, and a headache for the majority of the day. In the evening, it progressed to muscle/joint pain, a severe headache, extreme fatigue, and a 100 degree fever. The next day (today 4/21), the fever has subsided and I feel slightly fatigued. Though I am not sure this was related to the vaccine, it mirrored my initial reaction to the vaccine two weeks prior. It is very unusual for me to get a fever in the 100 degree range and typically only happens every two years or so.

The fever and chills lasted through the next day - body ache and soreness throughout both of those days. For those two days I did not work. (Ended the 8th when it was time for me to go to bed.) I did have heart palpitations the night of the 9th that I did go get ER  -they gave me a dose of Ativan and they sent me home. That took care of the heart palpitation symptoms.  I followed up with my provider the following week.

                                                I woke up at 3 am Friday with cold sweats and body aches. Took 1000 mg Tylenol. Woke up again at 10:30 am to a fever still and this odd extremity feeling. Felt like I had a compression body suit on and weight of 50 pounds around my arms and legs, Mild shortness of breath. I felt like I was swollen but did not see any. I called my PCP and vaccine line and both nurses said go to the ER. I went to the ER they ran tests. The time of the ER I started getting leg cramping and spasming. Those symptoms continued to the weekend. On Sunday the weight and swelling feeling went away. I still had bad muscle cramping and swelling. I did telehealth on Tuesday with PCP and was given muscle relaxer which helped some throughout the rest of the week. Thursday night I have a temp pf 99.6 and went up to 100.6 on Friday morning. On Friday I became shortness of breath and fatigued. It became difficult to go up and down stairs or walking about 20 ft without difficulty breathing. I now have a lower right leg muscle twitch/spasm that comes and goes. I switched to a different PCP, he ran more blood work on Wednesday 4/21. And discussed the next steps for treatment and monitoring.

                                                Later in the evening after receiving the vaccine, I experienced a very strong and pounding headache. I took some Ibuprofens and went to sleep around 9pm and the headache was resolved around 11:30pm. However, later during the night the headache came back. Also, my body aches all over and just generally uncomfortable feelings. The injection site felt warm to the touch and sore.

I woke up at 11:55p (8 hours post vaccine, two hours after falling asleep) due to full body chills and shaking. I took two Tylenol. This lasted about 45 minutes. I felt cold but didn?t have a fever.  I kept waking up throughout the night clammy.  I woke up at 5:30a (30 mins earlier than normal) because I couldn?t sleep and had a headache.  I felt sore and achy and very fatigued all day. I took the afternoon off work and came home and slept 3 hours. Still felt groggy and sore after. Felt more normal the next morning. My left arm is still sore two days post vaccination.

I had to go home from work due to these feelings. Eventually, developed into a fever. I went home and the chills and aches worsened. I could not get warm not matter how many layers or blankets I had. I took tylenol and fell asleep after several hours. When I woke up, I was profusely sweaty, my fever  broke. I was able to eat a small lunch and continued to lie down the whole day. My symptoms lessened and were more minimal 24 hours after. After going to sleep the second night, I felt back to normal upon wake up.

                                                I noticed a very mild headache and slight coldness within 2 hours of my vaccine.  Onset of my severe symptoms began around 10PM on 03/12/2021 with a stabbing headache (Felt like someone took an air pump and kept &#39;blowing up&#39; my head. My eyes felt achy and heavy and every time I looked in a different direction I would get a zapping/electric feeling throughout my head that would cause my head and neck to spasm (longer duration) or twitch (quick jolt). This also caused dizziness). I got really cold and had intense shivering and shaking. Around midnight, my skin started feeling bruised all over my body (very sensitive to touch, including my bed sheets against my spine felt like rubbing up against a wound). At the same time, my joints (especially my neck, hips, and knees) got hot to the touch and were incredibly painful (induced tears). My muscles developed a deep ache that also caused significant pain. I felt very weak and confused. I didn&#39;t take my temperature until the early morning, and it was 102.9 at that time. I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen throughout the day, but my temperature stayed between 102 and 103.1 for about 24 hours, as did the previously noted symptoms.   I noticed a gradual improvement of my symptoms over the next two days. On the evening of 03/14/2021, my headache worsened some, and I had an unexpected episode where I nearly passed out (dropped to the floor but stayed conscious). I also had intermittent foot tingling (very noticeable, not mild) over the course of a few hours.   For 3 full days (but by far the most severe within the first 24 hours), I experienced some strange sound processing. Things like the sound of a car driving by or the ceiling fan felt like it echoed throughout my whole body and gave me an uncomfortable shivering feeling.   As of today (03/16/2021), I am mostly recovered. I am still experiencing fatigue, a very mild headache, and some mild pain. My nausea has completely resolved, though that was never a chief complaint of mine.   I realize that some of my symptoms are to be expected with this vaccine. But especially the level of pain I experienced throughout my entire body was very concerning and not something that I was aware could happen as a result of the vaccine.

My muscles were very achey, and my heart was racing. I was slightly nauseous but still able to eat a little. By 24 hours after the shot my fever was down to 99f.  I started to get diarrhea beginning the second day and has lasted until now the third day after vaccination day.

                                                About five hours after the vaccine injection, at around 11 PM, I began to feel cold and achy, which soon led to body chills all over. It felt like I could not get warm no matter how many extra blankets I added. This soon led to a fever. I was in an out of sleep for the next few hours and woke up around 2:30 AM. At that point the fever had broken and I was sweating. I still had body aches, which I think was due to my body being tensed up for some many hours, and I had a splitting headache, as well. At around 4:30 AM, I woke up again, with a very sore arm a terrible headache still. I got up and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. At 7 AM my alarm went off and all adverse effects seemed to be gone other than a sore arm. The sore arm last for about 6 days.

                                                Vaccination appointment was at 1:30 pm on Monday, April 5. I received the shot at around 2:00pm in my left arm. It hurt going in, but quickly dissipated as I moved my arm. I felt fine for the rest of the day. I felt normal the following morning (April 6), but started to feel tired in the early afternoon. I took a nap around 3:00-4:30pm, and woke up feeling slightly hungry. I went to bed around 11:00pm. I woke up the next day (April 7) with a headache. I called in sick to work and stayed in bed as my headache grew worse and nausea began to appear. I threw up for the first time at 11:00am, then again around 11:30am. I emptied my bowels in between these bouts of vomiting, and my stomach was very obviously empty after the second bout. I took a nap from 12:00-2:00pm, after which I threw up at 2:30pm and then again at 3:00pm and again at 3:30pm. I took another nap from 4:00-5:00pm, then threw up again around 5:30pm. I threw up a seventh time around 6:00pm and saw  a couple flecks of blood in my vomit. Each bout was sudden in onset and violent but quick. I think I burst some of the blood vessels in my throat, because it was sore. I called a friend to take me to the ER, and threw up once or twice more while waiting. On the way to the ER, I threw up for the last time. The ER gave me Toradol, Zofran, and two bags of IV fluids. This improved all my symptoms. The next morning, April 8, I felt much better until 12:00pm, when I laid down for a nap and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until 4:30. My headache had returned so I took Advil, then ate some rice. I felt better from 6:00pm onwards.

I managed to doze off for about an hour before I was woken up again by a migraine at midnight; dozed off again, and woke up at around 2 am with a mild fever (around 99.3 degrees). Sometime between the migraine and fever I began to develop terrible body aches as well. The first 24 hours were the worst as I was completely bedridden. The next day, 4/8/21, was better, but the body aches and migraine persisted all day while the fever broke late morning. The third day (today, 4/9/21) everything is feeling better but the migraine is still a persistent issue.

At around 4pm, a mild headache started, and I was experiencing cramping from my chest down to my stomach. I had no appetite that evening. By 8pm, I had a 101.0 fever, and by 9:30pm the cramps were severe in my lower stomach. I was sweating profusely and shaking until I vomited, which helped to relieve some of the stomach pain. Before I vomited, I was in intense pain- possibly some of the worst pain that I have experienced in my life. The sweats and chills alternated throughout the night, and the headache was intense. The next day, the chills, sweats and headache persisted until mid-afternoon, in addition to the occasional stomach pain and diarrhea. The side effects slowly subsided, and I was feeling better by 4/9. The sweating was the longest lasting side effect.

                                                Starting on 4/8/21 around 9:00 PM my body started to feel slightly sore and I had a low grade temperature of 99.6. Throughout the night my body became extremely sensitive and sore especially in my lower back and neck. My temperature also continued to rise to 103.0.  Throughout the day of 4/9/21 I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen on a rotating schedule. My temperature went up and down throughout the day spiking at 105.7 and dropping down to 101.2. Around 10:00 PM it was around 102.9 and my body was becoming even weaker. This morning, now 36 hours after my symptoms started, I can barely lift my arm, my headache has worsened, my total soreness and weakness is no better and my temperature is 102.3.  I have also had trouble with staying hydrated because my skin hurts if it is not covered from the air and I get heavy chills,  but when I cover up I am profusely sweating constantly. The sweat is so bad, I constantly have to lay on a towel and change my clothes.

                                                Around 6 PM (after receiving my shot at around 12:30 PM), I started to feel very tired and slightly achy.  By around 9-10 PM, I had a fever of about 100.5 degrees with pretty severe chills, and my arm had started to hurt VERY badly.  For almost the entire rest of the weekend (from Friday night-Sunday), I was very fatigued and achy and could not lay on my left side due to the soreness in my arm.  The fever seemed to pass by mid-day on Saturday, though, and I was able to go back to work on Monday.  It was not pleasant, but it was totally worth it and a million times better than actually being sick with COVID!

I went to sleep around 9pm but my body was so pain that I couldn&#39;t really fall asleep. The whole body was pain. I didn&#39;t have short breathe but I had to breathe heavily to catch myself. Until 2am my arms, legs, face and head started numbing and I couldn&#39;t even grab anything. My hand were like sprained. That&#39;s when my hunsband has to go buy pain killers for me. He also bought thermometer. I checked my Temperature it&#39;s was ~96F. I took ibuprofen and some milk, bread and egg. The pain and numbing was getting off after ~40min after I took Ibuprofen. Then I was able to sleep on bed.

                                                Was administered covid vaccine J&amp;J  on left arm felt a burning sensation just after it which i knew it normal you just got a vaccine. Walked to the observatory area where we are supposed to wait 15min until you are released to go. Well less than 10 min in the observation area that?s when i started to feel un well my body started sweating excessively and thats when i felt numbness on my right side of my head with a tingling sensation couldn?t hear with my right ear and i freaked out when i started to get blurred vision thats when i knew something was wrong i got up to ask for water once i got up i felt like i was going to faint and felt really dizzy. Once i got to the lady that was there in the observation area  she was shocked at how i looked she told me to go sit down and brought me water as she called the ambulance. Once i was sitting down and was brought water i drank like more than half of the water and the numbness was going down from my right side of my head but still had blurred vision and just felt disoriented and not my self. The ambulance took me to the ER once i got there i felt a little better but still disoriented and dizzy. So disoriented that i left the hospital with me actually realizing i had to stay there to get checked because they kept saying i was fine.

This headache extended down my back and around the back and top of my skull. By 8pm I had began experiencing chills, body aches, and nausea. By 9pm I had a fever and could not stand up without feeling like I was going to vomit. Walking to even get water in the other room gave me motion sickness. I was shaking and sweating with a fever all night, was unable to sleep, and experienced hallucinations due to the high fever. The next morning I still had a fever but could finally sleep. I still had a bad headache, body aches, and nausea. I slept most of the day and my fever went down but was still &gt;100 degrees all day. On Monday, I had a mild fever in the morning which went away by afternoon. I  felt weak all day Monday and still experienced body aches and a headache. By Tuesday, I was only experiencing fatigue and brain fog. This lasted about a week.

As of 4/15 hard lump remains at injection site. 4/6- 12:15pm hives, redness, itching, burning on sides of upper thighs, buttocks, within 2 hours hives spread to backs of arms, all the way down legs. Went to quick care facility at 2:30pm. Waited in waiting room until 3:50pm checked legs with doctor at 4:00pm and little red dots appeared in random clusters down both legs. Doctor assumed folliculitis, prescribed Cephalexin. 5:00pm took 50mg Benadryl while waiting for prescription. Picked up antibiotic around 6:30pm. When I got home around 7:00pm both legs were burning. Discovered huge painful red patches all over both legs. 10:00pm took 50mg Benadryl again. Went to bed 4/7- 9:00am red patches still painful, burning. Took 50mg more Benadryl. Spent most of the day sleeping 4/8- hives gone due to benadryl. Red patches slightly less painful. New red patches/dots appeared on ankles and tops of feet 4/9- red dots spread over tops of feet/toes, new itchy bumps with red dots appeared trailing down the backs of calf area on both legs. 8:30am went back to quick care facility. Saw new doctor who instructed to stop taking antibiotic and switch to cream form of &#34;triamcinolone 0.1%&#34; twice daily. Also referred to dermatology specialist. 3:30pm first application of steroid cream made legs burn and feet/ankles swell. Determined too much was used 4/10-4/13 smaller amount of cream applied twice daily as directed. Burning stopped but feet/ankles still swollen each day 4/13-original large red patches mostly cleared. New red dots on backs of calves and tops of feet still prevalent. 4:00pm saw dermatology specialist who determined red dots were a form of vasculitis. Ordered blood and urine analysis to determine if other organs have been affected. Scheduled appointment with laboratory for 4/17 at 11:00am Other symptoms: dizziness, abdominal pain/pressure, diarrhea at various points throughout the day from 4/9-current

Sunday was dizziness, aches, nausea and cramping in left leg. Monday was nausea, aches, tingling in hands and feet, headache, brain fog. Tuesday I woke up with major imbalance and needed to use walls to walk without falling over. Dizziness subsided after some time to only rapid movements. I had a warm burning sensation in left leg with tingling hands and feet. Moderate headache. Reports came out of stopping the Janssen vaccine so I contacted my doctor with my symptoms and they ordered blood tests for clots.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine at 10:15am. Upon receiving vaccine she sat down on chair to wait for 15 minutes post-vaccination. Just minutes after sitting down patient lost consciousness, fell from chair, hit her head on the floor, seize for a short moment, only to momentarily regain consciousness,  and faint for a second time.  EMS were called and patient was transported to Emergency Department for testing and observation. Patient believes she fainted the first time due to not having eaten much by that point in the day and due to anxiety about receiving the vaccine, and she was told she fainted a second time due to hypotension. She states she has a history of previously fainting during other medical procedures, though no similar previous reactions she can recall after vaccines.

I feel completely better except for the dizziness.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                After the shot I had a pasta lunch and then took a nap for about one hour.  When I woke up ( 3-4 hours after the shot) I had a fever.  I could tell because I was very hot and sweaty even though my room was air conditioned.  I drank water and immediately was nauseous and vomited.  I continued to have sweats, chills, and after about another hour body aches set in.  My whole body was cramping up and my hands were shaky.  I was very short of breath over short movements like to get to the bathroom, I would be out of breath and dizzy.   Around 1700  (6 hours post shot) I took Tylenol and continued to take it every six hours.  I was able to keep ginger ale and crackers down but didn&#39;t eat much else until the next morning.  I think the fever broke in the night.  The next morning I was just really tired and sore, but much less achy than the day prior.   I was able to eat light meals  and I stopped taking Tylenol sometime that mid-morning.  I felt fine the next day (about 48 hours after the shot).

                                                I began to feel shortness of breath when walking, tightness in my chest, for the same reason any physical effort made me feel like I was short of breath. (The day before I had presented the common symptoms such as fever, chills, arm pain, muscle pain) however this symptom was off the list, at 11:30 in the morning I had to go to an emergency clinic, they checked me with blood test, urine tests, medical exam, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. The doctor told me that everything was fine that I could leave. I had to pay a high bill at the hospital. The following 7 days the sensation was disappearing very slowly. However from day 8 it started again, until now on day 13, I still having sensation of shortness of breath when doing physical exercise, it is something that lasts and does not disappear.

                                                a 27 y.o. female with a history of Covid infection December 26, 2020, positive covid test December 29, 2020. She had approximately 2 weeks of symptoms including generalized body ache and generalized weakness.  Fatigue and some headache.  Had some persistence of symptoms after that time.  Had some benefit from ibuprofen.   Was seen at emergency room on January 27, 2021 stating that she felt that all her symptoms of Covid had resolved except for some chest pain which awoke her on January 27.  She presented to the emergency room.  Had sinus tachycardia at 113 but otherwise unremarkable physical exam, laboratory studies with white blood count elevated 16,004-20, hemoglobin 13.7 g hematocrit 41.8%, MCV 87.1, RDW 12.7%, platelet count 329,000, segs 72.8%, lymphs 20.6%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 1%, basophil 0.6%.  BUN 10.1, creatinine 0.8, AST 24, ALT elevated 56, alkaline phosphatase 68, total protein 7.6, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.6, globulin by subtraction 4.0, troponin less than 0.02, D-dimer quantitative 0.22, urine pregnancy test normal.  Chest x-ray normal.  Chest pain appears to be musculoskeletal and was reproduced by palpation of her chest wall.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  D-dimer was normal.  Heart rate returned to normal after some intravenous fluids.  Patient discharged on Zithromax 500 mg day 1 and then to 50 mg days 2 through 5.  Also continued on ibuprofen.   Received Johnson and Johnson vaccine April 5, 2021.  Over the next week patient started having increasing soreness.  Her joints hurt more than usual and her headache was worse.  She had a sensation that her legs were &#34;numb and tingly&#34; starting at her buttocks and extending down her leg.   Because of reported incidence of cerebral sinus thrombosis or cerebral vein thrombosis patient appropriately presented for screening in the emergency room and was sent for appropriate imaging.   April 16, 2021 CT scan of head with and without contrast no acute intracranial hemorrhage, no mass-effect or midline shift.  On contrast-enhanced images there appears to be a lobular nonocclusive filling defect in the far lateral right transverse sinus.  Lobular occlusive filling defect is also likely present in the mid to central right transverse sinus.  Short segment filling defect in the medial left transverse sinus.  Remainder of sinuses and internal cerebral veins are patent.  Focal lobular filling defect within the confluence of the right and transverse sinus most likely related to arachnoid granulation.  No edema hemorrhage of the cerebellum or cerebrum.  No other significant findings.   April 16, 2021 confirmatory MRI angiogram of head without contrast with no restricted diffusion to suggest acute or subacute infarct.  Contrast void in the middle to central right transverse sinus consistent with occlusive thrombus.  Nonocclusive thrombus in the far lateral right transverse thrombus.  Narrowing of the medial left transverse sinus without complete occlusion.   April 16, 2021 2345 hrs. inital hematology consultation.  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels have been requested stat and are still pending.  If fibrinogen level is low will replace with cryoprecipitate.  If D-dimer is elevated barely confirms diagnosis of possible vaccine related thrombosis.  The fact the patient is not thrombocytopenic at this time is encouraging, however despite the lack of thrombocytopenia she still has clearly documented symptomatic nonocclusive and occlusive thrombus in her cerebral sinus.   From UPtoDate.com Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, also referred to as the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine) ? On April 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended pausing administration of AD26.COV2.S  to further investigate rare cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia [33]. As of that date, six cases had been reported, all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination; during this period, 6.8 million doses were administered (with 1.5 million doses in females of that age range) [121-123]. Since some vaccine recipients have not been followed for longer than the time frame over which these symptoms develop, the incidence may change with additional follow-up. Initial symptoms included headache, backache, chills, and fatigue, and progressed to focal neurologic deficits. Intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboses at other sites were also seen in some patients. All of the five patients who were tested for the anti-PF4 HIT antibody tested positive. Another case, in a young male who was a vaccine recipient in one of the pre-emergency use authorization efficacy trials, had been previously reported. These cases appear similar to those reported following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, another adenovirus-vector vaccine. Although rare, the observed number of events exceeded the expected rate among females &lt;50 years old. Given the extreme rarity of these events, the FDA and CDC acknowledge that they recommended the pause out of an abundance of caution and to ensure awareness of these rare events.    ?Evaluation and management of possible thrombotic complications ? Recipients should be aware of the possible association and seek immediate care for signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombocytopenia (eg, new petechiae or bruising) or thrombotic complications (including shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity edema, persistent severe abdominal pain, unabating severe headache, severe backache, new focal neurologic symptoms, and seizures) [117]. In such cases, some experts suggest evaluation with complete blood count and differential (including the platelet count), quantitative D-dimer, HIT testing, and imaging of any suspected site of thrombosis [113,114,125]. Onset 4 to 20 days after vaccination, platelet count &lt;150,000/microL, elevated D-dimer, and a positive anti-PF4 antibody (HIT antibody) suggest the diagnosis. Treatment with a non-heparin/non-warfarin anticoagulant (eg, argatroban or direct oral anticoagulant) and intravenous immune globulin has been suggested. The CDC recommends not using heparin in individuals with thromboses following receipt of Ad26.COV2.S unless HIT testing is negative [126]. (See &#34;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&#34; and &#34;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Terminology and HIT variants&#39; and &#34;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Role of IVIG&#39;.)   As stated above all the 6 cases were &#34;all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination&#34; this would certainly fit the timeframe that we are seeing in this case.  Recommendations from national guidelines would be to start treatment with dexamethasone immediately while awaiting intravenous gammaglobulin.  To pursue intravenous gammaglobulin treatment at 1 g/kg over 1 to 2 days.  It is recommended to avoid heparin and instead use direct factor X inhibitor such as Eliquis, which this patient is already been started on.     There is unfortunately considerable risk that even though patient&#39;s symptoms appear mild at this time, that she may deteriorate in the very near future and I would recommend treating her aggressively at this time with dexamethasone and intravenous gammaglobulin while we are awaiting further testing.  Patient clearly has had unusual thrombosis, especially in a 27-year-old.     With the fact that she had headache dating back to January, it is impossible to determine the acute versus chronic nature of her venous sinus thrombosis. Covid infection does cause increase in coagulation as well.  However, given the small risk of tragic outcome with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis in the setting of Covid vaccinations, we will proceed aggressively with treatment starting tonight with intravenous gammaglobulin and intravenous dexamethasone.     Will require rapid fasting glucoses to evaluate possible hyperglycemia from high-dose dexamethasone.  Will consider stopping dexamethasone at 48 hours.  Current recommendation for gammaglobulin would be single 1 g/kg or 500 mg/kg over 2 days.  No recommendations for treatment beyond this point.  Current recommendations for gammaglobulin dosing would recommend using an adjusted dose for patients with greater than 125% of their ideal body weight.  This patient at 122 kg on a 5 foot 2 inch frame does qualify for adjusted dose and her orders reflect that.   I appreciate the opportunity see this patient this evening and consultation requested by Dr.  We will follow patient in hospital.  Hopefully she will have gradual improvement and avoid any serious or tragic complications of her cerebral sinus thrombosis.     We will have pharmacy report possible adverse reaction to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to the FDA as required by law.   April 17, 2021 follow up. No new events.  Laboratory studies remained excellent.  White blood count is further elevated, however, this may be secondary to high-dose dexamethasone with a white blood count of 16,060.  Hemoglobin 14.0 g hematocrit 42.8%, MCV 86.8, RDW 12.9%.  Platelet count is actually increased slightly at 374 as of 9:10 AM this morning.  Differential shows left shift as expected with dexamethasone.  Results from yesterday showed fibrinogen normal at 369 (180?415) pro time normal at 10.4 seconds with INR of 0.97, PTT 26.7.  D-dimer 0.23 (0.19?0.50).  With platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer normal I am inclined to believe that this is not an acute post vaccination HIT-like phenomena.  If it were I would still expect to see some degree of thrombocytopenia elevated D-dimer and perhaps low fibrinogen.  The other explanations for her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are either idiopathic spontaneous and merely coincidentally associated at the exact same time as her Covid infection or more likely, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulable state secondary to her Covid infection from December 2020.  Unfortunatly there is no way to accurately date the acuity of the venous thrombosis in her cerebral sinus.  HIT Testing is still pending and most likely will not be available for 3-4 more days despite being ordered stat.  Have called the laboratory and asked them to check with our outside reference lab what the expected return time is on this test. (LabCorp says &#34;Tuesday April 20, 2021).  Patient refused intravenous gammaglobulin infusion which has been ordered last night.  Patient has been receiving dexamethasone which was a bridge until intravenous gammaglobulin could be administered.  Current guidance from the expert hematology panel (EHP) on Covid vaccine induced thrombosis dated April 7, 2021 from the  public health would state that a patient who has a reduced platelet count without thrombosis with a D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen or thrombosis with a normal platelet count and D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen are &#34;unlikely cases&#34;.  They recommend for probable cases who have D-dimers that are elevated to send HIT assay and then give immediate intravenous gammaglobulin while awaiting results.  They recommend fibrinogen supplementation, if needed.  They recommend a direct acting antithrombin agents such as the Eliquis this patient is receiving.  They recommend steroids particularly if there is a delay in getting intravenous gammaglobulin delivered.  With the fact that we now have 24 hours in the hospital with no evidence of thrombocytopenia, no evidence of increased fibrinolytic activity or active thrombosis, and no evidence of hypofibrinogenemia, I would argue that her presentation is subacute.  In this setting, I do not feel intravenous gammaglobulin would be necessary and does involve a small risk as well as considerable cost.  Dexamethasone also involves small risk and negligible cost. I have discontinued both of these medications.  My overall impression would be that this was not related to her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination which was recent, but rather her more distant Covid infection.  It is impossible to definitively answer the question however.  The next question is duration of anticoagulation.  Risk of recurrent cerebral sinus venous thrombosis is relatively small but the morbidity can be high.  Studies have been performed showing medications in the same class as Eliquis have been associated with a decrease in incidence of the recurrence.  Most hematologist recommend 3 months of anticoagulation for provoked venous thrombosis including cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.  I feel this patient&#39;s thrombosis is &#34;provoked&#34;, with her association at the same time of her Covid infection (and possibly vaccination).  I would recommend Eliquis (apixaban) 5 mg twice daily or Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 20 mg daily with food. I would feel comfortable in discharging patient for outpatient follow up IF Dr and other speciality services agree. Plan 3 months of full dose anticoagulation with direct factor X inhibitor.   Circulation 2010 Jun 29;121(25):2740-6 &#34;Long-term evaluation of the risk of recurrence after cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis&#34;, Background: The clinical course of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis (CSVT) is largely unknown because prospective studies with a long follow-up and with the goal to assess thrombosis recurrence rate and predisposing factors for recurrence are lacking. Methods and results: One hundred forty-five patients with a first CSVT were followed up for a median of 6 years after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. End points were recurrent CSVT or other clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism. CSVT recurred in 5 patients (3%) and other manifestations of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism) were seen in 10 additional patients (7%), for a recurrence rate of 2.03 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.14) for all manifestations of venous thromboembolism and 0.53 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 1.10) for CSVT. Nearly half of the recurrences occurred within the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis were male sex (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.86 to 32.7) and, for thromboses other than CSVT, severe thrombophilia resulting from antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency, anti-phospholipid antibodies, or combined abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 16.5). Conclusions: The risk of recurrent CSVT is low and is higher in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment and among men. Mild thrombophilia abnormalities are not associated with recurrent CSVT, but severe thrombophilia entails an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism.   April 19, 2021 Follow up, no change in condition. Discussed case with Dr, will order Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, anti phospholipid and anti cardiolipin antibodies, if she will allow draw. Expect Heparin Induced Thrombosis testing result tomorrow, but with no thrombocytopenia after given heparin, expect will be normal. Will await result. If discharged, would recommend 3 months direct thrombin inhibitor (Eliquis/Xarelto/Pradaxa) at full anticoagulation dose. Then stop, no taper. Overall still feel &#34;provoked&#34; thrombosis due to December Covid, unrelated to J&amp;J Covid vaccine, but can not definitively prove that..

                                                Continued and persistent pain in hips, back of thighs, and down my calves. There is a cramping sensation in my calves. Head pressure and sinuses are filled. I do not have a history of allergies or sinus issues. My main concern is the leg cramping/inflammation. I am 22-days post vaccine and still have this symptom.

                                                Immediately experienced pain and soreness in arm upon administration of vaccine.  Started experiencing additional side effects 9-10 hours after vaccine administration:  at night I developed a severe migraine, nausea and chills.   When I woke up the next morning, I still had a migraine, my nausea was less apparent, but I did begin to experience fatigue/exhaustion and muscle aches.  I&#39;ve experienced chills and hot flashes in waves throughout March 11th.  I took my temperature for the first time at 4PM on March 11th and I have a low grade fever of 99.6. degrees Fahrenheit.

My heart rate seems a little elevated and I am experiencing sensitivity and body aches. I have taken naproxen and acetaminophen. It is now 4 hours since symptom onset and I have not gotten much relief, if any. I would describe my symptoms as moderate.

I did notice my Raynaud?s symptoms became way worse.  At about 5:30pm I started to feel extremely cold. By 6pm I was having horrible pains and spasms in my lower back and hips. My muscles and joints became very stiff. This moved to my neck/shoulders, and down my thighs. I lost feeling in my feet and started struggling to be able to take in a full breath. I felt like my whole body was locked up. I started feeling nauseous, but part of that may have been from the nerves. The next morning I felt a bit more mobile but still nauseous and stiff. I have slowly gotten better throughout the day, but am still stiff and exhausted

A few nurses arrived immediately including this RN. She became dizzy, nauseated. Emesis bag but no vomiting occurred.

                                                About 7-8 minutes later I started feeling pressure in the  right side of my head. It went away a bit. I was walking after the 15 minutes and started feeling weird in my face, I just sat in my car and waited because I had to drive.  I started feeling numbness under my eye and down the rest of my face. The thing that worried me the most I had so much pressure under my eye like it was inside my brain.  The numbness and pain caused me to freak out.  I went to back to the convention center to let them know, they brought the Paramedic to me they started checking me and doing a work up. They told me I wasn&#39;t a life threatening emergency and my vitals were ok. They offered to take me to the ER and I declined and I decided to leave because I have been there for 1hr 45mins. I felt like my symptoms were at 70%. When I got home I freaked out again because the numbness didn&#39;t go away and my face looked like it was a little lower and had a panic attack and went to the ER. They checked on me and told me I didn&#39;t have a stroke. They told me It was a side effect to the vaccine. They told me to follow up with the Neurologist if I have any more symptoms, I have an appointment with them in a couple weeks. I&#39;m a little concerned because there is a minor pain that I didn&#39;t have before on my right side and it worries me.

My husband stacked 10&#43; blankets on top of me trying to get me to warm up.  I was running a fever of 103, and my heart rate was at 104 all night long.  My fever didn&#39;t break until shortly before 8:00 a.m. on Monday, March 15, 2021 but my heart rate stayed between 95 - 102 most of the day.  The body aches weren&#39;t too terrible, but I did have those.  I have bruising, puffiness, and swelling at the injection site.

                                                I had immediate soreness at the injection site. Later that evening around 9:30 I felt very weak and shakey. I had a bad headache, fever, chills, muscle aches, and nausea. I couldn&#39;t hold down water of food. At 10am the following day (3/21) I was able to take aTylenol and the fever came down. So far, I have taken Tylenol throughout the day and kept the fever down, however I still get bad night sweats and muscle aches. Today (3/23) I feel a little off, but much better.

I slept from 3:45 to 4:30 pm but was still tired and felt weak. I did feel hungry and made dinner over 30 minutes. However, this wore me out. I was even more tired and started getting dizzy. I almost fainted as I made my way to a chair to sit down. I couldn&#39;t eat because of slight nausea and cold chills. I was shaking for about 20 minutes. Eventually, I made it to my bed to lay down, but my legs were shaking as I walked up the stairs. At 6:00 pm, my temperature was 98.8 F. I was freezing a shivering for the next hour in bed under 3 blankets. My hands and feet felt like ice. At 8:00 pm, I had a fever of 100.2  F that lasted all night. My body ached all over, especially at the hips. I couldn&#39;t sit still and couldn&#39;t sleep until 4:00 am. I woke at 8:30 am with some milder aches and fatigue with a temperature of 97.6 F.

                                                I awoke at 6:45 a.m. feeling a bit sore in my arm, but relatively okay.  I was up for approximately ten minutes and then extended my arms over my head to stretch out some of the achiness and immediately regretted the action.  I began to feel dizzy and nauseous and saw black spots encroaching on my peripheral vision.  I washed my face to relieve some discomfort with no change.  I walked toward the bedroom to grab my glass of water when the black spots increased, clouded my entire vision, and I collapsed on the bed.  I then began to hyper-salivate and after waking my husband and catching my breath, I returned to bathroom, experienced diarrhea, and simultaneously vomited into the trash can.  The vomit tasted chemical and extremely acidic.  My body was also shaking uncontrollably during this time and I kept switching between chills and being too hot.  After I felt comfortable leaving the bathroom, I crawled back in bed but was shaking so much that I couldn&#39;t stop my teeth from chattering and could not get warm no matter that my husband placed an extra blanket over me.  I had taken my temperature before while I was in the bathroom and it read 94.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  I took it again in bed about twenty minutes later and it read 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  My head was splitting and my arm ached, but I was eventually able to go back to sleep.  I felt better after sleeping for a few hours and drinking more fluids.

                                                Around 4 pm I was starting to feel a little sore. By 4:30 pm I had some major chills that turned into hot flashes. At around 4:30 pm I took 400mg of Ibuprofen. For 1 hour I was fighting a fever and chill spells that rapidly changed during that 1 hour time period, ending at 5:30 pm. Within that time I had major acks in my back and neck. I also experience sinus pressure and pins and needs in my ears and behind my ears. After 5:30 pm I did feel significantly better and now are 8:00 pm I feel exhausted, my head hurts and my ears feel like they weigh a pound each. Hope that was helpful. Thanks for doing what you&#39;re doing.

                                                After receiving the shot, I was required to sit down for 15 minutes. About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

I was given benadryl  a steroid and a antihistamine there.

                                                I had the Janssen covid shot yesterday. The shot stung a little and made my arm sore. Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

Later that day (around 6:00pm) I started feeling lightheaded, chills and a headache. My hands, feet, nose and hands were freezing but other areas of my body were warm. I also felt body aches- my lower back started with the aches and it spread up to my upper neck. Around 9:00pm I started feeling very hot and this hot/cold changes continued throughout the night. This morning of 4/9/2021 I have less of a headache however, my body is still very sore and I continue to experience the hot/cold changes.

Headache and nausea about four hours after shot. Fever of 102.6 about 7 hours after shot accompanied by chills/shaking worse than any fever I?ve had. Tylenol was taken around time of headache which may have delayed the fever and chills. Tylenol and ibuprofen were taken simultaneously every 5 hours starting that evening and throughout the night and all the next day. Food consumption was minimal due to nausea but hydration  was maintained.

                                                Patient with previous hx of seizure disorder started convulsing within 10 minutes of vaccination, fell to the ground and convulsed for approximately 7 minutes. Convulsions reduced significantly and patient was coherent without post-ictal state. EMS was called and she was taken to nearby hospital for further evaluation. Patient had reportedly taken ativan and depakote this morning prior to arrival.

By 7am when I got out of bed, it felt like a truck hit me. I had a major headache, very fatigue, fever (checked at this point and it was 101), nausea, hotness/chills. By 12pm, I had an 100 degree fever, chills/hotness, and headache. By 6pm, I was only tired. Next day, I was back to normal with a little soreness in my injection arm.

PT with her mother, became light-headed and dizzy while walking from vaccination site back to vehicle for 15 minute wait. PT became unresponsive with mother and fainted.  Parking staff alerted rapid response team, PT regained responsiveness and was given chair to sit on, water to drink.  Rapid response team arrived to a responsive, A&amp;Ox4, pale female who was still feeling weak and light-headed.  PT was transferred to a cot (in the shade) where she was placed in supine position with legs elevated on a chair.  Pt was given water and hard candy to suck on while vitals were taken,,  Airway, breathing and circulation were all WNL.     PT states she presently has a strep infection (throat area)  and has been afebrile, and is to begin oral antibiotics once she picks RX up from pharmacy.     PT began feeling significantly better over 10-15 minutes of laying down in the shade.    EMS LAFD was called and transfer of care to EMS Station 93 for further work-up was instituted.  PT felt much better and was able to stand and ambulate from cot to EMS vehicle without issue.    PT chose to go home with her mother instead of being transported by EMS to medical facility.      Exam (update as needed): GEN: Alert and oriented x 4, relaxed in appearance.

After layering up it took about 30 minutes for shaking to fully subside and maybe 2-3 hours for body temperature to feel hot. Had headache and dry mouth the rest of the night into the early morning.   Took 400mg ibuprofen after having a morning meal and experienced no other side effects going forward except some tiredness from not getting a full nights rest.

                                                Chills and fever were accompanied by sharp joint pains,  severe throbbing and pulsating headaches (primarily on the upper right side) and migraines that developing into throbbing and pulsing in the entire body lasting for 10 hours; three fever cycles and the first lasted 10 hours before the fever broke in a sweat; I could not sleep the entirety of the first night and experienced hourly urination and intense dehydration. After first fever cycle I was alert for an hour before second cycle began; after third cycle symptoms changed to nausea and dizziness that prevented me from being mobile without assistance or upright for more than a few minutes, by Saturday evening symptoms went away and I could resume eating, drinking, and walking again

                                                I had the usual fever that began in evening around 8pm, but before that I started developing leg cramping like growing pains behind my left knee. The growing pains persisted behind the left knee for two full days (requiring me to take Tylenol to sleep), then it began behind my right knee, as well. That lasted another 24 hours before the growing pains expanded to both calves, as well. The pain persisted for an entire week and would wake me up in the mornings. I began stretching and working out and now the soreness from my work outs mostly masks the growing pains. I believe today is the first day I am not experiencing the growing pains.

The shaking (extremely bad, could not control my own muscles at all and I had to lay on my arms so they wouldn&#39;t flail out) and racing heart lasted about five hours. The headache and all over muscle pain finally eased up last night. Breathing aches and I am still experiencing muscle weakness.

I sweated through all of the clothes and soaked the chair I was sitting in.  That night around 7 pm I got a migraine and felt really fatigued I couldn&#39;t stay awake and I was really sore. My chest hurt and so did my head. I was nauseated to no end The next day was worse. All day I couldn&#39;t stay awake. I felt so sore and sick to my stomach and I coint move too much because I was super dizzy. The next day I was still sick and dizzy  By day four I felt fine just dizzy.

I started feeling nauseous about an hour later. Then at about 9:00 pm, I started to feel really sick. I felt very tired and my whole body hurt. I had a low body temperature, 95 degrees. Chills, fever, shaking, nausea. Very SEVERE symptoms. Felt very disoriented. I thought I was going to pass out and faint. Vision blurry and seen white.  Pounding headache. Ears ringing. I could hardly walk that night, I was crawling on the floor. I felt out of breath. My heart was beating very fast. My left side of my chest hurt by my ribs. When I did wake up from sleep, I woke up with blood in my mouth and dried blood on my lips.

My muscles stiffened and my hands/thumbs were cramping inward. My hands were also red and blotchy during this time. My face was tight and hard to move or talk. This entire incident lasted in total around 20 minutes or so. I seem to be okay since that incident, I have had a headache off and on. Not sure if it?s related to the vaccine but I haven?t experienced anything like this before.

I was wearing a fitbit and then noticed my heart Rate went up to the 90s and fluctuated between 90-110 bpm all night into the next morning.  I woke up every 2 hours  to a new symptom on top of what I was feeling already. It started with chills, then sweating, nausea and  a headache. I had a fever of 99.5 at the highest. And then the last time I woke up at 5 my heart hurt so bad, my whole chest muscle hurt with a sharp pain and It hurt to breath.  The next day I had a little headache and my body hurt, and I had cramping in my legs for a few days, but I also started my menstrual cycle on the 13th.  The leg cramping continued for a few days but only when I sat on my legs for too long.

                                                I received the shot on Saturday, March 6th. Flu-like symptoms developed 12 hours after (aches, chills, extreme fatigue) and lasted about 12 hours -- pain in left arm lasted a full five days. On Thursday March 11th I started to develop a cold sore on my chin which was followed by malaise and swollen glands. I treated it with Zovirax. On Wednesday March 17th I developed what looked to be a pimple in the middle of my left eyelid. There was a small white/ fluid filled head about the size of a pin head. Over the next three days, three more fluid-like blisters the size of a pin-head began to develop on upper eyelid. By Tuesday March 23rd, I had over half a dozen fluid filled blisters that were painful and began to crust. The blisters extended from upper eyelid to below the brow (only on left side of face). On Tuesday March 23rd I went to the eye doctor. The eye doctor had asked if I ever had shingles (I have had the chicken pox vaccine, but never had chicken pox nor shingles). I have had HSV-1 since childhood and get the yearly cold-sore when stressed or immunity is low, but I never have had cold sores appear anywhere else other than lip/chin area. The doctor had suspected the eye blisters were a form of herpes and prescribed me 14 days of Valacyclovir. The blisters only affected the skin-- not the cornea or inside eye. Within a day and a half of the antivirals medication, the blisters were fully crusted over and started to clear up.

                                                Severe headache for two days. Extreme chills, nausea, cold sweats, fatigue for three days. On the third day previous symptoms went away and I got an extreme head cold, congestion, tiredness, lethargic. My varicose veins have been midly painful but it might be from laying all day for a week. On day five I started my menstrual cycle two weeks early, it was completely black and clumpy (not normal). It is now day 10 and I still have a slight cold, very tired, and am still on my period.

                                                At the time of injection, it was pretty painful and thus sent my body into a shock less than 5 mins after receiving my dose. My vision went white and I was very light-headed and hot/sweaty.  A nurse came with me outside to monitor and I was feeling back to normal in 15 minutes. This is something that happens when I experience a high amount of pain, so just reporting for others who maybe have low blood pressure issues.  At about 8pm, other side effects started to set in. I first experienced a headache, then experienced soreness/ache-y-ness  in my back. Around 8:30, I started to feel light headed again and soon my whole body felt ache-y. I quickly developed chills where I felt so cold that I was uncontrollably shaking and felt very sore/stiff. I have been laying under a heated blanket for the last hour and a half and am finally feeling better with no more shaking  or chills. I still have soreness throughout my body and a headache, but I took ibuprofen around 8:30pm.

Around 9 pm I started experiencing extreme body aches all over that felt like my body was &#34;fighting&#34; against itself. I also experienced chills. I had a hard time sleeping from the pain. The next morning a headache started and progressed into a migraine. I could not get up or open my eyes from how bad the migraine was. I took extra strength Tylenol for the pain with little relief. On Saturday evening the symptoms started to get better and turned more into a headache. I still had the headache on Sunday but it was better after taking the Tylenol. On Monday my arm is now sore (it wasn&#39;t sore prior).

                                                Around 3:15 in the afternoon, I began experiencing severe aches and muscle pains, combined with a growing migraine. Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

Fever is continuing today (3/11/2021), but is lower at 100.4F. Tingling fingers on hand from vaccination arm (left), swelling from vaccination injection site, headache, and neck pain all developed on 3/10/2021.  Headache and neck pain could be due to head trauma from vasovagal syncope. Tingling fingers were not observed on 3/11/2021.    *I have had vasovagal syncope in the past, but never with vaccines. It always occurs when I see my own blood.

                                                I started feeling subtle flu-like symptoms about 6 hours after receiving shot. At first I thought it was in my head but by the early evening I felt like I had a full blown fever even though I never actually had a fever at any point.  I had chills, muscles aches, head aches, and extreme fatigue. My back hurt especially and overall I felt very weak. I also had pain at the injection site that got worse the following day. I had trouble even lifting my arm to reach a drink just a few feet away from me.  The arm soreness lasted through the Monday following my vaccination (I received it on a Friday). All my symptoms were at their worst on Saturday. I felt much better on Sunday but still had the arm pain through Monday. Motrin did help relieve the worst my symptoms. I thought that was the end of my symptoms but that last week I have noticed what I believe to be a lingering fatigue from the vaccination. While it&#39;s not usual for me to feel tired at points throughout the day, I have been feeling a heavier and more full body fatigue than I usually experience. I have had to take naps more often, sometimes multiple times in a day.  During these bouts of fatigue, my whole body feels heavy and somewhat weak. It&#39;s similar to the exhausted feeling someone might have after they&#39;ve been crying for a while but I haven&#39;t been crying or emotionally taxed in anyway.  Normally when I wake up in the morning, I might feel tired for the first 30 minutes to an hour but once I get moving, I feel better and more alter. I have been having a harder time feeling rested or awake in the mornings and even if I get more sleep than normal, I still feel exhausted. I did not change my routine or diet which I why I think this is related to the vaccine.

After taking some Advil my lips returned to normal and the body shakes stopped although it was hard to regulate my body temperature. I was sweating but felt cold. The worst of the symptoms seemed to last around 13 hours after they had started (so about 7pm on 3/25 to about 8am on 3/26). It&#39;s now been around 30 hours and I&#39;m feeling better but still fatigued and have soreness in my left arm where I received the injection.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

                                                I began to feel bad 6 hours after the application of the vaccine with chills, stiffness, muscle and body pain. I already imagined that the fever was starting. 3 hours later I got home and took my temperature, it was 101 F.   the fever lasted more than 15 hours. I didn?t  take any medication. I put cold cloths on my head, bathed and rested. the headache was very intense. So far I have discomfort from that but the fever has already stopped. The most striking thing was the allergic reaction that I began to have around midnight and it continued until today. they were hives all over the body. swelling and itching and redness. Finally after 24hs after vaccine I took an anti allergy called levocetirizine  cause itching won?t stop.

Noticed a red welt at injection site (bright red, hot to the touch, swollen) 4/7 - red welt inflamed, still hot, sore, became incredibly itchy, whole arm uncomfortable and hurting. All other symptoms gone 4/8 - Inflammation of welt partially faded but red irritation spread out like it was dispersing. Later became darker red, still itching, began to hurt so much that even light fabric brushing across the skin caused pain. Still very warm to the touch. Doctor diagnosed the welt as Cellulitis and immediately issued an antibiotic.

It&#39;s particularly bad in my legs, knees, and elbows. There&#39;s also a fever but the pain is much worse.  I have a high pain tolerance but I&#39;m not kidding when I say this is unbearable. Breaking a bone hurts less. Actual COVID hurt less. This is agony.

The fever got worse overnight and I woke up repeatedly with a higher than normal heart rate and a severe migraine that lasted throughout the next day. I took Tylenol (two doses, 12 hours apart) to some relief.

                                                Patient was sitting down and started to feel dizzy and her vision was starting to become blurry. She got up to let us know that she was having a reaction and fainted. She was awake immediately after she fell and said that she was experiencing the blurred vision still, extremely sweaty/hot flashes, and ringing in her ears. She drank some water and sat down for a little bit and started to feel better.

I then had severe flu like symptoms overnight, including chills, and feeling hot and cold at the same time.  I woke up with a headache. I had muscle pains through the entire ordeal.  At 7am the next day, I took 600mg of ibuprofen and took a walk. I then felt fine.

Fever would not break until later that evening even when taking one Tylenol every four hours. Day two I couldn&#39;t tell if I was actually looking at myself in the mirror. I was dizzy and felt high. I could not remember simple tasks I just did like washing my face in the shower. I felt like I was hallucinating. I went to urgent care and they had no recommendations. I was to take the LSAT today, Saturday, April 9. I had to cancel it because I&#39;m still not fully coherent. I still feel dazed and out of it. I tried to go to work yesterday and old lasted an hour. I had a COVID test performed yesterday on my own accord, not per the request of urgent care, just in case I caught it prior to the vaccine without knowing, and it was negative. I can remember things now at least but I&#39;m still not mentally coherent. It&#39;s a scary feeling. I am about three and a half days post vaccine and slowly becoming myself again. I still feel dazed but I am able to have a conversation and remember it.

                                                My daughter, although has cognitive issues, has not ever displayed any adverse behavior.  We first noticed some unusual behavior on March 31st 2021.  Three days later, on April 3rd, her behavior became more noticeable and unusual for her.  She was saying things that didn&#39;t make any sense and wasn&#39;t sleeping well or not at all.  On Sunday April 4th, her behavior intensified into delusions and hallucinations.  She was talking to people not there and making bizarre statements.  She was taken to emergency hospital late Sunday night and given a blood and urine test and sent home.  By Monday morning, she had not slept the entire night and was shouting out, trying to leave the house and her hallucinations and delusions had intensified.  We took her to Emergency room, where she was diagnosed with psychotic behavior and was admitted to the psychiatric ward.  She is expected to be released today, April 11th, 2021.

Once I was done freezing and with the fever it felt like my skin was on fire. I was in so much pain that night that I couldn&#39;t move without crying. After I slept that night and about 7 hours the next day I finally started to feel better.

                                                I had immediate soreness after the vaccine does. Then at 7pm of the evening after getting my vaccine, I began to feel weak, get chills, and run a low grade fever. At midnight, my fever had increased to 101 and I began taking Tylenol (recommended by Pharmacy). I had sever body aches, muscle fatigue, joint paint, chills and nausea through the night and the next day. In the morning, I had excruciating pain in my abdomen and began vomitting. Later that  day, my fever increased to 102.7 (with Tylenol) and I called my regular doctor. She told me to continue to monitor and if my fever did not decrease by 7pm to go the hospital. Finally, my fever decreased to 101, muscle aches, chills and joint pain continued. I began vomitting uncontrollably for a short period of time. I was very dizzy and weak the remainder of the day. Saturday, my fever finally broke (I sweated all day) but my body was still weak and sore. I also had dizzy spells on and off. Sunday, I felt much better but was still very tired compared to my normal self. I had abdomen pain and burning on and off. I also got hive on my hands Sunday afternoon. After Benadryl, the hives went away but I still felt itchy all over.  Today (Monday), I still don&#39;t feel like myself, but it is the best I have felt since receiving the vaccine. I have never experienced anything like this and was miserable Thursday night, Friday and some of Saturday. It truly was a terrible experience.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt bad enough to go to the Emergency Room, I did not go because I was hoping it would pass,  I felt 100 times worse than I did when I had Covid.  I had full body chills, I was shaking back and forth, my head was pounding so hard it felt like someone had a hammer to it, I got in a hot bath and it felt ice cold to me, I was throwing up, couldnt lay down because every part of my body that was touching something was in terrible pain.  Could not sleep.  The next day I had all of the same symptoms except I was sweating a lot along with everything else.  These symptoms lasted three full days.  It has now been exactly three week, I still have pain in my arm the shot was is, it hurts to raise it.  I also still have an incredibly awful headache that will not go away, I hadn&#39;t had a headache is years and years prior to this, I overall have not felt well ever since I got the shot and my reaction was incredibly awful.  Now I have concerns about my headache and body aches that still are not subsiding.

My back began to hurt and that then moved into my neck and muscles as a whole with a little headache. The next morning I took Tylenol which I then started to feel a little better but  then at approx 3PM, my muscles began to hurt again, I took another tylenol which did not seem to help and felt nauseated. I then took a shower hoping it would help, but instead thew up after getting out. For the remainder of the night - my overall body felt week and standing up for long periods, I felt dizzy.

                                                Headache (turned into a migraine), extremely drained of energy, lack of appetite, and felt off all day (4/9/21). The next morning (4/10/21) felt the same as the day before, however, had several episodes where I would get really light headed, dizzy, and nauseous. Went to Home Depot at 2:15pm (4/10) and while there my vision blurred and started to fade, I had ringing in my ears and couldn?t hear out of the right and barely was able to hear out of the left. I got very nauseous and I couldn?t breath. I managed to sit on something and put my head between my legs that helped. Fortunately my step- dad was with me and helped me outside while I could barely see and hear and he stated I was very pale. I was having a hard time talking or being conherent. Once outside the symptoms slowly cleared over about the next 6-7 hours. At 4:45pm my mom decided to take me to the doctor but the walk in had just closed and I went to the ER. They stated I had elevated d-dime and did a chest CT scan  to check for blood clots around 7:30pm (I believe not sure exact time) doctor stated they came back clear but when asked if he suspected that the episode and symptoms were due to a dissipated blood clot he would not directly answer it. I overheard him dictating his notes and he started he beloved as such. I have never experienced anything like this before. I still felt drained, headache (migraine), occasionally dizzy, and lack of appetite (4/11/21, 4/12/21) and still currently feel the same drained, migraine, lack of appetite, and occasionally dizzy.

                                                Woke up between 10:30 and 11pm night of vaccine administration with full body shaking and shortness of breath. It?s unclear if shortness of breath was a direct result of the severity or the shaking or something else underlying the shakes. Walking or standing for any period of time was nearly impossible. I felt too warm and too cold at the same time and felt myself sweating but also shivering. My temperature was 99.6 (high for me - I?m usually low, around 96-97 on average) which persisted until around 5:30-6am the following morning. A severely painful, throbbing headache was present until well into the next evening. The symptoms of the headache did subside with use of OTC extra strength Tylenol (2 oral every 6 hours, taken twice totally 4 over the course of 24 hrs) but the headache was still felt somewhat even with use of Tylenol. Moderate fatigue was present all of 4/9 and until around mid morning of 4/10. Pain at the injection site was present but only noticed if laying on the affected arm (left) or if the site was accidentally touched. Dull aching at the site was felt on occasion until the following Monday, 4/12. All other symptoms had fully subsided by 4/10. As of today, 4/13, I am symptom free but I have noticed that I am taking deep breaths every once in a while (maybe several times an hour) as if I?m trying to catch my breath/I can?t catch a full satisfying breath. It feels somewhat like breathing through a straw for a few moments and I breath in until a full breath ?catchs?.

My left arm was tingling , this lasted the rest of the night. The next day i experienced numbness/tingling and dull aching pain in my elbow, down my arm to my palm and two fingers (middle and ring). This has been intermittent for a week now, really effecting me while i drive and work as a travel nurse.

In the early morning I also got stomachache cramps and felt hungry, but food didn?t help. It actually made me feel nauseous. By 6am the next day I had a serious migraine too - sensitivity to light. My eyes hurt. It actually was so bad I caved and took 2 liquid Advil?s to help with the pain. From there I slowly got better over the day but still had the above mentioned symptoms, just less intense. Around 8pm the fever came back and I called it a night.  Next morning I felt better, but still tired. Still had a headache but not a migraine. And occasional stomach aches. It?s now 2 days later and the head aches, arm soreness and occasional stomach aches have not gone away.

                                                Got my vaccine on Monday in my right arm. On Thursday morning I had blurry spots in my eyes that lasted a couple of hours. It almost felt like i had something in my eyes. I kept rubbing and checking them. I called my primary care doctor and the office told me he would call me back. An hour later the blurs went away but the right side of my face down my neck had a numbing sensation. My right ear also felt like it need to be ?popped? like when on a plane that wouldn?t go away. Wasn?t completely numb but felt numb. When my doctor called me back i told him my symptoms and he told me to go to the emergency room. They ran blood work and did a CT and saw nothing abnormal beside my iron was a little low but I?m pregnant so that wasn?t surprising. I left not really knowing why I?m feeling this in my face. It still has that numbing feeling. And Friday i had a 10 minute nose bleed on my right side where I?m feeling the numbness.

                                                Headache that night of the shot (within an hour or two of the shot). That lasted until Thursday evening and going into Friday. I didn&#39;t wake up with it. I took 600 mg of Ibuprofen at bedtime on Wednesday. Didn&#39;t wake up with the headache Thursday. I started getting  body aches all over my body on Wednesday and they got worse until about 2:30 and I took a 15 min nap and woke up and felt a little better but I had them all the way to bedtime. And I was cold. That was until 1:00 PM on Wednesday. Wednesday night at 06:00 pm, on my left foot from arch to my toes I had a hot sensation. I thought one of my pets had pied on my foot - hot and wet feeling. But they didn&#39;t. That  has been happening frequently and intermittently and I am still experiencing them. The level of heat has decreased - it it warm and wet instead of hot and wet feeling. Happens frequently throughout the day. On Friday, I noticed, I had a rash on my left forearm. I noticed it on Friday evening and that went away on Thursday of last week after I was able to be hydrocortisone ointment on it for a few days. The rash was really itchy.

                                                My first side effects were fatigue and feeling ?out of it?, which started about 2 hours after the injection. At 7 hours after my left leg became numb and a little sore. I started to notice a feverish, tingly feeling on my skin and this would last at least 24 hours. These symptoms quickly spread through my whole lower body. The chills and intense body aches started at 11 pm. I woke up at 2 am that night and had a low grade fever 99.9 F. I took 2 pills of Tylenol. The fever broke around 3:30 or 4 am and I slept through the rest of the night. The next morning 3/09, I felt fatigue, slow, and woozy. I still had chills and muscle aches, although the intensity was less. Halfway through the day the chills intensified, the muscle aches became more severe, and my eyeballs felt like they were burning in the back of my head. By that evening, the fever was back and I couldn?t think straight. My legs ached with a pain that I?ve never felt before. I did not have a severe headache, but I felt that if I exerted myself too much I would get one. My partner said I could barely form coherent sentences, and I was so weak I couldn?t sit up straight. I took 2 more Tylenol that night, went to bed and slept through the whole night. The morning of 3/10 I woke up feeling tired but my skin did not have that feverish feeling. I was no longer sick. On 3/11 I woke up and did my normal morning routine. I ate an egg, some of a Nutella stuffed scone, and drank coffee and water. I took my 3 pills, loratadine, omeprazole, and a probiotic, and I had a severe allergic reaction within 5 minutes of taking the pills. For the next 10 minutes my breathing became labored and wheezy. I experienced severe eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms. For the next week, my EoE symptoms were heightened. I had a reaction after drinking a seltzer water, which does not usually affect me. Within 2 weeks I was back to normal and to my knowledge have not experienced any other related side effects.

Felt lethargic and fatigue for approximately 48 hours after the vaccine. Also had some menstrual bleeding which was brief on 3/5/21, which was the date of the vaccine, and this was not expected. Alternated Tylenol and Ibuprofen after vaccine to help lower fever, and drank fluids.

I went to the restroom and on the way back I passed out and was unresponsive for a few seconds (10-20 seconds). I have since being running a fever, breaking out in a sweat, had a severe migraine, and body aches and joint aches. It has been over 24 hours since the vaccine and am still having side affects.

Around 8:15pm, I started to develop chills. From there, I developed a fever, headache, neck soreness and body aches in my joints (particularly wrists, knees, elbows). I contained the fever with extra strength Tylenol taken according to the box instructions. The fever broke overnight.  I had a 99 degree temperature the next day (3:00 pm) after the vaccine, and experienced fatigue and body aches. Those symptoms largely subsided by the morning of 3/21.   I still (as of the PM on 3/22) have no appetite and a persistent feeling of &#34;fullness&#34; in my stomach.

By 4pm I had a headache, body aches, upset stomach, tired, fever, and chills. My fever would go up and down, highest was 103.2 reached that temp 3 times. By 2am my mother drove me to the ER. I was diagnosed with a migraine and was given IV fluids and an IV migraine cocktail. After receiving the fluids and meds I felt much better and was released back home. I periodically have pain in the injection site.

                                                Right after I received my vaccine I was told to pull up and wait 15 minutes. After about 2 minutes I started to feel hot and noticed my arm was red. I pulled down my visor and used the mirror to look at my face and chest area and noticed red splotches all over. The rash quickly moved to cover my whole body within minutes of receiving the vaccine. Ochsner had me pull over by the EMT tent and I waited 45 additional minutes to see if I had any other effects. The rash didn&#39;t go away but I didn&#39;t itch and I wasn&#39;t uncomfortable. It was just a surface rash. The rash was completely gone by 10PM that same night. I woke up at 2AM that same night/early the next morning and the whole left side of my body was numb and felt very heavy. I also had a very mild fever and cold like symptoms. These symptoms included chills, dizziness, fatigue, and headaches. All of my symptoms, including the pain and heaviness on my left side, were gone the following morning which was about 36 hours after first receiving the vaccine.

I went to a dark room and about 30 minutes later it stopped where a wasn&#39;t seeing a flashing line.  I took melatonin and went to bed figuring I was starting to get tired.  I woke up at 638am. Arm super sore, a red spot over the size of a quarter at injection site. Low grade 99.1 and my entire body hurts and a small headache. Called in to work to rest for the day.

A few minutes later she fainted and fell out of the chair onto the floor. We helped her up to a sitting position and gave her a bottle of water and an ice pack.  The right side of her forehead appeared red from apparent hit on the floor when she fainted.  We had her wait on the floor for about 30 minutes to ensure she remained conscious.  Patient reported an ache on her forehead at site of hit.  She was also sweating and reported feeling hot. Patient had a partner with her who agreed to escort her to an urgent care clinic in the same building as the pharmacy. Store manager in charge took the patient to the urgent care clinic by wheelchair to be examined.

Fever began and continued until end of day the following day. Although not as serve once fever reducer was being taken. (24 hours) Body aches that night and continuing into the next day. (24 hours) Headache began the next day and continued for almost 48 hours post injection.  Fatigue that night and continued for two days post injection (48 hours) All around would categorize day one after the inject as &#34;flu-like&#34; although this was a bit worse than when I&#39;ve had the flu. Day 2 post injection was more &#34;cold-like&#34; but higher fatigue than I&#39;m used to.  I normally never get headaches, and I had a dull headache for the two days post injection.

                                                Arm hurt very badly immediately during and after vaccine in similar sensation to ulnar nerve being struck in arm, bled only a little but caused swelling and then a large bruise developed over the evening of 4/4/2021 and is still dark today (4/7/2021). Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

                                                30 year old femail received Janssen vaccine Lot# 1808982 exp: 6/23/21 at approximately 3pm in the left deltoid.  Immediately after being vaccinated, pt. requested to remain seated.  The nurse noted that the pt. was getting pale so she suggested the pt. take off the surgical mask to get some air.  Before pt. had a chance to take off the mask she lost consciousness.  Together with another nurse patient was lowered onto the floor.  Pt. regained consciousness for 30-45 seconds and then began to have seizure like activity.  Her eyes rolled back and her body became stiff and began a jerking motion.  911 was called. This seizure like activity lasted 4-6 seconds at which time pt. regained consciousness and immediately sat up.  Pt was pale and diaphoretic.  BP 98/64, HR 78, Pulse Ox 99%.  Pt vomited multiple times.  Ice was applied to the posterior neck and a cold compress to the forehead .  EMS arrived and took vitals: BP 78/40.  Pt. was aware of person, place and situation.  Pt. was taken to Hospital accompanied by her husband.  Pt was called by me Friday and she was home.  All tests showed no sign of having a seizure.

Woke up with severe chills / teeth chattering / uncontrollable shivering, my husband said my body was warm but I felt chilled to the bone.  Finally got warm enough to fall asleep around 2am.  The next day, more chills, headache, fatigue, and general malaise all day.  Started feeling better on the third day.  Today, tightness in right side of chest--not sure if related, will be calling the doctor.

                                                Around 5:30 pm in the evening following my vaccine I started having chills, headache, nausea, and fever of 101. Chills got worse, whole body was shaking and shivering. Nausea progressed into constant dry heaving. Head was pounding with the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, worse than natural child birth and worse than running marathons. The nausea was so bad and I could feel my fever burning and getting worse. I was about to vomit so got out of bed to go to the toilet to vomit and the whole room started spinning completely out of control. My heart was racing and I could hear it and feel it pounding rapidly through my ears. I couldn?t walk and was so disoriented I crawled to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. My husband heard me and came and picked me up off the bathroom floor and carried me to our bed. As the night progressed fever got worse, head was in almost unbearable pain, severe body aches over my whole body, heart racing and horrible nausea and dry heaving.  I made it through the night. For two days after I had a headache and fever  and nausea and body aches and couldn?t get out of bed to care for my children. By the third and fourth day I was able to get out of bed at times and still felt fatigue, nausea, headache and body aches. Anytime I would stand up for 10 days after the vaccine it felt like I was rocking on a boat. I am almost at 2 weeks and still feel fatigue and dizziness at times. On April 15th, 9 days after my vaccination I had symptoms of a blood clot in my leg. I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a superficial blood clot of the leg as well as swelling in the vein. I am thankful to be alive!

                                                When I got the shot, moderately severe pain immediately radiated down my arm and into my last two fingers on my left arm as well as up into my shoulder blade area. It was a lot more painful than I expected based on previous shots. I went to bed with only arm pain and a small headache. Around 11pm that night I woke up in severe pain that was much worse than my chronic pain. I have prescription narcotic pain medication and that did not help. I was unable to leave bed and called my doctor at his home around 7am. I had a very bad headache (and I am used to headaches) and all of the areas of my body that normally hurt hurt much worse. My fingertips started tingling. I was miserable and in bed for about 3 days before starting to feel better, at which point I noticed that my arms and hands were off. The last two fingers on my left hand lost grip strength for about a week. The muscles In my arms kept getting weak. My fingers and the palms of my hands continue to tingling uncomfortably but the weakness is improving.

My arm was sore for the entire evening. I woke up around 2am Saturday morning and became dizzy. I fell to the floor and passed out for a short period of time. When I woke, I was extremely nauseous to the point of nearly vomiting. I had chills and fever. I could hardly move due to weakness - I needed help getting back into bed. When I woke the next morning, I had 100.3 fever, I had a headache and my entire body was sore. My fever went away late Saturday afternoon, but I still felt mildly nauseous. It is Monday and I still have mild nausea and light-headedness. My arm is only slightly sore.

                                                Around 8:30p.m. Saturday  March 6, 2021 I began to feel chills. I laid down around 9:30p.m to go to sleep. I woke up at 12:25a.m (Sunday March 7th, 2021) with a fever of 104.3 and was experiencing extreme neck and head pain. My hands hurt as if I had arthritis and couldn&#39;t make them feel better. I was very short of breath and dry coughing. I took Tylenol and tried to lay back down and was able to go back to sleep around 3:00a.m. I got up at 6:10am and my temp was 101.6. I took Ibuprofen at this point and by 9:30am my temp was 99.8. I was still experiencing a very bad headache and my neck and back were achy. I felt a lot better by about 11:00am, took a hot shower and laid down for a nap around 2:00pm Sunday. When I woke up around 3:15p.m I had spiked yet another fever of 102.0 and was having bad body aches again in my neck and head area and it continued to get worse though my back over the next hour. I was experiencing a dry cough again also but this time it was more constant. It took over 3 hours for my fever to go below 100.0 with alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen. It finally broke around 7:00p.m. I had a lot of pain in my neck and head the rest of the night. I woke up Monday March 8th, 2021 with a moderate headache but it went away throughout the day. No fever returned Monday. The only time I experienced coughing and shortness of breath was while I had the fever.

My pregnancy has thus far been really easy with no complications.  I had a low grade fever that I took Tylenol to treat.  I had pretty bad muscle and joint pain, chills, and could not stop shaking.  I just felt freezing.  Once my fever broke I felt extremely hot all night.  The next morning I was exhausted and had a lot of the muscle and joint pain still.  I marked on my report that it would&#39;ve stopped me from going about my normal daily activities, as I could not have gone to work and spent most of the day resting.  For the next few days I was tired and my eyes ached.  On Monday and Tuesday I had a headache in the afternoon.  Yesterday afternoon my eyes finally stopped aching and everything seems to be back to normal.

I took Aleve and it eventually helped, but this morning my legs are still feeling weak down to my bones. I am afraid I have nerve damage.

Then later around 10:00am a feeling of tiredness came over my whole body.  Around 12:00pm I felt even more tired, lightheaded  and my eyeballs felt as if with high pressure in them and are feel sensitive to the sunlight.  Also, at 12pm, I had lunch, which was my first meal of this day and felt the necessity to lay in bed and take a nap for 20 minutes before returning to work.  While taking the nap I felt tingling on my feet, arms, hands and neck along with certain sudden muscle contractions on the same parts.

                                                Fever of 100.2F around 5:30 am March 14, 2021. Lips and lower extremities were hot and felt like they were burning the most. Additional symptoms: chills and headache. Chills were mild. Headache felt like an 8/10, pain irradiated throughout my entire head. I took a total of 1500mg of acetaminophen and tried to go back to sleep. I awoke at around 11:30 am, and I have had a mild headache since then; I have not taken any more medication. I have been drinking water and eating soup. Chills have been random and sporadic throughout the day. I tried to log into the v-safe app, but it would not let me submit today&#39;s report. I will try again, and if I have any other symptoms and can&#39;t submit them through the app, then I will report them here. Thank you everyone for your hard work!

                                                About 6 hours after vaccination on 3/8, flu-like symptoms: chills, weakness, fatigue, headache. That lasted into the following ~1.5 days and was relieved with Tylenol and bed rest. Mild nausea on 3/9-3/10. The most concerning possible adverse event started on the evening of 3/12. I noticed my achilles area was itchy after taking a shower that night. I woke up the following morning on 3/13 VERY itchy on my left arm and ankles. I started to break out in hives on my lower legs and bilateral arms into the afternoon. I took Benadryl as directed on the package to try and relieve the hives. In the evening on 3/13 I tried taking a lukewarm bath with 1/2 cup of baking soda and epsom salt. After soaking for about 30 minutes, the hives had worsened and about 65% of my body was covered in hives. I called my primary care&#39;s emergency line that night and was prescribed 40mg Pepcid x 7 days and a Methylprednisolone pack to take in addition to the Benadryl. I took the 40mg Pepcid along with Benadryl and was able to relieve most of the hives. I did not take the methylprednisolone at all. I did wake up in the middle of the night with a scratchy throat and took another Benadryl to relieve that. The following morning on 3/14 I woke up and had some hives on my hands that disappeared that early afternoon without having to take Benadryl. In the evening on 3/14 at around 6pm the hives started to reappear on bilateral arms as well as legs. I took the 40mg Pepcid as well as Benadryl and the hives did not completely disappear before bed. The following morning on 3/15 it appears that the hives had disappeared. They did not reappear the following evening but I still took the 40mg Pepcid the evening of 3/15. Today is 3/16 and I have continued to be hive-free. One other detail to note, on 3/15 at around 4 in the afternoon I took an old supplement - Cranberry with Vitamin C. So I am not sure if this reaction was related to the expired supplement, the vaccine, or both.

On March 11 I broke out in hives on both arms, both thighs, neck/clavicle, and lower right leg this started around 8am. After work I went to Pharmacy to their consultation window (2:15) and they recommended benadryl and to call my PCP. I took my first dose at 2:30pm and followed up with a second one around 9pm. I called and  spoke with my PCP over the phone, she had me take benadryl at night for the next 3 days and claritin in the morning for the next 3 days.  The hives and redness were gone by the morning of the  12th. My skin was still sensitive throughout the 12th but was back to normal by the time I went to bed on the 12 (10pm ish)

Pt took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.  She woke up with another one of these episodes.  She feels like she is shaking but her spouse says she was not physically shaking.  She also had headache, body aches with pain, nausea, vomiting and can hardly walk.  Ibuprofen is not helping with this pain.  pt contacted her PCP and was to call us and and take Tylenol or ibuprofen and rest.

Patient had numbness on left arm, limited mobility, and redness at site of injection. Vaccine given by nurse. She initially couldn&#39;t move her arm after the injection.

No SOB, or tightness in chest, no other areas of redness, and patient had more mobility after given Benadryl. EMS said she was fine to leave, and to follow up with PCP. No history of allergic reaction to vaccine.

                                                I received the vaccine at 36 weeks pregnant. I am estimated to deliver April 16th.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I noticed general bodily discomfort and achiness, as well as a loss of appetite and a headache. About 30 minutes after that I developed chills but no fever, and was fatigued enough to fall asleep an hour before my usual bedtime. I slept terribly in the night due to the achiness and pain at the injection site making it hard to lay on my side, which I have to do for pregnancy. I went to bed with chills but woke up sweating and discovered a fever of 100.2 around 12:45 AM. By 5:30 my temperature was down to 98. The following morning I continue to experience achiness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and a headache. I seem to have felt some pelvic cramping associated with pregnancy but it may be unrelated.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

                                                I received the Janssen (J&amp;J) vaccine at 11:12pm on 3/5/2021. I went to bed with a slightly sore arm. I woke up the following day 3/6/2021 with a slight headache and feeling a little achy. At around 11:00-12:00pm on 3/6/2021 I started having a fever, chills, aches, an increasingly bad headache. For the next 18 hours I had a fever, shaking, aches, bad migraine headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. I felt increasingly sick and my lowest point was at around 9:00pm on 3/6/2021 when I vomited. Around 5:00-6:00am on 3/7/2021 I felt considerably better and no longer had a fever. I was exhausted and still had a headache. I was very fatigued for the next two weeks.   I was menstruating when I received the vaccine. My menstruation stopped when I was having side effects for about 2-3 days and then started again.  In addition, I have psoriasis and on 3/7/2021 my skin looked noticeably better than it had looked before I received the vaccine. The psoriasis I had on my hands almost completely disappeared. A few days later, my psoriasis looked worse than I had looked before I received the vaccine. Today 3/29/2021, my psoriasis is back to how it looked right before I received the vaccination.

During the overnight and all day Sunday, it escalated to severe migraines, fever, sweating, sensory overload, muscle weakness, dizziness, tossing and turning, couldn?t get up, unable to eat due to severe nausea and vomiting, dehydrated.

Had a sore arm for a couple hours right after vaccination which did go away and didn&#39;t return. Around 3:15 pm the same day, I started to feel rundown - fatigued and slight elevated temperature. Around 2 hours later, I started feeling feverish and my temperature was around 99 degrees F. I took a tylenol which helped bring my temperature down temporarily, but around 9 pm it was a lot worse and I was feeling chills as well. I took my temperature and it was 102 degrees F. I took more tylenol and this helped bring my temperature down again. I went to bed and started feeling chills again around 3 am so I took another tylenol and when I woke up again around 8 am, I did not feel feverish anymore, but had a headache and still felt rundown and fatigued. On 4/2 (day after vaccine), I started feeling better as the day went on and fever did not return.

I woke up to my husband holding my head and yelling my name. I had been seizing and had bitten my tongue. I was very white and nauseous and cold and shaky. They gave me water and a cold pack. The seizure probably only lasted for 5 seconds but it&#39;s hard to say. I felt very fatigued afterwards. I stayed for 10 more min and drank water and then they sent me on my way.

I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

                                                I began feeling lightheaded about 5 minutes after receiving the injection. The feeling continued to get stronger and I began sweating and feeling nauseous. I felt like I was going to throw up and/ or pass out. I was about to go get someone and let them know, but then it started easing back off again. It came and went all within about five minutes. I hung around the site a little longer than instructed to be safe, but felt fine and left. Two hours later, I&#39;ve had no other symptoms besides soreness in my arm and a slight headache.

                                                Within about 30 mins of the shot I became extremely lethargic. Hard to keep my eyes open. The injection site was extremely hot to touch and very sore. While the rest of my body was of normal temperature. Shortly after, I?d say about 45 minutes after injection, came the cold chills. I was freezing cold and shaking  fallowed by a fever. I became very foggy. It was hard to keep a conversation and had extreme waves of nausea. My mouth would salivate like the vomit was coming. I never actually vomited. But that continued  for the next 36 hours. I had to call out of work yesterday. Starting 24hrs after injection. I could not get out of bed. My body was very weak. Aches everywhere, I was freezing cold shaking with chills yet waking up in my bed covered in sweat. I was extremely restless and kept waking up to put a cold towel on my head to try to break my fever. At this point my headache was so severe. Any movement felt like my head would explode.  It?s now 48 hours after the injection my head is still pounding and my body still full of aches. Left arm is still really sore. I truly regret taking the vaccine. And would recommend others to not take it until further testing goes into this product.

                                                Re: Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Received vaccine at about 10:21am. Developed possible adverse effects at about 4:00pm. Initially I noticed weakness and feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. I was grocery-shopping at the time, and pushing the cart, standing upright, etc. was becoming difficult. Sometime between 4:00pm and 5:00pm I became delirious and also was no longer able to stand or sit upright. In my altered state I believed that my muscles, especially those in my legs, were turning into goo and then turning into normal muscles again. I experienced fever dreams. I had hot flashes and chills. I had the worst pain that I have experienced in recent memory.  I think that I may have had a migraine episode in addition to, and triggered by, these experiences. I had nausea (no vomiting).  Most of these events lasted until about between 12:30am to 1:00am, which was when I fell asleep. When I woke up the following morning (today as I am reporting), I still had a mild headache and exhaustion but the other events had resolved.

As soon as the Medrol was completed (4/9), the pain in the shoulder/injection site came back. As of 4/11, it is painful to left and rotate left arm.

I took extra strength Tylonol and those symptoms subsided within about 48 hours. The symptom that worries me is the tingling in both my arms that seems to get worse when I lay down. Each night since I received the vaccine, my arms have gone completely numb in the middle of the night. Once I move them repeatedly for about 5-10 min, the numbness goes away. Before the numbness starts, my arms usually begin to tingle.

I called over a doctor and explained what was happening. He got a wheelchair and brought me to a room to lie down. During this time, my vision continued to get worse (seeing more spots and less peripheral vision).  Upon laying down, the doctor put my feet up and a nurse took my blood pressure. If I remember correctly, it was 90/58. My normal blood pressure is around 112/68. A nurse also put ice under my neck. Immediately upon laying down, I started feeling better. I was observed for a while more and then a nurse took my blood pressure again (both laying down and sitting up). My limbs still felt weak when seated and my blood pressure was better but not normal yet, so I was told to lay down a bit longer. Then, a nurse checked my blood pressure again (laying down, sitting up and standing up). It was back to normal and I was feeling better. I was cleared to leave the vaccine clinic. Since leaving the clinic, I haven&#39;t had any abnormal side effects or reactions.

Then a couple of minutes later we could not distinguish what kind of reaction was occurring and had another patient call 9-1-1. The patient jerked at that moment, but the paramedics arrived within 8 minutes and checked her out, she is fine. It turned out that she has a history of fainting when needles are administered with blood draws or vaccines. She drank some juice and recovered without incident. The paramedics released her home and no other concerns arose.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I began by feeling stiffness and soreness in my joints and muscles, particularly my back and lower body.  The pain and stiffness worsened, and I began to feel ill similar to a common cold. Approximately 12-18 hours after receiving the vaccine, my symptoms worsened so much that I could hardly stand or move around, and began throwing up. This continued and worsened as my entire body felt pain and stiffness, I felt very weak and fatigued, and I was throwing up violently with frequency. I threw up so much and with enough force that I started to see bright red blood in my spittle and vomit. I had a severe headache accompanying these other symptoms.  I also had problems with homeostatic temperature regulation  and was simultaneously sweating profusely and very warm to the touch while feeling like I was cold.  I was shaky and experienced tremors and twitches in my hands, arms, legs, and feet. I kept throwing up and experiencing these symptoms for approximately 72 hours after recieving my vaccine.  I was virtually incapacitated for those three days of severe illness-like symptoms.

                                                The following day after my vaccination, I had a severe headache all over the top of my head and eventually only the left side of my head and face felt intense pain. It felt kind of like a stabbing or shooting pain down into my head. Then I started feeling a lot if pressure and pain in my left eye, eye brow, and the sinus area. I could hardly open my eyes. My left side of my face also tingled with tiny sharp pains or numbness. This pain intensified for about 5 days so I started taking aspirin. It would feel slightly better but then would feel even worse.  I decided to use a netti pot to remove pressure. After about 5 days of using that I started to feel better. I would say I started to feel back to normal two weeks after the shot.

                                                Six hours after injection of vaccine, I experienced nausea, moderate chills, headache, and a low fever which lasted for 6 hours. I also had numb fingertips which lasted for around 20 minutes right after the chills really set in. I&#39;m not positive its related but two nights after my vaccine injection, I woke up at night because my feet were itching and hot. They also had the pins and needles sensation and these symptoms lasted around 20 to 30 minutes. I have never had that happen before so I assume it was vaccine related.

During the night while trying to fall asleep I was hallucinating like someone was in my room but no one was there. The next day I felt like I had the flu, and just arm pain. Following days I felt tired and had a headache on the top of my head ranging from a seven to a ten in pain. I tried Tylenol but no help because body rejected it. I tried Excedrin migraine for headaches but still no let up. I am still experiencing headaches and Fatigue.

                                                About 5 hours after receiving the vaccine, I was overcome with uncontrollable muscle spasms / body shakes. After about 5 minutes they subsided, but the same thing happened a few hours later and were so overwhelming I had to crawl on the floor to move. I felt achey and exhausted, with heavy night sweating. The next day, symptoms included  light sensitivity, headache, chills, sweats, body aches, fatigue and a 101 degree fever. My symptoms subsided by the next day, about 36 hours after the initial injection.

My body shook, and it appeared that I had a seizure. Immediately upon waking I started vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements for about an hour.

I was shaking uncontrollably with a very high  fever and chills for two hours.  I couldn&#39;t eat.  I fell asleep for an hour and woke up feeling terrible- headache, fever, muscle aches, and sweating.  The next four days I had a headache and shortness of breath.   I am on day  8 now  and still  feel extremely tired.

                                                I first had common side effect symptoms but disappeared within 48h - extremely hot, knee pains. On the 5th day (Apr 16), I started to feel pain in my right hip to the point that I feel pain in every step walking, which has never happened to me.  Note: I didn&#39;t exercise since I got the vaccine and maintained pretty good routines for ensuring enough sleep. Today is the 3rd day since that symptom appeared, while I do feel better, the pain hasn&#39;t disappeared.

                                                **17 weeks pregnant, Due date 8/11/21, 1st pregnancy** I got the shot at 3am and was feeling fine. When I woke up my arm sore and felt really cold, my temp was 100, I called and they advised me to take Tylenol and rest. I did that and it lasted for about 24 hours.

My temperature about an hour later was 105. I took 1000 mg of Tylenol right away and put a cold rag on my head and tried to go to sleep. A couple hours later my fever started breaking, when it was 102.7 I was a sweaty mess and extremely hot and puked a lot.  My fever and other symptoms went away within about 7 hours after my fever started breaking.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Mid Saturday night I woke up to chills and was shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep even after adding another layer of clothes and blanket. Sunday morning I was still very cold and tired from not sleeping. I developed body aches but they were everywhere not just my arm. I was very fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. The worst part was getting a migraine with extreme light sensitivity. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around any windows without blinds. I spent the day in my bedroom sleeping with the curtains closed and an eye mask on. By that night, the migraine had subsided but I was adding hot flashes to the problem list. Had a pretty restless night again on Sunday. Woke up Monday to the light sensitivity back but not as severe. I took the day off work because I couldn&#39;t handle looking at a computer screen all day. By about 1pm I was feeling mostly back to normal. My arm is still sore near the injection site and I&#39;m a bit fatigued at times but those are the only things remaining.

                                                I?ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before.  Received the vaccine at around 9:55am on 03/08/21.  Pain while the vaccine was being administered but it healed within a few minutes. I started getting a mild headache at around 3:30pm while at work. When I got home at around 6pm I started having severe chills, the headache became intense, my mouth and eyelids felt hot, my hands and feet felt very cold and when I checked temperature it was 102.4.  By 9:00 pm the headache became excruciating like I?ve never had it before, as if my head was being squeezed or pressed. Eyes and the back of my jaw hurt too.  Had light and sound sensitivity. Took 200mg of Advil but pain was still almost intolerable until I was finally able to fall asleep at around 4:00 am.  Was still in pain the day after but not as bad as the night before. Only mild pain today but started feeling itchy tonight and noticed some rashes on my body.

I started to develop a low grade fever 8 hours after the shot. 13 hours after the shot, I had a 104.1 fever. Along with the fever, I experienced severe body aches and chills, nausea and a horrible headache. I couldn?t walk as my body was so weak and my vision was blurry. About 15 hours after the vaccine, my fever went down to 102. I was able to get up and walk to my kitchen to take some Advil. My fever broke 20 hours after the vaccine with the medicine. I?m still experiencing severe body aches, headache, nausea and chills and it has been about 30 hours after vaccine. I did have covid 3 months ago, and the symptoms from the vaccine were much worse than the symptoms I had with actual covid.

                                                Immediate soreness in arm - headache after a couple hours. By 9:00pm, I was freezing cold but body warm. Chills lasted for hours and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, so took Tylenol at 12:15am. Around 1:00am the chills subsided. Around 2:00am fever burnt off, sweating and hot. Couldn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night. Slept from 8am-10am and woke with just headache. Took Tylenol around 10:30am to help with headache and it did start to subside. Was mostly fatigued and muscle aches the rest of the day until 6pm when I started to get cold again. Feels like the fever and chills are coming back and it&#39;s currently 7:30pm, so assuming it&#39;ll be another night of this.

                                                3/6/21  This is a 32-year-old female who is receiving her first Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine and shortly afterwards developed some throat itching and tightness.  She was given a milligram of epinephrine by intramuscular injection by retired emergency physician there and then transported by ambulance here for further evaluation.  Says her tongue felt a little swollen as well but she denies any respiratory symptoms.  Her voice sounds crackly to her.  She denies any pruritus or rashes.  She has had multiple allergic reactions to medications in the past but never having to be admitted overnight.  One episode however did occur while she was hospitalized and receiving treatment.  She has never had to be intubated.  She has had isolated urticaria without oral or throat symptoms and vice versa.  At this point she says she does feel somewhat better. She is given IV dexamethasone and observed here.  At 1 point she complained of it complaint complained of it feeling like a tightening in the back of her throat was worsening.  She is given an additional intramuscular dose of epinephrine with epinephrine and on reexamination had no significant change in physical findings or her phonation.  This occurred again and she was given viscous lidocaine with minimal improvement in her symptoms.  After several hours of observation without objective worsening but continued complaint of feeling increasing tightness in her throat, CT imaging of the neck is performed to assess the soft tissue structures.  No abnormalities or indication of significant retropharyngeal or paralaryngeal edema or airway compromise present. Given the possibility of some laryngeal muscle or parapharyngeal muscle spasm as him, she was given Flexeril.  After some discussion with her I did indicate to her that I felt it would be safe to return home but offered admission for observation as well.  She indicated she was comfortable returning home for continued observation.  She will be continued on steroids and antihistamines and is given additional Flexeril by prescription if this does seem to help her symptoms.  If no improvement over the next 2 to 3 days and follow-up either with her primary providers through facility or Dr.  3/7/21: Return to ED. The patient is in no respiratory distress.  She has no wheezing.  On physical exam her throat lips and tongue look fine.  I think she is not a had another allergic reaction, rebounded from yesterday.  She is not on any type of steroids sinus syndrome with some Decadron.  And she is allergic to Benadryl but she can take Claritin if she wants.  Her CBC and chemistry were normal.  I went back to evaluate her and she still getting fluids and now she is complaining of shooting pain down her left leg from the EpiPen.  Again she has this regional complex pain syndrome that could be part of that but there is nothing I can do for this at this time.  In terms of her allergic reaction she feels much better her throat feels normal.  We will send her out with prescription for Decadron and EpiPen and if she gets worse she will come back and will follow up admit her.

A minute after I recovered and my husband gave me fruit (Melon) to raise my blood sugar. On that moment I had lots of nauseas and diarrhea. I was feeling weak and dizzy all night and the next day. Today Wednesday March the 17 I have been feeling much better.

                                                Estimated due date: 09/04/2021  I felt fine that afternoon after the vaccine and just felt a little more tired than usual when I arrived home at night. Around 12:30AM I felt feverish, and body aches, severe headache and chills that woke me up. Took Tylenol. Felt like I had the flu. Next day kept treating with Tylenol as needed and the fatigue, body aches and low energy persisted along with headache but by night time I was feeling somewhat  better. Next day I was much better that I could work from home. Still felt a little fatigued other symptoms subsided.

                                                Currently pregnant due May 31. I got the vaccine at 4 pm on Wednesday. At around 6pm I started to get a headache, I took 2 tylenol but it continued to get progressively worse. By 7 I was starting to get really fatigued and fell asleep. I woke up around 8 or 9 still fatigued with body aches and a headache. The body aches and headache continued to worsen, but due to pregnancy I could not take any more tylenol. Around midnight I got out of bed to use the bathroom and immediately started violently shivering. It continued for a few minutes after I got back into bed, it did cause a lot of pain in my joints and muscles. A few hours later I woke up very hot and sweaty. The next day (Thursday) I continued to feel very fatigued with body aches and a headache to the point where I had to stop working even though I work from home. The following day (Friday) I was still mildly fatigued and had some body aches, and my brain felt very foggy so I took off work again. I regularly checked my temperature during this time and did not have a fever.

                                                I was fine from 10am until 3:30pm on the day of injection. I started to feel feverish and chills at 3:30 and it progressed into a 99.2 fever with all over body aches and a headache and chills. I took alkasletzer cold medicine with Tylenol in it to help with the fever. It got the symptoms down where I could move and stood in the hot shower for 30 minutes to help warm me up. I felt slightly better and still had fever symptoms and severe body aches. I started feeling unable to move due to the fever symptoms again around 9pm and took 2 extra strength Tylenol that eventually worked and I had some nausea with that. I hadn?t been able to eat because of the symptoms and the nausea could have been from taking meds on an empty stomach. I finally felt able to eat around 10pm and had some food and went to bed. I could barley sleep all night and was tossing and turning due to fever. My nose started to get runny around 10pm before I went to bed. I woke up the next day and still had the fever symptoms, body aches and the worst headache I have ever had, a 10 on the pain scale. I took another 2 extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep for 2 hours. I woke up and could tell the fever had broken and my head was still in pretty severe pain- about a 7 on the pain scale.  I was incredibly fatigued the entire day and felt hot and cold throughout the day. I was incredibly weak and needed a lot of rest. I still didn?t sleep well through the night and woke up friday feeling fatigued. I expended some energy in the am at the dog park and had to sleep for 3 hours during the day which is atypical for me. I woke up Saturday morning (today) still feeling a headache and exhaustion. I will see how the rest of the day goes and am hoping to feel better and don?t know when the symptoms will stop.

                                                Most websites said 1-2 days for side effects to kick in but I was rocked pretty hard within the first 12 hours. The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

I have tried to ice, heat, and move the arm gently, but nothing seems to lessen the pain and soreness. I have no injury history on my right arm or the right side of my upper body.

                                                about 12 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced EXTREME cold. My body could not get warm. I shook violently all over my body. I took tylenol. Then, I experienced extreme heat and could not get cold. I felt like I had a fever and took some tylenol. I did not take my temperature. I started experiencing chest tightness. It feels funny in my chest like I cannot breathe fully. Everything has gone away except for the chest tightness.

                                                Approximately 3 min after receiving the shot, I began to feel light headed.  Light headedness increased over the next few minutes and I began to feel faint.  My activity device indicated my heart rate took a sharp drop.  At this point, I thought it best to lie down. I spent the next 5-7 minutes on the floor until I was able to sit up without feeling faint. I waited an additional 15 minutes before leaving.  I felt somewhat shaky, but felt better by the minute.

                                                Immediately after injection at 10:20am, I felt hot and light headed. I have passed out from shots and IVs before so I brought my own smelling salts to my appointment, and I used them as soon as I felt faint, which kept me from passing out.  I felt ok after waiting 30 minutes. Later that day around 5pm, I started getting chills and felt a little achy. At 6pm I checked my temperature and it was 99.9, at 7pm it was 101.9, at 7:30pm it was 104 so I took ibuprofen 400 since I had severe chills, headache fatigue and muscle and joint aches. At 8pm it was 102.7 so I took another 400mg of ibuprofen. At  9pm it was 101.7, and at 10pm it was 100.4 and then I went to sleep.  On 4/12: it was 98.7 when I woke up at 9am, then 99 at 10:30 so I took ibuprofen 400, then 100.1 at 11:30 so I took ibuprofen 400 again. Since noon, the fever has subsided and the fatigue and aches and headaches have become mild so that I could work from home.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after the injection I noticed body aching, specifically in lower back.  The following 8 hours after the first symptoms appeared, I had extreme chills followed by profuse sweating, fever, headache, tiredness, inability to sleep. I was able to help the symptoms with ibuprofen. The hot flashes and headache, continued sporadically 2 days following the injection.

Later that evening came muscle pain, chills, high fever, nausea, vomiting, and migraines. The next day, most side effects went away except for the looming headache. Since the vaccine, patient has been experiencing episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness. There was an article that came out today as it relates to blood clots being a possible side effect of the vaccine and to report any feeling of headaches or possible symptoms that may be related to that.

My injection site it still warm to the touch and a little red and swollen, but is looking better. I also had stomach pains in the evening Friday and Saturday night that happened when I was nauseous too.

                                                I received the vaccine at 3:50 pm and by 9:45 I had the typical side effects --muscle aches, minor pain at the injection site, and chills.  Within an hour from that I also had a terrible headache, nausea, and my skin hurt to touch.  I slept most of the next day, save for 5 or 6 hours.  Starting on 3/30/21 (exactly two weeks from receiving my vaccine) I started having sore skin.  No rash, red marks, itching, just hypersensitive to touch, even with clothing.  This started on my right arm right above the elbow.  The following day the pain had moved to inside both arms right above the elbow.  The day after that, the pain was more intense and was straight across my stomach at belly button height, and across my lower back at that same height.  It was more intense for two days and hurt whether anything was touching my skin or not.  It was very uncomfortable.  In the days following it continued to move to different places on my body.  Legs, bottom of feet, palms of hands, ankles, hips, groin, lower back.    Sometimes it just hurts, sometimes it&#39;s like a prickling, sometimes the skin in that area aches -- especially when on my hands. It&#39;s also very sensitive to anything cold.  Again, if you look at my skin though you can&#39;t see anything.  There&#39;s no visible signs of something being wrong.  It also stopped for a day or so, or just lessened so much that it wasn&#39;t that noticeable, but then returns.  That&#39;s happened twice where I thought this was finally over, only to have it return the next day.

                                                This was Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine.  I had the normal symptoms but it still felt very severe. I think there should be emphasis shared that symptoms might be severe. I believe the public should have a clear idea how severe. From 7pm to 12am I experienced extreme temperature changes, burning hot to very cold. I had the shakes. Headache. I took Advil which helped endure.  Buried myself in blankets with heater and heat on.  Drowsy. Experienced some dizziness. Now 3 days later I have some &#39;pings&#39; here and there but uncertain if from vaccine. I feel these in my ovaries and my legs and my side. These are very subtle &#39;pings&#39; (bit of pain but not much). Unsure if worth reporting but I think all this is important. Also, I have anxiety about the effect on this vaccine on the health of women and think it is very important that this is clear before pushing people -- more specifically young women, girls, babies -- to take this, and perhaps, any vaccine. I have been told from 5 friends they experienced heavy bleeding after taking the vaccine. They may have not all taken the J&amp;J vaccine to be clear.  I do not feel great about having taken this vaccine.  I feel like i&#39;ve put myself at risk of some other complications but of course, this is based on news and fear.  I just wanted to share this experience, and I hope that, if anything, the severity of symptoms might be more broadly shared.

                                                About 5 hours after shot, I started feeling weak, tired, and nauseas with a slight headache.  I had discomfort trying to fall asleep. I woke up at 12:43AM with a throbbing headache. I was hospitalized at 18 for viral meningitis, and this was a similar, intense pain. It felt like I had a crown on,  and that crown on my head caused a very intense, throbbing, debilitating pain. I also had chattering teeth, shaking with a freezing fever. I eventually fell asleep and woke up again at 2-something. My fever and headache still intense, but now I was drenched in sweat and burning up. I wanted to get up and find my thermometer--I remember digging through my drawers and closets around my apartment,  I remember speaking but no recollection what I was trying to say (I live alone), and I remember seeing my reflection looking glazed over. I don&#39;t remember getting back in bed but woke up again after 5AM. I still had a bad headache, though less severe, and felt my body was alternating very hot sweating and very cold freezing--like it was mix and matching. I eventually fell asleep again and woke up around 7:45AM. I was fatigued with a fever and chills all day.  I found my thermometer and went to sleep with a 100.3 fever that night. I was much better next day, just slight fatigue.

                                                Four hours after vaccine administration, the patient began experiencing body aches, headache, and chills typical of post-vaccine immune response. however, three hours later (7 hours after administration), she began having a burning sensation in her thoracic back, upper chest, shoulders, and upper arms with accompanying allodynia, the patient reports was up to 10/10 intensity. She went to an emergency room and was given acetaminophen, prednisone, diphenhydramine, and famotidine. Her symptoms did not significantly improve and was discharged. The burning sensation and allodynia did resolve overnight and have not reoccurred, but these symptoms are the adverse event I am reporting.

Put on compression socks but the restless leg and shortness of breath continued for 3/4 hours.

It began to increase in intensity around 4pm when I began to get nauseous. 5-6pm is when I began vomitting, and decided to go to the ER after the pain reached a level 8-9 and my face and limbs felt numb. I was admitted to the emergency room at 11:30pm and was given a CT Scan where it was discovered I had appendicitis. Wednesday evening I underwent surgery, and was discharged Thursday 4/15.

I had a slight droop on the l eft side of my face, mostly noticeable around the corner of my mouth. I also experienced itchiness around the injection site. The symptoms started with numbness in the tip of my tongue about 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine and slowly spread to the rest of my face. Approximately 5 hours after receiving the vaccine the entire left side of my face was numb. I called a nurse hotline to find out if I should seek medical care that night or wait until morning. They urged me to go to the ER.   I went to the ER, underwent a plethora of tests, received positive results on all of them, and was sent home with instructions to return if my condition worsened. The doctors said I had Bell?s Palsy but had little insight as to why it had occurred.  a nurse hotline

                                                8 hours after receiving the vaccine I was doing maintenance my fish tank and began to feel physically fatigued as if I had just worked an 8 hour shift of manual labor, although I hadn&#39;t. By 6:30 PM I was feeling shaky and weak so I laid down. At 6:45 PM I was feeling feverish (chills even though my body was radiating heat). I woke repeatedly due to muscle soreness and chills. At 10:30 I checked my temperature and got a reading of 103.2 F. I had a mild headache as well. I drank some green fruit/vegetable juice and went back to tossing and turning on the couch. I took an Ibuprofen at 5AM with water and was able to get a couple of hours of sleep. !) AM I checked my temp again and got a reading of about 98 F. I was still feeling a bit sluggish and slightly dizzy at times throughout the day.

At 4:30pm I took 400mg of ibuprofen since sitting, walking, and lying down were all painful. Relief came around 5:30pm and I was able to nap for an hour. At 6:30pm I awoke and attempted to eat, as I was beginning to feel nauseous. At 8:30pm I laid down again, my symptoms returning and worsening. I was now experiencing chills with my muscle pain and a headache. Pain was located throughout my body and my skin was sensitive to the touch. At 10:30pm I began shaking violently and struggled to feel warm, despite my skill feeling hot. My temperature was not taken. Another 400mg of ibuprofen was taken and one 350mg chewable of Tums anti-acid was eaten. It was not until 12:30am that I was able to sleep again.  The morning of 3/8/21 I was still fatigued and sore. Moving was difficult and painful and nausea was still present, and my headache returned. I was unable to eat despite trying. At 10:00am I took two tablets of Excedrin Migrain and napped for almost two hours. Currently, my muscle aches are minimal and my headache has improved. This may however be due to the medication.

                                                I received my shot at 1:15pm this afternoon. The arm that I got the shot in was immediately sore, and has continued to be a bit tender to touch and stiff when I move the arm. By 5pm I was feeling very fatigued. Around 7pm I began feeling cold and achy, and it has continued to progress to full body aches and chills. I have no appetite, but I?m not feeling nauseous.

I delayed taking Ibuprofen to not reduce the efficiency of the vaccine but couldn&#39;t endure the chills and shivering as well as the massive pain all over my body. I started with 200 mg Ibuprofen, which helped with all 3 symptoms at least as far as I was able to sit instead of lie all the time.

At midnight I woke up extremely hot, as if I had a fever (I didn&#39;t confirm this with a thermometer, I was just extremely hot and sweaty) and I had a very severe, painful headache that lasted at least 30 minutes until I took two acetaminophen pills. I also experienced the usual muscle pains. All symptoms were gone by Saturday morning upon waking.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

At 10:30 when I took my temperature, it was 101 and chills set  in.  For the remainder of the day I alternated with tylenol and advil.  Aches and fever remained the rest of the day.  By Saturday morning, fever was down and it was only 99.8.  The only side effect on Saturday was a sore arm and headache.  All symptoms were gone by Sunday morning.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

Started experiencing fogginess and feeling cold at 1:00 am 20Mar2021. Went to bed at 1:00 and dreamed of being sick until waking up at 8:30 am 20Mar2021. Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

But the exhausted next day - I went home from work early that day. Friday, I got a rash  - very itchy and sore  (it felt very tender when touched)- on my left side (abdomen). It spread around the left side on my back and to my stomach. I say my doctor on this Tuesday (virtual appt) said it was Shingles - Valtrex - to help it heal faster. The rash is starting to scab over and is peeling now.  It&#39;s getting better.

When I woke up in the morning I had a headache, muscle aches, slight difficulty breathing with chest heaviness, and fatigue.  At 2 am on March 8 I awoke with dizziness and room spinning, sweating, weakness and lightheadedness, and nausea. Later that morning most of the symptoms subsided except for slight lightheadedness. By March 9 all side effects had resolved.

Treated with iburprofen and odansetron at approximately 3:30 AM. Fever, nausea, and vomiting subsided due to medication. Muscle/joint pain remained at a lessened level. High levels of fatigue emerged in the early morning hours. Took sumatriptan for migraine at around noon and again later that evening. Fever resurfaced when ibuprofen wore off around noon. Had to leave work early due to fever, muscle/joint pain, and migraine. Took another dose of ibuprofen around that time and again in the evening. Fatigue lasted until approximately 48 hours later. All other symptoms subsided within 24 hours.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after I received the vaccine, I started to feel extremely fatigued and experienced some muscle aches. I took an Aleve and laid down for an hour long nap. At approximately 7:00pm, I woke up with more extreme muscle pain. By 8:00pm, my muscles were so tight and painful that it hurt to move, lay still, or go to the bathroom. It felt as though all of the muscles in the back of my body (from my back to my butt and legs) were spasming, Over the next few hours, my temperature rose to 102.7 and my heart rate spiked to 140-150 bpm. I also experienced chills and a headache. We sought the advice of a 24-hour nurse, who let us know these symptoms were likely normal side effects. I went to bed around 12:00am, and my temperature had dropped to 99.9 around 3:00am when I woke up to check it.  My heart rate eventually dropped below 100 bpm around 8:00am. I woke up around 10:00am on Saturday feeling much better than the day before. My temperature was around 99.1 when I woke up, and my symptoms included mild muscle aches, a moderate headache, and moderate fatigue. I continued to feel better throughout the day, with the headache gradually subsiding and a minor sore throat toward the end of the day. On Sunday, I felt back to normal, other than experiencing some mild-moderate fatigue.

By midnight, I had a fever of 100.2, nausea, intense headache (specifically around the eyes) and overall significant discomfort. The fever lasted overnight. Vomiting occurred on several occasions shortly after midnight for a few hours and again around 6 am. The following day, my fever did go down yet I maintained a headache and some nausea. After 3 days, adverse events were resolved. Treatment consisted of tylenol and fluids. I did not contact my a physician, so no medical tests/lab work was completed. For background, I have never experienced a serious event with a vaccine, besides general fatigue.

                                                Almost immediately, I had pain in my arm that shot into my shoulder when the vaccine was being injected into my arm. I did not mention it to the pharmacist since I figured it was normal. I sat for 15 minutes as instructed, but  other than feeling sore, I was normal. So we left. After about another 15 mins, My head started for feel &#34;drunk&#34;. I contemplated pulling over since I was driving home, but decided to get home asap.  As time went by, my head felt more and more cloudy, fuzzy, heavy and as if I&#39;d been drinking alcohol. That night, I couldn&#39;t sleep. I even took hydrocodon with tylenol (the pain was that bad) and an ibprofin. It helped a little. I finally got to sleep at 3am, Just to wake at 7am for work. All day, I could not focus, my head was super fuzzy. I had a bad headache, I felt super sick. My stomach also hurt and I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I tried taking a nap half way through the day because I kept making mistakes at work. It did not help how I felt. Since then, my symptoms have eased but now I seem to have a bad case of acid reflux, which I didn&#39;t used to get randomly.   I have not been to my dr yet and I haven&#39;t done anything else for it. I was informed that I should report my symptoms by a family friend.

                                                I started to feel chilled around 7pm friday evening. I laid down and began to feel nauseous and hot; my skin was sensitive. I soon had a 103.7 fever with chills and a terrible splitting headache. My symptoms lasted through the night. I took one 200mg Ibuprofen at 03:30 saturday morning/it didn&#39;t seem to help much. Most of the day saturday I had a headache that was manageable and 100.2 degree fever. Saturday evening I was fever free and had a dull headache. Sunday, I was exhausted.

Did not eat anything that would trigger an attack. This AM 4/13/21, c/o headache &#34;at the bridge of my nose&#34; and while on the phone started to c/o facial numbness. Denies worst headache of her life, says it would be difficult to look at screen if needed and hasn&#39;t put her glasses on yet because it&#39;s so bothersome. Denies hyperventilation. I advised that she present to ED.

                                                Started with chills pretty shortly after the vaccine was injected.  After about 6 hours I could tell I was not feeling great.  My husband said I looked very pale and out of it all of the sudden.  I became extremely tired and disoriented.  I don?t remember driving myself home that evening after picking up my kids from dance.  By the time I was home it was now around 8 pm.  I was so cold my entire body was trembling.  I kept taking steaming hot showers but I couldn?t feel it, I was still freezing and shaking.  I was very weak and started having extremely horrible body aches and pains.  Specifically my legs were hurting the worst, I remember my hip joints felt like they?d buckle underneath me.  I got a headache that was unbearable.  It felt worse than a migraine.  It hurt to move my head or use my eyes at all.  I went to bed and was under several blankets and a heating pad while also running a space heater right next to me.  I still could not get warm at all.  I hallucinated that I could see each ache and pain on my body and watched them move through me.  By 4 am I was now hysterical and crying.  I was in so much unbearable pain and so scared.  I had to call off of work for this day.  I was so out of it I called my daughter off of school but also called for my mom to come get her and take her to school.  I kept my youngest home with me.  My head was still the absolute worst headache I have ever felt in my life.  I couldn?t open my eyes and it hurt to move at all.  I had to call a friend to come pick up my youngest daughter because I was unable to take care of her, I could barely stay awake and alert.  I tried another hot shower and everything still felt cold.  I was now nauseous from the head pain.  Around noon on this day I finally had the strength to drink some water and was able to take Tylenol.  I laid on the couch for hours still shivering and in unbearable pain.  I was still very scared that I was having such a bad reaction that I would die.  I called my husband to come home from work and be with me because I was scared.  I took more Tylenol a couple hours after the first dose.  Around 6 pm I started to feel better.  I was able to eat again that evening.  I had a headache though for about 3 weeks after that gradually weaned away.

Woke up in middle of the night with high fever, cold sweats, and migraine. By morning migraine intensified, could not stand for more than a few minutes without feeling faint and waves of nausea, complete loss of appetite and felt extremely dehydrated and lethargic. Sore arm at injection site started second day and progressively got worse day 3 and 4. 36 hours after vaccine was when I felt more able to eat, walk around, migraine reduced to a dull headache. Fatigue lingered in day to day activities for about 1 week.

                                                Tachycardia.  I had the expected side effects of headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and fever (102.6 F) but began to experience symptoms of pounding/racing heart that worsened through the evening. By 10:00 pm my heart rate was bouncing around between 130 bpm and 155 bpm, and I was beginning to have pain in my lower legs/ankles.  Was told by a on call nurse for my clinic to go to the ER. I was in the ER for about 5 hours, roomed the whole time as they worked to get my heart rate down and checked to make sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot. They performed an EKG and CT Scan of my chest, both were fine. I was eventually allowed to leave after 4 am on 4/10/21 after my heart rate got into the high 90&#39;s with only small spikes into the 110&#39;s with slight movement and once my fever had broken.

I was in bed.  3/20?got period 3/21?I was gushing blood like never before in my entire life. I went through a menstral cup in 1.5 hours.    This excessive cycle lasted for days. My period is normally 3/4  days and this one was 6/7 days. I also passed 3 golf ball sized blood clots. I have never in my life passed a clot, let alone three that size.  The next cycle I had a tiny bit of break through bleeding the day I ovulated?that never happens. Then this cycled I have felt crampy and bloated. Like I am going to start my period at any minute but do not.  I am expecting my next period in less than a week. But this cycle has been completely abnormal and nothing changed but getting the shot two days prior to it starting.

Next day fever, congestion, &amp; body aches were gone. The dizziness was worse. I slept all day Sunday &amp; Monday thinking I would be better the next day. On Tuesday I was still very dizzy my mom convinced me to go to the doctor. The nurse from the doctor&#39;s office told me to go to immediate care, &amp; the doctor from immediate care sent me to the ER. I&#39;m still dizzy &amp; unable to work.

Patient took an ibuprofen which helped with the pain for about an hour then the pain came back. Pain got worse 2 hours later when she drove home from work. She called the RN line and was told to take ibuprofen and follow up in the AM. The next day 4/18/2021, patient went to urgent care and received Toradol and was told it was a migraine. Today 4/20/21, patient still had pain and noted feeling left sided facial numbness and blurry vision that correlated with when she got the headache. Patient went to an urgent care today and CT scan revealed a blood clot. She was then sent to the ED for evaluation. In the ED, she has no headache and facial numbness and has minimal left ear pain. Her headache is localized to the left side of her head. Patient denies fever, chills, and COVID symptoms. Patient was started on argatroban drip per hematology recommendation.

I have experienced sinus pressure headaches as well. My legs and arms feel tingly and numb at times - more often my left side which is where I got injection. I feel weakness and fatigue most afternoons. My body didn&#39;t feel this way before the vaccine and it seems as though my body hasn&#39;t fully recovered from the shot and has flared up these symptoms. I feel all of a sudden that I have arthritis.

The headaches became migraine like in quality with photosensitivity and a one-sided pounding that was debilitating and associated with nausea. The headaches respond to migraine treatment (Sumatriptan) started after the vaccine, but she has never had migraines before. The migraines continue almost every day until today, 4/27/2021. Due to the onset of new migraine-like headaches with no prior history, a workup and neurologic exam was done twice which was normal both times (see below). However, it seems significant that someone has new daily migraine headaches for longer than 3 weeks after the vaccine was given so we are reporting it.

At around 9:00 PM I had chills, migraine, bodyaches, burning sensation in my joints, neck pain, and a low-grade fever. I took some Tylenol at around 7 PM. But the pain did not subside and I was able to use the bathroom the next day at around 4 AM and was still in severe pain. That day at around 1 PM I was able to set up and felt 30% better. On day two I am feeling better but I still have minor body aches I do get fatigue while doing light work around the house and no appetite and loss of taste is the newest symptom. I am not 100 percent better but close to it.

Around 9:30pm that night I began to feel nauseous. As the night progressed my symptoms got worse. I experienced intense chills and by 11pm had a 100 degree fever. Sunday, March 7th my fever had decreased, but I continued to feel nauseous and have chills throughout the day. Additionally I felt extremely fatigued, weak, and had a throbbing headache. Completing simple tasks were difficult and exhausting. Monday, March 8th I continue to experience significant fatigue, headache, and muscle weakness, but at less intensity. Also, my right arm where I received the injection is very sore. I have also been somewhat dizzy today. I have been taking Advil, drinking fluids, using an ice pack, and resting as much as I can as part of the treatment.

After the pharmacist injected me, I felt the arm pain right away. No big deal. I walked over to the chair to sit for my 15 minutes. I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it&#39;s working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn&#39;t hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now. But I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s some sort of reaction because I already had COVID-19.

                                                24hr after vaccine I was so tired I could barely function and ended up falling asleep on the floor of my office. When I woke up two hours later I was freezing cold and my body was very achy. I ended up sleeping the rest of the day and night. On Friday I felt fine most of the day until about 10pm at night when I started having diarrhea. Throughout the night it got worse and my body got very hot to the point where I had to sleep naked with fans on me. I?m lightly short of breath, exhausted, and am still having diarrhea now (Sat).

I broke out into a cold sweat all over my body and could barely see anything or move my body and I felt very nauseous. I was nearly unconscious and barely able to talk. This lasted for about 20 minutes and then slowly started to recede after that. I felt able to stand after about 40 minutes, and was eventually able to walk out of the store and be driven home.   I am very very healthy and have no major medical conditions.

                                                4/8/21:  I receive the injection at 1:50pm on my left arm.  8pm: I begin experiencing normal side effects: soreness, body aches, and headache.  9pm: In addition to the soreness, body aches, and headache, I start having chills, which last on and off throughout the night. 4/9/21:  7am: I feel fatigued, with headache and body aches throughout the morning and afternoon. 3pm: I begin to have some itchiness on my forehead and both ears. My right knee cap feels hot and bruised, but there is no mark. 5pm: Visible hives appear on my forehead and right knee cap, and my ears are red. All of these spots are very itchy and uncomfortable.  9pm: The hives begin to be much more noticeable and itchier. I take one Benadryl before going to bed which helps the itchiness somewhat. 4/10/21  3:30am: I am woken up by pain in my ears and they have gotten incredible swollen, red, and hot. They are very tender to the touch. I take another tablet of Benadryl.  7am: There are more hives on my forehead and cheeks, as well as my knee and now on two of my fingers. A few spots also appear on my feet and on one toe. My ears are less swollen but still not back to normal, and they are still red, hot and tender.  9am: I have a video call with a Physician?s Assistant who determines it is most likely not an anaphylactic reaction (no swelling in my throat or eyes or any of the other red flag symptoms. I also take my blood pressure with a home monitor and it is normal). He prescribes me a steroid pack.  12pm: The hives begin to be less and less itchy and red.  8pm: The hives are almost completely gone, save for a few spots on my feet. As I am breastfeeding my 14-month-old daughter, I had waited to begin the steroid pack until after our last nursing session of the day (around 7:30pm). As the hives seemed to be going away on their own, I decide to not take the medication. I do take one dose of Zyrtec. 4/11/21:  7am: the hives are completely gone

                                                I am currently Pregnant, due August 11, 2021. I woke from sleep with a sever muscle cramp in my right calf on 04/11/2021 at about 3am after vaccination. The following day I have noticed moderate muscle cramping in both legs and forearms.

                                                I got the J&amp;J vaccine at 9:31am on 4/4/21. At 4:30pm I began to feel lethargic and by 7:00pm I had chills so severe that a heating tower, 2 blankets and a comforter did nothing to warm me. I pulled muscles in my neck and back because I could not stop shivering. Around 9:30pm the shivering stopped and I became extremely overheated - I took tylenol every 4 hours (which was all I could take because I am breastfeeding) and my temperature still reached 103.8 and I threw up several times throughout the night. My fever broke around 4am. I have had stomach pain every day since then and do not know when it will stop or what to do about it.

                                                I received the J&amp;J one-dose vaccine on Thursday, April 8, at approx. 1600. Within an hour I had a mild headache and was nauseous. I went to sleep around 2130. At 0030 (or 30 minutes past midnight) I was awoken to the sudden shock of feeling very cold. My temperature was 91, within 15 minutes I spiked to 100 degrees, and then 15 minutes later I was at 102. I was shivering but felt like I was on fire. I had intense pain throughout my entire body. Internally and topically (skin) my entire body felt like it was on fire -- a burning sensation. Clothes -- even a soft hoodie -- felt like a steel wool scrubber was brushing against my skin and my skin was very hot to touch. I continued to feel nauseous.  After 90 minutes of this, I was able to take acetaminophen (2 x 500 mg). After another 90 minutes, my temperature dipped to 99 and the horrible pain mostly subsided.   From 0530 to 1830, in three-hour increments, my temperature continued to spike and fall between 99-101 degrees and the pain came in the same waves. Nausea continued. So, I continued an acetaminophen regimen throughout the day to help with the symptoms and took a few tums to help too.  After 1830, I felt very weak and tired. My temperature stabilized at normal. Nausea continued.   On Saturday, April 10, I was mostly just tired and had minor body aches/soreness. My shoulder bruised where I was vaccinated. Food did not sit well and my stomach was quick to turn.   Sunday, April 11, mostly back to normal. Although, still fatigued. No major side effects or symptoms.   Monday, April 12, seems to be the same as Sunday.   Note: I had COVID the first week of February 2021.

Back started to hurt and couldn&#39;t get comfortable. Then the whole body started to ache. Quickly the whole body and skin hurt and food and drink tasted bad. Started becoming cold and had to wrap a blanket around. Went to bed and had to take Tylenol every four hours to sleep. Woke up and body aches and feeling cold continued the rest of the day. There was also nausea and headaches on and of the whole day. Went back to work the following day but felt heavily nauseous for most of the day and couldn&#39;t eat or drink much of the day.

Almost 24 hours later I?m still experiencing cold chills. I also developed full body aches to where my bones feel like they are breaking and weak. Around 10 PM I started vomiting and that lasted for a couple of hours. At 2 AM a headache started and is still going on as of 9:46 AM. My bones pop and feel weak.  At other times my body will become extremely hot and soaked in sweat just to go back to cold chills.

The fever and chills lasted around 5 hours. The following day I was weak in my hands and joints were sore.   I am a breastfeeding mom and my son broke out in a rash the following day. He was brought to the doctor. No data to show a correlation though.

                                                I received the vaccination 4/2/21 at 11am and at about 6pm the same day - I felt a sudden flush and felt like I was going to faint in the middle of Grocery store. Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

                                                I have never had side effects to a vaccination before so it was completely unexpected  but it had been approximately 9 to 10 hours (which I had a hard time entering on the page prior where it asked me the times.i couldn&#39;t get it to okay how I had the time) but I had felt completely fine and normal directly after and that evening, but close to around 9 or 10 hours later I developed such a high fever so fast when I took it, it was 103.7 and i could barely stand up to get the thermometer i was SO weak and my whole body ached so bad. I couldn&#39;t stop crying I was so miserable and had to have my ex boyfriend come take care of me because I didnt have anyone else to, but it got so bad I was strongly considering going to the emergency room...I tried to sleep but my body was so restless. I took ibuprofen and it broke my fever but today I still feel achey and weak. I definitely wasn&#39;t expecting that because the guy that did mine said it&#39;s rare and if they do happen they are mild...I would consider my symptoms higher than mild. There  was nothing else that could caused it..everything was the same and the only different factor was the vaccine so I&#39;m 100% sure that it was the cause.

After administration of the vaccine she appeared relieved afterwards and recieved a card with a note to wait for 15 minutes for any reactions. Her mother escorted her to her car, 10 minutes later, her mother came in saying &#34;she&#39;s having a seizure!&#34; We had a certified nurse that was administering the shots that went out to check on her and we had a technician call 911. Patient appeared disoriented in the car and clammy to touch. We checked her blood pressure, and the nurse reported it was a little low. After paramedics arrived was being treated as a vaso-vagal response and she was transported to the nearby hospital.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after the vaccine I developed a very bad headache followed by chills, sweats, congestion, chest pain, body pain, muscle pain, fatigue and fever. The muscle pain and weakness was so bad I would loose balance when walking. I then started to menstruate clots, not my normal cycle timing,  which lasted about 2 days. The clots subsided but I am still bleeding today. I was in bed for 4 days with severe immune response symptoms. After those symptoms subsided the fatigue was so extreme it was hard to function.

My arm continued to have red discoloration and soreness for about a week after injection.  One the redness went down the injection site was hard and continues to feel as though there is a marble under my skin.  It&#39;s about the size of a Nickle and now bruised.    This might be normal but wanted to report it in the event that it&#39;s not.

At 6:45 I had a fever, body aches, pain in my arm, headache, and chest pain. These symptoms continued for three days and my fever reached 102.7.  After three days the fever and body aches subsided but the fatigue and chest pain continued. The chest pain has continued with increased heart rate during small bursts of activity. I called the clinic that administered my shot on April 9th and was told chest pain was normal up to 10 days and if it continued to be a problem to go to the ER. After 11 days of chest pain I went to the ER on April 13th and they did an EKG, CT with contrast, and blood work. They concluded I was fine. I was told it could be esophagitis so to take 2 15mg Prevacid a day which I have done with no relief. I was also informed it could be muscle related so I have iced, taken anti-inflammatory medication, and have not exerted myself.  It is now April 19th and I am still experiencing chest pain and racing heart rate with minimal exertion.

Scheduled appointment.   4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     She has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   Patient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  Advised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   Today, patient presents states he feels &#34;a lot better&#34;. Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    She was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    Her mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   Phone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient&#39;s history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   I did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning for another state by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.

                                                During my menstrual cycle I usually have no symptoms other than tender breasts. So these symptoms were very unusual. Leg pains, pain and pressure in pelvis, clitoral pain, pain around vaginal opening, stinging like acid during urination that sent a shock through my entire body, uncontrollable bladder, nausea, large blood clots, lower stomach pain, flank pain, hot/cold chills, if I touch my belly button the pain radiated to my vagina, ovaries hurt, cervix pain, dryness, unable to get comfortable, crawling out of my skin, and constant urge to urinate, depression.  I landed myself in the ER where they told me to take Tylenol and Motrin and sent me on my way. These medications were not able to control the amount of pain I was in. I have now reached out to a couple specialists.

                                                4 days after the vaccine I started having periodic sharp pains in my uterus which made me think my period was coming. 6 days post vaccine I started bleeding lightly and the periodic sharp pains continued. 8 days post vaccine I woke up in the most excruciating pain of my life. It was the most severe menstrual type cramps I have ever experienced. I also had a severe headache which I never get. I took 600mg of ibuprofen. The pain continued for hours and I tried my best to breath through it. When I went to the restroom there was only a little blood but large amounts of fleshy tissue began discharging from me. Later that day when the tissue seemed to slow down the pain began to subside to a tolerable threshold (although still more severe than normal). I then began to bleed heavier than any other previous cycle. Normally I have a medium bleed for 2.5 days. This heavy bleeding lasted 6 days. I felt extremely dizzy and weak. Finally when the bleeding stopped I started to feel myself regain strength over the next few days although the sharp intermittent jabs of pain in my uterus lasted about three days after the bleeding stopped. I now am feeling back to normal and recovered. I never went to the ER but came very close to going during that time.

Body began to ache to the point I was in tears. Checked fever again and was at 99.9. Took more Tylenol and Ibuprophen and went to bed as much as I could. Woke up and took Tylenol the next morning. Checked temperature because I still had a pounding headache and was at 100.2, started sweating and shaking as in cold sweats. No appetite. Spent most of the day resting with most symptoms still accruing. On 3rd day I have no fever. I?m not as weak and I?m able to get around a lot better. Still a little nauseous but definitely feeling better then the previous days.

                                                My Rheumatologist suggested I report this:: I had no side effects other than a sore arm and some tiredness up until approx 6 hours after the injection. At approx 8:30 PM, I was lying in bed and both of my legs from the hips down started to shake violently. It did not feel like the chills as I was not cold and the rest of my body was unaffected. The shakes felt completely involuntary as if my brain was short circuiting. My legs shook so violently that my hip joints began to really hurt. Shaking lasted less than 30 minutes total. I am not sure what stopped the shaking, but I had tried to put my body weight over my legs  (body folded in half) to try to stop the shaking and took 1 regular strength tylenol.  After the shaking ended, up until I went to sleep (maybe 3-4 hours later) I felt some numbness and tingling in my finger tips and feet.  The next day, I felt fine but emailed my Rheumatologist to report the shaking and she directed me to report it here.

Intense started in early evening in upper arms and neck and spread through entire body.  Felt as if bones hurt.  In bed 10 hours but got little rest.  Chills and sweats.  Note that the pain is the exact same I had when I had COVID several months ago, which has flared up on and off since.  Next day symptoms are mostly gone, some tiredness and soreness remains.

Was able to sleep until about 3:00 a.m., at which point I woke up to changing temperatures from hot to cold, headache and muscle aches. Most of the aching is occurring in my legs and arms. The back of my thighs are the worst, then my valga, and lastly my biceps and triceps. The headache is mild.

Hard to sleep that night because I was so achy. By the morning I had a fever of 99 (never went higher than that), headache, sore joints and muscles that lasted through the whole day/felt like a mild flu. Waking up on 3/28/21 (day two after shot) my low grade fever was gone and symptoms are mostly gone. Just a slightly sore arm.

I am better this morning, just very tired, slight headache and slight achy.

First day after felt slightly better, still tired and slightly light headed. Second day symptoms worsened, feeling like I was going to pass out/faint, hot/cold chills, clammy, no fever, shortness of breath, culminating in numbness and tingling in arms, legs, then chest and then hands freezing up which resulted in a panic attack. Have never had a panic attack before. Emergency services called and after checking gave a sedative and went to the ER.

                                                I got the vaccine, then was asked (due to having previous allergic reaction to Levaquin in the past, I was asked to wait 30 minutes) I got up and walked a total of 30 feet to sit in a chair. I felt completely normal, up until this point. I sat down and began to text my Mother that I had just got the vaccine &amp; I was told to wait 30 minutes, at this point (2 mins in) I felt normal. I sat my phone down on my lap and was just looking about. I began at that point (2 1/2-3 mins mark) seeing the tile floor morph; the blue tiles and the green tiles kept merging together and forming one color. Then my heart raced, immediately and I started having hot flashes that shot out my ears. My heart raced even more and at that point I had realized something wasn?t right. A National Guards member came up to me and had asked if I were okay, I explained I was not and something was not right. They took me to a medical area and made me take deep breaths, and made me drink some water. My BP was high, and my Pulse Ox had dropped slightly, and then went straight back to normal once they had asked me to stick my head between my knees and keep breathing deeply. Also, both of my ears had turned deep red/purple and they were VERY warm to the touch. They felt as if heat were tunneling out of them. The only way I can explain truly how I felt, and I have NEVER done it fully, I felt as if I was fainting. Out of nowhere I felt as if I was going to pass out ? but it didn?t happen. The entire ?spell? lasted about 20 mins? I was monitored for an additional 40 minutes and was allowed to leave.

Felt a little nauseous immediately after shot. Flu symptoms came on around 10pm and lasted until about 5pm on 3/21/2021. Worst period of symptoms was overnight (about 12 hours.) Took 2 Tylenol 2-3 times while I was experiencing side effects which helped some with symptoms.  Had pain with injection and sore arm for about 48 hours after. It was a much more severe, deeper muscle pain than with other vaccines.

Patient was anxious even before administration.Patient came back to pharmacy drop off at about 7.20/7.22pm stating she was not feeling good. She was flushed, her face was pale, patient was alert and communicating. She was really dizzy, so I had her lay on the floor. Requested my technician to get get wet towels and wiped patient&#39;s face. Within 3-4 mins she was feeling much better. But still dizzy. Had her take a few sips of Gatorade and remain laying on the floor for about 45 mins

Took Ibuprofen, rubbed &#34;cramp cream&#34; on legs, used heating pad under multiple blankets to keep warm.  Had trouble sleeping because of the throbbing, but woke up with a headache and some arm pain. Feeling a lot better on day 2.

                                                Brain fog approximately one hour post vaccine. Approximately 4 hours after the vaccine, chills started, approximately one hour after chills (5PM) temperature began to rise. After taking temperature, it was 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Took tylenol to attempt to lower temperature, however it did not minimize temperature significantly. In addition to the fever, the onset of intense migraine and severe dizziness occured. Took a second dose of tylenol and the temperature did not reduce- and raised to 104.9 degrees fahrenheit. I was unable to sleep the night the vaccine was administered as my head was throbbing and spinning so intensely. I may have had an increased  heart rate- which likely prevented my body from being able to settle, despite other side effects. I also had loss of appetite due to fever, and was able to eat normally until approximately 2 days after the vaccine. The fever broke approximately 24 hours later, however fatigue set in afterwards and lasted through the following week (felt mostly normal the Thursday after receiving the shot 3/18/2021).

Pulled over and called 911 because I thought I was going to pass out and couldn?t breath normally. I was by myself.  Lasted about 3-5 minutes. I started to feel better while on the phone with 911 dispatcher. I was able to walk to the ambulance. Still felt a little woozy, but could breath fine. My chest got a little heavy while in back of ambulance, but not as severe. Was transported to ER.  Discharged same day Diagnosis- vaccine reaction; syncope near-vasovagal reaction

                                                My shot was around 12 noon. I didn&#39;t eat before so they gave me crackers and juice at the site. Afterwards I ate a real meal and two hours later I got dizzy. It was tolerable.  At 9:30 PM I got a fever. Then I felt pressure all over my body, pressing me down; I felt so heavy I could barely move. That&#39;s when my joints started to ache and I had piercing pain in my right knee and the bones in both hands. Then I got really dehydrated. No matter how much water I drank, it wasn&#39;t enough. Then I got chills, then a headache. It felt like I had sold my soul to Satan and he was sucking it out through my limbs, very slowly. I thought I might be an anomaly that died from a bad reaction. I tried to sleep so I wouldn&#39;t feel the pain anymore. That attempt took 3 hrs. The next day my migraine and joint soreness persisted. I felt so weak I didn&#39;t get up for hours. Thr second night I still felt unquenchingly dehydrated. Third day I only felt soreness in my arm from the actual shot.

Immediately after she had a syncopal episode and was unresponsive for about 1 minute. We immediately called 911, lay her flat and raised her legs. She became responsive and was alert and oriented X  3. We were unable to get a BP reading but her color was improving and she remained alert. We repositioned her in a supine position and she had another syncopal episode. We raised her legs again and she improved immediately. EMS arrived shortly after. She remained alert and responsive  and was evaluated for about an hour and released to her spouse. She didn&#39;t want to be evaluated at the hospital. She made record of having a similar episode during a procedure at her doctor&#39;s office.

My body felt very hot but I was still cold. Went to bed without taking any pain relief. I woke up at 2 AM, took Tylenol and went back to sleep. I woke up again at 3 AM, felt very hot and turned on my fan. When I woke up in the morning at 7:30 AM, my body still aches and I still had a headache. I took more Tylenol. Headache went away but for the rest of the day I felt very lethargic, a little foggy in my brain, slightly achy. I took Tylenol again when I went to bed at 9 PM and when I woke up at 4 AM the next morning I felt better. All symptoms are gone.

The feeling is similar to when you bump your funny bone, but more muted. The sensation began about 10-15 minutes after the injection. It is relieved with Aleve, but returns once the effects of the medication subside.

                                                approximately 5-6 hours after vaccination I developed a severe migraine that was unresponsive to tylenol and ibuprofen.  I had chills, body aches, and general malaise. The migaine remained severe throughout that night until around 5 AM the next morning when I took Tramadol which finally relieved the migraine which then became only a mild to moderate headache. I stayed on the tramadol for another 24 hours which during this time my additional symptoms were improving. By Monday morning (approximately 36 hours after receiving the vaccine) my clinical signs were almost completely resolved. After this there was only a mild headach and lethargy for an additional few days.

Approximately 4-5 minutes later I started feeling really hot. Then I started getting nauseous and dizzy. I tried to get up and walk to the pharmacy desk (vaccine occurred at pharmacy) but fainted midway there. I was out less than one minute and after sitting down and having some water and putting ice packs on my face I felt better. I have never in my life fainted before. I wasn?t nervous or scared to have the vaccine.   I followed up with my regular doctor on the Monday following the vaccine and had an EKG and bloodwork done all of which came back normal.

                                                I took the Johnson and Johnson vaccine on March 6th. The following day my left arm was sore and my right ear was hurting. On March 10th I went to my doctor office because my right ear pain would not go away. The NP diagnosed me with having trigeminal neuralgia. She subscribed me some nerve pill to take two times a day. On March 17th I went to my dentist complaining that my lower right side of my teeth was hurting me. He took x rays and didn?t see anything, but did an unnecessary filings on my top right side of my teeth which cost me $149. I got in my car and called the NP complaining that my teeth was hurting me. She said it?s because of that trigeminal nerve that goes from the ear to the mouth which is causing the trigeminal neuralgia. She said it?s okay to take one nerve pill in the morning and two at night. That Saturday, March 20th I couldn?t sleep and was in excruciating pain. I went to the ER to see if they could give me any relief. The ER doctor did a CT and which confirm I do have trigeminal neuralgia. He referred me to a neurosurgeon. I finally got an appointment with the neurosurgeon on Friday, April 16th. On April 3rd I was in so much pain again. I called my doctor office and she up the nerve pill that I can take up to 4 times a day if needed. So now I take 4 nerve pills a day along with ibuprofen and extra strength pain reliever pill.

This was followed by headache, nausea, joint and muscle aches, and shaking from the chills.  I had difficulty sleeping overnight and the next morning, I had a fever of 101-degrees and was still very fatigued.  The symptoms all went away within 24 hours.

Symptoms I think are not part of the vaccine side effects include cough (mild mucus), sinus pain, stuff/runny nose (painful burning sensation when I blow my nose), some scratchiness in ears and throat, and loss of taste and smell. The last one (no taste/smell), is the most unusual, I&#39;v never had this before.

In the 5 minutes waiting for paramedics, the numbness spread to the right hand and up to the right elbow. Dizziness became intense. Once in the ambulance (5-10 minutes after onset), legs experienced light numbness, and chest tightness increased, with what felt like spasms / clenching of the heart muscle. Chills and out of body feeling occurred as well.   Paramedics examined heart, pulse, oxygen, with all being normal. IV was inserted and Ativan was given. After 10-15 minutes symptoms subsided.

Instead of beginning to wane, my period started to get extremely heavy and I started passing clots again about 24hr after the injection. On the night of 4/12 I passed an unusually large clot, roughly the size of a hockey puck and felt very faint and weak. I continued to bleed quite heavily until this morning (4/19), for a total of 14 days. I called my obgyn on Tuesday of last week to report the excessive bleeding and that my cervical lymph nodes had become so swollen that it was bothersome to swallow. My Dr said to go to ER if I experienced typical blood clot/PE symptoms and had received no guidance about the effects of this vaccine on menstruation.  I have had mild headaches, sore throat, mild fevers and fatigue as well since the injection

I refused further medical care because I felt better once the ambulance arrived. I visited my primary care doctor on 4/13/2021 to follow up.  He said it was likely an occular migraine.  A blood test was ordered and results came back as essentially normal.  I have been continuing to have dizzy spells, headaches, blurry vision and light sensitivity. An MRI of my  brain and spinal cord has been ordered for 4/29 to rule out other conditions.

From about 8:00 pm - 8:45 pm I experienced a pattern of 30-90 seconds of normal vision, then 1-2 seconds of only being able to see light/colors/shapes (I had lasik in 2016, my prescription was -4.75, the 1-2 seconds of bad vision I experienced was like when I removed my glasses before having lasik correct my vision). This pattern of 30-90 seconds normal vision then 1-2 seconds of bad vision repeated for about 45 minutes. During this time I was also very dizzy and lightheaded.   My other side effects were as expected (fever of up to 102, chills, VERY sweaty, did not have energy to remove my sweatshirt when I was hot, headache).  I am only reporting this in case it is important/helpful for further studies/development of the vaccine and public health.

I had fever chills and aches within the first 24 hours after the vaccine. The body aches were there till Thursday. Once the body aches started subsiding, I felt the numbness and tingling in the legs on Thursday. Then it spread to my arms. Stays in the legs. Then I started feeling in back of arms and upper back. Certain things make it worse, laying and sitting is worse. Standing helps it. I have no swelling.  I have never had a reaction before to a vaccine.  No problems ambulating, no breathing problems, no wheezing.  I would also like a refill of my headache medication and inhaler today.  The patient is a 35 year old female who presents with a complaint of COVID vaccine reaction. COVID Janssen J&amp;J vaccine recieved on 04/11/2021 at Pharmacy, IM in left deltoid.  Several hours later I had fever/chills/body aches/ racing heart which lasted 24 hours. The body aches lasted for 72 hours. I began noticing numbness and tingling in my extremities as well as in my upper back. The numbness and tingling worsens when  I sit and lay down.  No bowel/ bladder problems.  I also have Raynaud&#39;s and I do not know if that ties in to my symptoms at all.  My nipples have also been abnormally hard and sensitive.

                                                Within about 2 hours, I felt really tired. A couple hours later I got body aches and tingling sensation on the left leg.  That night it got worse, hurt and some numbness. The following day I had abdominal pain and still had leg symptoms. On Saturday I needed up going to Urgent Care .  They did a Urine test, that was negative, but did see traces of blood but she wasn&#39;t concerned and did I send it our for a culture test. She sis an exam and a little concern because she wasn&#39;t aware of the side effects and ordered an ultra sound. She told me to take Tylenol and sent me home. I was still experiencing all everything the next day and developed a headache. The Urgent care Dr had called me the next day asked me to go in and get the Ultra sound.  They didn&#39;t find anything. I did have another ultra sound scheduled and had it done, I got the results and it was fine. She thinks the vaccine effected my nerves.  I also seen my Primary Physician because I had a fever as well, she did an exam and ordered Blood work and CT scan (abdomen). Everything came back normal.  My OCO believes it&#39;s my nerves as well. I believe it effected my mensural   cycle as well because it&#39;s earlier and heavier.

Monday around 8PM: fever &amp; chills gone, body aches still there all over my body, headache,  fatigue 3. Tuesday: Body aches still bad all over and headache 4. Wednesday: Body ache a little better and headache, tingling/nubmness starts in both legs (faintly) 5. Thursday: body ache barely there, soreness in arm at injection site, tingling/numbness in legs (sharp pain) 6. Friday: tingling/numbness in legs - mainly back of my thighs - sometimes also feeling this tingling  in my arms and upper back area 7. Saturday: same, tingling/numbness in legs/sometimes in arms/upper back, body still sore to the touch 8. Sunday: same, tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back, body still sore to the touch 9. Monday: same, same, tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back ? Called DR to speak with nurse about this as didn&#39;t feel normal to have this reaction, went into dr for appt on Tuesday, April 20. 10. Tuesday: Saw Dr.  at 7:30am about tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back. Possible reaction to vaccine or more? Took labs/blood work: Vitamin B-12 (82607), Folic Acid Serum (82746), CBC / Platelets &amp; Aut Diff (85025), TSH (Tyroid Timulating hormone) (84443), Metabolic Panel (80053), Quest blood draw (36415), Sed rate erythrocyte (85651) - ALL came back normal. 11. Wednesday: same, tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back, but the tingling this day got a little less intense. Not as painful today. 12. Had follow-up appt on Thursday, April 22 - took more tests. Tingling/numbness in legs but felt like Wednesday as a little less painful - didnt feel it as much in arms/back. Felt more like when your hand falls asleep and blood comes rushing back into it, thats how my legs felt this day, so more soreness than pain. 11. Friday: Symptoms same as the past 1 days, feel like tingling is getting a tad better.

It has been weeks and it is still very sore and a little swollen, which is right above where I received the injection. It is causing my shoulder to lock up, I cannot move it in certain direction or lift items at times. I have taken ibuprofen every day since then. I finally went to the doctor and they has me taking  2400 mg of prescription ibuprofen and on flexeril muscle relaxers for 2 weeks to see if I get any relief.

Heart racing and fatigue continued but right hand was noticeably pins &amp; needles.  Took a very hot shower around 11 PM and felt better, but right hand continues to be &#39;cold.&#39; -- Reporting this because I&#39;d never heard of any neurological(?) effects.  Probably just vaccine doing its thing and interacting with my slightly odd biochemistry.  Hopefully will be better in the morning!  ~ Also, an older member of the household received same lot of vaccine at same time: 0 side effects.

By 6:30 I felt like my body was burning up on the inside but had no fever. My muscles in my neck became extremely tight and my ears aches. The injection site is extremely tender and hurts to lift my arm. As of 11 am the next day I have also added diarrhea to the list of symptoms.

It felt like a muscle spasm or like electricity was being pulsed through my body. First it would happen in one leg, and then the leg would curl up under my body. Then it would spasm in my chest and my arms would be drawn inward. Then the other leg, or sometime multiple locations at once. I didn&#39;t feel cold at the time. This lasted for 40 minutes total. I took 1000 mg Acetaminophen at  3:00 am.  Then, as the shaking lessened, I became very cold. I put on lots of clothes and laid on a heating pad under my comforter. Sometime later, I became very hot. Throughout the night into the morning, I felt feverish and chilled back and forth. At 6:00 am I took 200 mg Ibuprofen. I then spent the rest of the day with fever, chills, and body aches. Everything was achy and I was very tired. I slept well that night. The next day I was fatigued.

While driving home my muscles seem to shut down. My face was numb I couldn?t move my hands or my legs to drive. I had to pull over on the highway for 20min until my hands legs and face regained mobility.

                                                First I felt lightheaded/dizzy, then became nauseous, and my feet and hands were numb and tingling, I felt like my tongue was getting bigger but the primary care dr at the clinic didn&#39;t think so. They eventually after monitoring me for awhile sent me down to ER, by then my voice was raspy and scratchy, my lower lip was big, my tongue still felt big. I still felt nauseous. The dr asked me if my eyes are usually swollen and red and I said no. My extremities were still numb and tingling. I got epi and other drugs, zofran, benadryl, pepcid, I think a dose of steroids. The symptoms continued so I ended up getting a 2nd dose of epi. I went home around 5pm. When I woke up that evening to do a neb treatment I was nauseous, my lower lip again big, my tongue felt thick and this time my upper throat felt swollen, I gave myself epi and took myself to ER, they monitored me for 3 hrs the dr was gonna hospitalize me if I got worse, I still felt nauseous and the numbness and tingling feeling in my hands and feet when I left but was not having any airway issues when I left. Not sure if the numbness/tingly is gonna go away in my hands and feet.

I sat in a hot bath for about an hour and they stopped. When I got out I took ibprophen and went back to bed. Soon they started again and I piled on a weighted blanket to get them to calm down and eventually fell asleep. I also had a lot of head heaviness and pressure during this time. The next morning I woke up with body aches from all the tensing up and felt week and still had head pressure. By midday I was back to normal. Still some injection site soreness and swelling her today, Monday 3/15.

I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

The technician held the pt up and supported her head and neck while asking pt if she was OK.  When pt came to she was happy and said &#34;hi&#34; to the technician.  Soon after she laid on the floor and started crying and saying her hands were cramping and in pain.  She also stated she was very nauseous and felt like she was going to throw up.  Pts husband agreed that we should call an ambulance which we did.  When paramedics arrived pt was feeling better and refused a ride to the ER.  Pt&#39;s husband took her to the car and drove her to the ER.

                                                A lady received her vaccine and went over to sit in the waiting area.  A few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient walked up to the counter and said she wasn&#39;t feeling well.  When I went over she said she was really lightheaded and was sweating and felt like she was going to faint.  I had her lay on the floor and elevate her feet.  I put an ice pack on her forehead.  She never lost consciousness and felt better after a few minutes. She eventually sat back up and stayed in the waiting area for a while longer to be monitored.  She did state that she felt a cold rush in her chest right before she became lightheaded. She ended up feeling fine and went home.

I went to bed and had difficulty sleeping because I felt so hot. When I woke up the next day, I had a fever of 99.7. I took Tylonol, but still had body aches, chills, a headache, fatigue and some nausea, as well. I slept most of the day, ate bland foods and continued to take Tylonol every 4-5 hours. I began to feel better around 6pm the day after the shot.

I got hot and sweaty and horrible tunnel vision, I almost fainted. I laid down on one of their medical beds to recover while the sweet nurse fanned me.  I was observed over 30 min before leaving.  I woke up yesterday and felt weird along with bodyaches, chills, joint pains, random stinging sensations throughout my body (almost like a pen prick), sporadic short headaches and muscle cramps.  I left work yesterday and didn?t even go in today.

At 8pm got hit with chills, fever of 100F, entire neck and back started to ache and have pain, mild headache, and both hands and fingers felt weak and had a burning sensation. Took another 500mg Tylenol then laid down and fell asleep around 9pm. Woke up at 11pm drenched in sweat with same symptoms. Changed into dry clothes and woke up again around 3am drenched in sweat again, but fever was gone. Woke up on April 9 feeling lethargic, a tire body was achy and sore and had a headache. Fever never came back and the weakness and burnings ends ruin in hands was gone as were the chills. Throughout the day I rested and had physical therapy to loosen my muscles in my neck and back. By the end of the day I still had a headache and sore back and neck. Woke up on Sunday april 10 and back achy ness is tolerable, headache is still present, but manageable. Took 600 mg Advil in morning.

                                                Almost immediately after receiving the vaccine, the patient reported feeling lightheaded and then she lost consciousness. She began convulsing. I stabilized her and directed my staff to call 911 and store management. Within 15 seconds of its inception, she regained consciousness. We ended the phone call for next level care. We gave the patient an ice pack for her neck and a bottle of water. Once aware again, she mentioned that she hadn&#39;t eaten anything today. We got her a candy bar as well. Within 20 minutes, she was able to walk out of the store under her own power.

                                                After sinus surgery, low grade fever, shakes, chills, muscle pain, headache that did not fit with recovery time from sinus surgery. Dizziness... overreactive immune response. Rapid heart rate.  Headache severe, throbbing and not helped by Tylenol or Ibuprofen.   Infection from the surgery resolved after antibiotics but symptoms remained. Told I might have a &#34;virus&#34; and my immune system was over reacting. Vitamin B12 shot. Currently taking prednisone but still short of breath and fatigued.

                                                I got the vaccine at 4pm at the pharmacy where I work. I had no symptoms except for very mild local injection discomfort but was able to do my usual normal activities. At 2 am that evening, I woke up with  a lot of pain in my legs, I felt they were so heavy to move around in bed. My lower back was extremely painful too, I tried to stand up to walk a bit, the pain was very severe and I couldn?t stand straight, it was very hard to drag my feet, they felt very heavy and my muscled were painful to the touch even. So went back to bed, and was in agony. I had to go to work in the morning to open the store I work at until they find me coverage. Driving was very hard with my painful legs. J reached the store and I was walking very slowly, I couldn?t have a full control over my legs, they were painful waist down, and felt very heavy, when I sat down my muscles were painful wherever pressure was applied to them (from the chair).  Lightheadedness: I felt lightheaded when I woke up from bed at night to try to walk and ease the pain. So decided to go back to bed to prevent falls. At work, while walking and sitting, I had episodes of very light headidness and sat often on the floor and lifted my legs. Measured my blood pressure on 3 occasions it was 90/50  then 100/50 then 110/60. One time only I fainted where my colleagues put me down and lifted my legs.  At 8am (morning of 3/9/20201) I had a feeling of  heavy breathing. Needed to take deep breath as if my lung muscles were tired and needed to take deep breath to fill them with enough air. At work and because of the increased intensity of muscles pain, I started to breath faster and deeper coz I was in agony   Headache: severe and excruciating headache started from 6am to 12pm on 3/9/21.   Throughout the symptoms, I refused to take medications to let the vaccine run its course. My family drove me back from work coz I was weak and lightheaded and in severe pain at 10.30am. Came home, took one Advil 200mg at 11am. I was completely pain free  at 12pm. Lungs still felt weak, needed to breath deeper for two days but then got better.

                                                I have a 9 month old daughter. I breastfeed her on a regular basis, every 4-5 hours. Twelve hours after receiving the vaccine along with the usual expected side effects -- fever and chills - I experienced a decrease in milk supply. My daughter was latched on the right breast and then on the left for a total of 15 minutes, there was no let down and no milk was flowing (I was intently listening and she was not swallowing which means no milk was coming out of either breast), let down usually happens after 2 minutes for me. The milk returned the following feeding, about 2 hours later although the let down took longer- about 10 minutes after she was latched on, and there was definitely less milk because my breasts were not full and at this point after 9 hours of no breastfeeding my breasts would have been very full and I would be experiencing some pain because of the fullness. My breastmilk supply is back to normal now.

It lasted about 24 hours. LEG PAIN:  About 5 hours after my vaccine, both legs were very sore/painful.  Both legs have been sore every day since the vaccine. Pain/discomfort is worse in both calves than in upper leg. Pain/discomfort is least in the morning when I wake up. It gets worse throughout the day and with movement.  After 15 minute walk, my calves are tingling/crampy. I get some relief by laying down and putting my legs up the wall.

About 3 days ago I started getting a major headache on the right side that also arrived with blurry vision, mental fog and mild dizziness. Nausea yesterday and today except the headache was much worse. I cried from the pain and this is when I became more concerned. My eyes, mainly the right side and a pressure in my sinuses were very difficult to bare with, subsided some with multiple doses of ibuprofen and Advil sinus but not by much. The headache is unbearable, painful to stand out bend over or move.

But then by Tuesday (4/6) of the next week I started feeling pain in my right arm and then sometimes I would get the sensation of it falling asleep.  I havent felt that sensation anymore since Sunday (4/11).  By Friday (4/9) I started feeling pressure in my chest in the mornings.  I have been having these two discomforts till today.  Yesterday was the worst feeling it was morning and then all of a sudden everything went white and I was about to faint then my heart started racing so fast.  I have never experienced any of these symptoms in my life.  I am not a person that gets sick or is sick of something.

I felt weak with chills.  This began the consecutive 7 day cycle of fever, chills, and sweats.  During this time, my fever would range from 101.1 to 103.  After taking two extra strength tylenol it would come down but then go back up before the 6 hour mark to take the next dose.   The chills were the worst of the symptoms as they were full body spasms curling me into the fetal position.   As the Tylenol would kick in, the chills and fever would subside and I would begin to sweat. This was a full body sweat that soaked my clothing and bedding.

                                                On March 13th, 2021 I was given the opportunity to receive the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid 19 vaccine so I decided to go ahead and get vaccinated.  Within 1.5 hours of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel unwell. It started with my left leg going numb. From there symptoms continued to increase. I got very tired could hardly stay awake. Then the chills hit. I could not get warm.  By the next morning (Sunday day 2) I had developed a low fever, headache, body aches and whole body weakness. I could still hardly stay awake still. When I was awake, I was very dizzy and I felt like everything around me was moving but I was not. My left leg still felt numb but I thought it would pass on its own.. Because of how I felt, I just laid around and rested. My injection site was swollen, Red and extremely hot to touch.  Next comes Monday (day 3), I got up that morning, still not feeling well. I made my way to work. That did not go well. The more I moved, the worse I felt. I was completely unbalanced and looked like I was drunk. I couldn&#39;t walk straight, I had to randomly grab onto chairs and sit down. I was feeling weaker by the minute. I left work at that point and went to see my primary physician that afternoon. At this point I could see straight to drive myself, could hardly walk as my left leg now dragged. I had no balance and having lots of dizzy spells at this point. He suggested I head to th ER but eventually decided we could wait until morning to see if things improved at all. If no improvement,  I was to go to ER. Tuesday Morning (day 4), my husband took me to the emergency room. I had reached the point of not being able to walk unassisted. At this point, the weakness and numbness I had on my left, had spread to my right side. We had no idea what was happening. We got right in and discussed what was going on. What lead up to me being there, etc. The ER ran blood work, xrays of my chest and 3 different MRIs trying to figure out if something happened like a stroke. NOTHING was present on any test they did yet there was something obviously wrong with me. My arm was still very Red and hot.. I had developed a lump in my arm where the vaccine was given. After ruling out everything the doctor could think of, he consulted with the on call neurologist since it was obvious to him something was happening with my neurological system. The diagnosis...my body was taking the vaccine as a toxin causing my neurological system to react and shut down. They felt that I should be starting feel better in the next few days as the vaccine settles into my system. I was told to follow up with a neurologist and my primary. I was then discharged from the hospital in the condition I had arrived.  Wednesday (day 5) I spent the day at home, not able to do anything. I napped most of the day. I still felt like crap and had no idea when I would start feeling better. No improvement that day.  Thursday (day 6) I woke up feeling a bit better. My right side was beginning to feel normal again but I was still feeling weak and unbalanced. This is also the day I meet with a neurologist to follow up. I don&#39;t know that this appointment had accomplished much as she didn&#39;t have access to all my medical records. She ended up prescribing me a medication to help with nerve pain I was having in my left side and referred me to do physical therapy. I am to follow up in 2 months.  Friday (day 7) my right side is back to pre-vaccine stage. My left is not. I feel pretty good except the occasional dizzy spell and the fact my left isn&#39;t working yet.  Day 8 and beyond...I&#39;m feeling ok. I went back to work but still have issues with my left side and residual dizzy spells. I began physical therapy 2 days a week to work on strengthening my left side however it has yet to help.  I am now just over 4 weeks post covid vaccine. I am now using a cane to help me walk as my left side has still not returned to normal. It is unknown if it will. I&#39;m in Physical therapy 2x a week still. The lump at injection site is now the size of a pea. I still have moments of unbalanced feeling and dizzy spells.

It would go always for a few hours, then come back, go away, come back, etc. This lasted up to three days ago.

                                                I started getting fatigued and achy around 5 pm. By 6 pm I started to feel chilled and a fever began to form. By 6:30 or so I was shaking intensely and my fever was climbing quickly. By 8 pm I had a fever of 102.7 F. I took two Advil around 7 pm. My fever stayed that high for less than an hour, but it stayed at around 101.5 throughout the night. When I wok up at 6:30 it was still over 101. It took until early afternoon to go all the way back down to my normal temperature of 97.6 (that has been my normal temperature throughout the pandemic). I had a pounding headache throughout the night (with a fever) and for most of the next day. Today, on the 3/8, I will have some joint and muscle achiness. The most intense aching was in my hips and low back. FYI, I am marking that I have recovered from my adverse reaction in the field below because I am considering the high fever and intense headache and bod aches to have been the adverse reaction. My mild aching right now would not have been worth reporting.

I drifted off to sleep all right around 10:30, but by midnight, my legs were on fire like I?d just run a marathon. I?m pretty sure I had a fever because I was sweating and tossing and turning for what seemed like hours. By 4:00, I had a massive headache and felt like I was going to throw up. I took Advil and Zofran at 4 and went back to bed. Sunday I still battled headache, aches, and fatigue. The fatigue is what&#39;s still lingering yesterday and today.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 4:35 PM. I got a headache around 9:30 PM and took Tylenol at that time. I started getting very cold and shaking around 10:00 PM. My finger nails and lips started getting pale and my temperature started rising. The shaking stopped around 12:15 AM, but my fever continued as high as 101.4 throughout the night and into the morning. I continued taking Tylenol and the fever went away the morning of 3/12/21, but slight chills returned around noon that did not last long. I took more Tylenol that evening for a headache and noticed I had an on and off throbbing pain in my right ear.

                                                Janssen COVID-10 Vaccine EUA  About 5- 10 minutes after the vaccine, I started getting numbness in my left hand and my ears began getting hot. By the 25 minute mark, I noticed numbness in my cheeks, around my mouth and my forehead. I turned around and went back to the Health Department for observation. I sat with a nurse until I passed the hour mark for after the vaccine had been given. By that point, the numbness was gone around my mouth and forehead, but the numbness remained in my cheeks and they were visibly red where they were numb. At this point, I left the health department because my symptoms were getting better. It took about 2.5 hours for the numbness to gone in my cheeks.

I put an ice pack on my head because it feels swollen and there?s a lot of pressure that it?s painful. This morning I tried to eat crackers so I could take ibuprofen but I threw up immediately. I?m currently still experiencing a lot of head pain/ache and nausea and muscle tightness.

                                                04/02/21 12:45 pm ? At approximately 12:45 pm I was called to vaccine tent #1 after reports from staff that a patient was feeling sick after receiving her Janssen injection. I discovered the patient slumped in her chair, head back with eyes closed, skin clammy and cool. Alert and oriented x3, speaking slowly but clearly. Per vaccine nurse, she administered the Janssen injection to patient at 12:41 pm  (Lot 1805020, exp 5/25/2021, Left Deltoid) and a few minutes later the patient started to close her eyes and leaned back in chair requiring assistance to sit up.  Nurse was able to stabilize patient in chair and then called for help and that is when I came to assist. Patient remained in this state for several more minutes. Activated EMS for further evaluation as patient did not stabilize immediately. Measured vital signs ? Blood Pressure 98/62, O2SAT 97, Pulse 68.  I continued to monitor the patient until EMS arrived. EMS evaluated patient and cleared but advised to continue to monitor for an additional 15 minutes before leaving the site. Patient verbalized understanding and agreed with plan. Patient remained in observation for an additional 15 minutes with no incident.

                                                I went to a community event (held at a church) for the COVID vaccine. After the vaccine, I wanted the 15 minutes and felt ok - just hot. I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

                                                I took the J&amp;J shot roughly at 11:50a, and naturally felt the immediate burn, and swear I felt the liquid moving through my arm. My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

Patient then ate a snickers bar in her purse and felt better, stating she must have felt uneasy because she had not eaten and was also a bit anxious after getting her shot. Patient walked out of the pharmacy at the end of her observation period saying she felt fine and was going home. Upon calling the patient 12 hours later on her cell to see how she was doing, the patient said she was fine, and no change since she left the pharmacy this morning.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

I also got dizzy and lightheaded. The girl in the car next to me had waved over one of the attendants as well because she was feeling weird too. I got home and had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had and felt flu like symptoms and very weak. The next day at work I was so sick I had to go home. I was puking and had diarrhea  over and over for a few hours. I also felt lightheaded and dizzy and weak. Also had the headache. I was getting chills as well once I got home. Today I just feel very weak and just &#34;off&#34;.

About 10 minutes after the shot, she came back to the pharmacy and reported she was not feeling right.  She was extremely tired, weak, and dizzy.  She was told to sit down for further observation and given a bottle of water.  About 5 minutes later, she said she was still feeling really bad.  She said she was not thinking clearly and didn&#39;t feel right. She was also experiencing moderate pain down her spine.  She said her thinking was so affected that she wanted to seek treatment.   Patient declined offer to call EMS, and proceeded to an urgent care clinic next door.  Urgent care later called the pharmacy to inform us that patient had been transported to the hospital by ambulance.

Pt stated this has happened in the past with shots and blood draws, however, she has never fully lost consciousness. Pt was still c/o dizziness. Pt requested transport to REX ER. Pt was on the cardiac monitor upon EMS 14 arrival and a sinus rhythm was noted. 12 lead revealed a sinus rhythm with no STEMI criteria met. Pt was able to stand and pivot onto the stretcher without incident. Pt secured via straps and loaded into the unit. Once in the unit, VS reassessed. NS was reduced to a KVO rate due to improvement in BP. Pt had received approx 200mL of NS at the time. Pt denied any chest pain, SOB, N/V, or abd pain. Pt only complaint was dizziness. Pt was initially very anxious and was coached through breathing techniques which improved her anxiety. EMS left en route to REX ER.

Pt denied any complaints during transport other than dizziness which she reported was improving. EMS arrived at REX ER. Pt was taken into the ER triage area and was able to stand and pivot onto a wheel chair. NS DC&#39;d, pt received approx 300mL total. Report given to the triage RN and care transferred to same.

                                                Later in the evening after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I developed a 103 degree fever, severe chills, headache, fatigue, and mild nausea/upset stomach.  I tried to hold off for a bit from taking any pain relievers, but did take tylenol about halfway through the night which helped quite a bit. The next day I only had a low grade fever, fatigue and minor stomach upset. I also had some arm pain starting that evening post vaccination and it lasted for about 5 days. I felt mostly fine though within a couple days. I am one week post vaccination and currently feel pretty good. I have been sleeping heavier/more this week but I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s related or not.

Administered the vaccine, gave the patient and her timer, she sat down to be observed. Before her 15 min. was up, she said she was clammy, hot and felt faint. We offered to call an ambulance. She did not want one.  We layed her down in the floor, with legs elevated, took her bp 117/73 (normal), but she was hot. Got her a cold pack and she placed it on her forehead. She layed in the floor for several minutes, but said the cold pack made her feel much better. Waited, we asked her to sit up, took bp again, it was 117/75, she felt better and wanted to go home. Her husband was with her, he drove her home.

At 6:30pm I began to have uterine/abdominal cramping, vaginal pain, lower back pain. At 7:30 I began to feel extremely overheated and a little fatigued. At 9:00pm I felt chills, extreme fatigue, all over body ache and joint pain. At about 2:00 am overnight I again felt extremely overheated. The following morning I continued to feel fatigue, abnormal temperature swings, body ache and joint pain. This lasted until night (about 30/36 hours after the injection). About 48 hours after the injection, I felt some dizziness and abdominal upset.

(not sure if this is still there) Did not miss work due to these side effects.

Upon examination, there is subtle swelling to left lower extremity and doppler revealed multiple DVTs in left lower extremity. CT head without contrast was unremarkable, however, CT venogram of the brain reveals thrombi of the right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinuses, as well as IJ.

                                                Received shot around 2:10 pm. Experienced some stinging at injection site within a few seconds that became uncomfortable for several minutes then disappeared.  At 2:40 texted spouse that my face was tingling.  Started in cheeks and upper lip and spread to nose. A few minutes after that I started having hot flashes and my face was flushed.  Hot flashes lasted for an hour and subsided, tingling has mostly subsided except for area of cheek closest to my nose (it is 6 pm now).  Did not formally check into the urgent care facility but did contact them to see if this was normal.  Was advised to take antihistamine and, and if symptoms worsened to go to ER.  Symptoms did not get worse.

I spoke to a doctor through phone who confirmed these aren&#39;t normal side effects from the vaccine.

                                                Starting in the afternoon after my shot I started feeling extremely cold. I had chills and my teeth were actually chattering at one point it was so bad. This gradually got worse as the evening went on. With it I also started feeling weak and fatigued. By 8pm I started to have a headache. Throughout the night symptoms worsened and I had a fever and more serious headache. My head was pounding so badly. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I also had a couple hot flashes to where I woke up sweating. Then I would feel frozen again. The nausea started during the night too. I thought I would throw up but didn&#39;t. At one point my heart was racing so fast I was a little concerned something bad would happen to me and contemplated going to the hospital. By morning I felt a little better, still nauseous and with a bad headache. My body was a little weak. These symptoms lasted all day Thursday. By that Friday morning I only had a little weakness and slight headache. By mid day Friday I was pretty much back to normal.

Few hours later developed typical &#34;flu like symptoms&#34;.  Next day woke up and both arms, hands, legs and feet and side of face had pins and needles and felt numb. Heart rate sky rocketed and went to ER. Felt like I was going to pass out.  Took blood work at hospital and doctors reassured that the feeling should come back in my legs and arms. When I left  6 hours later my legs were still pins and needles and my joints began to hurt.  A week later and this feeling continues to come and go, but is not consistent.  My joints still randomly hurt and I am an active 38 year old with three kids.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of receiving the injection I experienced pain and numbness in my left arm down through my hand. These symptoms are consistent with what I experience during a migraine. Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine the pain expanded to my neck and face on the left side, soon after followed by a mild headache.   Over the course of the day, within a couple of hours of vaccination, my headache remained mild but expanded to a general head pain that wasn?t confined to just one location. Also around this time I began experiencing neck muscle soreness and became very tired.  It is now approximately 10 hours post vaccination and I still have a mild headache. Migraine symptoms still present but not as notable. I feel run down, tired, an overall sense of malaise, and have full body mild muscle soreness.  No medications or treatments used so far to treat these symptoms.

A few hours after, I felt flushed and slightly feverish with generalized body aches. 6-7 hours after the vaccine, I experienced extreme fatigue, extremely high fever that registered as &#34;err&#34; consecutively on the thermometer numerous times (min of 5 times checked), severe headache, worsening body aches, left flank pain, GI upset with nausea, congestion, dizziness and many heart palpitations. The high fever broke around 11pm and my temp was 102 when checked then and I was drenched in sweat. The fever continued to decrease throughout the next 12 hours. The extreme fatigue, severe headache, dizziness , GI upset and nausea continued throughout the day Saturday and most of Sunday.  I also experienced burning in my chest that radiated into both shoulders, anterior/posterior neck and between both shoulder blades in my back all day Saturday. The burning has decreased over this past week, but I am still experiencing it with some exertion, but not consistently.  Fatigue continues some and SOB at random times.

My stomach hurt, I was nauseated. I went through hot &amp; cold sweats &amp; chills. I got really light headed &amp; disoriented. I began to get a fever.  I felt far from flu symptoms. My heart was racing. I had to get into my shower repeatedly &amp; just lay. I cried. I dont recommend this to anyone! It has been 2 days &amp; i am still experiencing symptoms. I read the fact sheet for the Janssen shot. I am going to get a check up by a doctor. I feel like I am having an allergic reaction. I never felt so much pain in my life; my side effects are far from the flu symptoms.

After that I felt flushed, and around 5:30pm I had a fever and my heart rate began to rise and blood pressure drop.. My heart rate continued to rise until about 9:30pm, and then it began to fall. I also experienced a terrible headache, moderate body aches, and chills and hot flashes. But the diarrhea and rapid heart rate were very concerning to me--I felt very sure something was wrong. This morning I have a low heart rate and low blood pressure and I feel very weak, but other symptoms are gone. I don&#39;t have a primary care doctor and read that the diarrhea and heart symptoms could be signs of a severe reaction and I wanted to report it.

Starting at 8 hrs after the vaccine was administered. When I breastfeed my baby for 36 hours after it felt like razor blades when the milk passed through my nipples and I had clogged ducts. Normally it is not painful and I don?t experience clogs. I got temporary relief soaking in Epsom salts in a hot bath. Even in the hot bath my nipples wouldn?t flatten or go smooth. I?ve never experienced a totally body reaction like this. It really get like every pain receptor that ever had activated reactivated. After 6 hours it subsided and I felt fatigued. During this time my temp was 102.5 I had a fever for 8 hrs. The second day at hour 28 the muscle aches returned but not as bad. While I don?t have a temperature I still feel warm and flushed and had trouble sleeping the second night my back is still sore.

Numbness lasted about an hour. 40-50 minutes post vaccine nausea would come and go. 4 hours post vaccine the typical flu-like symptoms began: extreme fatigue, mild headache, muscle weakness, painful skin, lack of appetite.

                                                April 7th about 6:30pm: I became very confused, having trouble remembering where I was or answering simple questions.  Around that same time my vision became blurry, and my face in and around my mouth became numb, I began to slur as a result.  The numbness and slurring increased over the next hour or so.  After that hour or so, I realized I was exhausted and my head hurt so I went to sleep. I also had a strange emotional response to all of this, I behaved giddily and as though it were funny.  April 8th about 8am: I woke up and the confusion, blurry vision, numbness, and slurring were gone.  I had a mild headache, brain fog, and was still more tired than usual.  Later that evening the headache developed in to something more like a migraine, intense pain focused behind my right eye and blurred vision.  At this time I again decided to go to sleep.  It would have been about 8pm.  April 9th about 8am: I woke up still feeling a moderate headache focused on the right side, still tired, and brain fog.  The symptoms weakened throughout the day and by the evening I was feeling mostly normal again.   I have felt healthy and normal since.

                                                * Arm was very sore for about the first 10 minutes.  Moving it reduced it pretty quickly and was no worse than a minor ache for most of the next day or so. * Had a mild headache before the shot (believe due to not having had caffeine that day yet) * At about 6 pm on 4/10, lost appetite due to mild nausea (just enough to not want to eat but not enough to vomit) * At about this time I noticed I also started to feel a little winded, akin to walking just briskly enough that you have to breath harder than if you&#39;re just sitting / resting.  It did not get any worse than this however, so I opted to keep a close eye and see if it eased (which it would by end of Sunday, 4/11) * At about 8:30 pm on 4/10, noticed I felt warm, had a fever between 100.4 to 100.8 * Also around 8:30 pm I noticed that pain I normally feel from my herniated discs and pinched nerves (L4/L5 L5/S1) just ACHED and was more painful than normal. * Started feeling tired (I&#39;m usually up until around 1-2 am, and I was ready to go to bed by 9pm on 4/10)  Also felt a little forgetful / hard to concentrate on anything * When I went to bed, I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to the white light from my monitor.  This is usually a sign of a painless migraine with auras that essentially blind me for about a half hour.  I did not have auras, though my headache was steadily getting worse to the point I suspect it might have actually been a migraine) * At about 12:30 am on 4/11, the headache got to the point where I could no longer ignore it (best I can describe is it felt like someone was trying to peel my skull of like you would an orange) so I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen.  I also by this point had a fever of 102, though it would drop to 100.5 or so within a few minutes of taking the Ibuprofen. * At about this point the arm starting aching a lot more, I assume because I wasn&#39;t using it while sleeping.  It felt like someone had punched me multiple times hard in the same spot. * I felt much better on the morning of 4/11.  However as the day continued I felt more and more tired.  My temperature was higher than normal but very mild; it stayed around 99.8 for most of the day that I took it.  By Monday, 4/12 I felt mostly fine aside from my arm aching worse than it did when I first got the shot.  Now on 4/14 its pretty much no longer achy.

Pharmacy gave Benadryl when advised of reaction.   15 mins later family drove me to ER to wait to for the Benadryl to take effect in case ER services were needed. ER services were not needed once Benadryl took effect.  I?m at day 14 and still having lingering reoccurring headaches and fatigue.

I woke up at 1am the the next day (4.10.21) with a severe migraine and my heart racing. The migraine was so severe that just bending down made my head pound with extreme pain. I felt very hot and was sweating profusely and my clothes were soaked. I was also very thirsty and drank several glasses of water. I took 4 ibuprofen as it had been 8 hours since my last dose and laid back down in bed and tried to relax. I fell back asleep within 1-2 hours. I felt fine the next morning but did have a slight headache, but it was nothing compared to what I woke up to during the night.

                                                Around 6 pm on the ninth, I started to feel lethargic; really lethargic. 8:30 pm - 100.5 fever. 09:00 pm I had chills that shook my body. Very intense. Extreme body aches and especially legs which prompted me to use a weighted blanket. That was all overnight and excessive sweating overnight. That may have been from the fever. I had nausea that started around midnight. That was mild. I did notice a little bit of a headache at that time as well which was mild. Saturday, fever all day, fatigue. Overnight that night - a little achy; but the chills had gone away. Tuesday night the body aches had gone away - they had diminished Saturday- Monday. I had body aches until about 6 or 7 pm on Monday. The fatigue -all this week I&#39;ve still been dragging - I&#39;m still tired. The fever would go up and down with Tylenol but I needed it until Sunday night. Headache - the first one was gone Saturday morning. I had a headache  Sunday evening and Monday morning. It was gone about lunch time.  The injection site was tender with the delivery of the shot until Sunday when I went to bed. It was not pain but just tender to the touch. Usually that happens with any shot for me but usually it doesn&#39;t stay tender for that long. April 13th - Televisit with a Physician&#39;s Asst in my doctor&#39;s office.

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

                                                Slight chills started to set in 8 hours after the injection. After an hour long bath, the chills were extreme. I shivered and sweated for 12 hours overnight with a severe headache. I tossed most of the night and had to get up to pee 3 times throughout the night - which is extremely uncommon. By 24 hours after the injection, I still had a strong headache and was mostly able to regulate my body temp. By 36 hours after, I felt tired but no longer had a headache or chills. My injection site is red, raised and very tender.

I had the most severe pain throughout the night, unable to move my left arm and nausea from the pain. The fever and chills continued into the next day. Ibuprofen relieves the pain and fever, but it all returns when the medicine wears off. I have a high pain tolerance, and this pain was worse than natural childbirth, and I have given birth twice without any pain medication.

                                                I was fine until about 5 hours later and then oh my was that rough. It started with severe back pain first that came on very sudden. Then I noticed I was sweating real bad and I was so weak it took all my energy to just lift my head off my pillow. Small burst of energy like sitting up became  quite a challenge. All I have done is sleep none stop and when i wake ive noticed a bit of confusion. For example I thought i woke up at 7am tomorrow and then kept falling back asleep on and off till about 8:30 when i realized it&#39;s still today. The body aches and pains were very rough too. My husband went at the same time for the same shot and what Im experiencing vs him is not comparable! He has mild discomfort mine is extreme. Also Ive had a headache a pretty bad one  since about 10pm yesterday as well. Ive been unable to even think about food Im too tired to care even. I have not ate since I was vaccinated yesterday. Ive never reacted to any vaccine or shot of any kind till now.

When I looked over, I saw patient experiences minor convulsions. She was still in her chair. Episode lasted not even 10 seconds. Patient awoke and said she blacked out. She was coherent and responsive. We called 911. Patient said she has no history of seizures or low blood sugar. She said she tends to faint when giving blood or during vaccines due to the needle. Paramedic checked patient out and cleared the patient. No ambulance was taken. Will call patient tomorrow to follow up.

                                                The shot was administered by a young woman at pharmacy, who I later learned was an intern. She injected the shot less than two fingers down from my shoulder bone, much higher than I have ever had an injection given before.  I immediately felt intense pain, and the intern had trouble pushing the syringe down fully.  She said ?I need help!?, and her male manager ran over, and quickly jabbed the syringe further into my arm, and pressed extremely hard down on the syringe, forcing the remaining contents into my arm. I immediately felt a shooting, searing pain down my entire arm, into my wrist, and  my arm went numb, felt heavy, and tingly by my hand.  The manager pulled the needle out of my arm, and said ?you must have hit bone, the needle is bent?.  I then felt extremely nauseous and woozy, and my vision started going in and out.  I fanned myself and after about five minutes my vision stabilized, and I felt less nauseous.  It is now 9 hours later and I have intense shoulder and neck pain, and limited range of motion of my shoulder.

About 20 mins after vaccine I was slightly dizzy and vision a little blurry. I sat down a few more minutes.  About 3 hours later that even is when the chills, body aches, migraine started.   All thru that night I was in pain.  Next day still felt like my head was in a vice with a migraine.  The chills had gone away. still had body aches just not as severe.  Day 3 after vaccine.  SLight headache (nothing  like the vice headache) , arm is still very sore. body aches have subsided considerably.   I treated with taking Tylenol and using a heating pad on my arm and back to help with body aches and pain,.

                                                After the immunization was administered to the patient, she was asked to have a seat in the waiting area for observation.  A few minutes after she sat, she told her husband who was seated with her she didn&#39;t feel well (he did not inform us).  The technician observing her noticed she passed out and reported to the pharmacist (myself).  I designated a team member to call 911 and ran out to the patient.  She was extremely pale and her lips were blue.  With the assistance of her husband I laid her on the floor, had him elevate her feet and checked for pulse and breathing.  I couldn&#39;t immediately find her pulse but within 30 seconds she began to come to.  She appeared to tremor a few times as she came to and her color began to return.  She was extremely confused and did not know where she was upon awakening.  EMS arrived on the scene approximately 10-15 minutes after the event.  They did standard patient evaluation which was unremarkable and proceeded to bring her to the local ED,  According to the patient, the ED visit yielded nothing and they said &#34;she couldn&#39;t be more healthy&#34;.  One note, that was revealed in conversation with the patient while waiting for EMS to arrive is that the patient had very little to eat or drink prior to being administered the vaccine.

                                                Had my injection at 9am and felt fine.  At 5:30pm it hit me like a ton of bricks. My legs (hips, knees &amp; Ankles)  hurt so bad I could barley walk. My lower abdomen and back also hurt and was cramping as if I was in labor.  I took two Tylenol PM and 10mg of Cyclobenzaprine. Then the chills started, I have never been that cold in my life while I was shivering that is when the sweating started and a basically sweat through three pairs of pajamas last night. Woke up around 3am with a pounding headache. By 10am I was feeling wrung out, but a lot better. I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep. Woke up around 3:30pm took a shower and was able to take my daughter to soccer. I am still weak and have some achiness in my knees and ankles.

                                                Headache and very tired the night of the vaccine. At 12:30 AM that night I woke up to what felt like electric shocks going through my body (painful zaps) and in a full body sweat. No fever. I then started shaking uncontrollably and my heart rate increased to the 100s. The shaking and rapid heart rate lasted for 30 minutes. Woke up again multiple times with body sweats.  In the morning still lethargic but all symptoms resolved by noon.

                                                Immediately when I received the injection, I felt a cool fluid rush around my heart with a moderate discomfort/pain. I reported this to the tech who administered. He didn&#39;t seem alarmed &amp; advised I wait 15 mins. I still felt a &#34;coolness&#34; around my chest but otherwise felt &#34;fine&#34; so I was permitted to leave. As the day went on, I felt my chest (lungs &amp; area around my heart) feel tighter &amp; tighter &amp; my breath grew more &amp; more &#34;shallow&#34; like I couldn&#39;t take deep enough breaths &amp; I was short of breath. In the evening, it intensified. I was very fatigued (couldn&#39;t go up our stairs or talk in complete sentences without feeling &#34;winded&#34;). The tightness in my chest was worse &amp; was accompanied by periodic acute pain in my heart. I also had pain my lower back. I went to the emergency room around 10PM that night. An EKG, blood tests &amp; chest X-ray were conducted. The ER doctor said all tests came back &#34;normal&#34; &amp; they weren&#39;t sure what my issue was. I went home &amp; rested. I woke the next morning with the acute pains gone but the tightness still lingered. I did not feel &#34;normal&#34; until almost 72 hours after my vaccine.

Less than six hours in, headache set in, along with vomiting.  Around 10 hours after injection, fever, chills, cold sweats and severe body aches began and lasted approximately 36 hours. Fatigue set in sometime during day two and continues to linger six days later.

                                                After receiving my vaccine on March 14th, I started experiencing pressure in the left side of my head and severe headache.  As the days progressed, I was continuing to have severe headaches for the next couple of weeks.  I was taking exedrin Migrane medicine to try and calm it down.   When I would try an work out it was worse, it was like the pressure on the left side of my brain was expanding and it would be worse.  My legs and body did feel weak.  It has slowly gone down with less and less of these headaches over the last couple of weeks.  They were definitely different than what a normal migrane feels like and very specific type of feeling.  I don&#39;t know if I have had any clots or not, but I am currently trying to get into a neurologist to get looked at to make sure there is not something else going on.  I am going to try and contact Johnson and Johnson to see if they can help refer to a neurologist because I currently do not have health insurance.

Then visited my physician on Apr 02. The doctor prescribed Meloxicam 15 mg. since I also had seasonal allergies for which the Dr prescribed Fluticasone 50 mcg and Azelastine 137 mcg nasal spray. The Dr also requested for lower back MRI.  I have scheduled the lower back MRI for 04/16. I did let the doctors office know today about the vaccine.

Carried on with my day like nothing happened.  3/29/2021: (1) Uncharacteristic, debilitating headaches began started around mid-afternoon (ish) and continued on/off - occurred approximately 5-7x and largely tapered off by 4/9/2021.  (2) extreme soreness continuously occurring on the upper right side of my back b/w the spine and scapula. I could barely move it most days. Has gotten slightly better beginning 4/12/2021, but remains unresolved as of this report.  4/15/2021: woke up with severe headache again.

                                                Immediate arm pain when the injection was administered, was painful to raise arm after the shot, for hours. Made effort to continue to raise the arm and engage the muscle to alleviate pain, which helped by the end of *that day*, though tenderness persisted at the injection site for the following 4 to 5 days, including feeling pain when sleeping on that arm. Also, on the day of receiving the vaccine and dealing with the initial sore arm, I experienced a surge of energy lasting into the evening, that is common to me right before I fall sick ( for example as a runner, it sometimes manifests as a PR and then soon after that I get sick). The morning after the vaccine, I woke up slightly queasy, ate breakfast,  went for a bike ride and hike, then headache &amp; nausea appeared near lunchtime (1 pm). I pushed through the rest of the afternoon but headache/nausea worsened, and by late afternoon (maybe 5 pm) I also had developed body aches, chills (with sweats), and low-grade fever.
