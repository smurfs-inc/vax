                                                Eight hours after the shot, I quickly became very chilled with total body aches and pains and extremely tired.  My mouth became very dry.  This lasted most of the night.  The next morning approaching 24 hours after the shot, the initial side effects were gone but I then had a headache and a bit of nausea.  Again was extremely tired and pretty much rested all day.  All side effects were gone the next day.  I felt no need to call my healthcare provider and did not take any over the counter pain medication.

                                                I had the most peculiar taste in my mouth. It wasn&#39;t entirely a metal taste, but it was strong enough it overwhelmed the taste of everything else for about 6 hours. I could still taste other things, but the primary taste and the one that remained in my mouth was this odd, almost metal taste.  The next day (after the taste was gone)-  it would have been almost 24 hours from the time of the injection - I was hit with a bad headache and body aches like I haven&#39;t had in many years. The body ache was gone the next morning, and the headache lingered another day past that. Today, Tuesday March 9, is the first day I feel like myself again.

Overall I felt as if I had a terrible case of the flu. It was very intense. I was unable to sleep the first night due to the severity of symptoms. The second night I sweated a tremendous amount and my fever broke. I am still not over all of my symptoms but I am feeling better.

                                                Headache and neck stiffness within 15 minutes of vaccine and lasted for a couple days.  The days after vaccine I had extreme tiredness and felt like I had a bad cold with a lot of coughing and shortness of breath.  I was coughing up a lot of mucus.  The cold like symptoms are still ongoing, 2 weeks after the vaccine, but are less extreme.  8 days after the vaccine I started to have pain at the injection site.  My upper hurt if I touched it.  Twelve days after the vaccine my upper arm hurts if I raise my arm and if I shake my inhalers to use them.  This seems like a muscle pain from the injection site to my shoulder.

I felt like I hit a wall. My body just ached. I took some Ibuprofen and continued my shift. I woke up the next day with a headache so bad that I couldn&#39;t lift my head off of the pillow. I took Tylenol and that continued the entire day. I stayed in bed all day. The next night, I woke up in the middle of the night with chills, but no temperature. The following Monday, I still had the chills along with nausea. By Tuesday, I felt normal again.

The headache and nausea lasted 4 days. Headache is milder but still present, especially with head movements. Ringing in ears, moderate tinnitus from the day I got the shot and it still remains.

                                                Approximately, 11 hours after the shot Severe cold chills, so severe my teeth would not stop chattering. I was shaking so hard my body ached from shaking. Goosebumps, a crazy headache.  I thought i was having an anurysm.  Not a normal headache.  Cold sweats so bad you could just about wring out my sheets and clothes. Nausea, some vomiting.  On a scale of 1-10 of these symptoms is was an 11-12.  These symptoms changed as the days went on.  In the moring of the first night.  I was ok.  Woke up with a bad headache, still nauseas and still cold but not like at night tollerable.  About 5PM day 2 it started all over again, just as severe.  Next moring ok.  This pattern kept reapeating for 4 days.  Food now getting repulsive.  No way I  could eat anything.  On day 5 the symptoms continue now throug the day, however the teeth chattering not happeing and the cold chills a bit less severe.  I would say by day 5 on the scale of 1-10 i am now about a 9. This was so horrible for so long.  Every single night i would wake up soaked in my own sweat.  This is still happening 11 days later.  I am still experiencing headaches.  I never have headaches.  I did not go to a Doctor because i figured what are they going to do, i have to ride this out.  Also a strange thing is took my temparture daily and seveal times.  Zero temprature. by day 5 I could not get out of bed for 3 days.  Day 8 things getting better, still cold chills and headaches but not as bad.  Day 9 way better, now getting hungry. Daytime cold chills now gone mostly less headaches.  Oddly headaches and cold chills start about 4-5pm and continue through the night.  In the morning i wake up with a headache still today.

                                                Sensitivity started within four hours of dose. Autistic sensitivities to maximum. Scrambling of all senses including proprioception to the point of not being able to move from standing  or sitting. By hour seven, all sensory inputs were too overwhelming to do anything but shut down and sleep. 911 was not an option because they don&#39;t let you sleep, and ERs are overwhelming already, before maximizing all inputs. 7.5 mg hydrocodone for overwhelming pain and sensitivity, allowed sleep. On waking, sensitivity was lessened, but the pain started, 18 hours after the vaccination. Emotional lability for three days. Average aching of arm and injection site were not above expected levels. &#34;Brain fog&#34; and lack of ability to articulate (another autism symptom) started within that first seven hours, and diminished over next ten days. Not yet gone as of today  Dry mouth; overproduction of thick &#39;chunky&#39; mucus that wouldn&#39;t cough out, treated with guaifenesin, lasted three days. Shortness of breath and cough associated with that mucus also diminished after three days. Not completely gone ten days later.   Excessive thirst, onset two hours after vaccine, lasted two days.   Hyperalert (can&#39;t sleep without drugs), hyperactive despite weakness, and hypervigilant (extreme startle reflexes) lasted three days as well. Sleep was achieved with hydrocodone and THC.  All over body pain, feelings of immune mobilization (coming down with) for two days were not above expected levels.   No fainting or other collapse at time of injection, or later.  Knowing that severe over-stimulation is exacerbated in a medical setting, it was decided not to seek medical support for three days of systemic symptoms that would have easily merited hospitalization.

I then went to Dr who gave me RX and the next day it was worse again so the current RX is described earlier. It is not getting any worse but I am struggling to not itch. I can not wear clothes for long periods of time and it is quite debilitating  Clothes

                                                Shot immediately started stinging.  My upper arm swelled with a hard ridge about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Extremely painful.  Could barely raise my arm and could not sleep on that side or tolerate even soft touch of my entire upper arm.  No other reaction that seemed like an allergic response.  I did get very sick for 2 days with severe flu symptoms and strange shooting pains in random parts of my body.  Enough pain to wake me from a sound sleep.  Bad chills, but no fever. I did. I give my legs seemed swollen for about 3 days.   I got the J&amp;J vaccine on 3-6-21 and my arm is still swollen with a slightly smaller hard and painful ridge at the injection site and it sometimes throbs and itches severely.  Today is 4-2-21.  Starting to wonder if it will ever go away.  I still cannot sleep on that side.  The pain overall is less, but it still throbs and itches periodically throughout the day.

I checked her blood pressure, which registered as 80/60.  I offered to call 911, due to hypotension, but when I checked it on her other arm, it was 177/87, which she confirmed was closer to her baseline.  Additionally, she complained of nausea and vomited.  I then offered to call 911 again, but she said that she was feeling better.  I continued to monitor her, and offered to call an ambulance again,  She did not complain of any difficulty breathing or chest tightness/pain. I continued to monitor her for twenty minutes, and then she said that she wanted to go home.  I offered to call an ambulance again, but she assured me that she felt better and wanted to go home.

Headache started in the front of my forehead by late evening, and I literally couldn&#39;t even walk up to my bed.  Restless sleeping with all the sweating and chills.  Woke up with headache remaining and feeling very &#34;wiped out&#34; and still light-headed.  No more chills or sweats the next day, but I was weak for about 48 hours.  Honestly - I&#39;m very healthy and getting Covid directly from another person couldn&#39;t have been worse than getting  the vaccine.  :(   And I am even saying that as a 35 year professional Research Scientist.

                                                I felt no immediate side effects of the shot, but 2 hours later, while sitting calmly, my heart rate suddenly elevated and I began to feel light headed. My home blood pressure monitoring kit provided a reading of 149/99 and a resting heart rate of 108. Normally, my blood pressure is very well maintained with my meds and hovers in the 118/75 range. My resting heart rate is usually below 70. I was going to dial 911 but within 5 minutes, my heart rate began to slow down and I felt better. When I rechecked my numbers at 8 pm, BP was down to 118/80 and resting heart rate was 70.

For the next 6 days, I had a headache, flu-like symptoms, light-headedness and nausea.  Four days after receiving the vaccine, I had a nose bleed, which is a very rare occurrence for me.

My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

The redness and heat on cheeks intensified through out the night and into the next day. Called my primary care doctor who recommended Zyrtec which eased symptoms.  After 48 hours symptoms had mostly subsided.

Took Tylenol and started feeling better after about 2-1/2 hours.  The next morning, the 25th, felt like I had a mild case of the flu but, again, Tylenol seemed to help.  No soreness in arm or other symptoms.

Woke on Friday  3/19/21 with fatigue and diarrhea with body aches.  Woke Saturday 3/20/21 with fever 101.7. (During this duration to include today I have  taken Tylenol rotating with Motrin every 2 hours, this never broke my fevers). Fever continues on and off with body aches, nausea, the worst headache I have ever experienced and pain in the base back of my neck L side.  These symptoms have continued since Saturday.  It is now Friday, 3/26/21.  I will say that during waking hours 8am - 10pm on Wednesday 3/24/21 and Thursday 3/25/21 I had no symptoms except absolute fatigue.  The fever returned on those two nights at around midnight with it breaking about 4 am, waking up in a pile of sweat.

On Thursday, 03/25/2021, her arm was still in pain and she spoke with her doctor. The doctor believed a nerve was hit during the administration of the vaccination. She was prescribed Ultram with a plan for follow-up in 1 week.

In the morning it seemed getting better but then my symptoms got worse.  I took two Ibuprofen which helped. I still continued to feel tired. After my vaccine, I also got a weird taste in my mouth. I was very tired over the weekend. My armpit itched and so I scratched it and I felt raised bumps under my armpit, under the pit of my arms on both sides, right greater than left. My left arm was the one vaccinated. I also had bad diarrhea on 03-29-2021. Today I still continue with the rash under my armpits and still feel very tired and fatigued.

                                                By 6pm, I started feeling feverish, with chills, nausea, chest pains and abdominal pain. I also experienced headaches and my fever got up to 102.5. I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

                                                The next morning, 09:00 am, I had mild flu symptoms which was full body aches and feeling feverish and unwell. I didn&#39;t register a fever on the thermometer. I was very tired; no appetite. I stayed resting all day. Slept a lot. It was easy for me to sleep - very unusual. By 9:00 pm that all lifted and I was feeling back to normal. The morning of March 28, I woke up with a very sore throat. And on 3/29, I had really continued sore throat on and off and Tuesday it got much worse. There was a really strange sensation of being extremely thirsty - I had never had experienced that before. Swollen gland on the right side of my throat - between the jaw and ear area. I had a little bit of an earache on the right side. I drove by the drive-in testing area. I am working in person each day so I get the drive by testing - I think Tuesday, the 30th. Called the dr and did the Telehealth visit - Wednesday - the 31st. I had in and out of laryngitis - raspy voice and headache. I looked in my throat with flashlight and could see a definitive red spot in back of throat and some white spots.  They said it could be a blocked salivary gland and told me to eat something very sour to activate it. Over 6 to 8 hours it did clear the issue somewhat - thirst went away. I still had a sore throat. They told me that by the weekend, I could maybe start antibiotic. Saturday night I took first dose of Zpack - two tablets at first dose and then one tablet a day after that. By late evening Sunday (Easter) I felt some relief of symptoms. This week I still have a little bit of raspy voice and post nasal drip and clearing my throat at this point. I am recovering but not fully recovered.

                                                8 hours after getting the vaccine I started feeling very cold. It came on me all of a sudden.  Shaking, shivering, teeth chattering ensued along with generally feeling very unwell.  (Similar to how I felt years ago after having surgery)  This progressed during the night to fever, chills, extreme body aches, stabbing pains in the head, heart racing, dizziness and nausea.  After 12 hours I started to feeling improvement.  At the 16 hour mark I am really tired and nauseous but feel like I&#39;m coming back.  Probably the worst I&#39;ve ever felt.  We considered going to the ER in the night.

Minor arm pain the first day, I expected that. Did my regular errands and was fine, a little tired.  The next day, (Sunday)...I went to church, had a headache, arms aching like mad, arthritic symptoms , legs cramping, joint pain in elbows especially, were off the chain!  I returned home and took immediately to the couch, where I had a low grade fever and stayed all day. I had no appetite, no energy to get up except to go to the bathroom.

                                                started vomiting at 1:30 and I felt really dizzy and confused. My roommate found me on the floor passed out. I am not sure how long I was passed out. I woke up and I was talking gibberish. I was aware that nothing I said was making sense. I went to bed and slept almost 24 hours. I woke up feeling wiped out but I wasn&#39;t confused and I was talking normal again. Right arm hurt and is numb. ( right side of my body typically is kind of numb but the right arm seemed more so numb after the vaccine)

                                                The actual injection itself was so painful that I almost passed out. It hurts so badly while the needle was in my arm and when she took it out it was worse. I was in such pain that I began to sweat profusely and apparently I turned white and began dry heaving. This was all within a minute or so.  I really thought I was going to pass out. A woman with a tag that said pharmacist came rushing over. She got a reclining chair with wheels, they help me into it and then took me to a recovery room. After a few more minutes of sweating and dry heaving I began feeling better.  The pharmacist got me some paper towels so I could dry myself off as I was drenched in sweat. I asked her for a bottle of water. I waited the 15 minutes and came home.  They never checked my vital signs. Once I got home, I laid down and slept for 15 hours. I was fine the next day and my arm was never sore.  Could  the shot have hit a nerve? I?ve never felt such acute pain.

                                                I started running a fever and aching very bad Saturday morning. By Saturday afternoon my fever was up to 103.5.  I did not want to go to the hospital, but I came very close to calling. I decided to try ice packs on my forehead, neck and chest. I have never had a fever this high, or ached this bad. I don&#39;t know how long it took for my fever to come down, but finally came down to 102.5, where it stayed throughout the rest of the day and into Sunday.  I continued to use the ice packs throughout Sunday. I drank a lot of water and took Tylenol for fever and pain. I had a fever for three days. Today, Tuesday, 3/17/2021, I am very light headed.  I was diagnosed with covid-19 on Dec 29th 2020.

                                                My wife got the J&amp;J shot last Wednesday and had the typical sore arm and a little fatigue. On the following Saturday she had a very severe episode of anger at the members of our household and wanted to leave our marriage, sell the house, and said she could not live like this anymore. She slammed doors, yelled and screamed, insulted everyone around her, and would not listen to reason. 3 days later she is calming down somewhat but still has a lot of anger.  I have lived with the woman for over 30 years and have never seen anything like this before. She does have her moments and has had mood swings in the past but  this episode was exceptional. I think she will be OK in a few more days but I wanted to report this to possibly prevent something similar from happening to others.  It is possible this episode was unrelated to the vaccine. It is also possible this is related to her heavy use of Neurontin with Prozac. Let me know if you have questions.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the single dose at 10:40.  In approximately 11 minutes I started to experience shortness of breath.  I thought it was my N95 mask so decided to head to the car after my 15 minute wait period was completed.  After sitting down in the car I started the following symptoms:  shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, swelling of face, dizziness, weakness.  I sit in the car for approximately 15 minutes then headed home.  I had a driver (thank goodness).  I continued to have symptoms and what felt like elevated blood pressure (I did not have access to a pressure cuff).  After resting at my driver&#39;s house for about 5 hours I felt better and headed home.  The next morning the symptoms were less but still present.  In addition I had a slight rash on my stomach that wrapped around my back.  After approximately 48 hours all of the symptoms subsided.  My blood pressure had returned to normal also.  All swelling went down.

I went to the ER on March 19  for nausea and vomitting, was dehydrated and received IV fluids. I also had hives which I was prescribed Steroids for.  The next day, March 20, I went to urgent care for severe hives and was given a steroid shot and epinephrine shot.  I don&#39;t know if these symptoms are a result of the vaccine, but I did not have them prior to the vaccine so I thought they should be reported.  Thanks

Per pt&#39;s visitor her color had returned to normal, pt still feels a little shaky. Pt rested another 5 mins, repeated vitals and pts BP was elevated.

                                                Arm became sore on the left arm - I had a lump and my whole arm was like one giant bruise. That lasted about three weeks. I still have a lump but it isn&#39;t bruised looking anymore. The incident I went to medical care for - I saw the doctor on 4/2/2021 and he diagnosed I have shingles on my right leg. I thought it was spider bites. I did have the shingles vaccine. It is inflamed and I get nerve pain down my leg. It is very, very sore to the touch. Right now it is kind of dry - like blisters on it. It&#39;s a mild case. Doctor put me on Valacyclovir. He put me on it for one week and I have two more days after today.

                                                I started experiencing dizziness when my head turned in a specific position. This began about one week after the vaccination. At the next VSAFE check I reported that I was having some dizziness and tiredness. However, I saw a doctor on April 2 and he diagnosed me with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo and treated me in his office using the Epley Maneuver. The dizziness was cured and I am not experiencing it any longer. I do not believe it was associated with the vaccination but had not seen my doctor when I completed the report on VSAFE.

Then, headache started and was quickly very severe.  Accompanied by fever and chills. Slept for 24 hours, woke up for five minutes and slept for another six hours.  Though I felt better within 36 hours, I would not call the side effects mild.  Still feel lightheaded and having difficulty sleeping.

Had diarrhea for 2 days which resolved but lightheaded and nausea remained for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks had some relief but lightheaded feeling returns on occasion. Can remain functional but don?t feel right some days.

                                                I got the vaccine at around 11am on 6th April.  By 8pm the same day I was experiencing very severe chills - I have never felt so cold before in my life,  and the evening was not cold..  The next day, 7th April,  I woke up with bad aches in various, seemingly random areas of my body:  both upper arms, outside parts of both thighs, center of back between shoulder blades.  Interestingly all the aches were symmetrical.  I had not done any serious exercise to cause these symptoms, just a stroll around the park after getting the vaccine. I also experienced crushing tiredness and had to go back to bed in the afternoon.  Today, 8th April at 5:30 pm my left arm at the vaccine site still aches, but all the other symptoms had vanished by the morning.  I&#39;m 5&#39; 4&#34; and weigh 114lbs.  My husband got the vaccine at the same time and had no symptoms.  We are speculating that my smaller size may have contributed to my adverse reaction.  He is 5&#39; 6&#34; and weighs 180lbs.  In spite of this discomfort I&#39;m so relieved and pleased that we were able to get the vaccine.  Thank you!

                                                Initial reaction was flu-like symptoms but more concerning reaction was a bad rash with red small bumps on the same side as the shot was given directly above my left breast that was severely itchy. This rash is just now starting to dissipate but still itches; I used OTC cortisone creme and Benedryl to address the itching. The other major effect involved my left arm. For a full week, the muscle in which the shot was given was extremely sore to the touch and the whole arm ached. I still cannot fully extend that arm above my head without it feeling like an aching weight. Lastly, I had a pain in the center of my back as a hard ache that one week later still has not fully dissipated. It appears to be going away, but has lingered longer than I would have expected.

I took 2.5mg of Ambian thinking that if I could just fall asleep, I would sleep it off. After an hour of non-stop symptoms, I fell asleep for about an hour only to wake up  with the severe neck and back pain and headache still present. The body shaking had subsided.   The next day, I was tired but fine.

He sent me to the center where they did an Ultrasound which was positive . I was adviced to go to the Hospital for a CT  scan of my lungs and brain.  I went to medical center on Monday at 6pm. There I was given an Iodine CT scan.  They noticed a small spot of pneumonia. They repeated the Ultrasound of my leg and took a swab for Covid-19. I was given a prescription for Xarelto and an antibiotic , Levaquin, 500mg.. I came home.

                                                Fast heartbeat and moderate to severe dizziness began at 3:30 PM on March 6. Fast heartbeat slowed considerably after 10:30 pm. Dizziness is mild to moderate as of 5:00 pm March 7.   I am reporting this simply because it said we should make you aware of adverse events with the vaccine.

About 1:00 am I got so chilled I couldn&#39;t get warm, I did not take my temperature because my thermometer goes under my tongue and I was afraid I would break it cause my teeth were chattering so bad. The next day I felt very weak and nauseous.  Then I discovered I had a rash at the top of my legs. My left breast was very sore I felt like  someone punched me. Today is Monday and I still have diarrhea.

I woke up the next morning with a headache, chills, runny nose, fatigue, and nausea.  I took an allergy medication and stayed in bed.  This lasted all day.  I woke up the next day feeling fine, except for the constant runny  nose.  Also, on that day, I started having &#34;floaters&#34; in my left eye that I never had before (probably unrelated but I want to let you know).

I received the dose (1805029) on 3/12/2021 (Friday) at 4:30 in the afternoon. At around 10:30 p.m. I began to feel unwell with chills, shaking/tremors of my hands/arms, and overall aches. I had trouble sleeping through the night due to these symptoms in addition to night sweats (fever).  These conditions persisted through the next day (Saturday) and evening (24 hours).  I managed to sleep 8 hours and had only a headache the following morning (Sunday).  I treated my symptoms by taking Tylenol which was helpful.  Hope this helps with your research/records.

I was speaking with a friend, who is a nurse, and she told me to take a Benedryl, so I ate a 12.5 milligrams children&#39;s chewable diphenhydramine.  Twenty minutes later I felt normal again.  Later that evening I noticed the palms of my hands were very hot.  I did not have any fever.  That passed the next evening.

She broke out with a rash the thursday after getting the vaccine and after a few days of vaccine she decided to go to urgent care since the \&#34;burning wasn&#39;t stopping\&#34; and it spread to her chest. She was discharged with a script of prednisone and the rash seems to be getting a little better. I will follow up with her in 2 days to make sure it has cleared up.

                                                At the time of injection I felt a pressure pain radiating diagonally downward toward my armpit.  Where she injected me was very high up on my arm almost close to the top.  The pain at injection site was quite sore for the first few days and then went away for the most part for a day or two but has now come back much worse.  It hurts to lift my arm or move it and feels like I&#39;ve lost strength to raise my arm.   I am in constant pain now and my arm around the injection site is painful when I press down especially on the bony area.

                                                March 13, 2021-1:30pm-Shot administered to right arm-it bled and the nurse had to apply pressure with an alcohol swab. It stopped immediately. 1:40-started feeling a tightness in the muscle in my neck under my right ear Stayed a few minutes longer than the required 15 to see if anything else presented. Mentioned it to the nurse and rep. The rep asked if I was nervous about getting the shot. When I said yes, he said it may just be that. Told me to contact my doctor with additional issues.  1:55-When leaving the parking lot, I felt my lips and nostril on the right side go numb-it felt like when Novocain is wearing off after a dentist visit. As the day progressed, the area under my ear and down my neck got more and more sensitive. My lips continued to feel numb. My injection site was tender and black and blue. When I went to bed at 9pm, I began experiencing lots of pain in my right lower jaw. I took a Tylenol but it didn&#39;t alleviate the pain. I called on-call doctor. Since I already had taken a Tylenol, he suggested an anti-inflammatory and warm moist compresses and to contact him again if things worsened. 3/14/21-7:00am-Upon awaking, my jaw pain was virtually gone but the whole area I had had the issue with was very tender to the touch. My lip still felt a bit numb.  3:25pm- It is now 26 hours since my vaccination. I still feel like I had trauma to the right side of my face and neck because it is sensitive to the touch. I also have a continued slight sensitivity of my lips on the right side. My glands on both sides of my neck now seem tender, as well. 3/15/21-3/17/21-I continue to have random pain/tenderness in the aforementioned areas. I also have an aura of tingling in my brain from time to time.

Vomited in middle of the night.  Felt very drained and tired with myalgia all of the next two days.  Majority of symptoms went away after that but I felt as if I was coming down with a cold for the next 7 days - today my nose has been running all day and I have a stuffed head  (and I have not had a cold since November 2019). I  had a covid test yesterday because I need to accompany my husband for a medical procedure on Friday - that was negative. I have seen no one, gone nowhere, and done nothing different since I received my vaccine than I had beforehand yet I am displaying symptoms normally associated with a cold although I have no fever.

Headache became worse, and fever during the night.  By morning dizziness, extreme fatigue, severe headache and stomach upset which continued throughout day and night of second day.  By third day symptoms had subsided some but still incapacitating.  By fourth day better but symptoms still there, kind of how a hangover feels.  Each day since there has been a little more improvement.  Received the shot Tues. morning.  Now it is Sunday morning, and still some fatigue and dizziness, but headache is gone and stomach better.  Only medication I used during severe symptoms was tylenol.

                                                3/14/2021 Goosebumps, shivering, fever (101.8), headache, nausea, achy.  Took Tylenol and it helped for about 3 hours.    03/15/2021 Woke up with symptoms again around 2:30 am and took Tylenol.  Woke up around 8 am with slight headache and VERY tired.  Kept a nagging headache and &#34;brain fog&#34; all of the day  and tired.  Took Tylenol and it helped some.  I felt a bit foggy all day even with Tylenol.  3/16/2021 Still felt tired with a bit of a headache on and off. Took Tylenol and it helped.    I don&#39;t take meds often so I just took 500 mg Tylenol, 1 tablet. I am healthy with no underlying conditions and do not have reactions to the flu shot.  I expected the same  with this shot.

Lot of congestion and a runny nose.  I also got a stomach ache later in the evening.  by the time I went to bed around 10 pm I hurt all over and was very sick to my stomach.  I felt like if someone touched my skin my bones and muscles would all shattered.  I did not sleep much that night and woke up on Saturday, the 27th with the same symptoms but not quite as bad.  I still had nausea and a stomach ache and was very tired and drained.  I did start to get diarrheic around 3:30, 4:00.  I still hurt and have diarrheic and am very tired today, which is Tuesday, the 30th of March at 5:15 pm.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included seasonal allergies, and codeine allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802068, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 05-MAR-2021 to left arm as prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, after vaccination, she felt fine all day and night. The next morning she woke up and felt sick. She had nausea, headache, hive under eye. She laid back down and tried to sleep. A few hours later, she woke up to use the bathroom. She was very nauseous and dizzy. She lost consciousness and fell trying to get to the bathroom. She fell on her bed and was uninjured. The paramedics took her to the hospital. She was given medication for nausea, headache, and IV fluids. She gave blood for lab tests and they came back normal. No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, fatigue, inflammation on left eye, and small hives under eye on MAR-2021, and vomiting on 07-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from canker sore under tongue, and the outcome of fall on bed was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).  Additional information was received from the patient on 23-Mar-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history added as seasonal allergies and codeine allergy, Vaccination site as left arm added; Additional events as small hives under eye, fall on bed; lab test of blood work added; Event outcome of loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: v1: Follow up information received updates  patient&#39;s medical history (seasonal allergies and codeine allergy), Vaccination site as left arm; Additional events (small hives under eye and fall on bed), laboratory test (Blood Work); Event outcome  (loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved). This updated information does not alter prior causality assessment of reported events 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-headache, nausea and fatigue. These events are labeled and are therefore considered potentially related. 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-loss of consciousness, fainted, heart racing, dizzy, vomiting, canker sore under tongue. These events are considered unassessable. The events have a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, are unlabeled, and have unknown scientific plausibility. There are no information on any other factors potentially associated with the events.

The next morning I was very tired. As time progressed, I felt like I HAD to be horizontal. No energy at all. No appetite at all. Took my temperature and was shocked to see it at 101.4ş. Pharmacist suggested I take aspirin, which I took one, and then another one several hours later. It did help and reduced the fever to 99ş.  The following day the temperature remained at 99ş but under 100ş. (I never took any other aspirin other than the two that I mentioned). The third day I was good to go!

I felt a burning all over my body (especially my back), and body aches, and began a fever which grew from 97.3 (my normal) to a high of 100.1  (&#43;2.8 degrees) within 2.5 more hours (by 9:30pm).   Very bad chills and fever.  By 9:30 took 1 500mg Tylenol.   Little sleep that night.  Felt very unwell next day (3/9) including headache.  At noon I could get up and get some food.  By 1pm fever subsided completely, but temporarily.  Fever came back by 4pm, but only to 98.6 (&#43;1.3 above normal).  Took another 500mg Tylenol.  Night 2 slept well. Woke up 3/10 no fever, headache gone, but balance still peculiar.  I noticed the first night that my sense of balance was off.

By the following morning, Friday, 3-12-21, symptoms were still present but less pronounced, and the headache had abated. Slept most of the day and by nightfall had only lasting fatigue, which was still present this morning, 3/13/21. By this afternoon all symptoms had abated.

I took Ibuprofen   to help sleep.  I slept most of Friday I has extreme fatigue. On Saturday I has muscle weakness and tingly in my hands, the muscle aches have gone away. I couldn&#39;t knit ot fine motor skills, It bothered me. I woke up on Sunday where I had extremes muscle weakness in both my legs. I called my PCP, they were surprised by how the reaction was delayed.  They wanted me to get a test for the strength in my legs and sent me to the ER. I wen to the Er they tested for stroke, blood work, scans, they were worried about Guillain Barre Syndrome.  I stayed there about 5 hours. Yesterday afternoon the tingly went away from my hands but my legs are still kinda goofy. The muscle in my forearm  and thigh feel like my muscle are really sore, like they have been tense

                                                Immediately after the shot, I felt dizzy and started to sweat throughout my body including my hands.  I waited more than 40 minutes to see if improved but it was exactly the same. Didn&#39;t get better or worse. I did not report it immediately because it was not alarming and I did not feel bad. It was just my head that was spinning a little bit and sweating. After waiting more than 45 minutes I decided to drive home because the dizziness was not that strong. I would say it was like a 45% dizzyness if I have to calculate how I felt. The sweating passed after 4 hours and at soon as I arrived home I went to bed and relax. It is now 6:08 pm and the dizziness has improved considerably. I would calculate now about 10% of that vertigo feeling. It is getting better and better. I just wanted to point out that in no time I was feeling bad. Everything was just in my hearing labyrinth internal with balance. I also felt 20 minutes of echoing in my ears about 2 hours ago.

Right away after receiving the vaccine-- stiff neck on the left side which after a night&#39;s sleep, moved to my right side of neck. No big deal.     Tired &amp; &#39;drunk&#39; after the vaccine which lasted until mid-afternoon the next day.  No big deal.       The worst of all happened at 3 1/2 days, a rash started in the evening, went to bed, woke up the next day with rash almost everywhere. Red, swollen, &amp; itching like crazy.   The next day- Sunday, along with Monday &amp; Tues. was horrid. I am covered from my scalp to the tops of my feet, my crotch hurts, as do my breasts. Used Benadryl cream, aloe vera to no avail.

                                                Severe shaking chills, headache, fever, muscle aches that lasted several hours. Taking Advil helped reduce symptoms. These symptoms are typical of those who have taken the J&amp;J vaccine and in fact, if you read the actual stories of the side effects of people who took this vaccine, shared on sites, these symptoms are closer to 100% present rather than the far lower and untrue percentage revealed by the CDC. These symptoms need to be better tracked and people should be forewarned how COMMON these side effects are; they are not rare!

                                                On 3/7/2021 after I returned home, I ate broiled, skinless chicken, salad and  small amount of corn at 5:00pm.  I started having diarrhea about 5:30pm.  Later in the evening  around 8:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Around the same time I became very, very sleepy and had extreme fatigue.  My right arm where I received the shot did not hurt and still does not hurt.  Around 6:00pm, my left arm starting hurting in the same spot where I received the vaccine in the right arm.   On the morning of 3/8/2021, I ate breakfast consisting of whole wheat bread and peanut butter and weak coffee (my usual breakfast) and had diarrhea again soon after eating.  At 3:30pm, I ate broiled, skinless chicken, green beans and small amount of instant mashed potatoes.  Around 5:00pm, I had diarrhea again.  I have been drinking a great deal of water on both 3/7/2021 and 3/8/2021 as I normally do every day.  At 6:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Soon after, I took two imodium gelcaps and hoping they will help the diarrhea.  My left arm has become increasingly more sore and hurts in the muscle.  No other symptoms.

The first 1/2 of the vaccine was given easily IM to the left deltoid and then the patient complained of severe arm pain, tensed her muscles, and the last 0.25ml was difficult to inject. Then the patient became hypotensive 90/45, dizzy, and felt like she was going to pass out. She was laid in the supine position, given a cool cloth for her forehead and monitored for approx. 45 minutes. Her blood pressure remained 90/60, 96/56 at discharge. Her heart rate ranged from 55-65, regular. Her son came to take her home as we did not feel comfortable with the patient driving. The patient was continuously monitored by the NPs and APCT. She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged home. She was given information for V-safe to report her reaction and advised to follow up in the ER for any SOB, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, syncope, CP, etc.

I started getting chilled but was very hot and feverish.  I went to bed around 10:00pm and had extreme body aches, shaking with chills and had a fever.  I took tylenol around 4am, when my temperature was 100.7.  The fever and aches subsided by the time I got up around 7am, but I was tired all day.  Took another tylenol around 1pm and started feeling normal, fine.  No other issues.

                                                About 4hours after being vaccinated, I started to feel weak. I wen to sleep. Woke up an hour later (9PM) with fever (100.5), HUGE migraine and being nauseous. I threw up, tried to go back to sleep but couldn&#39;t because of the migraine and fever. Decided to take 2 Tylenol, but I vomited about 20 mins later.  All night, I hardly could sleep at all, so sick I was feeling (and I&#39;m never sick!). No reaction at all on the site of the vaccine, no redness, no swelling at all. All day today (day after the vaccine), I have felt really weak, slightly feverish (though less than last night), with a persistent headache.

This has caused difficulty in taking a deep breath.  No congestion, coughing, or vomiting. Just pain with inhalation.  Pain can be palpated in ribs, level 6 and 7.  Somewhat better today, March 17.

                                                VIRAL PINK EYE Monday 3/15 AM I received the  vaccine. That night I had some mild achiness and headache which continued the next day. Nothing exceptional. The next morning, Wednesday, when I woke up I was surprised that my right eye was a bit crusty. It was rather red but not painful. I thought it would go away ignored it but that night I realized it was still red.  I did some research about pink eye and realized I fit the description for viral pink eye.  But when I saw that 90% of all viral pink eye is caused by the Adenovirus - the same that is used in the vaccine I realized I should report the coincidence. I made an appointment with my doctor to confirm before submitting this report.

This lasted for 8 days and I&#39;m still dealing with the fatigue and lack of energy.  I took alternating doses of tylenol and motrin and drank lots of fluids.  I had to miss 6 days of work because I was too sick to teach.

I went to bed but could not get warm and writhed in considerable distress for at least an hour. (This was the most uncomfortable I&#39;ve been since induced labor before the anesthesiologist arrived for an Epidural 28&#43; years ago.) My temperature fell to 95 before I took acetaminophen and was able to fall asleep.. Now, at 7 hours it&#39;s 101.2 and I&#39;m just getting the side effects I expected: weakness, a little nausea.

Around 3  am, I was nauseous and vomited, although there wasn&#39;t much actual vomit. I vomited again around 9 am the next morning, with even less vomit, since I hadn&#39;t eaten any breakfast. I rested most of Friday and ate sparingly. Today (Saturday) I feel better.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approximately six hours after administration of the vaccine, patient experienced sever chills and dizziness. Unable to stop shaking, patient took temperature which registered at 95.4F and then 95.1F at 15 minutes. Patient donned flannel pants, thermal shirt, and oversized hooded sweatshirt and got in bed under flannel sheets, two doubled-over blankets, a bedspread, and quilt. A down-filled king-size pillow was placed on top of patient&#39;s torso and a space heater was turned on to highest setting. Patient reports heart seemed to be racing, but did not take BP. Unable to quell the chills, the patient continued to shake, developing very stiff shoulders, neck and back as a result. This continued until approximately 2 am. The next morning, patient&#39;s temperature was registering at 99.4F and pulse was 96, but patient did not report chills. General muscle aches and mild headache were noted. At time of this report, patient&#39;s temperature and pulse are normal (97.6F and 76 pulse).

Next day very slight feeling in the injection area, muscle aches, still have heavy chest and breathing issues, but not as bad as yesterday.  I took a Zyrtec tablet around 6:00 p.m. on 3/9/21.  Also used CPAP during the night. Oops, forgot to add CPAP and Zyrtec to medication list, I use CPAP nightly and Zyrtec 1xd at night time.  I also had a resting pulse of 111 with fast heartbeat.  My blood pressure was 136/84, my oxygen was down to 93.

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

The next day, bigger lump, swollen, all just below injection and red, moderate chills, a bit itchy, nausea., and painful. Same on 3rd day but much bigger redness spreading down arm, 2 1/2 by 2 1/2&#39; hard mass and red, itchy, painful, chills and nausea. Next morning called Dr. I am taking amoxicillin-clav 875-125ng tab.  Three days later mass is turning from red to pink and retreating. Still hurts  and now bruses show around the injection site, which I thought was strange. The vaccine actually hurt when given (I get injections every three months, so I know what they will feel like, but this hurt and went very deeply and then burned). I felt warm afterwards for about 10 minutes.

She was reporting soreness with pulsating pain for the first 2 to 3 days, now reports a constant dull and achy pain that is worse with activity and movement.  She has been using Tylenol, which she reports does help reduce pain symptoms.  She denies any reduction in her range of motion, but states pain symptoms are more prominent with movement.  She is also reporting daily headaches that occurred starting the day after getting the vaccine.  Patient reports headache is bilateral in nature with a dull, aching quality.  She states headache starts within 10 to 20 minutes of waking up.  She takes Tylenol to help with headache symptoms, which does seem to relieve the headache.  Some days, she reports headache comes back in the afternoon or evening.  She denies any nasal congestion, vision problems, tinnitus, postnasal drip or sinus pressure. No balance, near syncopal, or syncopal problems. Denies any sensory or motor impairment accompanying the headaches.

I went to the Dr. because it sacred me, she gave me antibiotics , cough medicine with codeine- I couldn&#39;t stop coughing.  I asked her to change my nebulizer treatment because it wasn&#39;t working.  The Dr. suspected that this would happen.

We monitored her for 30 minutes and before she left she was pain free and able to freely move her arm.

                                                Prior to vaccination, the patient stated that she was nervous, but seemed relieved and okay directly following the vaccination.  Following vaccination, patient became restless during the 15 minute post-vaccination window about 2-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.

When I woke up the next morning about 7:30 a.m., my body felt fine, but my brain was a bit foggy.  This continued until about 12:00 p.m.  After that, I was fine.

My heart rate stayed at 109 or more until 10 PM the next night when its slowly went down to a normal heart rate.  At 3 am  (12 hours after the shot) i had  a blinding debilitating headache that lasted until 9pm the next night.   It also affected my vision.   The headache was so bad i could not concentrate on the simplest task.  I  was unsure of what i could take for the headache.   So, I did not take anything.    When i woke up i was very tired and this lasted until the following day.  6am i had a fever of 102.3 this went down to 100.4 at 9:15 pm that night.  I also had chills for several hours. 9:20 AM  the nausea started followed by vomiting and dizziness.   This only lasted for a few hours.    I  experienced very vivid dreams the night of the shot.    I only drank some coconut water all day and could not eat any food.  The next day Saturday March 27 i felt better but the fatigue did not go away until late in the evening.   Sleeping seemed to help but i could only sleep for 2- 3 hours at the most.

Drawing cramping pain followed in forearm, prickling turned to numbness. Mentioned this to one attendant, who recommended sitting longer. Sensations continued, another nurse/attendant checked on me, also mentioned I sit at least 30 min. All other sensations normal-no nausea, no headache, etc.  Small finger, finger next to it,-and their part of the hand to the wrist -were first numb, with occasional tingles, now still numb.[7:30 pm.]  Slight cramp from top of arm to neck, is off -and- on from injection wait-time til now.  I left at 11:55, took temperature at 12:20, =99.4 (my usual basal is 97.6).

                                                Dizziness, light-headed, nausea, sweating, pale skin.  The patient was observed and given water and orange juice for 25-30 minutes. She felt well enough to leave the pharmacy on her own after 25-30 minutes.  The  patient had a prior history of anxiety prior to receiving vaccinations and was very nervous about getting the vaccination prior to administration.  The patients daughter was with her and felt that her symptoms were due to anxiety about  getting vaccinated, but later called the pharmacy asking to report the adverse events as being related to receiving the vaccine.  It is not known weather or not the symptoms are directly related to the vaccine.

                                                On MON evening after the shot, at 11:00pm I experience severe chills that lasted for hours. Tuesday morning I awoke with a bad headache and had body aches all day as well as tendonitis- like pain in both lower arms. I felt somewhat better on WED but I did notice that my compression sleeve on my right arm (lymphedema arm) felt more snug than usual. That night I had severe chills and fever of 101. I slept until 11:45am on THU and felt aches all over. Very fatigued. Went back to sleep from 2:00pm until 6:00pm. Temp was down to 99.8.  When I woke and removed my compression garment, my arm was red and swollen, also rash-like bumps, and was very warm to the touch. FRI morning it looked worse, so I contacted my lymphedema specialist and then my PCP. This is NOT a good situation for anyone who has lymphedema and will necessitate months of treatment.

After she received the shot her leg and shoulder pain/ache increased to an 8/10 (usually a 2-4/10) and was constant when it usually is intermittent.  Her breathing is worse and she is maxing out her inhalers and needing many more doses of her rescue morphine than usual (usually 2.4 ml of 20mg/ml Roxanol used in a week and last week was 7.5ml).  She has not been taking it for the pain for fear of med interactions.  She has increased her Tylenol use from 500mg qd to 3000mg qd.  Her tremors are worse and she is taking her propranolol for tremors 20mg BID instead of her usual 10mg BID.  Her body sweats have gone from 1 time a week to 1-2 times a day.  No fevers noted.

A heating pad helped but continued after removing it.  I also had a slight stomach ache.  The next day, I felt i had less energy  than normal, lethargic.

                                                Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 EUA vaccine  At the time of the injection, the vaccine burned as it entered my arm. (I have never felt that burning sensation with any other vaccination that I have had in the past. Twenty minutes after the vaccination, I became lightheaded and dizzy.  I could walk but I was wobbly. At one hour after the vaccination, I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my tongue and then the left side and only the left side of my tongue began to go numb. Within a couple of minutes, I realized that my left jaw was going numb, too.  The numbness slowly but surely began to move up the left side of my face all the way to the top of my head.  I had a sharp but brief headache on the left side of my head  that subsided quickly but the numbness remained.  I went home and talked to two people on the phone for several hours because they wanted to be sure that I was OK. At two hours after the vaccination, my face was still numb but I could think and talk clearly, but I was clearing my throat and coughing a lot.  At that point, I also realized that my whole left arm was a little numb and my fingers on my left hand were tingling.  That numbness lasted about 20 minutes and then subsided. The facial numbness lasted for hours.  I wasn&#39;t scared and I wasn&#39;t in pain but it was very strange.  It felt a little bit like the after affects of dental anesthesia but it wasn&#39;t just in my mouth it was the whole left side of my face.   I believe that this must have been an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the vaccine but I don&#39;t know which one.  If you can tell me which chemical it might have been, I will avoid it in the future.

                                                The pharmacist jam the needle into my arm to the bone and my arm is  still a little sore. I could feel the fluid running down in my arm.  Around 5 hours or so after the shot, I was in bed for 2 days with chills/aches/fever, head pounding, and heart racing.  Also I did not have an appetite. I am just getting my strength back and willing to trust myself walking.

                                                On day 9 felt both sides of neck tender under ear by jaw line.   Upon palpation  both sides painful however left side more.   Paid no attention to it except on  day 10 because pain still felt  with left side more painful.  No lump or bump felt just very sensitive and painful upon palpation.   Left side more painful when palpated.  It seems to be going away slowly.   Did not put this on my daily  report because I chalked this up to being maybe a cold or something coming on.  After thinking about this symptom I realized it is slowly going away and as an R.N. contributed to it now as a side effect.  Below I put &#34;No&#34; regarding recovery because the pain is still there however not as bad.  It seems to be going away slowly.  Hoping it will be gone in a few more days.

                                                Six hours after the shot I began to shake. I was not cold and my temp was only 99 degrees. The shaking turned into uncontrollable jerking of my shoulders, torso and thighs. The jerking lasted 3 hours. My family became concerned and said I looked like I was convulsing. We were making plans to go to the ER when it started to calm down. I had no control over my body. I finally stood up and my body felt like I was made of led. Headache, slight fever, and weakness persisted until 48 hours post shot.

Pain in legs became intense; I could not sit on the toilet.  Went to emergency room of Hospital at 9pm; no medications given.  Pain calmed by 10pm, but sensation in legs returned at 11pm and continued until  discharge at 1:15am on 3/6.  Took Tylenol PM at home for moderate pain in legs and went to bed.  Awakened next morning to no pain, had breakfast and went back to bed until noon.  Feeling fine since that time.

                                                I received the vaccine at a Department of Health vaccine clinic at the Hospital. About 25 minutes after receiving the Janssen vaccine, my face became flushed (red) and I felt weak. We were in the hospital parking lot and drove to that hospital&#39;s emergency room, where I was evaluated. After several tests (item 18) I was declared okay and left after 3 hours with no further intervention. I probably should have taken a Benadryl (diphenhydramine) after the shot to prevent such a reaction.

I finally fell asleep for an hour or two, then awaken just in time to make it to the bathroom where I sat on the toilet ALL night having severe diarrhea and vomiting into a container on my lap.   I would fall asleep, then wake up, on the toilet, very sick.    The vomiting ended after that first night, but the diarrhea has persisted.  It is getting better, though. (It has been 72 hours since the shot.)  I had a headache, my left arm ached, I was nauseous, and feverish until about 8 a.m., today, when my fever broke.  I still feel like I have a low-grade flu, which I have not had in over 40 years.  And, I still have some diarrhea.  I am sipping Coke and can eat some Cheerios, with milk and banana, but that is all that I want to attempt.

                                                Got extremely cold and shivering starting around 6:30 pm on Friday 3/12/21.  Could not get warm.  Took my temperature and it was 97.1 (my temp is usually in the mid 97&#39;s).  Weak and tired.  Took Tylenol about 7:30 pm - it helped a little but still felt freezing cold.  Went to bed and next morning felt better but wrung out.

This started around 11 a.m.  Around 3 p.m. I felt dizzy and faint and nearly passed out.  I was very weak.  I had to lie down.  I still feel weak and dizzy and it is now 4 pm but I feel a little better.  My stomach is still gurgling

Neck muscles &amp; jaw muscles hurt. Dressed in polar fleece jammies, socks, flannel bed-sheets, two heavy duvets &amp; couldn&#39;t get warm nor stop the shaking. Tried standing to walk it off but legs were like jelly.  Tried bio-feedback to relax &amp; stop the shivering but it just continued in wave after wave. My chest tingled and my heart felt like it was working hard. It subsided around 4:30a.m. The next day felt &#39;punk&#39; muscles still jelly like &amp; jaw really ached from chattering. The 2nd day was fine.

                                                About 10  hours after receiving vaccine, I suddenly began shaking, so hard I could barely walk.  At the same time, my fever shot up to 101.8, and mucus began running from my nose like never before.  Shaking subsided after an hour or so, fever broke during the night, and cold symptoms lasted about 3 days.

                                                I had the Johnson and Johnson one shot vaccination on March 15, 2021 and Initially  had no adverse reactions .. However , 18 days after my vaccination, around April 2, 2021,  began to have deep muscle pain radiating around the injection site, which was in my upper right arm, in the muscle at the top of my arm.. It was SO painful,  the pain was deep in the muscle but not painful to external touch., that I had to take Tylenol for three days. Today is April 7, 2021, and the deep muscle pain is barely noticeable, but once in awhile, I will still get a jab of pain..

Body aches and stiffness, affected my walking.  Did not take temperature at that time.  Got back into bed with 2 blankets and a comforter and still couldn&#39;t sleep.  Got up a 7AM - temp 102.2, shaking less but still  feeling cold, body was hot to touch.  I had a bad headache and body aches and stiffness were still there. I noticed at that time  that I had a bright red flush on both cheeks and my nose that was hot to the touch.  Took 600mg of Ibuprofen.  Went back to bed feeling terrible.  At 12 noon I got back up and temp was down to 99.7.  Headache, body aches, stiffness, and &#34;red flush&#34; still on cheeks and nose.  Went back to bed.  Took more Ibuprofen at 7pm - temp was down to 98.7.  Headache was better, body aches improved.  Flushed hot face was still present.  Went to  sleep at 11:30PM  and slept for 10 hours.  Today, 03/06/21, all symptoms improved, no fever, redness of face is still present but less.

                                                about two hours after injection,  I experienced headache,  then mild dizziness,  then extreme dizziness,  then sudden overwhelming fatigue,  then swollen eyes and eyelids,  then chills and elevated heart rate,  with pounding.    I had to cancel the class I was supposed to teach,  because I would not have been safe to drive to campus.  I slept from approximately 2:30 pm on March 8 until 8:30 am today,  March 9,   all symptoms continuing,  with bathroom breaks, a couple of short reports to family members who were watching out for me,  and one  2-hour window during which I ate a small meal,  went back to bed,  and read part of a book.    During bathroom breaks I took more antronex,  some milk thistle,  and some glutathione,  which seemed to at least temporarily reduce dizziness and eye/eyelid swelling.  At one point I took some hawthorne tincture because I was concerned about the heart pounding.    Today I woke up feeling symptom-free,  but by 2 pm I was compelled by sudden fatigue to take a two-hour nap.   After that I felt better,  and I think I am now fine,  at 7:45 pm on 3/9/21.    I am happy to have gotten the Janssen vaccine,  because it is one and done!

Medicated with Tylenol, bananas, oatmeal and herbal tea.  Documented on pdf form, but unable to use &#34;continuation page&#34;, so added sheet that unable to attach.  Will try again to upload and send separately to this.  NO forms given to me at pharmacy for reporting anything.  I called several times and left messages, but no return call.  Sent email, but response saying unable to help at this time.  Very frustrating as I continued having severe symptoms and unable to get help.  Finally feeling better enough today to send form.

                                                On Wednesday, March 10, 2021,I started having muscle pain throughout my left and right legs.  Things and calves were like walking on raw nerve ends.  I had all types of tests, x-rays, MRI?s and dr. visits to try to find the cause.  This pain continued through March 31, until  I was finally given a prescription for a steroid by my internist who believed this pain was being caused by the Johnson &amp; Johnson covid 19 vaccination because of the time frame between the vaccine I was given and when the symptoms began.  The pain while on steroids has disappeared.  I am, as of this date, on the third day of a seven day course of the steroid medication.  The pain subsided on day two of the medication.

                                                I received vaccine at 2:00 PM on 3/10//2021.  I was tired afterwards.  By 11:00 that same night I felt nauseous, has a headache and every joint and muscle  in my body was painful.  I could not sleep or get into a position where I was comfortable.   The pain level was a 10.   I took Tylenol in the middle of the night but it did not help.  In the morning I was unable to contact my physician&#39;s nurse so I called the 24 hour Nurse Line.  The nurse took all my information and told me that I could take Ibuprofen.  I took 400 mg. and found a lot of relief from that.  I still had some symptoms for the next few days.  By 3/14/21 I felt fine.  Now today I have a stuffy nose which could be an allergy to something else.  I don&#39;t know yet.

                                                When I woke the next morning I had a moderate headache, sore muscles all over which intensified throughout the day, intense pain in the spine between shoulder blades and when I tried to walk, my limbs would not do as I wanted.  They moved in wide circles- arms and legs.  This lasted through the day and next day it was sliightly better.  Balance was poor.  Had to hold onto things to walk.  Also I had fatigue.
