After that vomiting, soreness, headache body aches, fever of 100 degrees.  When awaking the next morning, still had fever of 99.8, chills, nausea, headache.  Finally felt like myself by 3pm on Tuesday, March 16.   I am not a chronic complainer.  After receiving my flu shots every year for many years, this was the first reaction I&#39;ve ever had to any immunization - ever.

                                                Approximately, 11 hours after the shot Severe cold chills, so severe my teeth would not stop chattering. I was shaking so hard my body ached from shaking. Goosebumps, a crazy headache.  I thought i was having an anurysm.  Not a normal headache.  Cold sweats so bad you could just about wring out my sheets and clothes. Nausea, some vomiting.  On a scale of 1-10 of these symptoms is was an 11-12.  These symptoms changed as the days went on.  In the moring of the first night.  I was ok.  Woke up with a bad headache, still nauseas and still cold but not like at night tollerable.  About 5PM day 2 it started all over again, just as severe.  Next moring ok.  This pattern kept reapeating for 4 days.  Food now getting repulsive.  No way I  could eat anything.  On day 5 the symptoms continue now throug the day, however the teeth chattering not happeing and the cold chills a bit less severe.  I would say by day 5 on the scale of 1-10 i am now about a 9. This was so horrible for so long.  Every single night i would wake up soaked in my own sweat.  This is still happening 11 days later.  I am still experiencing headaches.  I never have headaches.  I did not go to a Doctor because i figured what are they going to do, i have to ride this out.  Also a strange thing is took my temparture daily and seveal times.  Zero temprature. by day 5 I could not get out of bed for 3 days.  Day 8 things getting better, still cold chills and headaches but not as bad.  Day 9 way better, now getting hungry. Daytime cold chills now gone mostly less headaches.  Oddly headaches and cold chills start about 4-5pm and continue through the night.  In the morning i wake up with a headache still today.

                                                Sensitivity started within four hours of dose. Autistic sensitivities to maximum. Scrambling of all senses including proprioception to the point of not being able to move from standing  or sitting. By hour seven, all sensory inputs were too overwhelming to do anything but shut down and sleep. 911 was not an option because they don&#39;t let you sleep, and ERs are overwhelming already, before maximizing all inputs. 7.5 mg hydrocodone for overwhelming pain and sensitivity, allowed sleep. On waking, sensitivity was lessened, but the pain started, 18 hours after the vaccination. Emotional lability for three days. Average aching of arm and injection site were not above expected levels. &#34;Brain fog&#34; and lack of ability to articulate (another autism symptom) started within that first seven hours, and diminished over next ten days. Not yet gone as of today  Dry mouth; overproduction of thick &#39;chunky&#39; mucus that wouldn&#39;t cough out, treated with guaifenesin, lasted three days. Shortness of breath and cough associated with that mucus also diminished after three days. Not completely gone ten days later.   Excessive thirst, onset two hours after vaccine, lasted two days.   Hyperalert (can&#39;t sleep without drugs), hyperactive despite weakness, and hypervigilant (extreme startle reflexes) lasted three days as well. Sleep was achieved with hydrocodone and THC.  All over body pain, feelings of immune mobilization (coming down with) for two days were not above expected levels.   No fainting or other collapse at time of injection, or later.  Knowing that severe over-stimulation is exacerbated in a medical setting, it was decided not to seek medical support for three days of systemic symptoms that would have easily merited hospitalization.

I then went to Dr who gave me RX and the next day it was worse again so the current RX is described earlier. It is not getting any worse but I am struggling to not itch.

Headache started in the front of my forehead by late evening, and I literally couldn&#39;t even walk up to my bed.  Restless sleeping with all the sweating and chills.  Woke up with headache remaining and feeling very &#34;wiped out&#34; and still light-headed.  No more chills or sweats the next day, but I was weak for about 48 hours.  Honestly - I&#39;m very healthy and getting Covid directly from another person couldn&#39;t have been worse than getting  the vaccine.  :(   And I am even saying that as a 35 year professional Research Scientist.

                                                A few hours after the Thursday afternoon injection, my temp shot up and stayed right around 102, my heart rate was 135- just sitting, and my oxygen level was 93%. I shook uncontrollably the first 10-12 hours, and had chills. Tinnitus. Nothing inproved until the middle of Friday night- I sweated through sheets. Still had fever, high heart rate, and up and down oxygen for 18-20 days. My heart rate (I&#39;m on 2 anti-arrhythmia drugs so my rate is rarely above 65) was still high but better by day 22. Fever is also better but not gone. Exhausted.

                                                Felt hot within a few minutes after the vaccine, then passed out. The NP on site said she was unable to find a pulse so did 10 chest compressions before I woke up. Called the rescue squad who did an EKG on route to Hospital and once I was in the ER another EKG was performed along with blood work and chest X-ray. Entry was noted as allergic reaction but diagnosis was noted as Vasovagal Syncope, Adult. EKG?s performed along with labs were normal. I have pulled muscles, tendons and ligaments from the chest compressions which were questionable but since that day have experienced tingling in upper body and arms and have felt bad. Went back to my Primary Care Doctor for follow up on March 29 for another EKG. Have had panic attacks from the situation and per Doctor will take 2 months for my chest, muscles, tendons and ligaments to heal. Hard to determine if the way I have felt is from the vaccine or what transacted when I fainted. Today which is April 9, I still feel weak, normally I am very energetic. Just wanted to report as when I saw the news that others had some situations thought best to let you know.

I came straight home and slept until dinner, ate and then went back to bed and slept until midnight, took more Advil and drank a full glass of water, and slept the rest of the night.  Wednesday I felt a bit better, headache not as bad and jaw pain not as frequent, still pretty tired.  I went to bed straight after dinner and then felt great on Thursday.

                                                Was doing CDC TEXT tracing first week after injection, but new reactions started after tracking completed. Had mild reactions originally. Pain in arm, and fever next day that rose to 100.9. No chills, no major problems, no rash. A couple nose bleeds on second day which were not typical for me. Returned to work on third day. Now on day 10 I&#39;m convinced I&#39;m having a delayed reaction. Still mild but present. Low temp 99.5, headache, fatigue, feeling of not being normal. Not allowed to work today. Reason for report of such mild symptoms is my surprise of this delayed reaction 10 days later. There is a bruise on my injection arm now, opposite side of arm, that also is puzzling, but not really worrisome. Know to monitor for platelet issues.

Took 2 Tylenol every 4-6 hours to help the headache. It lasted until Sunday morning. My nose felt stuffy when I woke up Sunday morning at which time there was blood in my nose. The rest of the day it was clear but a small amount appeared Monday morning as well. Both sides of my temples are sore to the touch as if they were bruised. Other than that and being weak the other symptoms are gone.

I had periods of nausea and dizzy spells for the following week. I had an extreme migrane the night of the shot and chills throughout the next week. I did not report the symptoms to  anyone because I had not heard that these were reactions to this vaccine. After I heard that others were experiencing similar symptoms, I felt I should report my experience.

                                                The patient had burning sensations and increased urination symptoms consistent with a possible urinary tract infection prior to the vaccination that took place on 2 April 2021. A urinary culture was negative on 31 March 2021.  A few days after the vaccination, the burning pain and urgency subsided but was replaced by increasing lower abdominal pressure and pain.  The patient will see a doctor on 14 April 2021.  Other effects observed following the vaccination on 2 April 2021 include: headaches, muscle pain, injection site arm pain, sore throat. These effects resolved within 24 hours after the vaccination with exception of the sore throat which is ongoing.

                                                Developed heart palpitations approximately 10 hours after receiving vaccine. Also insomnia  making it impossible to sleep.  Palpitations seemed to get better by 11 am the next morning but my heart rate was still elevated ( pulse 106-112).  Shortly after that ( around 11:45 am) I became extremely light headed and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I also started to feel nauseous and sweaty.   I rested lying down for two hours before hearing back from my doctor&#39;s office.  I was able to control the lightheadedness and dizziness by lying down. The feeling of passing out / nearly fainting went away.  I continued to feel nauseous and my  heartrate was still elected. I started to get a headache as well.  On the advise of a nurse at my doctor&#39;s office,  my husband took me to the ER.  My EKG was normal . My heartrate was elevated.  Due to the overcrowding at the ER that day I was made to wait at least an hour and half for further evaluation.  I continued to feel light headed and slightly dizzy. My nausea and headache got much worse .  I was finally taken back to a treatment room and received IV fluids, Zofran and Tylenol.  My heartrate went back to normal and my headache and nausea improved with treatment and I was discharged around 7pm.  I continued to feel very tired and slightly lightheaded that evening. The next morning  I was much more nauseous again and still very weak feeling and slightly lightheaded. I have  continued to feel weak, very fatigued , unwell and nauseous on and off until today, April 14, which is 6 days after I was vaccinated.

                                                Started on Monday morning at 8:30 am started feeling cold chills.  Took 800mg of Ibuprofen and after an hour felt better.  When going to bed around 9:00pm I noticed that my skin was soaking wet and that I had a hot feeling.  When I woke up in the morning  (tuesday April 13, 2021) around 7am I could not fully open my eyes.  I looked in the mirror and noticed that my entire face was swollen and was red in different areas.   I took some benadryl as I thought this was an allergic reaction and went back to bed.  A litter later I started getting cold chills and then hot flashes.   Around noon time I took another benadryl.  By 2:30 I was not feeling any better and I also had body aches and pains and called my doctor.  I was able to get in to the office.  I was told that I was having a reaction to the shot and that I was boarder line for the hospital.  They gave me a shot steriod shot and prescribed Metheylprednisolon tablets (24) to be taken as directed and to continue to take benadryl.   It&#39;s now Wednesday morning April 14, 2020 and the swelling has gone down but not fully gone and I have stated on the prescription.  I now have redness in my chest area.  I still have a some chills and hot flashes.

                                                Day one post vaccination - dull headache, leg pain, abdominal pain, back pain - these symptoms continued for a few days, I started to feel a bit better, did not take any pain reliever medications because I didn&#39;t want to mask symptoms.   On 4/14/21, 7 days post vaccination, my leg pain in both legs worsened including numbness and a burning sensation in both feet.  Back pain continued, arm pain started in both arms with numbness in both hands however the pain on my left side with legs and arms is worse. I&#39;ve had intermittent shooting pains in my left ear, left jaw, left temple and across the left side of my face. I&#39;ve also experienced shoulder and neck pain. The abdominal pain is intermittent and mild. On 4/15 - 4/18 the pain in my legs was so bad that it was waking me up at night and my arm pain was occurring more frequently. I decided to go to the ER on 4/18, day 11 post vaccination, due to my concern of a possible DVT or other type of blood clot.  The ER physician&#39;s assistant did not look at my legs but did several blood tests and other tests.

Twenty minutes after shot, felt skin flush pass over me and was directed to private area where paramedic took blood pressure and checked for hives. No hives but bumpy skin. Blood pressure spiked to 186/75. No history of such high blood pressure. Waited a while and blood pressure went down, flush and skin bumps subsided, and I went home. Blood pressure erratic in evening but never as high. Next day pulse higher than normal. Took homeopathic remedy. Pulse slowed down a bit. Better by next day.

Hurt the balls of my feet when I walked.  My eyes felt like they had sand paper in them.  I did not run a fever but my  body felt like I had. I had Flu B January of 2018,  my syptoms after Janssen Shot were as severe as Flu B, but the duration was not as long! Approximately 24 hrs after injection I starting experiencing a headache, along with neck and shoulder aches.  And I experienced fatigue for 3 days after injection along with the headache and neck, shoulder and back ache. On the fourth day  following the injection I only feel tired.  Aches, pains and headache are gone.

My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

                                                By 6pm, I started feeling feverish, with chills, nausea, chest pains and abdominal pain. I also experienced headaches and my fever got up to 102.5. I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

I also have muscle twitching on my left hand, which started after the shot. I&#39;ve had it now for 28 hours. I got the shot on my left arm.

                                                At 4 AM the following day I woke up with a severe headache and fever. I attempted to take 2 extra strength Tylenol which seemed to trigger cyclic  vomiting every 15-20 minutes for approximately 4 hours. After this, I vomited  once an hour for another 4 hours. I was finally able to sip water and sleep after this. I also took my first temperature once feeling better and it was 99.9F. My normal temp is in the 97s and I?m sure it was much higher during the vomiting.  My fever broke approximately 12 hours after the first symptoms. Headache lasted approximately 36 hours and resolved the next day, although a milder one did come back off and on for a couple more days.  I did not have much pain in the arm I received the injection in.

                                                Beginning approximately 10 PM (about 8 hours post-injection), I started to have chills (feet were freezing) and was exhausted. Went to bed, and slept most of the night, only waking once to urinate and to drink a small amount (approx 2 oz) of Coca Cola -- I was very nauseous and thought it would help settle my stomach. During the night I sweated profusely. At 8 AM,  I woke again and went to urinate. At that time I felt very nauseous, dizzy, and light headed. When I walked about 2 -3 feet to my bedroom, I collapsed on the floor - unconscious. My partner called EMS, they arrived minutes later. By then I was conscious. They transported me to Medical Center Emergency Room, where I remained for several hours. They indicated that my SYNCOPE was a result of dehydration. TODAY, 4/13, news of BLOOD CLOTS has compelled me to report my adverse reaction.

On April 8th woke up very dizzy, had to lay back down for a little bit.  On April 10th woke up not being able to take a deep breath without a very bad pain in my back (it felt like my right lung)  same issue the 11th, and 12th.  This pain was not severe unless I took a deep breath.  I was able to go about my daily activities.  Today April 13th still a little tight in my lung but do not have the pain in my back that I had the last few days.

The pressure eased off quickly but the tingling lasted until the next day then my face felt like I had been punched. I still have a little face swelling and itching with raised red spots on my face that move around to this day.

                                                It has been a month since getting the vaccine and my arm is still painful to the point of limited movement. The first few days after the shot, I was not concerned about the soreness, I knew it was a normal side affect. But at this point I am more concerned and do feel it is an  issue to be reported. This may keep me from getting the vaccine in the future.

Stayed off my feet. Right foot became very cold. 3/30/21 Saw my primary care physician at med center. She sent me for an ultrasound at medical arts. From there I was sent to the emergency room at hospital. I asked the attending physician assistant about a correlation between the blood clot and the Covid vaccine because I had read about it being a concern in other countries. He stated that was a bunch of baloney. Was told to have a repeat ultrasound in a few days and was prescribed a 30 day starter pack of Xarelto and released.  3/30 repeat penis ultrasound of right leg showed the same results. 4/1 appointment with hematologist. Prescribe Xarelto for three months and ordered a repeat ultrasound in three months and bloodwork at that time.

                                                Right after shot, did not feel anything that morning till around 5pm I started to feel feverish, headache, tired.  My arm never got sore or swollen.  AFter 5pm till, the feverish feeling and hot cold got worse as time went by and I started shaking uncontrollably - pretty severe.  I took Tylenol early hoping to stop the achy feverish and shaking but did not seem to help.  THis went to till about 1am or 2am when I could finally lay down and try to sleep.  The shaking had stopped.  I did take more Tylenol and drank some herbal chamole type of hot tea.  I could not sleep that night.  Next day I was exhausted, body aches and still had some feverish feeling.  By the way, took my temperature and it was normal.  Then on Wednesday, I believe is when I had a huge episode of diarrhea (came on sudden).  I kept calling and talking virtually to the doctor telling him all of what was going on.  The next day I the feverish feeling and body aches and being tired kept happening  - adding headache getting worse.  I kept taking Tylenol.  Seem to help some but did not take the pain away. EAch night , I could not sleep due to the headache.  I started to feel better but then on the weekend, I had that headache and tired feeling.  The headache was getting stronger and it circled my whole head and both shoulder and around my neck.  It scared me because I felt at times that my throat was getting smaller.  I could still swallow but it was so strange.  I kept putting heat packs and ice packs and taking Tyelnol.  I know that on Thursday or Friday the week, the doctor told me if I wanted to to go get tested for Covid and I did.  I was tested negative on both the quick test and the other test that takes longer.     I had that headache, sinus tension pressure for quite a few more days.  Overall it took 7 days. I had to take off  most of the week from my telework job because I could not function.  I also did not eat much and drank lots of water during this time.  It seem to go away and then about a week later, I got this painful diarrhea out of the blue and went to see an urgent care doctor.  They tested me for blood, urine, and stool and they were negative.  I was also having pain on my left side.  Then it seem to go away after I was on the BRAT diet for a few more days.  Then the diarrhea happened again the next week or so.  This week, as of yesterday, I got a very strange throbbing pain in my left hand and not sure where that came from.  It can be extreme at times.  I tool Tyleonol but the pain is still there.  Also, during this time and before the shot, I got a trigger finger issue on my right index finger.  I don&#39;t think that has anything to do with the vaccine.  Please note I have been told my doctors and I know this for a fact, my body is super sensitive to food, meds.  I don&#39;t usually get the flu shot because of that.  Today I am experiencing the left hand pain and now metal tasting in my mouth.  I am about 5 weeks out from the vaccine.  I wish I had never taken it.  I pray nothing more will happen  in my body  If I have left anything off it is because I did not write this down when was happening.  I really thought I was going to die one night because of the pressure I was having in my head, neck and shoulders.   I have a little bit of a headache now and told my PT doctor that if I needed to know, I could get a brain or some kind of scan to see if I am hainvg any issues. I am going to bring this up to my virtual call today.

                                                Whether the adverse events were caused by the vaccine is to be determined.  We are available to discuss more details if this information can be used to help others from experiencing these reactions.  The morning after getting the vaccine, patient discovered that she could not swallow.  As her condition worsened, she was taken to the emergency room.  Over the past month, patient went to the emergency room 4 times.  The last time resulted in extended hospitalization that continues to this day.  In addition to the swallowing problem, two other major adverse events need to highlighted.  First, on 27 March, while in the hospital, vaginal bleeding started.  On 29 March, her doctor, performed a hysteriscopy/DNC finding &#34;  &#34;an unexplained blood clot (hematoma).&#34;  The second major event was when patient demonstrated significant confusion and lack of memory.  On 7 April, she was diagnosed with Metabolic Encephalopathy.  Neurologists at the hospital suspected that her MS was reacting to her UTI and once the infection is eliminated her memory should come back.  But as of 10 April, she was still having issues including hallucinations.  Although she is eating some as of 13 April, she is still very weak and will likely by moved from the Hospital to a rehab facility.  She still does not remember much of the last 37 days.

Continued pain after two days into two weeks, shooting pains , crawling at injection site,and throbbing, even at elbow and wrist.  Arm was also very weak, and still gets tired and throbs .  Has been 4 weeks this week-end . Reported to nurse who tod me to see my Dr. which I did this week.  No redness at injection site, just soreness, know something was off, according to side effects.   Very tired feeling, still, and had some flushed color the first week in my face and like heat flashes for two weeks.    Hope to get the normal feeling back in my arm.  Not sure ?   Maybe a nerve was nicked?  But was not like a Bee Sting like tech described it would feel like that day.  Had a ruff start.

Patient reports that she felt lightheaded after the vaccine when she was leaving. She got home and felt better but then that night woke up in a delirium which passed by the morning. She had some weakness in her extremities, brain fog, cold feeling, funny GI feeling and fatigue for 3 days and then was fine.   Two weeks ago she started to feel that the circulation in her lower legs was cut off with sensation of blood pooling in her legs with associated numbness and tingling. She describes it as what you feel when a tourniquet is applied to your arm.  No visible lower extremity swelling, redness and no pain.    One week ago she felt like her right hand was not working well and then left hand too. She then felt pooling in her arms like the sensation in her legs.No swelling, redness or pain.   She reports she did a hand stand and afterward felt pooling sensation in her lower abdomen which has since resolved but continues to have a prickling sensation that comes and goes.   Last night while lying on her back she felt the pooling sensation in her chest and this morning throbbing in head and chest and neck. That is when she decided to come in and be seen.    Patient denies severe headache, backache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, bruises, unusual bleeding or rashes.   Patient has not had a physical exam with blood work since 11/9/17.

                                                My sister, received the J &amp; J vaccine on March 5th.  I now know that she was not feeling well for a few days afterwards.  She then felt better until day nine after the vaccine.  On the evening of the ninth day,  she began having abdominal pain, vomiting &amp; diarrhea, headache. This was Sunday evening.  Unfortunately I wasn?t aware of how she was feeling and she didn?t go to the emergency rm. until Tuesday morning.  Tests determined her platelet level was low and abdominal CT showed bleeding from her adrenal glands.  She was given platelets, pain meds and admitted into the hospital.  Later that night staff felt she wasn?t responsive and a head CT was performed.  It was determined she had a brain hemorrhage and emergency surgery was performed. It is my understanding that there was brain damage at that point.  During the early morning hours of the 10th day, post surgery, a repeat CT scan was done showing more hemorrhaging and blood clots. She also developed a  DVT and PE and was kept on a respirator until the 13th day post vaccine to allow family to say their goodbyes.  On the morning of the 13th day patient was removed from life support and she passed.

Began at around 10am. Felt like I was dying. Placed on Stroke Unit. Scans and tests all negative for stroke and Drs. thought could be panic attack or TIA. Since then my lingering effects point to TIA, Seemed to clear up around 2pm with gradual improvement through the day. Still experiencing some side effects including tinnitus, memory and word retrieval issues, fatigue, anxiety.  DO NOT HAVE PANIC ATTACKS. The only time I have had a panic attack was at 26 after the death of my mother.

I could not bend over, lie down or sit for very long without severe discomfort. I ended up seeing a chiropractor within the week who has been treating the problem over this past month.  X rays were taken. I have been treating it with ice, ibuprofen, and aspirin.

Left ring finger went numb, white and cold, with bruise appearing on the middle digit. Other finger tips turned pink. Skin turned red onhands with tingling sentation. Right hand blood vessels came to the surface and began to swell at intersections. Skin on rt. hand looked whiter and dry. The sudden onset sent me to the emergency room, the condition began to fade in 3 hours, not completely. The same reaction occured the next day at 12 noon. I took a hot shower and the condition improved followed by extreme tiredness. *At the time of vaccination, &amp; on both of these events I had a stiff neck/red skin.

                                                Fingers on left hand began tingling around 30 minutes or so after shot.  While riding home in the car, both the numbness, heaviness feeling in my arm and the tingling worsened.  Then a strong sensation went up the left side of my neck and into the left side of my face where my face started tingling.  That was so powerful and unexpected it caused me to gasp and grab the side of my neck.  My husband turned the car around and we returned to the hospital where they took the information and had me sit for a while checking back a few times.   My arm, fingers, neck and face continued to feel numb and heavy with my face and fingers tingling.    After no improvement and some escalation as it ebbed and flowed, I had an April 12 appointment with Dr at Medical Center.  Some blood work was done afterwards.  A PT appt. is set for April 29th.  It has been more than two weeks now and unfortunately, the numbness, heaviness and tingling continue.

Shaking, shivering, teeth chattering ensued along with generally feeling very unwell.  (Similar to how I felt years ago after having surgery)  This progressed during the night to fever, chills, extreme body aches, stabbing pains in the head, heart racing, dizziness and nausea.  After 12 hours I started to feeling improvement.  At the 16 hour mark I am really tired and nauseous but feel like I&#39;m coming back.  Probably the worst I&#39;ve ever felt.  We considered going to the ER in the night.

Minor arm pain the first day, I expected that. Did my regular errands and was fine, a little tired.  The next day, (Sunday)...I went to church, had a headache, arms aching like mad, arthritic symptoms , legs cramping, joint pain in elbows especially, were off the chain!  I returned home and took immediately to the couch, where I had a low grade fever and stayed all day. I had no appetite, no energy to get up except to go to the bathroom.

I woke up and I was talking gibberish. I was aware that nothing I said was making sense. I went to bed and slept almost 24 hours. I woke up feeling wiped out but I wasn&#39;t confused and I was talking normal again. Right arm hurt and is numb. ( right side of my body typically is kind of numb but the right arm seemed more so numb after the vaccine)

                                                A few minutes after the vaccine my heart began palpatating and I began sweating profusely.  My vitals were checked, I was given water and moved to a cooler area of the facility.  HR was still elevated but I wasnt feeling as flushed.  By 4pm that evening I began having having chills and a fever of 100-100.4 which lasted about 4hrs.  Later that evening my HR elevated to 125 with the feeling of feeling I was having a heart attack.  By that Wed. my HR was still at 125 in motion and about 75 still so I went to visit my PCP on Thurs and when I arrived the HR was 77 but during the visit it elevated to 125 and blood work was done resulting in my tyroid level elevated and since getting the vaccine my HR had been up and down.  When in motion its elevated and when sitting its around 75.

                                                My wife got the J&amp;J shot last Wednesday and had the typical sore arm and a little fatigue. On the following Saturday she had a very severe episode of anger at the members of our household and wanted to leave our marriage, sell the house, and said she could not live like this anymore. She slammed doors, yelled and screamed, insulted everyone around her, and would not listen to reason. 3 days later she is calming down somewhat but still has a lot of anger.  I have lived with the woman for over 30 years and have never seen anything like this before. She does have her moments and has had mood swings in the past but  this episode was exceptional. I think she will be OK in a few more days but I wanted to report this to possibly prevent something similar from happening to others.  It is possible this episode was unrelated to the vaccine. It is also possible this is related to her heavy use of Neurontin with Prozac. Let me know if you have questions.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the single dose at 10:40.  In approximately 11 minutes I started to experience shortness of breath.  I thought it was my N95 mask so decided to head to the car after my 15 minute wait period was completed.  After sitting down in the car I started the following symptoms:  shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, swelling of face, dizziness, weakness.  I sit in the car for approximately 15 minutes then headed home.  I had a driver (thank goodness).  I continued to have symptoms and what felt like elevated blood pressure (I did not have access to a pressure cuff).  After resting at my driver&#39;s house for about 5 hours I felt better and headed home.  The next morning the symptoms were less but still present.  In addition I had a slight rash on my stomach that wrapped around my back.  After approximately 48 hours all of the symptoms subsided.  My blood pressure had returned to normal also.  All swelling went down.

I threw up until about midnight for a total of 7 times. The night before I had difficulty sleeping. The next morning I felt nauseous again and threw up about 10:00 a.m. I started having diarrhea which has lasted through today (Thursday) and I had lost over 5 pounds in just 3 days and my weight is still over 5 pounds less today because it is difficult to eat much. Sunday I was feeling pain around my lest breast where I had had my mastectomy in June of 2006. That eased up the next day.  Feeling stressed because I have bad tinnitus and was worried about a reaction.

I still have a lump but it isn&#39;t bruised looking anymore. The incident I went to medical care for - I saw the doctor on 4/2/2021 and he diagnosed I have shingles on my right leg. I thought it was spider bites. I did have the shingles vaccine. It is inflamed and I get nerve pain down my leg. It is very, very sore to the touch. Right now it is kind of dry - like blisters on it. It&#39;s a mild case. Doctor put me on Valacyclovir. He put me on it for one week and I have two more days after today.

EMT observed the client sitting with her head in her hands and alerted RN, then all responded at 1140. The client complained of shortness of breath and dizziness. Upon assessment, the client was pale, diaphoretic, and clammy, and her skin was cool and dry. The client stated that she is anxious about needles and vaccinations, and that her mask was making her feel &#34;claustrophobic.&#34; The client was encouraged to practice deep breathing and her vital signs were obtained: blood pressure of 96/76, respiratory rate of 12. The client stated that she did eat breakfast that morning at 0930 and was offered some water to drink. . Per the client, she has a medical history of hypothyroidism and the only medication she takes is levothyroxine. The client also stated that she tends to have lower blood pressure and &#34;110/60 is normal&#34; for her. The client was alert and oriented. At 1145, the repeat vital blood pressure for the client was 97/63. She stated at this time that she felt like she was going to pass out, and was transferred to the reclining chair. At 1150, the repeat vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 118/80, heart rate of 78, respiratory rate of 16, and pulse O2 reading of 95%. At 1155, repeat vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 112/74, heart rate of 78, respiratory rate of 14, pulse oximeter reading of 96%. At this time, the client&#39;s color returned to normal and they were no longer clammy. At 1207, the client&#39;s blood pressure was 110/72, their heart rate was 73, their respiratory rate was 8, and their pulse oximeter reading was 97%. The client stated they &#34;feel great&#34; and left the facility at 1210, ambulating with a steady gait to their car, where they were driven home by an acquaintance.

                                                I got the vaccine at around 11am on 6th April.  By 8pm the same day I was experiencing very severe chills - I have never felt so cold before in my life,  and the evening was not cold..  The next day, 7th April,  I woke up with bad aches in various, seemingly random areas of my body:  both upper arms, outside parts of both thighs, center of back between shoulder blades.  Interestingly all the aches were symmetrical.  I had not done any serious exercise to cause these symptoms, just a stroll around the park after getting the vaccine. I also experienced crushing tiredness and had to go back to bed in the afternoon.  Today, 8th April at 5:30 pm my left arm at the vaccine site still aches, but all the other symptoms had vanished by the morning.  I&#39;m 5&#39; 4&#34; and weigh 114lbs.  My husband got the vaccine at the same time and had no symptoms.  We are speculating that my smaller size may have contributed to my adverse reaction.  He is 5&#39; 6&#34; and weighs 180lbs.  In spite of this discomfort I&#39;m so relieved and pleased that we were able to get the vaccine.  Thank you!

                                                Initial reaction was flu-like symptoms but more concerning reaction was a bad rash with red small bumps on the same side as the shot was given directly above my left breast that was severely itchy. This rash is just now starting to dissipate but still itches; I used OTC cortisone creme and Benedryl to address the itching. The other major effect involved my left arm. For a full week, the muscle in which the shot was given was extremely sore to the touch and the whole arm ached. I still cannot fully extend that arm above my head without it feeling like an aching weight. Lastly, I had a pain in the center of my back as a hard ache that one week later still has not fully dissipated. It appears to be going away, but has lingered longer than I would have expected.

I felt very cold and clammy and nauseous.  My hands were very shaky. I  felt very weak and very tired so I slept the whole day.  Today I woke up and felt the same dizziness, very cold hands and nauseous.  Both times I had diarrhea.  I have never had dizzy spells before so I know this has to be vaccine related.

                                                Six hours after the vaccine, I had the chills that quickly turned into UNCONTROLLABLE &amp; SEVERE body shaking, a headache, SEVERE back and neck pain and elevated resting heart rate (96). I took 2.5mg of Ambian thinking that if I could just fall asleep, I would sleep it off. After an hour of non-stop symptoms, I fell asleep for about an hour only to wake up  with the severe neck and back pain and headache still present. The body shaking had subsided.   The next day, I was tired but fine.

Mental fogginess began at 8 PM (8 hrs after shot) and lasted until late the next evening Chills began at 8:30 PM and continued until early Friday AM. There were also a few instances of hot flashes in between the chills. About 10 hours after the shot the following began: headache (I rarely get headaches), nausea, muscle aches - mostly my quadriceps, low back pain, pain in the back of my neck, general lethargic feeling. These all lasted into Thursday evening, except the low back pain, which lasted into Friday AM. I felt a dull pain in all my back teeth that lasted about a day and was intermittent.

                                                2 hours after I received the vaccination, I came down with severe chills.  My entire body was shaking and I could not get warm.  I got extremely fatigued to the point that I could not get out of bed.  I got a severe headache (and I get headaches a lot...this one lasted for almost 10 days).  It seemed that every bone and muscle in my body began aching, from head to toes.  My fever went up to almost 102.  These symptoms continued for a course of four days, except the headache and fatigue (which lasted for approximately 6 days and the headache for 10 days).  I alternated Tylenol, Advil and Alleve.  They did not help hardly at all, unfortunately.  2 weeks later, I developed lymph node swelling in my right arm pit and alongside my right breast.  Today, these lymph nodes are still swollen and are painful to the touch.  I experienced pain at the injection site and if I touch it, it is still painful today, but does not ache like it did initially.

                                                Got shot a little after 3 pm March 11, 2021. At about 10 pm that evening, had about an hour of chills, no big deal. Then began to get headache with slight fever and the headache got progressively worse, with nausea and rapid heart rate. The headache was so bad I could not sleep at all - the worst headache I have ever had. I took one extra-strength Tylenol at about 10 or 11 am the next day, March 12, which took the edge off the headache. The headache diminished till it was gone by about 8 or 9 pm. The rapid heart rate, along with tiredness, low energy, and feeling jittery continued for several days, then stopped. About 3 or 4 weeks later...there&#39;s more BUT FORM WON&#39;T LET ME GO TO CONTINUATION PAGE

                                                She received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID Vaccine 3/5/2021 9:30am.   3/6/2021 She reports that she was weak and exhausted and flu like symptoms.   Symptoms began on 3/7/21, woke up horizontal binocular diplopia at 8:30am. Has been constant since it started. It is worst when looking to the left and best looking the right. Worse in the distance. No other associated symptoms   3/13/21: Around noon, was just sitting in the chair. She reports that she got a bad headache and then the entire left side of the body from head to toe was numb and burning in the left side face. This lasted all day, but completely resolved by night time.  Had never had anything quite like that in the past. She had a headache that started soon before the numbness, that also lasted most of the day.   3/15/21: was seen in ED with reported normal MRI, CT, and EKG   MRI brain with a small left pons lesion near the cranial nerve 6 nucleus   She was seen by Neuro-ophthalmology Dr. (attending), Dr. (fellow) 3/17/2021 &#34; MRI brain on 3/15/21 did not reveal a structural etiology for diplopia.  Differential diagnosis includes microvascular ischemic left 6th nerve palsy versus possibly post-vaccination cranial nerve palsy (received COVID vaccine 2 days prior).  Also on the differential diagnosis but less likely, includes myasthenia gravis (she did not have expected abduction saccade slowing of the left eye typical of an ischemic cranial nerve palsy).  Thyroid eye disease also would be less likely.  We will obtain antibody testing for myasthenia and thyroid eye disease.  Today we applied a 10 prism diopter base out prism over her left glasses lens.  I instructed her to remove this when appropriate, as I expect her diplopia to gradually improved.&#34;  4/7/2021 acetylcholine ab receptor negative, TSI negative, TSH receptor antibody negative, LH/FSH normal,

I alerted the person at the vaccination site saying something was not right and then they called the paramedics who took my vitals and said my heart rate and blood pressure was extremely high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl and oxygen because I was feeling shortness of breath. They kept me until about 11:35 in observation when I felt myself again. The headache, nausea and body aches stayed for about 2 weeks but all other symptoms subsided.

                                                received Jansen vaccine on 3/31/21 and the following day I had a headache,, achy and tired.  I expected this, but a few days later I was still having what I describe as migraine type headaches and at one point I was sweating profusely, dizzy massive headache with not only nausea, but  dry heaving so bad I could barely get to my medication and seriously thought it would never subside.  I continued with headaches up until today April 14.  This is the first day I have not had a headache.  I contacted my vascular doctor as I had a blood clot several years ago and he has prescribed Eliquis twice a day for the next 2 weeks.   Today marks 2 weeks and like I said, it&#39;s the first day I have not had a headache

Began having a dry cough, went to nurse to as if normal, she said no, she started monitoring me. Still had cough, then became light headed and nausea. She gave me 25 mg of  Benadryl,  coughing continued, breathing became rapid, then I was given  shot of epi,  I became dizzy again and couldn?t complete a sentence. Words were slurred, heart beat racing. EMT?s were called. Received another shot of  Benadryl. It did not counteract anything. Received another shot of epi. Had uncontrollable shakes and hard to breathe or speak.  Was difficult to get BP reading due to shaking. Finally got reading of 196/99. EMT listened to heart and lungs. Said all was good. Taken to ER for monitoring of heart, Lungs and BP. Was there for approximately 2 hours u til shakes and BP were good.

                                                I received the Janssen COVAX on Monday morning, 5 Apr 2021.  A week later, on Monday evening, 12 Apr 2021, I experienced extremely painful leg cramps and broke out in a sweat. I felt extremely nauseous, and weak, this was followed by a sever pain in my head that was so extreme that I passed out. After coming to, the pain in my head finally began to subside, along with the leg cramps. My husband indicated that I was unconscious for just under a minute.  For the next two days, I had bouts of nausea, headaches, sweats, and was extremely tired.  On Wednesday, 14 Apr, after learning of the issues related to the Janssen vaccine, and the symptoms described being what I experienced, I contacted the advice (cont&#39;d)..Additional information for Item 18: Line and was told to go to Emergency Room at the hospital, which I did.  I do not feel that they addressed my concerns or the symptoms that I was experiencing, and at no time did they try to determine if it was due to the vaccine.  The discharge papers did not even address the &#34;event&#34; and the &#34;symptoms&#34; that I described.  They did not take any information down related to the vaccine, lot number, etc., that I had received.  They seemed to go through a set routine:  blood pressure, blood work, temperature, EKG, and CAT scan.    21. (continued)...Visited Emergency Room, however, was requested by ER to go to Primary Care as follow-up, however, as a  Employee we cannot be seen by Primary Care on THIS site.  Instead , we have to go on the local clinic to receive care.  The issue is that this was a vaccine that I was scheduled by my leadership to receive, with no choice in choosing which vaccine I could receive, and without follow-up care for adverse reactions. The hospital did not indicate to me that I should report this incident, however, I am concerned as a result of the &#34;event&#34; that I experienced, that it should be reported.  Furthermore,we should have a choice as to which vaccine we want to receive, just as everyone does.  Your form does not allow for input addresses  Also, your form does not allow for a phone number.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I grew exhausted and had to sleep into late evening and was chilled,  had a fever of 101 and developed severe pain and inflammation on the top of my collar bone that was feverish and migrated toward my shoulder region on the same side as my vaccine. Ibuprofen would not help with the pain but helped with the fever. My mind told me that I had things to tend to the next day, but still was forced to sleep off and on for 2 more days. After a week and a half, not only did I have thirst, but also food didn&#39;t taste right and was metallic.  This lasted for 2 days and finally my taste was restored. The exhaustion lasted off and on for 2 weeks and I just listened to my body. The pain and inflammation on my collar bone has subsided 4 days ago but still have pain in my shoulder when I sleep.  On April 5 around 8:30 a.m. a nasty virus hit me out of the blue. I grew week and tired and had to go to bed. I slept all day until around 9:00 p.m. and woke to uncontrollable diarrhea and fainting spell while in the bathroom. I had abominable pain and nausea that last for a half hour and then I returned to bed. The next 2 days, I was week and exhausted but continued with my regular routine.  My equilibrium is still affected from time to time.

Every tooth in my mouth started throbbing at around 11 hrs  and continued for about 5 more hours. Also during that time, waves of nausea but no vomiting, also uncontrollable shivering but I wasn&#39;t cold and I wasn&#39;t hot but weird shivering. I did not take my temperature as I didn&#39;t feel like I had a fever. Around 13 hrs after a stabbing pain in front of thighs like hot pokers started and around 14 hrs thigh pain was still present but then the calves on both legs started to get the same stabbing pain.   At around 24 hrs after - headache remained, pulsating teeth stopped, thigh pain stopped but calf pain remained. Headache remained off and on for several days. General brain fog also lasted for about 1 week. The calf pain comes and goes even after 2 weeks. Arm where shot was administered was very tender to the touch for the last 2 weeks.   Lastly, I wouldn&#39;t say I had shortness of breath but at times I just felt like I needed to stop and force myself to take a very deep breath.

I experience numbness below and above my knee cap. I also experienced bad migraines , arm soreness at the injection site. I called my doctor and he gave me an appointment to see him and he did not think it was related to the vaccine but he was not sure since I do have history of rheumatoid arthritis.  Today my left knee and leg still feel numb and I am taking my regular medications as instructed.

I received the dose (1805029) on 3/12/2021 (Friday) at 4:30 in the afternoon. At around 10:30 p.m. I began to feel unwell with chills, shaking/tremors of my hands/arms, and overall aches. I had trouble sleeping through the night due to these symptoms in addition to night sweats (fever).  These conditions persisted through the next day (Saturday) and evening (24 hours).  I managed to sleep 8 hours and had only a headache the following morning (Sunday).  I treated my symptoms by taking Tylenol which was helpful.  Hope this helps with your research/records.

By morning, my temperature was down to 99.9 and I continued to run a temperature for 48 hours.  My normal temperature is 97.2.  I also had for fatigue for about 5-6 days but it was minor.

I was speaking with a friend, who is a nurse, and she told me to take a Benedryl, so I ate a 12.5 milligrams children&#39;s chewable diphenhydramine.  Twenty minutes later I felt normal again.  Later that evening I noticed the palms of my hands were very hot.  I did not have any fever.  That passed the next evening.

She broke out with a rash the thursday after getting the vaccine and after a few days of vaccine she decided to go to urgent care since the \&#34;burning wasn&#39;t stopping\&#34; and it spread to her chest. She was discharged with a script of prednisone and the rash seems to be getting a little better. I will follow up with her in 2 days to make sure it has cleared up.

                                                March 13, 2021-1:30pm-Shot administered to right arm-it bled and the nurse had to apply pressure with an alcohol swab. It stopped immediately. 1:40-started feeling a tightness in the muscle in my neck under my right ear Stayed a few minutes longer than the required 15 to see if anything else presented. Mentioned it to the nurse and rep. The rep asked if I was nervous about getting the shot. When I said yes, he said it may just be that. Told me to contact my doctor with additional issues.  1:55-When leaving the parking lot, I felt my lips and nostril on the right side go numb-it felt like when Novocain is wearing off after a dentist visit. As the day progressed, the area under my ear and down my neck got more and more sensitive. My lips continued to feel numb. My injection site was tender and black and blue. When I went to bed at 9pm, I began experiencing lots of pain in my right lower jaw. I took a Tylenol but it didn&#39;t alleviate the pain. I called on-call doctor. Since I already had taken a Tylenol, he suggested an anti-inflammatory and warm moist compresses and to contact him again if things worsened. 3/14/21-7:00am-Upon awaking, my jaw pain was virtually gone but the whole area I had had the issue with was very tender to the touch. My lip still felt a bit numb.  3:25pm- It is now 26 hours since my vaccination. I still feel like I had trauma to the right side of my face and neck because it is sensitive to the touch. I also have a continued slight sensitivity of my lips on the right side. My glands on both sides of my neck now seem tender, as well. 3/15/21-3/17/21-I continue to have random pain/tenderness in the aforementioned areas. I also have an aura of tingling in my brain from time to time.

Vomited in middle of the night.  Felt very drained and tired with myalgia all of the next two days.  Majority of symptoms went away after that but I felt as if I was coming down with a cold for the next 7 days - today my nose has been running all day and I have a stuffed head  (and I have not had a cold since November 2019). I  had a covid test yesterday because I need to accompany my husband for a medical procedure on Friday - that was negative. I have seen no one, gone nowhere, and done nothing different since I received my vaccine than I had beforehand yet I am displaying symptoms normally associated with a cold although I have no fever.

I experienced nausea, pain in my upper back and my heart raced for approximately 10 hours.  On Tuesday, March 16, 2021 I slept on and off for the entire day and continued to have a fever.

I am currently recovered from all symptoms as of  March 22, 2021.

The next morning I was very tired. As time progressed, I felt like I HAD to be horizontal. No energy at all. No appetite at all. Took my temperature and was shocked to see it at 101.4º. Pharmacist suggested I take aspirin, which I took one, and then another one several hours later. It did help and reduced the fever to 99º.  The following day the temperature remained at 99º but under 100º. (I never took any other aspirin other than the two that I mentioned). The third day I was good to go!

She stayed longer due to questions and her sister getting vaccine also. I had to call PCP for sister to get vaccine due to medical issues. I could not get through to PCP informed her I would call her.  I called to tell them they would need to  call her sister&#39;s PCP At about 0846 she stated she was not feeling well. Stated she thinks her right side may be numb-tingling and right side of face. Informed her to go to ER if she thought she was having an allergic reaction or call 911. She stated she was in ER parking lot now. Stated her PCP wanted her to have this vaccine and she is allergic to Epinephrine, informed her to tell ER what she just told me and that she had received the COVID vaccine. At 3:00 PM client called and asked if predisone she got in ER would elevate her BP. She stated ER papers say paresthesia of skin, TIA vs allergic reaction to vaccine, work up TIA symptoms and sent home to follow up with PCP.

I had a little itching at the shot site.  That went away in about 15 mins.  Late afternoon I had a slight headache. 4/1/21 Day 2:  Morning was normal.  Afternoon I started feeling a little sluggish.  I had a little headache. 4/2/21 Day 3: Morning was slow.  I noticed that I was tired.  Headache was stronger.  I took Ibuprofen 400mg. By mid day, I was on the couch the rest of the day.  My body was telling me to rest.  So I did.

On the 12th had severe chest pains which I chalked up to a very bad case of heart burn.  On March 24th, while driving I had two major (what I thought at the time) was panic attacks...body started shaking, heart was beating like crazy, couldn&#39;t catch my breath, felt like I was going to pass out or die.  Had to pull over twice to calm myself down.  (From what I read this could be a sign of a blood clot but I am not a doctor.)  Had minor heart burn until April 5th....which ironically was the end of my 28 days until the vaccine fully kicked in.  Just reporting what happen.  I feel fine now.

I felt very fatigued and my eyes hurt so much and I could not keep them open. On 04-06-2021 I still was not feeling well. I started to have problems with my right side of my face, eyes and mouth which gradually got worse so I went to the hospital. At the hospital they checked me for stroke, performed lab work, did MRI and CT scans and the  the doctors came back and said it was Bell&#39;s palsy. I again went to the hospital 04-11-2021 but this time due to GI issues with pain.  On 04-14-2021 through 04-15-2021, I started to experience neck pain behind my right ear. At the hospital they had prescribed my prednisone 50mg, so I took half for my pain.  I still have trouble sleeping and have lots of pain.

Sunday evening in the middle of the night, in bed, I was shaking so badly from chills that I was afraid to get up to get Tylenol.  I finally did and I couldn&#39;t even focus my eyesight and control my hands as I went to open the bottle of pills that my hands were shaking so badly that I spilled them all over the place.   Finally I woke my husband who heated up blankets in the dryer and brought me hot tea.  My husband helped me to the bathroom where I vomited.  I cannot remember when I was so sick.  I missed work that day at my part-time job and the next day at my full time job as a teacher.

This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 This report involves a patient who experienced sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue next day after receiving Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2.S for prophylactic vaccination. Approximately a week later, the patient experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea and 1.5 weeks later she had foggy feeling in head and &#34;believes the vaccine is contaminated&#34;, had fever blister, facial pain and vertigo. Approximately 3.5 weeks after being vaccinated the patient experienced pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. A throat (ENT) specialist was unable to diagnose and they felt there was some autoimmune effects. A month after being vaccinated the patient experienced stomach burning sensation, night sweats and tooth pain. Given the close temporal relationship and the nature of the events, the events of sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue are considered related to the vaccination. The insufficient information precludes a meaningful medical assessment of the remaining events, including &#34;autoimmune effects&#34;. The events will be assessed further when additional information is received.

                                                24 hours after the vaccine I developed a sharp pain on the inside of my left knee, slightly above the knee cap.  There was a soft bump in that area.  At work the next day I felt more sharp pains and bumps developing around my knees on both legs. The backs of my thighs were also beginning to burn.  I contacted the hotline set up at my work for adverse reactions when I got home from work that night.  They were concerned and had me call my doctor.  My work is onboard an aircraft and she did not want me to fly again without an ultrasound. I had an ultrasound perform on my left leg and the thigh of my right leg. It was normal.  Over the next week I would get stinging , painful bumps and used NSAIDS to help. Approximately six days after the shot the burning sensation on my thighs got worst. It spread for the back of my thighs to the front and then to the calves, arms and shoulders in that order, I started taking Benadryl to release the burning. I went to my doctor who sent me for another ultrasound and blood up. Three weeks after the injection the painful stinging bumps are still happening and the burning is on my legs, arms and shoulders. I am going back to the doctor today and talk about prescribing Gabapentin.

I felt a burning all over my body (especially my back), and body aches, and began a fever which grew from 97.3 (my normal) to a high of 100.1  (&#43;2.8 degrees) within 2.5 more hours (by 9:30pm).   Very bad chills and fever.  By 9:30 took 1 500mg Tylenol.   Little sleep that night.  Felt very unwell next day (3/9) including headache.  At noon I could get up and get some food.  By 1pm fever subsided completely, but temporarily.  Fever came back by 4pm, but only to 98.6 (&#43;1.3 above normal).  Took another 500mg Tylenol.  Night 2 slept well. Woke up 3/10 no fever, headache gone, but balance still peculiar.  I noticed the first night that my sense of balance was off.

                                                Within 12 hours I became to have severe muscle aches and joint aches. All my joint felt hot, it was bad enough I wasn&#39;t able to sleep. I took Ibuprofen   to help sleep.  I slept most of Friday I has extreme fatigue. On Saturday I has muscle weakness and tingly in my hands, the muscle aches have gone away. I couldn&#39;t knit ot fine motor skills, It bothered me. I woke up on Sunday where I had extremes muscle weakness in both my legs. I called my PCP, they were surprised by how the reaction was delayed.  They wanted me to get a test for the strength in my legs and sent me to the ER. I wen to the Er they tested for stroke, blood work, scans, they were worried about Guillain Barre Syndrome.  I stayed there about 5 hours. Yesterday afternoon the tingly went away from my hands but my legs are still kinda goofy. The muscle in my forearm  and thigh feel like my muscle are really sore, like they have been tense

Hives in the crook of my right arm. Burning, itchy little red bumps. I couldn&#39;t swallow but I think that was from the high blood sugar as my mouth was very dry. I felt like I had a really bad cold, my head felt foggy.

                                                Rosacea flare up within 10 minutes of injection. Face bright strawberry red. Entire body became hot and had to fan myself (not a hot flash) Approximately 45 minutes later left ear started tingling and then pain followed and only in left ear. An hour after the shot ( and back home) started feeling tingling in lips and face. Face swelled up and smoothed out wrinkles. Lasted about 2 hours and then subsided.  Also metallic taste in mouth during swelling of the face. Metallic taste lasted as long as the face swelling which was about 2 hours. Loose stools and tummy upset which is still going on.

Right away after receiving the vaccine-- stiff neck on the left side which after a night&#39;s sleep, moved to my right side of neck. No big deal.     Tired &amp; &#39;drunk&#39; after the vaccine which lasted until mid-afternoon the next day.  No big deal.       The worst of all happened at 3 1/2 days, a rash started in the evening, went to bed, woke up the next day with rash almost everywhere. Red, swollen, &amp; itching like crazy.   The next day- Sunday, along with Monday &amp; Tues. was horrid. I am covered from my scalp to the tops of my feet, my crotch hurts, as do my breasts. Used Benadryl cream, aloe vera to no avail.

                                                Severe shaking chills, headache, fever, muscle aches that lasted several hours. Taking Advil helped reduce symptoms. These symptoms are typical of those who have taken the J&amp;J vaccine and in fact, if you read the actual stories of the side effects of people who took this vaccine, shared on sites, these symptoms are closer to 100% present rather than the far lower and untrue percentage revealed by the CDC. These symptoms need to be better tracked and people should be forewarned how COMMON these side effects are; they are not rare!

At 5:30pm, same day, became immediate flush, dizzy, barely made it to bathroom, violently vomiting all that was in my stomach.  This was followed by severe chills, the shakes and a mild headache.  Took (2) Tylenol at the time of the shot, drank many ounces of water all day but still had this issue. Took another (2) Tylenol after vomiting and more water. Went to bed at 8pm.  Woke at midnight, 4/5/21, severe headache, now took (2) Advil and slept better until Mon. Morning, 4/5/2021.  Experienced two sluggish, low energy days and still have no appetite. What the heck????

Immediately had to lay down and took Advil/Tylenol.  Could feel the movement of joint pain from shoulders to elbow, hips to knees.  Headache.  Couldn&#39;t navigate stairs safely.   In bed or on the couch for 24 hours until 6pm Friday 4/9/2021.      Three of us from the same company had the Janssen Vac within a day of each other and all 3 of us had the same adverse reaction.  To me, that is not mild symptoms when it debilitated me and kept me from going to work.    Most family members have had Pfizer with two shots and had NO side effects.

My first shot for Covid-19 was a Moderna shot, to which I had a bad reaction (immediate and prolonged lightheadedness reported already on this site).  My doctor advised me that my second dose should be a Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, as per information he had received from the CDC.  So, 28 days after the first shot I had the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  I experienced the expected side effects of body aches, chills, headache--no big deal on day 2, but on day 3, I started some lightheadedness, as did my daughter who had the shot the same day.  Her lightheaded subsided the next day, but mine continued into day 4 and got worse when it became accompanied by pressure in my head/ears, and it felt like I was talking in a tunnel with echoing.  I couldn&#39;t function the rest of the day.  Today, the head pressure is not there, but the lightheadedness and shakiness are still there.  I hope I fully recover from these shots, but I don&#39;t have a lot of hope.

                                                2 weeks post inoculation developed burning sensation/tingling /pain from armpit to thumb; some tingling in thumb - sensation more like nerve pain vs muscle pain.  After two days gradually improved.  Muscle strength not affected, but movement in most directions elicited sharp pain coursing down arm.  Gradually improving to pain over the deltoid near injection site;  as of 19 days since initial pain motility much improved but still periodically throbs and sensitive to pressure and certain movements.   No treatment except restricting use of arm and time.  10 hrs post inoculation developed chills, myalgia and headache.  Chills and myalgia resolved in a few hours; an aspirin the next day resolved the headache.    This reaction was not unexpected.  Did not have pain at injection site until 2 weeks post injection.

Pain continued throughout the night, until I finally got up and just walked around house to try to get some relief then laid down and try elevating leg on pillows. The pain continued so got u p and walked around more and pain finally subsided enough to get some rest.  Then felt like just had a bruise in that area of the leg for a day.

                                                Beginning the following morning after my vaccination, at approximately 8:30 am, I began having severe stabbing chest pains. Feeling as though I was being stabbed dead center of my chest and it came out my back.  I had trouble breathing or felt like it hurt more when I tried to take a deep breath. This was very severe for about 2 hours then eased off  and was off and on for about two days. My arm did not get sore until the third day after my vaccination and remains sore still. I?ve experienced a headache in severity ranging from a nuisance to temple throbbing since the day after vaccination.  I have taken my naproxen for the chest pain and headache.  I ran a temp of 99-100 occasionally but never for a long period of time.  I?m still experiencing some chest pain  occasionally but nothing as severe as  the first two days.

                                                Vax received Saturday.   Entire leg very sore on Sunday.  Monday morning woke early with pain in the knee that was replaced.  I was unable to straighten leg when lying in bed.  I managed to stand up and walk it off, but with pain as severe as in January when knee was replaced.  Leg continued to be sore, then Monday night I didn&#39;t have the same issue w/bending, but I did wake early with horrible stabbing pains in knee.  I treated with Tylenol, Alprozalan &amp; Ice.

Told to return in 3 days if not better. They said pulse was ok so prob not a clot. I had pain for two weeks but did not return. At end of two weeks swelling gone . Still some residual pain in right arm, but not constant.

                                                Metallic taste in mouth 30 minutes after receiving vaccine. I have had a lot of stress (significant other diagnosed with Stage 4 inoperable NSCLC ) and had been attributing the often present headache to that, but they were also accompanied by a butterfly pattern red flush across my nose.  Acid reflux which I was attributing to stress or alendronate.  Woke in the night 4/12 to severe acid reflux, nausea, headache, flush, thought maybe I was having a heart attack (I have no cardiac/BP issues); then last night, 4/14 about 6 PM, weird numbness tingling in right arm from center of my chest  passed in about 5 minutes. Significant Other said I had the pattern flush on face at time of attack which faded as I began to feel better.  I have not consistently felt at 100% since vaccination, but I have a lot going on and attributed it to that.

                                                For the 1st 10 days it felt like my brain was swollen too big for my skull.  Not like any headache I have ever had.  I did take some acetaminophen but it didn?t seem to quell the pain.  While still at vaccine site I got a weird taste in my mouth, dry mouth and my voice started going hoarse.  I stayed a while longer to be watched as I also had itching.  I did not go into hives.  I had pain in my body from time of injection ? the ?typical? sore arm didn?t set in until day 3-4.  I had hot spots all over my body ? but not fever or rash.   On 4/11/21 I broke out into a rash on my forehead that lasted about 4 days.  What I want to specifically report is I like these zinger/sharp traveling pain from my temples to posterior head.  Still having this sensation but not as frequently.  They don?t last long but are noticeable at the time they are happening.  The only way I can explain the pain is that it felt like when you break a blood vessel in you finger and it really, really hurts for a short while and then pain subsides.  I started having these pin prick sensations within the first few days all over my body (arms, legs, back) but the frequency has decreased.  Days 2-6 I was just wiped out and rested.  I am still feeling lack of energy still today.

When I arrived I noticed foaming around her mouth and she urinated on herself.  No clonal movements noted.  Pulse could not be felt so CPR was initiated.  She woke up in about 30 seconds.  Paramedics called and arrived within 5 minutes.  Patient was awake and oriented.  When asked she indicated that she had a history of a seizure many years ago.   Paramedics transported her to a Medical Center.

Over the next couple of days, became very ill, spent five days experiencing severe headache, disorientation, confusion, neck, shoulder, and back pain together with generalized arthralgias and myalgias. Around the 2nd week post-vaccination began to experience ?numbness and tingling? initially, affecting all fingers and toes; symptoms gradually evolved into ascending paresthesia affecting the upper and lower extremities. (worse in the upper extremities). Neurological symptoms are accompanied by painful electrical-like impulses running along my spine and elicited by flexing my neck (Lhermitte neurological phenomenon). Neurological signs and symptoms prompted me to go to the emergency room. Currently, I am under the care of a neurologist and undergoing extensive diagnostic workup.  Present treatment: Glucocorticoids (tapering) and Gabapentin. Among the initial rule out diagnosis, were transverse myelitis, and Guillain Barre. Present preliminary r/o diagnosis: Post-vaccine immune reaction ? No definitive diagnosis yet.

She reported these on 4/19/21. I advised her to contact her PCP to get evaluated for the signs/symptoms that she is experiencing to rule out anything severe. She did not seem to understand and asked to speak with the manufacturer. She said that she would contact the manufacturer and walked away.  When I attempted to contact her again today on 4/20/21, the phone number she provided to us has been disconnected and we have no means of reaching her at this point in time. I am hoping she heeded my advice and contacted her PCP to get evaluated.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure and diabetes.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 17-MAR-2021 at left arm for prophylactic vaccination.  No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient had experienced headache after vaccination. On 27-MAR-2021, the patient began to experience intermittent pain on right leg. On 30-MAR-2021, she experienced headache again and was still having leg pain; she visited the Emergency Room (ER) and was admitted on 30-MAR-2021. On 02-APR-2021, the patient experienced clots on right leg. On APR-2021, a catheter was placed in catheterization procedure and her right leg vein was unclogged of a clot. A second clot did not require removal because the vein had already unclogged itself after medication. The patient was administered unspecified anticoagulants. She was discharged on 5-APR-2021 and was prescribed ticagrelor which was then changed to clopidogrel. On 18-APR-2021, the patient experienced a headache again and feeling of pressure on legs and hands. Patient was advised to visit ER. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from clots on right leg and intermittent pain on right leg on 02-APR-2021, recovered with sequelae from headache on 19-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from pressure on both legs and pressure on hands. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 64 year-old Hispanic or Latino female with history of high blood pressure and diabetes was hospitalized for clots in her right leg 13 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Concomitant medications were not reported. On the day of her vaccination, she experienced a headache. Ten days later, she began to experience intermittent leg pain. Three days later (ie, 13 days post vaccination), she went to the emergency room (ER) and was admitted to the hospital. During the hospitalization, a clot was removed via catheterization and she was administered unspecified anticoagulants. A second clot resolved on its own without surgical intervention. After 6 days in the hospital, she was discharged with ticagrelor which was later changed to clopidogrel. She recovered from the clots. Thirteen days after discharge, she began to experience headache and &#34;pressure&#34; in both legs and hands. She was advised to go to the ER; no further information was provided. Based on the limited information, the relationship of the serious events with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant. Additional information is being sought.

                                                Department of Health received a call from her sister, in response to a call/letter/text sent out to all recipients of the Janssen vaccine. She stated that her sister received the J and J vaccine on 3/12/21 (confirmed in State vaccine system) at the hospital where she receives her oncology care.  She reported the following:  &#34;She had a massive stroke on MARCH 27TH, 2021 leaving her paralyzed on the right side with the inability to speak, swallow, or see. She was initially diagnosed with Ovarian cancer approximately three and one half years ago. She was chosen for a study with Pharmaceuticals and her diagnosis was changed to a vary rare form of cancer called clear cell carcinoma which originates in the gynecological area. She did have a previous stroke approximately three years ago, (just after original diagnosis) but she was on a different course of treatment at that time...Oncologists have explained that this most recent stroke event would not be considered a side effect of her current treatment routine. She wanted to bring it to the attention of the health department in case it needs to be looked at more closely by the J&amp;J research/scientific team. She passed away on 4/5/21. Her current treatment consisted of palliative chemo only. &#34;  Decedent was a resident but was vaccinated in another state. After the CVA she was brought to the hospital and subsequently transferred to the Medical Center where she died on 4/5/2021. Sister is willing to speak with any investigators if deemed necessary.

Originally I had used heat, before finding the information online.  Nothing seems to help at this point.

I started having diarrhea about 5:30pm.  Later in the evening  around 8:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Around the same time I became very, very sleepy and had extreme fatigue.  My right arm where I received the shot did not hurt and still does not hurt.  Around 6:00pm, my left arm starting hurting in the same spot where I received the vaccine in the right arm.   On the morning of 3/8/2021, I ate breakfast consisting of whole wheat bread and peanut butter and weak coffee (my usual breakfast) and had diarrhea again soon after eating.  At 3:30pm, I ate broiled, skinless chicken, green beans and small amount of instant mashed potatoes.  Around 5:00pm, I had diarrhea again.  I have been drinking a great deal of water on both 3/7/2021 and 3/8/2021 as I normally do every day.  At 6:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Soon after, I took two imodium gelcaps and hoping they will help the diarrhea.  My left arm has become increasingly more sore and hurts in the muscle.  No other symptoms.

                                                Patient received Janseen COVID vaccine. The first 1/2 of the vaccine was given easily IM to the left deltoid and then the patient complained of severe arm pain, tensed her muscles, and the last 0.25ml was difficult to inject. Then the patient became hypotensive 90/45, dizzy, and felt like she was going to pass out. She was laid in the supine position, given a cool cloth for her forehead and monitored for approx. 45 minutes. Her blood pressure remained 90/60, 96/56 at discharge. Her heart rate ranged from 55-65, regular. Her son came to take her home as we did not feel comfortable with the patient driving. The patient was continuously monitored by the NPs and APCT. She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged home. She was given information for V-safe to report her reaction and advised to follow up in the ER for any SOB, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, syncope, CP, etc.

There is a burning sensation with mild itching and red blotches/spots.  I contacted my physician who recommended OTC treatment at home and advised me to report it to VAERS.  It is mild in terms of impact but not expected four days after the vaccination date.

                                                Around 10-11 hours after the injection, I began to feel body aches and soreness around my neck and upper back.  I started getting chilled but was very hot and feverish.  I went to bed around 10:00pm and had extreme body aches, shaking with chills and had a fever.  I took tylenol around 4am, when my temperature was 100.7.  The fever and aches subsided by the time I got up around 7am, but I was tired all day.  Took another tylenol around 1pm and started feeling normal, fine.  No other issues.

Woke up an hour later (9PM) with fever (100.5), HUGE migraine and being nauseous. I threw up, tried to go back to sleep but couldn&#39;t because of the migraine and fever. Decided to take 2 Tylenol, but I vomited about 20 mins later.  All night, I hardly could sleep at all, so sick I was feeling (and I&#39;m never sick!). No reaction at all on the site of the vaccine, no redness, no swelling at all. All day today (day after the vaccine), I have felt really weak, slightly feverish (though less than last night), with a persistent headache.

I tried to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I took it easy. I did get the chills and sweats thru the day; skin turns really red (MCAS). That symptoms still comes and goes. The chills, regulating body temperature, has flared back up after being dormant for years.  3/30 I saw MD. She wanted to defer for 4-6 weeks after vaccination to see if symptoms were still persisting or leveling out.  I have since canceled every sort of appt since then as I don&#39;t have the energy.  *I am on the very tail end of an opioid withdrawal; tramadol. I have taken for 6 years, 400 mg weened down to 100 mg this last year, down to 12.5.

My temperature fell to 95 before I took acetaminophen and was able to fall asleep.. Now, at 7 hours it&#39;s 101.2 and I&#39;m just getting the side effects I expected: weakness, a little nausea.

Yesterday around dinner time, she began having issues with vision in her right eye, causing her visual field in that eye to appear dark to her entire right eye. She told her husband that she thought she might have a hair or eyelash in her right eye and that she had an irritating pain radiating from her right eye to the right side of her face. Even after washing her eye with cold water, the sensation did not subside. At approximately 3-4 AM this morning, she also began to experience pain to the back of her head and neck bilaterally. This morning, the visual impairment improved from the entire visual field to now only just the inferior aspect of the right eye. However, she denies weakness to any of her extremities. Patient also denies chest pain, numbness, abdominal pain or nausea. She was seen at ophthalmology, at which Dr. diagnosed her with a right retinal branch arterial occlusion and decided to send her to SHE to be evaluated for the possibility of a CVA. She denies being on blood thinners or taking Aspirin. She denies any previous diagnosis of a CVA or TIA.

                                                I can&#39;t say for sure but 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my condition called Erythromelalgia flared up terribly, which involved uncomfortable to intense burning of the outer ears 24/7 with no relief.  It calmed down for a couple of days and then came back with other symptoms, including the burning ears, and parts of my neck and face.  In addition to that, my eyes were bloodshot and had drainage coming from them and in the morning, it appeared that they had like a lining of film over them.  Skin is peeling due to all the burning in the areas described.  Several different treatments were tried but none has slowed down the flare-up.  After another trip back to the NP, she said that it was inflamation and gave me a steroid shot along with prednisone tablets.  I also went to an optometrist who found some things wrong with my eyes and prescribed some steroid eye drops.  Before the vaccine, we pretty much had the Erythromelalgia under control with meds but this time, it&#39;s been hard to get things under control and more tolerable.

                                                Around 10 minutes after vaccine patient reported feeling dizzy, tired and weak.  Patient was still responsive, stated she had eaten breakfast.  She then was given water.  She then became unresponsive, eyes closed, snoring with head slumped down while sitting.  After we realized patient could not be awoken, property manager called 911.  While ambulance was on thier way, patient &#34;woke up&#34; but was drowsy and could barely communicate.  No epinephrine or diphenhydramine was administered.  BP was 130/100.  After EMS arrived, patient&#39;s partner came in from the car and reported this has happened multiple times at doctor appointments/procedures.  Patient was unconscious for around 5minutes.  Patient reported she went to the ED but was discharged after a short visit.

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

The next day, bigger lump, swollen, all just below injection and red, moderate chills, a bit itchy, nausea., and painful. Same on 3rd day but much bigger redness spreading down arm, 2 1/2 by 2 1/2&#39; hard mass and red, itchy, painful, chills and nausea. Next morning called Dr. I am taking amoxicillin-clav 875-125ng tab.  Three days later mass is turning from red to pink and retreating. Still hurts  and now bruses show around the injection site, which I thought was strange. The vaccine actually hurt when given (I get injections every three months, so I know what they will feel like, but this hurt and went very deeply and then burned). I felt warm afterwards for about 10 minutes.

                                                On day 11 post shot I started to feel mildly nauseated. Next day nausea increased, as did muscle aches and pain - by early evening I had repeated bouts of uncontrollable vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhea [no cramps, no warning] that lasted most of the night.  I did have a fever briefly - got all red and felt like I was on fire - but that passed pretty quickly while the rest continued.   I had to stay up all night, any attempt to lie down triggered more vomiting.  By 3 in the morning I was ?on empty? and by 6 am could lie down.  Nausea took three more days to leave completely.  Muscle pain is resolving, almost gone.  I am resuming my meds [everything that went down before came right back up].  The only tummy pain was after hours of vomiting [muscle strain].   Today is the 25th and I?m still tired and a bit foggy but otherwise feel better.  I had a call with my doctor about this and she said I should report it so that?s what I?m doing.

                                                Prior to vaccination, the patient stated that she was nervous, but seemed relieved and okay directly following the vaccination.  Following vaccination, patient became restless during the 15 minute post-vaccination window about 2-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.

My heart rate stayed at 109 or more until 10 PM the next night when its slowly went down to a normal heart rate.  At 3 am  (12 hours after the shot) i had  a blinding debilitating headache that lasted until 9pm the next night.   It also affected my vision.   The headache was so bad i could not concentrate on the simplest task.  I  was unsure of what i could take for the headache.   So, I did not take anything.    When i woke up i was very tired and this lasted until the following day.  6am i had a fever of 102.3 this went down to 100.4 at 9:15 pm that night.  I also had chills for several hours. 9:20 AM  the nausea started followed by vomiting and dizziness.   This only lasted for a few hours.    I  experienced very vivid dreams the night of the shot.    I only drank some coconut water all day and could not eat any food.  The next day Saturday March 27 i felt better but the fatigue did not go away until late in the evening.   Sleeping seemed to help but i could only sleep for 2- 3 hours at the most.

                                                11:05 injection-burning sensation at site, assumed to be normal, sat down, within 17 min. top  of hand began to prickle.  Drawing cramping pain followed in forearm, prickling turned to numbness. Mentioned this to one attendant, who recommended sitting longer. Sensations continued, another nurse/attendant checked on me, also mentioned I sit at least 30 min. All other sensations normal-no nausea, no headache, etc.  Small finger, finger next to it,-and their part of the hand to the wrist -were first numb, with occasional tingles, now still numb.[7:30 pm.]  Slight cramp from top of arm to neck, is off -and- on from injection wait-time til now.  I left at 11:55, took temperature at 12:20, =99.4 (my usual basal is 97.6).

                                                About an hour after having the shot, I was nauseous, dizzy and light headed, I thought I was going to pass out.  I had to lay down. My eyes swelled and they started to tear up, I felt weak all day and into the evening. I never had a bad reaction to a vaccine before, so this was surprising.  I contacted the health department as they came to my house and gave me the shot, but I could not get through to anyone. I had to leave a message. After I was contacted back, I was told that someone would contact me that very same day, but no one ever did that day or any other day. .Because of that, I thought it must not have been a big deal, but after reading today that people in a specific had some of the same reactions I did, I thought I should report it.

My legs kept cramping up because I was sweating so much I guess I was dehydrated this went on at three and then again at five. I finally got up at five and I took a piece of bread and two Advil drank some more water finally starting to feel better it was like having the virus all over again but much milder

                                                About one week after my injection, I had severe cramping in left leg. On April 5th started with a couple of days with severe pain in tendons of right shoulder. The pain referred into the right neck and base of occiput. On April 7, 2021, I felt off then developed a severe, stabbing headache over my right eye referring back into the occiput.  Was not steady on my feet. Did not eat dinner, went to bed.  Felt tingling around my mouth, and my neck and shoulders were very tight.  I debated about going to the hospital, but decided against it.  Still have tightness on the right side of my neck into the occiput and right shoulder.

She stated that Friday after her shot on Monday she had severe tremors, so bad it shook the car, and she went to the ER.  They ordered an MRI without contrast and she is scheduled for an MRI with contrast soon.  She cannot remember the date, but she began having blurry vision in her left eye.  She went to her eye doctor and he stated she had an &#34;eye stroke&#34;.  She had injections in her eye today.  I asked her to please call her primary physician as well and she agreed.  I told her I was going to report her symptoms.

                                                On MON evening after the shot, at 11:00pm I experience severe chills that lasted for hours. Tuesday morning I awoke with a bad headache and had body aches all day as well as tendonitis- like pain in both lower arms. I felt somewhat better on WED but I did notice that my compression sleeve on my right arm (lymphedema arm) felt more snug than usual. That night I had severe chills and fever of 101. I slept until 11:45am on THU and felt aches all over. Very fatigued. Went back to sleep from 2:00pm until 6:00pm. Temp was down to 99.8.  When I woke and removed my compression garment, my arm was red and swollen, also rash-like bumps, and was very warm to the touch. FRI morning it looked worse, so I contacted my lymphedema specialist and then my PCP. This is NOT a good situation for anyone who has lymphedema and will necessitate months of treatment.

After she received the shot her leg and shoulder pain/ache increased to an 8/10 (usually a 2-4/10) and was constant when it usually is intermittent.  Her breathing is worse and she is maxing out her inhalers and needing many more doses of her rescue morphine than usual (usually 2.4 ml of 20mg/ml Roxanol used in a week and last week was 7.5ml).  She has not been taking it for the pain for fear of med interactions.  She has increased her Tylenol use from 500mg qd to 3000mg qd.  Her tremors are worse and she is taking her propranolol for tremors 20mg BID instead of her usual 10mg BID.  Her body sweats have gone from 1 time a week to 1-2 times a day.  No fevers noted.

Was able to take this medication on 4/9 when I felt another migraine coming on.  It worked.  The migraines on 4/4, 4/6, and 4/8 began with an aura which lasted more than an hour.  The headaches were so severe that on 4/8 I had my son stay the night.  I never experienced such intense pain in the past.  I do have a history of migraines, but had not had one since 2016.  Typically, I would get the aura, lay down and close my eyes, and then the aura would diminish in 15 - 30 minutes.  I never get a headache with the auras.

                                                Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 EUA vaccine  At the time of the injection, the vaccine burned as it entered my arm. (I have never felt that burning sensation with any other vaccination that I have had in the past. Twenty minutes after the vaccination, I became lightheaded and dizzy.  I could walk but I was wobbly. At one hour after the vaccination, I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my tongue and then the left side and only the left side of my tongue began to go numb. Within a couple of minutes, I realized that my left jaw was going numb, too.  The numbness slowly but surely began to move up the left side of my face all the way to the top of my head.  I had a sharp but brief headache on the left side of my head  that subsided quickly but the numbness remained.  I went home and talked to two people on the phone for several hours because they wanted to be sure that I was OK. At two hours after the vaccination, my face was still numb but I could think and talk clearly, but I was clearing my throat and coughing a lot.  At that point, I also realized that my whole left arm was a little numb and my fingers on my left hand were tingling.  That numbness lasted about 20 minutes and then subsided. The facial numbness lasted for hours.  I wasn&#39;t scared and I wasn&#39;t in pain but it was very strange.  It felt a little bit like the after affects of dental anesthesia but it wasn&#39;t just in my mouth it was the whole left side of my face.   I believe that this must have been an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the vaccine but I don&#39;t know which one.  If you can tell me which chemical it might have been, I will avoid it in the future.

Around 5 hours or so after the shot, I was in bed for 2 days with chills/aches/fever, head pounding, and heart racing.  Also I did not have an appetite. I am just getting my strength back and willing to trust myself walking.

I could not get warm, even with a heated blanket.  It finally subsided a little after midnight and I could sleep, waking every hour.   My body was very achy, and I felt exhausted.   I was very nauseous too.  The next day, Sunday, my body still ached and I felt weak, like recovering from the flu.  Today, Monday, I feel fine.    I did not call my doctor.

                                                On day 9 felt both sides of neck tender under ear by jaw line.   Upon palpation  both sides painful however left side more.   Paid no attention to it except on  day 10 because pain still felt  with left side more painful.  No lump or bump felt just very sensitive and painful upon palpation.   Left side more painful when palpated.  It seems to be going away slowly.   Did not put this on my daily  report because I chalked this up to being maybe a cold or something coming on.  After thinking about this symptom I realized it is slowly going away and as an R.N. contributed to it now as a side effect.  Below I put &#34;No&#34; regarding recovery because the pain is still there however not as bad.  It seems to be going away slowly.  Hoping it will be gone in a few more days.

                                                Six hours after the shot I began to shake. I was not cold and my temp was only 99 degrees. The shaking turned into uncontrollable jerking of my shoulders, torso and thighs. The jerking lasted 3 hours. My family became concerned and said I looked like I was convulsing. We were making plans to go to the ER when it started to calm down. I had no control over my body. I finally stood up and my body felt like I was made of led. Headache, slight fever, and weakness persisted until 48 hours post shot.

It lasted about 5 minutes. I felt fine the rest of the day. The next day I developed a burning sensation in my tongue, mouth throat and chest. Then weakness in my chest and dificulting breathing. It is Saturday April 10, 2021 and the symptoms still come and go. The burning sensations mostly at night. The chest weakness and breathing issues seem to be in the morning and when I exercise. These symptoms are not as bad as they were initially but still present. I am unable to get an answer when I ask if the burning down my are is normal when getting a vaccine. No one else that I have talked with has experienced this symptom.  I emailed my doctor she suggested taking tylenol.

                                                I was sent to table 6. A young woman there started to swab my shoulder / very top of my arm.  I told her to stop- I could see my friend at the other end of the table getting an injection  3 inches below the shoulder. Told the woman not to give me the injection so high. She said it had to go into the muscle. Told her there was just skin and bones that high and no muscle. She said she knew what she was doing. And gave me the injection. My arm and shoulder hurt immediately. Really hurt. I should have talked to someone in charge about her. A nurse watching us for 15 min said that pain at that point was normal. It has been  almost 6 weeks and the pain is so bad that it wakes me up. Pain pills, Tylenol, Advil do not work. Please help me find a way to get rid of this pain.  I did take a photo of the injection site later that day as the pain was still there.  Went to my doctor and she said to give it more time. That was  2 weeks ago.  This is a true story. I hope that you can help me get rid of the pain.

                                                I received the vaccine at a Department of Health vaccine clinic at the Hospital. About 25 minutes after receiving the Janssen vaccine, my face became flushed (red) and I felt weak. We were in the hospital parking lot and drove to that hospital&#39;s emergency room, where I was evaluated. After several tests (item 18) I was declared okay and left after 3 hours with no further intervention. I probably should have taken a Benadryl (diphenhydramine) after the shot to prevent such a reaction.

I finally fell asleep for an hour or two, then awaken just in time to make it to the bathroom where I sat on the toilet ALL night having severe diarrhea and vomiting into a container on my lap.   I would fall asleep, then wake up, on the toilet, very sick.    The vomiting ended after that first night, but the diarrhea has persisted.  It is getting better, though. (It has been 72 hours since the shot.)  I had a headache, my left arm ached, I was nauseous, and feverish until about 8 a.m., today, when my fever broke.  I still feel like I have a low-grade flu, which I have not had in over 40 years.  And, I still have some diarrhea.  I am sipping Coke and can eat some Cheerios, with milk and banana, but that is all that I want to attempt.

Neck muscles &amp; jaw muscles hurt. Dressed in polar fleece jammies, socks, flannel bed-sheets, two heavy duvets &amp; couldn&#39;t get warm nor stop the shaking. Tried standing to walk it off but legs were like jelly.  Tried bio-feedback to relax &amp; stop the shivering but it just continued in wave after wave. My chest tingled and my heart felt like it was working hard. It subsided around 4:30a.m. The next day felt &#39;punk&#39; muscles still jelly like &amp; jaw really ached from chattering. The 2nd day was fine.

She did not report them to the pharmacy until 4/13/21 when she saw the news regarding the blood clot adverse events and thought it may be relevant. She had charlie horses in the past but had not had them in recent history until after her vaccine. It happened 3 times, all in the middle of the night, mostly in her right leg. She did not need to see medical attention for any of them.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included minor low pressure glaucoma, blood pressure, mild asthma, augmentin allergy, non alcoholic, non-smoker, and pre-diabetic.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805018, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 17-MAR-2021 10:00 on left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, Patient stated that the shot hurt so bad not like any other shot she had before, she felt nauseous right on the spot. When she went home, she felt tired, weak and had headache, stomach cramps and her face was tingly but not red. At around 9 or 10 PM, She felt cold, had shiver, diarrhea, chills, and a fever of 100.8 F max. Her arm felt sore and looked bruised so she took Tylenol. By 21-MAR-2021, she had minor symptoms but fever went away, her arm was sore and she had diarrhea. Her symptoms completely resolved by 25-MAR-2021. On 08-APR-2021, patient went to see her Ophthalmologist to follow up on her minor low pressure Glaucoma and Dr. told her she had an Optic Nerve Damage. Dr. told her that her eye pressure is 10 or 11 and it did not make sense that her pressure was low but she had an optic nerve damage. Ophthalmologist suggested that this could be because her oxygen level was low or she had sleep apnea but patient regularly checked her oxygen (always around 98) and did not had sleep apnea. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from diarrhea, bruised arm, tingly face, stomach cramps, shivering/chills/felt cold, sore arm, weakness, nauseous right on the spot, tiredness, headache, and fever on 25-MAR-2021, and the outcome of optic nerve damage was not reported.

                                                Patient reported a sore arm directly after receiving the vaccine. She called the pharmacy to report the sore arm and concerns that she didn&#39;t think her arm should be that sore. The pharmacist went over the vaccine technique used by the technician who remembered the patient. Technique seemed appropriate, so we recommended patient follow-up with her PCP  if the discomfort continued. Pharmacy let the patient know that discomfort in the arm for up to 7 days can occur and is not unusual.  On 4/19/21, patient reported that she  followed up with PCP, tried taking a Medrol Dose Pak and was then referred to doctor with sports medicine. The pharmacy called doctor for more information for the VERS reporting. Doctor had determined patient had injury of left shoulder with bursitis relating to vaccine administration and is a &#34;well known phenomenon&#34; per doctor. Patient continues to follow-up with doctor and will begin PT to help with the condition.

                                                Woke up at 4AM on  03/05/2021 with shaking chills, feeling very cold, couldn&#39;t get warm.  Shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t get whole sentences out.  Body aches and stiffness, affected my walking.  Did not take temperature at that time.  Got back into bed with 2 blankets and a comforter and still couldn&#39;t sleep.  Got up a 7AM - temp 102.2, shaking less but still  feeling cold, body was hot to touch.  I had a bad headache and body aches and stiffness were still there. I noticed at that time  that I had a bright red flush on both cheeks and my nose that was hot to the touch.  Took 600mg of Ibuprofen.  Went back to bed feeling terrible.  At 12 noon I got back up and temp was down to 99.7.  Headache, body aches, stiffness, and &#34;red flush&#34; still on cheeks and nose.  Went back to bed.  Took more Ibuprofen at 7pm - temp was down to 98.7.  Headache was better, body aches improved.  Flushed hot face was still present.  Went to  sleep at 11:30PM  and slept for 10 hours.  Today, 03/06/21, all symptoms improved, no fever, redness of face is still present but less.

Diarrhea, despite taking OTC medications  to control. Dehydration and dizziness. I am now 4 weeks since my shot on March 4th and I continue to have these symptoms.   I went to see my doctor and all lab tests are normal. There is no other diagnose reason for my continued symptoms. I wish I waited to get either the Pfizer shot or Moderna as I have not heard of these extreme and prolonged side effects from those shots.

                                                Tues. eve., after the vaccine, I got the CHILLS that lasted all night long!  I woke up (Wed.) with  NAUSEA and took the &#34;anti-nausea&#34; pills that I had left over from when I had COVID (11 - 2020).  My upper arm was now very sore, especially when I tried to lift it.  I took my temp. and I had a FEVER (101). On Thurs., my temp. went down to 99.5 and the nausea was gone.  Today (Fri.), I woke up with pain on my shoulder (over the injection site). I took Advil and iced it and it is now much better (this eve.). The only side effect I have now is the pain in my arm (mostly when I lift it). I am eating better and sleeping better now.

Medicated with Tylenol, bananas, oatmeal and herbal tea.  Documented on pdf form, but unable to use &#34;continuation page&#34;, so added sheet that unable to attach.  Will try again to upload and send separately to this.  NO forms given to me at pharmacy for reporting anything.  I called several times and left messages, but no return call.  Sent email, but response saying unable to help at this time.  Very frustrating as I continued having severe symptoms and unable to get help.  Finally feeling better enough today to send form.

                                                On Wednesday, March 10, 2021,I started having muscle pain throughout my left and right legs.  Things and calves were like walking on raw nerve ends.  I had all types of tests, x-rays, MRI?s and dr. visits to try to find the cause.  This pain continued through March 31, until  I was finally given a prescription for a steroid by my internist who believed this pain was being caused by the Johnson &amp; Johnson covid 19 vaccination because of the time frame between the vaccine I was given and when the symptoms began.  The pain while on steroids has disappeared.  I am, as of this date, on the third day of a seven day course of the steroid medication.  The pain subsided on day two of the medication.

                                                Around 5:30 pm on Friday night, I started feeling really cold; couldn&#39;t get warm for 2 hours. Then I started getting a fast heart rate; checked this around 7 pm; BP was 181/80 and heart rate was 135.  I was starting to feel warm along with being cold.  I had a gradually increasing temperature; checked it around 8:30 pm; was 102.1; took 2 tylenol and temperature slowly started going down.  My heart would not slow down; I sat in my recliner and kept deep breathing and had calming herbal tea; was afraid to go to the ER due to Covid.  After more than 4 hours with a racing heart, I felt exhausted and laid down around 12:30 a.m. and fell asleep.  I woke around 3 am with nausea and soaking wet pajamas from sweating.  I fell asleep again and woke around 7 am; I felt very tired, woozy and my heart hurt.  I felt a bit more normal after a few days.  I still feel a bit dizzy and light headed.  I was concerned when I later heard some J&amp;J vaccines were contaminated; on 4/2/21, I called the pharmacy because the number they wrote on my card, 1805D18 wasn&#39;t clear; they told me this # was incorrect and should be 037A21B and couldn&#39;t explain why this was so. They were going to check into  this and call me; I called them again on 4/5/21 and was told the correct # was 043A21A and that the vaccine was from the Netherlands.  They couldn&#39;t offer any more information or explain why the initial # was incorrect. I find this concerning and have been unable to find an answer.

After that time she has noticed a worsening of the fatigue and &#39;tiredness&#39; to the point that she can no longer perform normal activities.  She states that she is normally very active and enjoys activities like cutting the grass and other outdoor chores.  But for the last 10 days or so she has been unable to do those things and finds herself falling back asleep during the day.  She says this overwhelming feeling of tiredness seems to be getting worse.  I suggested she visit her doctor for bloodwork and she said she would do so.

At the same time it felt like my head (in notch immediately forward of middle of ear to ear)  was in a tightening vise.  Then I got hot and cold  but not severely.  Same for dizziness, very mild. I was nasusseous and not able to eat.  I had random muscles pains , none lasting more than a few minutes in any one place. Odd thing was that I felt no discomfort at sight of injection. Next day I felt just as bad but at 8:30pm I felt like throwing up (after having 2 teaspons of vegetarian vegetable soup). However, I only had dry heaves. I live by myself and started to get scared. I called my daughter and took a Tylenol at 9pm. Within 10 minutes the feeling of a vise and my aching teeth felt significantly better. but  stil very fatigued. Next day, today,  I feel much better but still a little foggy headed. I can eat. I can function normally, thank heavens. If I had to take another shot now, I wouldn&#39;t. Not even sure I&#39;ll take a booster when it comes out . It was very scarey.

                                                BLOODY NOSE; BELL&#39;S PALSY; This spontaneous report received from a patient concerned a 73 year old female patient. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included carotid surgery on 12-MAR-2021.  The patient received vaccination with JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE (covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s) (suspension for injection, route of admin intramuscular, batch number: 042A21A, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 02-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate for blood thinner. The patient reported no other symptoms or side effects after the vaccine.  Around 07-APR-2021, patient started getting Bell&#39;s palsy and went to the Emergency Room (ER) because she thought she was having a stroke. The patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. The patient followed up with primary care provided on 12-APR-2021. Patient&#39;s Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered completely but was almost gone. The patient had bloody nose on 13-APR-2021 and went to urgent care. The patient was told not to worry about it and &#39;it will probably never happen again&#39;.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from bleeding from nose, and was recovering from bell&#39;s palsy. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 73-year-old female patient experienced medically important Bell&#39;s palsy 5 days after receiving JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE (covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s) intramuscularly to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The patient&#39;s had carotid surgery 21 days prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulphate. The patient reported no other symptoms after the vaccination. She started to get Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms 5 days post vaccination and visited emergency room. She was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. Details of symptoms, diagnosis, treatment were not reported. She followed up with primary care provider 10 days post vaccination and was seen with Bell&#39;s palsy &#34;almost gone&#34;. She was recovering from Bell&#39;s palsy. The patient experienced non-serious bloody nose the next day and had recovered.  Although information is limited, as there is no confirmatory epidemiologic/biologic evidence that vaccinations cause/contribute to the development of Bell&#39;s palsy, and the most common causes include viral infection and diabetes, the event is assessed to have an indeterminate causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification for adverse events following immunization. Company causality for Bell&#39;s Palsy is considered not related to JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE.  Additional information has been requested for further assessment.

                                                5 pm on Sunday, I started getting pains on my lower leg. Not like an ache. All up and down the inside of the leg (the pain was). There was a pressure point where I found a point where if I pressed it, it was really painful. My skin - the inner leg towards the back - it was really really sensitive. If you touched it lightly it felt painful - not a searing pain. If I massaged it, it would go away but in a few minutes it would come back. I took an aspirin in case of a clot. At this time, I was thinking of deep vein thrombosis. Gradually, it went away. It lasted quite awhile - it lasted between 2 or three hours like this. Even now, the skin isn&#39;t sensitive, but I can still press that one point and it hurts. (That pressure point.) I went to the Doctor on the 13th, he sent me to an Ultrasound there wasn&#39;t a clot in the leg. That came out fine. When I had the IBS for four months (with a lot of diarrhea). I just found out yesterday that my magnesium was low and they gave me a drip for that. My potassium was a little low also. I had the magnesium drip last night - it was an Hospital ER visit - but it was for bloodwork that had been done yesterday to check me after IBS symptoms.

In the morning, her entire arm was covered in blood and her sheets wet. Her husband cleaned her up, and the next day, she did not have any bleeding.  But then the second night, again overnight, she bled heavily and woke up with her arm covered in blood and sheets wet with blood.  She also experienced leg pain so bad that she couldn&#39;t walk.  This happened after she had done some leg exercises in which she used a tension band.
