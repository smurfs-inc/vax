                                                Received a Janssen vaccination on 4/7/21 from a home visiting nurse from the County Health Department. On approximately 4/13/21, the family noticed slight signs of an issue, with patient slumping towards the right, and showing some signs of weakness on right side of body. Family contacted the PCP,  who advised to take her to the ED. Family was hesitant to do that because patient had been bedridden for past few years. She seemed to improve somewhat on 4/15/21. Then the morning of 4/16/21, the family found her on the floor of her bedroom. She appeared to have had a moderate to severe stroke. Right side of body paralyzed, cannot speak. Uncertain whether mental faculties further deteriorated. PCP ordered a hospice facility for care. Stroke likely caused by blood clot but unsure if related to JJ vaccine. She has not been evaluated in person by her health care providers.
