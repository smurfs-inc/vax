Headache and fatigue at 6:45 am got up with two children (2 yrs and 10 months) ate small breakfast by 9 am I couldn?t get off the couch or stay awake. My head started aching and my eyes hurt, I felt extreme chills two thick blankets weren?t enough to warm me. Extreme fatigue, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I fell asleep and didnt have the energy to walk to my bed until 2:30 pm.  It set off my stomach and I was vomiting off and on until around 9 pm. By then I could keep little bits of fluid and food down. Then I was hot. I felt flushed but had no fever. My usual heart rate is 52-54 bpm via Watch while laying down. My heart rate during this hot period laying in bed was 102 -101 bpm. Which is consistent for my workout heart rate. I went to sleep and woke up 7 am with my kids and was well enough to take care of them but not do all my usual chores. I couldn?t bend down or put my head lower than chest or the extreme throbbing headache was back. Still had body aches and fatigue but nowhere near yesterday. It is 11:22 pm Sunday and I feel spent.

About two hours after the fever began, extreme fatigue and muscle and joint pain, and left breast pain began (had the injection in my left arm).  The extreme fatigue lasted for about 9 hours, during which time I felt like I could barely walk or move in bed.  After the extreme fatigue passed, and for about 24 hours, I continued to experience moderate fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and headaches.  A bad headache has bothered me for about 36 hours since the extreme fatigue passed.  All symptoms are now clearing up (it is now about 42 hours post vaccination).

                                                A few seconds after vaccine was given I had a sensation go up my left jawline that felt similar to a nerve pain.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and waited the 10 minutes after my vaccine and had no other symptoms.  I left the pharmacy and started driving home and had a sudden sensation of a heaviness in my chest and trouble taking a deep breath.  I also felt like my tongue and throat were swelling slightly.  I had a warm sensation throughout the middle of my back that felt like a heating pad was on it.  I felt light-headed and called my husband.  As I continued to drive my symptoms worsened and I called 911.  I made it home in my car and the ambulance met me there.  My husband called the pharmacy to ask them what we should do and they said that it would be ok for him to give me Benadryl.  I took 15mL of liquid Benadryl shortly before the ambulance arrived.   Within 15-20 minutes, I felt like I was able to swallow better.  In the ER, I received IV Benadryl and Famotidine.  I was also given 800mg of Ibuprofen for a bad headache I developed.  My oxygen level remained in the high 90&#39;s and my symptoms were much improved after the IV medication.  I was instructed to continue taking Benadryl capsules for the next few days along with Pepcid to keep my symptoms from flaring back up.  I noticed this morning when waking up that the left side of my face as well as my throat felt odd so I took the Pepcid and Benadryl and symptoms were relieved in 30 mins or so.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the shot I started experiencing  skin sensitivity (common when I feel ill), chills, aches in my legs and a slight headache. The chills subsided after about 2 hours, but then my resting heart rate went up to 110-120 bpm rather than the normal 75-85 for me. It felt like my heart was beating out of my chest even though I was laying down in bed. That lasted through the night and I felt back to normal around mid-morning.

The day after the shot, on Tuesday 3/23 at 7:30am, about 30 minutes after waking up, I felt nausea for a brief instant and immediately the need to vomit; I then had one episode of throwing up, pretty intense. After that I felt weak and cancelled my fitness class I was going to teach in the afternoon. I spent the rest of the day resting and taking care of myself because I felt exhausted.

After no side effects, I drove away.  Only to have a sudden reaction as I was driving.  I&#39;ve felt dizzy with flu vaccines before and have felt the same symptoms as with the covid vaccine when IV dye was injected for a CT scan 5 months ago.  Felt faint/ dizzy, Got severe tachycardia, thought my heart was gonna explode.  I drove back in a hurry, scared and confused. I was waiting to be seen, and no one ever came out.  Symptoms subsided on their own after 15 min, therefore I just left without notifying anyone.  2 hours after vaccine, my arm looked moderately red and swollen, with minimal pain.  7 hours after getting the vaccine I started with chills and body aches.  8 hours after getting the vaccine I felt feverish and malaise.  After taking Tylenol with feverish symptoms (didn&#39;t check temp) slept for 2 hours and felt a little better.

                                                I felt light headedness right away. The night that I got the injection, I felt kind of drunk. I felt like I had too much alcohol. I am very sensitive to things. I felt silly - loose - tired.  In the night, I had aches and chills - no fever. The next day I felt achy and really really tired. I had a pain at the injection site. That evolved into a left side migraine (the achiness and fatigue and pain from shot) It created tension up my arm and up my neck - and I did get nausea with the headache - on Saturday. Sunday, I felt a little bit better but energy was still low - unusual tiredness; couldn&#39;t exercise as I felt a heavy fatigue. On Sunday, I went to a dance class but it was difficult as I was tired. On Monday, I felt a tiny bit better but still fatigued and did another dance class which went a little better. On Monday evening, I felt like I did the night of the injection - a little loopy and &#34;drunk like.&#34; Monday night, I woke up with a Fiery, achy, itchy, burning rash on both of my arms and the tops of my legs. If I would itch it, it would exaggerate it. When I woke up the next day - the rash went everywhere in my body - it would come and go in different places - neck, face, down and up my legs and feet and on my butt. Pretty much every spot had the rash at one time or another. It was really bad on Tuesday morning, I called the doctor. Was treated with Benadryl and cortisone cream which helped with the symptoms. Tuesday night, it was excruciating - it was all up and down my legs, arms, neck and face and stomach and rear end and feet. It was very achy, burning and itchy - very intense. It would hurt if I scratched it. Accompanied with really intense fatigue. Wednesday, after taking Benadryl, I woke up and it was a tiny bit better. It was still on my legs, neck and face. Sometimes my arms would flare up and sometimes they wouldn&#39;t. Any kind of exertion - like my dance class - would trigger the rash - so I took a break from exercising that week.  It started getting incrementally better - very slowly. Still there on Thursday - still fatigued and I was still taking Benadryl. Friday, also. Saturday, it was pretty much gone but it would threaten to come back and I felt itchiness in my legs when I went for a walk. It still feels a little lingering - my legs are itchy. I&#39;m still building back my energy. Incrementally my energy is increasing. Still not 100% there but it&#39;s getting better day by day.  Note: My history with my skin: I do get flare ups when I get bug bites and when I get poison ivy - I have very sensitive skin.

                                                In addition to the known side effects of extreme fatigue, low grade fever and body aches, I also have right arm pain at the site of injection with right arm swelling, warmth and right axilla swelling and tenderness.  The arm pain was began immediately at the time of injection and did initially lessen some for the first 12 hours until it started worsening mid-morning 22-24 hours after the injection.  Around 26 hours after the injection the arm pain worsened such that it couldn&#39;t be ignored and the axilla pain became very prominent almost worse than the arm pain.  Upon inspection I noticed obvious swelling and pain in my right axilla.  The right arm and axilla pain has persisted and worsened over the last 2 days to now include upper biceps, upper triceps, lower deltoid, trapezius, clavicular and right lateral breast pain.  The axilla and arm swelling has persisted and worsened over the last two days to now include swelling in my upper arm, around my clavicle, my upper chest and upper back.  The initial axilla swelling has not decreased any and is more prominent than any of the swelling located elsewhere.  Of note, I cannot easily palpate any axilla, clavicular or cervical lymph nodes.  If there is lymp involvement the nodes are not appearing to be extremely swollen with palpation exam.

Approximately, 5 minutes after vaccinating the patient, patient came up to the counter stating that she is dizzy and feel to the floor. We quickly went to check on the patient and patient stated she is feeling very dizzy. When asked if she can breath, she stated she is fine and the only thing is dizziness, which happened before. Patient was extremely weak and pharmacy staff helped her into the immunization room to sit and lay her head down. We got her some juice and chips, which helped the patient. Patient was resting for about 20 minutes in the immunization with another pharmacy staff. Patient was advised to report any other symptoms that may require us to call the ambulance. After about 20 minutes, pt came out of the room and sat for about 10-15 more minutes again. When asked the patient how she is feeling again, she said she is feeling normal again and that it had only happened to her once. Patient left the pharmacy in good condition.

Around 12:30 am (March 30th) (about 6 hours after receiving the Johnson and Johnson COVID) vaccine I woke up with chills, body aches all over and a headache. That along with fatigue continued for about 28 hours. I missed a day of work due to not feeling well. The following day (March 31st) I still felt tired and spacey. My headache was better. But I started having hot flashes and more minor body aches. Not as severe body aches as the previous day. April 1st I felt back to normal. I called my doctor&#39;s nurse on March 30th to ask if I could take Tylenol to help with my bad headache. She advised not to so I didn&#39;t take any Tylenol or Ibprophen.

I tried taking a warm bath, but it felt cold. Once I bundled up and got into bed, the chills wore off and transitioned almost immediately to a fever spike, which reached 103.8 at its peak at around 9-9:30p. The fever stayed at that level for about 4-5 hrs, before it started to subside, at around 3a. By 10a on April 4, my fever was down to 99.5 or so, with a headache. Today, April 2, I have no fever and only a mild headache.

The injection site and arm never hurt besides joint pain.

Continued to worsen based on dialogue with patient.  Tried to take blood pressure manually as well as with automated cuff but too low to detect.  Pt stated she felt tingly all over, hot , clammy, dizzy and was made worse by opening her eyes.  Put ice packs on neck and forehead as well as wet cloth.  Pt requested water but we declined as to not knowing severity or extent of reaction yet.  Based upon pt not improving and lack of palpable pulse decision to involve EMS was made.  Upon ems arrival 10 min later pt was taken to their transport vehicle for further evaluation.   At that time they observed vitals to be normal, monitored for additional 10-15 minutes and determined pt had adverse reaction, not allergic reaction.  Pts caregiver called us to let us know she was fine on drive home and improved rapidly en route.  Noted pt drove 2-3 hours for appointment, in convertible with temps in mid -upper 70&#39;s and noted she was possibly hot upon arrival and this could have precipitated reaction to injection.

My body was feeling heavier. I tried to sleep again and was waking up every 1 hour. In the morning, I was feeling like a truck went over me: headache, feeling tired and body pain. I was monitoring the  fever and it went away at around 6am. But I was feeling very tired the entire day and headache stopped at around 3pm. in the night, symptoms were mild. Next day (today) I&#39;m feeling better than yesterday (back to work), but not 100% - would say 80%.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

Sat down on a chair, put my head between my knees. Wasn&#39;t helping so I sat down on the floor cross-legged and put my head to the ground to try to keep myself from fainting. A medic noticed I wasn&#39;t doing well and took me to a tent on the other side of the large room to lie down. She asked if I wanted a wheelchair and I declined. I barely made it to the tent to lie down before I would have fainted. Lying down was significantly better than sitting down. After staying prone for about 20 minutes, I was doing better so I left. Immediately after walking outside and feeling cool fresh air I was much much better. Dull headache approximately 19hrs after shot that lasted half a day.  48hrs post shot had tingling and numbness in injection arm that lasted about a day. Injection arm soreness for 3 days total.

                                                Almost immediately began to experience nausea and some mild lightheadedness.   Within an hour began to feel like I had taken a sedative (reminded me of how klonopin made me feel when I was taking it for anxiety).  Sedative type feeling lasted for approximately 4 hours.  Headache developed approximately 2 hours after receiving vaccination.  Headache and nausea persisted until bedtime.  Had major issues sleeping and had night sweats all night.  Nausea is gone this morning but headache is still present.  Some mild tenderness at injection site that is still present this morning.

                                                I suddenly became lightheaded and had extreme weakness, then collapsed, then immediately began having chest pain and pressure, shortness of breath, arm numbness, and uncontrollable shaking. All of these symptoms happened at the same time. We called the paramedics but all my vitals were totally normal. The severe symptoms passed after about three hours. I continued to have chest pain and pressure, but was able to breathe normally and had 100% oxygen saturation. I am not a smoker and don&#39;t have asthma or any breathing issues so the sudden inability to breathe coupled with the other symptoms all at once was very alarming.

The next morning  15 hours after vaccine my arm started to hurt so badly I could barely move. The nerves in the injected arm running up and down with shooting and  pulsing, lack of feeling in hands and extreme pain through the the arm and shoulder on the injected side.  The pain was extreme for 13 days I lost work time. I saw several doctors who sent me on my way. My arm still hurts right now 24 days since vaccine. The pain is not extreme but the nerves still shoot pain and oils and there is often extreme pain by the end of the day.

I sat for a minute hoping it would pass, and it didn&#39;t so I asked for help.  EMT gave me pulse check and blood pressure, both were very very high (don&#39;t know what) and irregular so they brought ECG.  The ECG was also irregular.  I felt disoriented and had waves of heat/blood racing/pulse racing.  I was taken by ambulance to  Hospital.  Within 2.5 hours I was feeling better, not recovered but not as acute.  They did another ECG, still irregular and did some blood draws which seemed to satisfy the Dr.  that nothing was acute.  Once I had returned to a more normal level they released me.  Tonight at home I still have a bit of a racy clammy feeling but have felt more stable thus far.  It was an awful, scary feeling and it come on in just two or three minutes after shot.

                                                Patient had covid19 vaccine yesterday in her left arm. Today, she noted some swelling at the base of her neck on the left and it is quite tender to touch. The upper arm is only mildly tender. The vaccine was Johnson and Johnson. She has no breathing difficulties and no trouble swallowing. No fever, chills or myalgia. No chest pain.   Acute onset. Stable. She has no evidence of airway compromise or difficulty swallowing. This does not appear to be lymphadenopathy. I want her to monitor closely. Apply ice to area as directed on after visit summary. Acetaminophen for pain. If enlarges with any evidence of airway compromise at all, she must go directly to Emergency Department or call 911. I encouraged her to report this on VAERS site for adverse vaccine reaction.  As of 4/11 1:41pm pain at collarbone is same, but swelling is down a bit. Injection site is now very tender/ painful to touch.

                                                Had a sore arm within hour of shot (got it at 7:30pm). Felt a little yucky before going to bed. I made sure to hydrate significantly before the shot and after. I woke up at 3am with chills and had them for about an hour.  Woke up the next morning at 9am with with medium neck and head pain and feeling a little chilly and out of it. Mild ache in joints and body overall. At 10am I took one ibuprofen, but at 11am (200mg), kept pushing fluids. 11am headache got worse temp 98.7 (slightly high for me, I am usually about 97). Started having some gastrointestinal issues around noon. Felt nausea and sweaty palms loss of appetite. Had a bowel movement (normal in appearance).    That all seemed to pass and I felt better, still tired, for most of the afternoon. Arm was sore to the touch and when moving. I managed to eat a few small meals, kept up hydration, and took a nap late in the day. I woke up at 5pm with headache and body aches all over. No appetite again. Had very little to eat, kept hydrating,    At 7pm my vision got a little blurry and I had a minor vasovagal episode. Center of vision blurred, got chills and sweaty, nausea, and I had to poop  (it was less formed). I rested, cool compress, and raised my feet. It all passed in about 20 minutes. I had major loss of appetite rest of the night (couldn&#39;t eat anything), kept hydrating, and went to bed.  Slept through the night with no incidents.   Woke up at 9am second day and had a small breakfast, though my appetite is still not back. Generally feeling exhausted, but no headache or aches in the body anymore. My arm is still sore. Had some more GI distress (another less formed poop around 11am).   My appetite returned by early afternoon on the 2nd day post-vaccine. Still tired and generally feeling &#34;off,&#34; especially mentally. Had brain fog all afternoon and my ears felt plugged today. Hard to concentrate on a task.

                                                Seizure-like incident while at a restaurant. Eyes rolled back in to my head, according to my friend who was with me. My vision got blurry, I started feeling nauseous, shivers, cold sweats, body felt shaky, and at first I thought I had been drugged. This &#34;attack&#34; lasted for a couple of minutes. After being able to get home I was in bed until 4 pm the next day. At first I had several hours where I was freezing despite being in bed fully dressed with the heat blasting, the following hours, I was sweating. I had a headache, felt nauseous, and uncomfortable all day Saturday. My reaction to the vaccine was much worse than having Covid-19. Missed work due to the symptoms from getting the vaccone.

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving the J &amp; J vaccine, my left arm, and then left leg began to feel heavy and intermittently tingly (that was not what I consider the adverse event, but I want to give you the full context). Then approximately 40-45 minutes after the vaccine was administered, I was sitting and typing on my computer when out of the blue I felt considerable  tightness in neck. The sensation began at the base of my neck and moved upwards across my neck and rose into my head. At that point, it felt like my neck and head were in a vise. That continued while at the same time it felt like there was a great deal of pressure directly on my sinuses.  This all continued for 1-2  minutes, at which point the tightness in the necks  diminishing until I  did not feel it any long. The tightness and pressure in my head lasted another 10 minutes or so. It gradually diminished, before fully dissipating after. The entire event lasted about 12-15 minutes and was very scary, as nothing like that has ever happened to me. Once it was over, I continued to feel heaviness and intermittent tingling in my left arm and left leg for another couple of hours. By the next day the heaviness was gone, but I was a bit congested and had a headache.  I didn&#39;t know who to report this to until the J &amp; J vaccine administration was halted and it occurred to me that maybe my experience  should be documented and reported. A friend found this website for me.

In the middle of the night, I began heavily sweating (something I have never experienced).  I was drenched with sweat and needed to change in the middle of the night.   Absolutely no energy and a horrible headache.    24 hrs. after the injection I no longer had a high fever.  However, consistently for a week, every day, I had at least one symptom (headache, nausea, chills, or lack of energy) at some point throughout the day.  When I received the injection, I was on day 2 of my period.  It ended one day later than normal.  However, what was not normal was that on 4/3/21, I began to bleed again.  I passed 2 clots and had spotting for an additional 5 days.  This is in no way normal to my cycle.

Right lower leg and F&amp;A also had minor pitting, but not the pronounced swelling seen in the left.    Did self MLD massage, elevated and wore compression.  Tingling in left leg overnight and felt heavy.   Called doctor&#39;s office as soon as they opened on Day 17 post.  Saw them that afternoon.  Swelling had already gone down significantly either on its own or due to compression, elevation, and massage.   Practitioner noted pitting edema in both ankles, more pronounced in left.  It was not painful or warm, so she ordered a D-dimer test if I still had swelling over the weekend.   Since swelling continued to improve, nothing else was done.

                                                On April 8th at 4am, I woke up feeling a strong pain in my heart / esophagus region. I was alone and out of town and didn&#39;t know what to do, so I just sat in the hotel bed and waited for morning to come. I didn&#39;t know if i was having a heart attack or if it was gas from drinking soda the previous day. I went to work. At work, the left side of my tongue suddenly started swelling and a tingling and numbness set in my upper lip. I was very scared, rushed to the drugstore and bought GasX, Ricola drops (my throat was slightly sore, too) and Allegra 24 hours. I immediately took the Allegra pill but still went to the hospital. When getting to the parking of the hospital, though, the anti-allergic started kicking in and the tongue started getting back to normal, so I went back to work and didn&#39;t enter the hospital. I was ok for a while. Hours later, rashes started showing all over my body. Starting in my arms then under my breasts. On the night of the 8th, I even had fever and chills. Still, I had to go to work so it was a real nightmare. I also had diarreah. I then went to the drugstore again and also bought regular and night Advil, lots of water and electrolytes drink, Peptobismol and Benadryl (only Allegra was not enough). The following day, April 9th, the rashes started spreading all over my body, the fever was only being controlled by Advil. I flew back to Miami and was bedridden until the April the 11th. On the night of April the 11th I still woke up with very strong headache and on the 12th spent the day with a headache, but since have gotten better.

                                                On Friday after the shot, I felt ok, but my left arm was swollen to the point of taking off my wedding rings because they hurt.  The leg pain started on Friday night.  Saturday woke up with a groggy head and tired. Sunday I had leg pain, headache, and foggy brain.  Saturday into Monday I had night sweats (pouring in sweat) fever, headache, body aches, tired (could not keep my eyes open) I slept all day and could barely move comfortably.  Tuesday I was extremely exhausted, leg pain continuing, headache, and weird feeling.  The swollen arm is back.  Today is Wednesday, almost a week after with leg pain, headache, swollen arm, and weird feeling.

I felt clear headed but exhausted for the rest of the day.  My chest has been tight and congested since then. Hard to breath and my voice is rough and raspy. This is ongoing and I still have chest tightness and a raspy voice.  On 4/12/21 I started having horrible joint and muscle aches again throughout my body and felt so tired. Horrible headache and stomach pain, bloating and nausea.

                                                Severe headache about 7 hours after getting vaccine which I think was normal but about a week later my feet and hands started tingling and I?m experiencing numbness in them, almost the same sensation as when your foot falls asleep but it doesn?t go away and it?s both feet and both hands. I met with my doctor regarding something else and mentioned it and she suggested I report it and I have an upcoming appointment  to be seen for just that soon.

                                                Within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine on 3/9/21 I felt exhaustion, body aches, chills and headache. About 30 hours later I started to experience extreme leg pain/tremors, severe nausea and an unrelenting headache, lower back pain and continued chills. 6 days after receiving the vaccine (3/15/21) I tested positive for Covid-19 and the symptoms worsened. 8 days after receiving the vaccine I developed a cough and sore throat and trouble breathing. 10 days after receiving the vaccine I went to the emergency room (3/19/21) and received a chest x-ray and diagnosed with covid pneumonia and given antibiotics to treat along with a CT scan. Symptoms started to subside about 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine, although to this day I am still troubled with a lingering headache and constant fatigue. Throughout the duration I relied on Tylenol and Motrin. At the hospital I was prescribed indomethacin and ondansetron for pain and nausea.

                                                experienced a sudden pain to the forehead. Pain increased from 0-100 very rapidly, I became very nauseated to the point of having projectile vomit. Experienced blackout segments. Took 1 dose of 100mg Sumatriptan at about 930pm and tried to sleep w/the immense pain. Took 2nd dose at about 12am. Pain did not dissipate but fell asleep. When i woke up pain was gone but felt very sore, dizzy and disoriented. Fast forward to April 9th while laughing uncontrollably the right side of my face spasmed/cramped  closing my right eye and contracting my right cheek as if having Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never experienced this before. Face did not continue to droop but has left a tick/twitch sensation under my right eye.

She started getting very dizzy and her hives were moving towards her shoulders and her throat was closing up.  911 was called.  She was told her anxiety was very high.  She was transported to Hospital ER.  She was put on fluids and steroids, (methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, sodium chloride 100ml) They did blood work which showed low platelets. Her rash was bright red and spreading down her arms and her stomach while she was being monitored.  She was discharged w/ DX; Acute allergic reaction and given an EPI pen and oral steroids.  She has a FU w/PCP on 5/3/2021 to check blood platelets and will go from there.

                                                Later that day I started getting pain in the hip/groin area of my left leg preventing me from putting pressure on it or walking.  The acute pain diminshed after about 3 hr and I could walk again but the hip flexor area remained tender and felt like a sore muscle had been pulled for about 3 days.  About 5pm I developed really bad chills which lasted about 24 hrs and was really intense about the first 6hr.  About 11pm I developed a severe headache preventing me from sleeping which lasted about 9hrs.  4/10 I had occassional chills, the headache had subsided a little but had a nagging tension feeling and I was really fatigued and really wiped out the remainder of that day.  My Gynecologist advised I stopped taking my Birth Control for the next month to lower my risk of blood clots.

The following day body aches increased, numbness on the left side of my face and right lower leg, hives on my chest, neck and face, debilitating fatigue. Spoke with my PCP and treated hives with Zyrtec and Benadryl.  Hives went away quickly. After 5 days of intense body aches, they eased up. The only remaining symptom is the numbness in my face and leg. There is occasionally pain in my leg (feels like nerve pain).

I also had a headache and fever of 100-102 degrees. I was in bed for three days and I was still very fatigued for a whole week. My hands and legs were swelling off and on. I also had some shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain. I was dizzy and lightheaded. I have been very uncomfortable and unable to sleep. I still have tingling and pain in my feet. I get easily winded and I am still experiencing headaches. It has been almost three weeks. My feet and hands are still swelling and my hands are very red. I am seeing my doctor today for a breathing treatment. Everything seems to be slowly improving but the headaches are still coming and going. I have a weird feeling of bubbles all over.

Although I did not have a fever, I had temperature regulation issues all night - alternating between hot and cold - and woke up sweaty.  Headache responded to Advil in the morning but I still have a minor lingering headache a few hours later.

                                                I noticed it felt like a sinus cold coming on along with face, head and minor toothaches to the my left side of my face on the the 8th or 9th. I took Tylenol everyday for my sore arm and the headaches but it did help suppress them so I didn?t think much of it. My throat also started to feel kind of raw or itchy but I didn?t have a cough and I noticed a slight post nasal drip. Ok the 10th in the evening I felt exhausted and my face and sinuses were much worse. I took cold medicine and fell asleep early but had a hard time sleeping. I?m a side sleeper and if I turned on my left side, my ear felt like it was burning and my face would go numb. It also made me very dizzy. I woke up with body aches and light headed. My throat doesn?t hurt but it feels different. Almost numb like nothing and I can?t smell or taste.

                                                The day after the vaccination, 3/16, I noticed red irritated skin on the back of my right hand and wrist.  It did not itch or feel irritated, just noticed that it was red and thought I might have scratched it on something.  The next day, 3/17, I woke up to see that the irritated area now had blisters and I felt a burning sensation in that area.  I also noticed a few of the red patches and one blister on the underside of my right forearm.   I took Benedryl which seemed to help with the burning feeling. Today, 3/18, it now is less red, but the blisters are still present.  It does not burn and I have not taken any more medication for it.

                                                She got the vaccine she was fine, had a mild cramping in her stomach.  She wakes up at 5:00 AM in the morning for work and on Friday she could not put her feet on the ground for pain in her legs.  She also had a bad headache on the left side and took Advil for that, and then the headache switched to the right side.  She then took another Advil, and that was all she took that day and was that way the whole weekend.  She had pain all weekend and could not touch herself as the pain was so bad.  She also had chills, nauseated, her vision was going in and out as if she was at the eye doctors office.  Her uncle brought her mother over to her as she could not take care of herself or drive to take care of her cousin who she takes care of.  She went to go work on Monday 3/26/21  then she started having difficulty breathing  and her employer called the EMT&#39;s, they checked her heart rate which was high and did her oxygen level which was fine, and were afraid she may have gone into cardiac arrest, and told her to rest.  She called her doctor who told her that it was a bad reaction to the vaccine.   She is still having difficulty breathing after walking so far, she weighs 115# and has always been a small person.  She was not given any medications by her doctor and told her to rest and if it worsened to call her back.    She had been seen two weeks prior by her doctor for a sinus infection and was given an allergy shot and some other injection of which she does not know what it was, possibly a steroid.

With history of panic attacks we observed closely.  After 25 minutes, and symptoms getting worse, we decided it was best to administer epi-pen and called 911.  Symptoms got a bit better after a minute. After about 7 minutes another epi-pen was administered as symptoms were starting to get worse again.

                                                Started with chills shortly after getting the injection, which got progressively worse. At 9:30 pm, the evening of injection, chills got worse, along with a headache and muscle aches that started with my shoulders and moved quickly down my body, eventually, ending at my toes. It hurt to move, even my fingers. I took 2 regular strength Tylenol, which helped get me to sleep. I then woke up around 4 am in a puddle of sweat... I took my temp and no fever, but body aches, headache and chills were still prevalent. I spent the next day in bed without moving or eating much - drank a lot of water. Tylenol every six hours. An hour after taking Tylenol, I seemed to be well enough to not be moaning and groaning, but it wore off too quickly and I had two hours of feeling horrible before taking more Tylenol for a bit of relief. I woke Sunday morning around 5 am in another puddle of sweat and severe body aches and headache. I took more Tylenol, went back to sleep and woke around 9 am feeling groggy, but quickly realized that I was feeling 100% better! Just like that. I also had pain at the injection site that for some reason seems to be getting worse today, Sunday (April 4). I do not have swelling or redness. It just feels hot and very very sore and getting worse. Heavy and hard to lift.

This lasted through the night, for a good 6 hours.  As of 10:30am on 4/6/21 I still have a very bad headache and mild to moderate body aches and an extremely sore injection site.

I felt super tired but my body would not let me sleep. I also had muscle aches and cramps with lower back and leg with a throbbing sensation. This was within 12 hours. About 5 days later, my eye started to hurt, went to se my eye doctor and they found out I have ocular herpes. I am on now on some antiviral eye medication. I could tell after the vaccine I had a viral type infection. I still have not recovered and I will see my eye doctor tomorrow.

                                                *Fatigue:  Starting around 7pm, I started feeling tired at the time of day when I am most awake.  I experienced strong fatigue over the next couple of days, including sleeping 11 hours on 4/9.   I am still tired today, 4/10.  *Dizziness:  Late in the evening, I was very dizzy for a couple of minutes.  My head felt strange on and off throughout the night. Maybe lightheaded and definitely strange.   *Not able to complete normal daily activities because of:  Nausea, chills and hot spells: These 3 were experienced starting around 11pm.  Each symptom would come and go in waves.   I was miserable and could not sleep for very long.  I took lots of naps the next day.  Also, I was unusually forgetful.  These 3 symptoms (chills, nausea, hot spells), along with the fatigue, were so strong that I was unable to do most of my daily activities on 4/8.   I felt only about 50% functional on 4/9 and I&#39;m mostly OK today.       *Fever: none *Heart rate:  frequently elevated about 20 beats per minute from my baseline

I checked in with her 5 minutes into her wait and she said she was fine. Then she complained she was dizzy. I asked her if she had eaten yet (1230pm) and she said no. I had her sit down and drink some orange juice. She then said she wanted to lay down, so I took her back into the booth and she stretched out over a few chairs and boosted her legs up. She said her hands and arms were getting tingly and she started to panic. I took her phone and dialed her husband who was outside and told him to come in. She asked me to call 911, I did. I applied an ice pack to her forehead neck and shoulder areas and she said she was feeling better. I gave her another juice bottle an verified any meds she was on. She wasnt taking any meds. I called mngt also to take a statement. her husband came in and told her to calm down she was just anxious and didnt eat. When the paramedics finally showed up she was feeling much better. they took her out the the ambulance to check her over. They asked her if she wanted to go to the hospital, and she said no. I will call her later to check in on her.

Friday morning felt dizzy, light headed,  weak, not able to taste food (everything tasted bland), able to sleep for about 6 hours into Saturday morning.  Saturday felt more weak than previously, not able to perform simple activities without shortness of breath, dizzy, light headed, fast heartrate, no appetite, food tasted bland, very weak all day. Sunday improved a lot, more energy, no dizziness or light headed. Heartrate was still fast around 94 bpm, felt a lot better.

It passed within about 30 mins.  These dizzy spells have reoccured 4 times since then.  4/8/21 @ 2:15 am - fever of 101.8, chills, muscle spasms, extreme muscle aches all over body esp in back and legs, **unable to use my hands freely.  My hands became very ridged and I could not open or close them well.  I could not hold a glass of water to take a Tylenol. I finally did take a Benedryl and a 500 mg Tylenol.  These symptoms lasted until around 5:00 am when I dozed back off.   I woke at 7:00 am feeling tired and had a bad headache.   My back and legs were still aching but were much better.  4/8/21 all-day - fatigue, bouts of dizziness, and nausea.   4/8/21 @9:00pm - diarrhea for about 4 hours.  Stomach pain.  4/9/21 @ around 3:00 dizziness that last about 30 mins  4/10/21 throughout the day - diarrhea and stomach pain  4/11/21 - tired and headache persists.  I started to feel more normal.  4/12/21- headache still there.  Won&#39;t go away.  I feel &#34;foggy&#34; and unable to think about things as I normally do.  I returned to work today and still feel &#34;yucky&#34;. I feel as though I&#39;m recovering from the flu.

                                                About 45 minutes after I got vaccinated I started to feel a strange sensation (a kind of tingling) in the right side of my head, inner ear,  and jaw. Then about 15 minutes later I felt the sensation in the right side of my tongue. The best way I can describe it is similar to the same sensations I feel when the Novakane is wearing off after having a cavity filled. It&#39;s Monday (4/12/21) and I can still feel it a tiny bit in my right ear, where my jaw connects (right side), and my right cheek. Hopefully, it will go away when the stiffness in my shoulder goes away.  Also, during my 15 minute waiting period I had the same tingly sensation going down my arm to my fingertips, but I was told that some people experience that sensation as the vaccine moves throughout their body. Other than that I experienced the stated side effects.

That was one week ago and I&#39;m feeling a little numbness and tingling again in the same part of my face. I&#39;ve also had some bouts of forgetfulness and confusion.  Starting at roughly 11 pm on the same day as receiving the vaccine, I endured common symptoms of fever, severe chills, and body aches. I felt terrible but I knew these side effects were to be expected. I&#39;d say they were in the range of moderate-severe. The symptoms all subsided the following day around 5 pm.

I became extremely cold and shaky for over an hour. My hands were visibly shaking and my lips and teeth were chattering uncontrollably. I could not stand without feeling like I was going to pass out. I drank more water, ate popcorn and then ate three fruit bars and began feeling better after about and hour and 15 minutes. I remained shaky most of the day and experiences more dizzy spells for the following 72 hours

She was working on the graduation hooding ceremony and scribbled all over her papers like a 3 year old and the papers were strewn all over the floor. She reports that she had a mild headache all over her head dull pain and pressure 4/10. Took tylenol but that didn&#39;t help at all. Denies having any visual problems, trouble breathing or chest pain. Did have some abdominal dull cramping with nausea and even though it felt like she was going to have diarrhea there was no diarrhea or vomiting . The abdominal pain went away after friday but the nausea stayed through Sunday.She states she got lightheaded if she stood up too fast or turned her head too fast. This just happened on Friday. Denies having any weakness, lack of coordination, or speech issues. She states she was crying and could not stop all day on Friday. She told her boss she was having a mental breakdown and had to go home.  4/3/21 Saturday: Patient states she felt stupid, could not think, could not remember anything she said. States that the horrible headache came on Saturday. It was so bad she had to lay down in a dark room with a wet washcloth over her eyes. The horrible headache.lasted about 1 hour at a 10/10 level. Took some more tylenol but does not think it helped. Went to sleep and when she woke up the headache was still there at a rete of 4/10. She was still nauseate but the crying had resolved.  4/4/21 Sunday: Again, had a  severe migraine when she woke up. 7/10, not as bad as the one on Saturday. It lasted a couple of hours and then went back to the 4/10 headache that has persisted at the 3-4/10 level the entire time since she got her vaccination. The headache never stops hurting and stays 3-4/10.   4/5/21 Monday: Had a regular headache 3-4/10. Still felt &#34;loopy&#34; and with brain fog.  Went to work on Monday and told her boss about it and that she still says she can&#39;t think straight. Her boss has been very supportive and has helped her to complete her assignments to get them in on time.   4/6/21 Tuesday: Still had a  headache, It has been continuous ever since Friday. Still taking Tylenol and it doesn&#39;t seem to help. Yesterday she even tried Ibuprofen and it didn&#39;t help.   4/13/21 Today is day 13 and she still can&#39;t think straight. still has 3-4/10 headache, still all over her head. Feels that she still has brain fog, but not as &#34;loopy&#34;. Feels like she can remember what she has said better.   She called the nurse line at her husband&#39;s work.They told her that it was just a reaction to the vaccine. The patient didn&#39;t think to report it to the Health Center.  She got the vaccine from the Health Center (she asked if employees could get the vaccine and said she would prefer that)  She is not pregnant.  She has no chronic health conditions and takes no medications routinely  She denies being allergic to any medications and states she has taken the Flu shot without any reaction in the past.  NOTE: Tested positive for COVID on 2/4/21 and was told it was OK to get the vaccine. She lost her taste and smell and said she felt she had a mild flu for a couple of days. Has regained her sense of taste and smell and has had no residual symptoms.   Instructed patient to go to the ER for an exam. She needs a full neuro exam and at least a C_T scan of the head. She would like to contact her Primary Care Provider. States she hasn&#39;t seen him for a couple of years but feels like he would want to know. Instructed patient to call me with the outcome of her visit to her PCP or the ER. Patient verbalized understanding of and agreement with plan.

Everything but the soreness of the injection site and tightness in the muscles on that side lasted about 48  hours. The tight muscles and soreness lasted about a week.  *** THREE WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** Sunday, 4/12/2021 I woke up and stepped out of bed and my left ankle gave out when I stepped down. Internal rotation, weakness in left ankle. It happened again as I walked shortly after. That day I tripped many times due to weakness in that ankle. When I showered and shaved my legs I realized that I had absolutely no feeling in the left lateral part of my lower leg. It felt like I had a novocaine injection in my leg. I could not even feel a pin prick there. By Friday 4/9/2021 I started to have some sensation, but still decreased sensation and weakness in my left ankle even at this moment.  ****4 WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** My period started Monday, April 5th, 2 days early. By Friday, 4/9/2021 and through the day and night Saturday 4/10/2021, I had such a heavy period that I kept soaking through tampons, pads, and 2 pairs of jeans. I have never blead like that and could not keep up.

Woke up the a few hours later and went to work and headache came back so I kept taking Motrin until I got off. When I got home I was tired and my headache came back so I went to lay down because I was cold as well. I went to bed and woke up really cold and my husband came in to check on me and I was running a fever of 101.5. My body was hurting really bad as well I took another Motrin and went back to sleep. I woke up the next morning a little weak with a fever blister. I was still sore and has a headache as well. I took some more Motrin all day and the pain went away. I didn?t report to any doctor because I thought this may be normal.

Pharmacist was asking if the patient is okay and the patient stopped responding so the pharmacist kneeled over to pick up the patients head and she looked flushed, her eyes were bulging and she began to sweat. The pharmacist asked the technician to call 911, asked the patient if she could breathe and the patient said yes but said she is not feeling well. She kneeled back over and the pharmacist was holding her hand telling her to continue breathing. The patient was very sweaty continued to breathe heavily. About two minutes passed and the patient was expressing she was feeling better and better as the pharmacist was speaking to her. The EMTs arrived 7 minutes after the call the patient had sat up already and was speaking and feeling alert.  She expressed that she felt like she was underwater and the pharmacists voice was fading during the minutes after the shot and she felt like her heart was racing. She explained that she suffers from anxiety.  The EMTs took her blood pressure when the patient was sitting and standing up, blood pressure was in normal range and also checked her blood glucose with a finger stick which was also in normal range. The patient had mentioned previously that she biked to the pharmacy. Later on the pharmacist called to check on the patient she said that she is feeling well and biked back home.

                                                When I first got the shot I noticed it in my throat. I told the nurses they had me wait 20 minutes before I could leave. I felt dizzy but not dizzy enough to not go home. It felt like it went to my stomach, then my head, and then I could feel it in my joints.  I drove home from the city. Two hours pass, I notice a rash but I didn&#39;t think anything of it due to indoor allergens, springtime plus it went away within an hour.   I started to get chills and fever. I had a lack of sleep due to pain throughout the first night. I was waking up feeling like my head was on fire from my ears to the top of the skull area and in front of my face by my eyes too. My eyes felt like they were going to burst. I layed in bed for 24 hours.   Day two: pain, tiredness, headache, and sensitivity to light for the next few days. Symptoms come and go for days then wean off.   Next, I had issues with anxiety, sleeping, yet being really tired as well coupled with problems sitting still. These are subsiding but still there.  I am still very tired today and a bit anxious on April 13th, 2021. I also notice my typing skills, as well as testing skills, are not as sharp as before the vaccination.

                                                With prior vaccines and flu shots, I have either had no side effects or mild.  But with the COVID vaccine, I was sicker than sick!  I wasn&#39;t expecting to miss as much work as I did, nor go to the doctor three times in a week&#39;s time.  I received it around 11:30am on Thursday, March 18.  Around 1pm, my mild headache started to intensify and had ringing in my ears that would repeatedly come and go (still is doing so today, just not as frequent).  Around 4pm is when all of the &#34;normal&#34; side effects started?chills, hot flashes, sore arm, and super sleepy.  I woke up a couple hours later, with a headache that was WAY worse and was super nauseous.   This was close to 10pm.  Then, around 11pm that same night, I developed HORRID shooting ear pains and took my first Tylenol.  The ear/jaw pain was more than I could stand - had it in both ears, but the right ear was more intense.  It felt like I had a lighting rod between both ears and had these intense &#34;zings&#34; that kept going back and forth, like they were playing ping-pong.  The painful &#34;zings&#34; reminded me of those felt during an ear infection but WAY MORE INTENSE.  My jaw was super tight, as well, with a horribly intense headache.  I spent the entire night night doing warm compresses on my ears, taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours, staying in the shower, and lots of crying.  It was so bad that I felt the need to go to the ER but didn&#39;t feel comfortable driving and didn&#39;t want to go the ambulance route?and thought it was pointless because going to the ER for ear pain would leave me there for hours and hours since I didn&#39;t feel it would be viewed an an urgent emergency.  My goal was to make it through the night and see if I could get into my PCP doctor the following morning.  I took another Tylenol around 5am, and I thankfully cried myself to sleep for a couple of hours.  When I woke up, I called my PCP but couldn&#39;t get in, so I did an online doctor visit through my insurance company.  My fever was about 103.06 at its highest during the night but was gone by 3:34pm Friday afternoon (assuming because I was taking more Tylenol than I had been post-online doctor&#39;s appointment).  Around 7pm Friday evening, I knew I needed to go to the ER or urgent care.  I got a ride and was taken to urgent care for my intense ear pain.  They gave me a Toradol injection and Tramadol prescription.  By bedtime Friday night, the injection was doing its job and made the ear pain and zings were much less intense (didn&#39;t get the prescription until a couple days later).  On March 20, Saturday night, is when I developed a red, itchy rash on my back and tummy.  Over the next couple of days, it was on my chest, arms, legs?pretty much come and was in various places.  I called my PCP Monday morning (March 22), left a message, and they called me back to tell me to restart taking my Zyrtec/HCL to see if it would help the itching.  It has and am just mildly breaking out at this time.  The stinkin&#39; ear/jaw pain returned on Tuesday the 23rd, so I loaded up on OTC ear drops and made an appointment with my PCP for Wednesday, March 24.  She saw no ear infection and essentially told me to keep taking the pain meds.  I received the vaccine on March 18 and did not return to work until the following Thursday.  In retrospect, I should have just missed the remainder of that week, too.

                                                Injection given very high on left shoulder. When injection started?burning pain went through the shoulder and then followed bloodflow down left arm to fingers, back up arm, down left side of back of neck, down the back, down the back of the left leg to foot, and back up to the middle of body before the burning no longer followed a path. Upon standing, I was dizzy, and told the pharmacist, and I told her that something felt wrong. She asked me to wait outside the pharmacy, standing, for 10 minutes. I was shivering and visibly shaking. Immediately after the injection, the burning on the left side persisted for over 30 min, and was over the whole left side of my body.  I could not move my shoulder joint without a lot of pain. The pain has gotten worse each day, around the shoulder.....pain in the rest of my body has lessened.

To ease the symptoms I took Tylenol every 6 hours. 10:00am:  Started noticing hives, first on my left shin and continued to manifest in my torso/back as well as forearms.  I called my physician via telehealth and I was advised to take Benadryl as needed.  Took Benadryl twice (6 hours apart) and the hives calmed down and eventually went away during the course of the day.  March 14, 2021 1.30am:  Woke up with itchy hives on my torso and back.  Took Benadryl once again.  I called my physician and was instructed to take Cetirizine for the next couple of days (10mg at 1x per day).  Symptoms subsided.  March 23, 2021 4:00am:  Woke up with itchy hives on the left side of my torso and across my back and my groin area and upper thighs.  Called my physician once again who instructed to take Cetirizine for a course of 2 weeks.  No symptoms while taking Cetirizine.  Stopped taking Cetirizine on April 2.  April 6, 2021 6:00am. Woke up with itchy red patches (with very small bumps) in localized areas of the body (ie on my hand, on my right leg, and areas near my armpits.  These lasted a little while with intense itchiness...would subside to just having red patches, and another area of the body would manifest red itchy patches.    The above lasted several days as I wanted to see if this would go away on its own.   On April 9th, called my physician to advise of the continued itchy patches which seem to come and go in different areas.  Advised to take Cetirizine once again for another 2 weeks once a day.

                                                Immediately after the JANSSEN vaccine I felt tenderness in my jaw that lasted for about two days. My body was sore, my Legs felt like I was having cramps ?growing pains? I also was experiencing allergy/asthma like symptoms that included difficulty breathing and shortness of breath that worsened over time I couldn&#39;t speak in full sentences or laugh I was unable to walk 10 steps without gasping for air, after a couple of days of trying to maintain and cope with my theses symptoms. I couldn?t take it anymore, as I was preparing myself to go to the emergency room. I got into the shower the steam from the shower felt like it was suffocating me and I passed out my children took me out of the bathtub and rushed me to the emergency room where I was given several tests that include x-ray, CAT scan, artery bloodwork and vein bloodwork. I was being treated for asthma and given several different breathing treatments and steroids, unable to keep my stats at a decent level and the hard rebound even after continuous treatments, I was admitted because the breathing treatments were not effective. I am still uncertain of the ?actual outcome? the Hospital doctors treated me for an asthmatic episode and gave me directions how to handle my asthma i was prescribed prednisone and referred  to my primary that would then refer me to a pulmonologist and cardiologist. At the hospital I was told that there was black spots on my lungs I was told that I was being treated for infection, but then also told it could be pneumonia no certain  answer was ever given and i was given and antibiotic and was also told that I needed to see my primary for a way to maintain my asthma. The antibiotics seem to work for a couple of days and again I&#39;m back to having difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, muscle pain soreness and mild lingering headaches.

                                                Numbness starting from the injection site (upper left arm) and surrounding area, noticed about a week after the shot. Then numbness continued progressing down my upper arm, and into the front of my lower arm. This is accompanied by pins and needles kind of tingling and an intermittent heavy aching feeling along my entire left arm (picture the feeling of dental numbing wearing off).   On 4/14/2021, I noticed the numbness is now also in my left thumb.  Arm appears to function normally at this time, but worried about the increasing loss of sensation.  Went to doctor who performed a complete blood count and recommended monitoring  as she felt nothing could be immediately done.

                                                ? Acute CVA (cerebrovascular accident)  Hospital Course/test results:  Work up with MRI showed 2 small acute infarcts in R temporal lobe region, and findings which could represent subacute infarcts in L frontal lobe.  Neuro deficits now resolved.  Neurology consulting.  Suspicious for embolic phenomenon.  She does also have a IUD to treat her menorrhagia, which may predispose her to clotting.  However when we did further research Mirena IUDs were not found to raise the risk for blood clot-related heart attack and strokes but the company does recommend clinical consideration for removal in such situations. We contacted  OBGYN oncall physician and spoke to doctor today. From his recommendation is not to remove the IUD at present time because the risk is very low comparing to the higher risk of severe menorrhagia that patient had experienced in the past. Since she will have annual visit with her GYN at OBGYN, patient should have that conversation with her GYN for options.    Patient remains stable and symptoms free. Repeated brain MRI and new MRV did not reveal new findings. Her HA resolved on its own. She was initially started statin and full dose of ASA then changed to low dose ASA plus Plavix (21 days) then ASA as monotherapy after. Currently hypercoag panel is still pending. Echo showed no evidence of intracardiac shunting with fair quality and technically adequate study. Neurology recommended outpatient follow up with neurologist and 30 days heart monitor to look for Afib/flutter. Currently her headache is resolved as well R hand weakness/tingling is resolved. She is stable to go home today.    A1C is 7.3 while on Metformin (2000mg daily). She may need additional agent to get A1C &lt; 7 as outpatient.    Neuro also recommended outpatient sleep study.

My throat starts to swell, it?s hard to swallow. I start coughing profusely.  Later that evening came the chills, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea. That lasted 3 days. On day 8 I had severe pain down my arm. The same as the pain I had before I had my cervical spine fusion. On day 11 I had severe down my leg. Again the same type of pain I had before having lumbar spine surgery.  I?m on day 12 as I?m writing this.

                                                The first two days I had a normal reaction with fatigue and soreness.  On the second night I developed a severe sinus issue that caused my tongue to turn white/gray and be dry and sore.  Frequent diarrhea, headache, sore throat, soreness, low grade fever for half a day and a resulting acid reflux condition. (I have never had acid reflux before) I was tested for Covid and Strep, both negative. Continued lymph node sensitivity for two weeks.  3.5 weeks in, I developed muscle tension, unrelenting, from the back of my head all the way down my spine. I had continued chest pressure and some numbness on my left side in my arm, leg and later my face. No home remedies worked and rarely do I get back/neck/shoulder pain. I was not doing anything strenuous. I went to the ER where they tested me for blood clots (J&amp;J news had just come out and I have a family history) and prescribed valium for the muscle tension which has somewhat helped.   I fully recognize that this might be bad luck, a series of unfortunate events after I received my shot.  However, I have not been sick all year, I have never had acid reflux issues or pain like this in my neck/back/shoulders previously.  The fact that in the 4 weeks after the shot I have not had a single day where I felt normal is a red flag to me. I feel like it is worth reporting in case anyone else has had a similar experience.

Period cycle started early and was very intense cramps, heavy bleeding, vomiting. To date, the headache, dizziness, light headed, brain fog and fatigue are still being experienced 13 days after being vaccinated. I called a nurse line on 4/16/2021 to talk over my side effects and was told to visit an urgent care center, who then sent me to the ER for bloodwork and an MRI of the brain. Was told all results came back normal, to continue to monitor myself and make an appointment with a primary care physician if I feel the same in week.

                                                About 9 pm I felt fatigue, I went to bed. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol as a pain medication. I drank a bunch of water and took an Emergen-C. I fell asleep by 10:00. I slept and I woke up - shocked awake around 04:30 am - I was super thirsty. My whole body was really sore and stiff and I had a headache.  It was uncomfortable but not unmanageable. I decided to take more Tylenol and Ibuprofen and drink more water again. I got back in bed and was feeling a lot of symptoms - I was really sore in my thigh muscles, lower back, knees and forearms. I had slight chills; I was pretty uncomfortable. I couldn&#39;t get back to sleep - I couldn&#39;t sleep on my arm with the injection site. This was about 5 pm. I never actually had a fever. But just a lot of fatigue and body aches. For the next day or two - I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol every 6 hours. Within 48 hours, the body aches started to subside. I still felt a bit fatigued and I still do feel fatigued to this day. Into the next week, I started feeling like (towards the middle of the week - about the 7th) I was having an urinary urgency feeling. It was a sensation in my lower back like a UTI was coming on. I haven&#39;t gotten one in a long time ( I use to). On Friday or Saturday, when I wiped, I was seeing a slight pinkish hue  - a trace of blood - in my urine. Decided to take probiotics and Vit C. and I started to feel better. But Sunday morning, I was back to feeling pretty bad. I visited the Urgent Care on Sunday, the 11th. In the visit, they took a urine specimen. Dr. saw blood in my urine from the test. And an absence of nitrates in the urine and she said it wasn&#39;t  a typical UTI. They decided to culture the urine specimen. Macrobid - 2 times a day for 7 days - antibiotics was prescribed. I felt a little better the second day of taking it, I thought, but it was up and down. Culture showed there was no UTI.  Friday, the 16th, I had my annual visit with my PCP, I was feeling okay by this time. But I still had a sensation in my lower back - not a pain but a sensation and I still feel this sensation now (on my left side). She asked me to come back after the antibiotics to take another urine sample. Lab test. I feel some fatigue but I&#39;m doing normal daily life.

I thought it would pass but the next day things did not get any bettor so I went to the emergency room in the afternoon. Several hours and tests later I was sent home with colitis diagnosis a 10 day course of antibiotics. I still have the occasional discomfort but am feeling much better.

                                                Hi, I had the Janssen vaccine around noon time. From around before 7pm the same day evening, I started having chills and fever for two hours, I didn&#39;t do anything but just lying there and feeling really cold with a fever. Then around 9pm, the temp went up becoming a high fever and I had a severe &#34;temple ache&#34; for the next 3 hours on both sides. I felt dizzy during those hours. Then around midnight my fever slightly went down but the aches on my temple remained there. For the next 10&#43; hours, I suffered a fever and temple pain.  Until around the early afternoon the next day, I finally felt I was back to 70% normal but still weak.  But I didn&#39;t feel I was fully recovered until around the noon time the following day-- which was about 1.5 to 2 days later after my vaccination.

I went Ito the Chiropractor and I got some relief after my visit. II still had the migraine for another day after that. It seemed the same as my normal migraines but lasted longer. I was very sleepy for a week after the shot. I have not had any more since the first week after the shot.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

Went to primary who detected a drop in oxygen levels, was then sent to ER where many tests were done.  Included chest scan, to look for clots.  None were found.   Took dramamin for vertigo which helped.  Symptoms of nausea, headache, vertigo continue to persist off and on.  On Friday 4/23 I died my hair.  Within 2 minutes an allergic reaction too place: sudden nausea, some shaking, headache.  Took benedryl which help.  At this point, I have continued bouts of nausea and no appetite.  Its been close to a month and I&#39;m really scared for my health.  I was completely healthy before.

Also, my lying down heart rate was 130, which is 50-60 bpm higher than normal  April 11: A fever between 100 and 101 all day. Took a Tylenol in evening.  April 12: Fever, headache gone. Just a little tired and fatigued. Then I seemed to have been recovered.  April 21-22: Achiness, tingling pain in arms, left back, shoulders.  Then this seemed to have abated.  April 28-29: Tingling pain in arms, hands, sometime back and feet.  I have never experienced these symptoms pre-vaccine so it makes me wonder if it is related to the vaccine

As I walked out of the pharmacy to see what her reaction was her muscles tensed up and she became completely rigid and stared sliding out of her chair. By appearances it looked like she was shaving a mild seizure, with a blank stare. By the time I got her down on the floor and got her coat off to see if there was an allergic reaction to the site the patient came too and asked me why she was in the floor. At that time she was clamy but knew who she was and where she was. Paramedics were called and while they were here she stated that she was dizzy and nauseous so they ended up taking her to a location hospital to be seen. While there they drew blood as a precaution.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I felt pretty good. Just some soreness in arm and a minor headache an hour later. I took Tylenol and symptoms were bearable the rest of the day. By around 6 or 7p that night, I experienced full body pain and chills, similar to the flu. I also had some chest pain and tightness but attributed that to the overall body pain. I was also very winded and short of breath. I called my Primary Care Doctor to report this, and she said this was a normal reaction and it meant my immune system was working. It continued into the next day, and I took my temperature and had a 102 fever. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. I also had a severe headache. The next day, on Day 3, my flu symptoms were getting better; however, I felt dizzy and short of breath. I also fainted . This is the first time this has ever happened to me. I have never fainted in my life. My symptoms seemed to resolve after eating and drinking, so I figured it may have been dehydration. On Day 4, I was concerned because I was having shortness of breath and chest pain, along with dizziness. I could not take a deep breath without having pain. I called my Primary Care Doctor, and she told me she was concerned I might have covid and to go to the ER. I do not believe I have covid. No one in my household has these symptoms except for me. I believe it is from this vaccine. My chest pain/shortness of breath seemed to go away. for a bit so I did not go to ER. I&#39;m on Day 5 now, and the chest pain/shortness of breath has come back, so I decided  to report this because I do not listed on the list of common side effects for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I joined a J&amp;J social media group where others are also reporting these symptoms, so I decided to report to Vaers. I also have had night sweats every day since taking the vaccine and my blood pressure is lower since taking the vaccine.

Patient was unable to swallow fever reducers due to fever and body trembling. Physician ordered Tylenol suppositories and Benadryl 50mg for suspected allergic reaction. Suppositories brought fever down to 103 and stopped trembling so patient was able to take Benadryl 50mg orally. Fever continued but was controlled with Tylenol.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approx 7 p.m.,  I noticed moderate pain in my lower back, hips, and legs. Around 7 30, I felt very cold and began covering up with several blankets and turning up the heat. Husband and kids reported the house was not cold at all. Within 15 minutes, chills began and increased quickly to an almost violent state. I was shivering so badly, it became painful and scary. My husband added three blankets on top of our down comforter and sent me to bed. It took approx 15 minutes to warm up, stop shivering, and slow teeth chattering enough to relax and fall asleep. Awoke around 1:30am feeling incredibly thirsty and in desperate need of water. Upon standing, the pain in my body was excruciating which made it extremely difficult to walk. Finally in the kitchen, I took Ibuprofen 800mg and filled a large bottle with water. I began to feel incredibly dizzy and needed help from my husband to get to the couch. It took approximately 2 hours before I began to feel any relief from the ibuprofen. Around 6:30 a.m., about 60 to 65% of the pain had abated and I had finished around 100oz of water. The remainder of the day was spent feeling extreme fatigue and a general sense of unwell. Appetite was poor throughout entire event. This all continued into the evening until bedtime at 11pm. Experienced moderate insomnia overnight, falling asleep around 2:30am. Could not fall asleep due to constantly thinking about the stress of the previous 24&#43; hours. Upon waking this morning, I feel almost back up to 100%.

Then felt very low energy with a headache all the second day. Third day I felt great except are sore.

                                                We had a vaccine reaction today at pharmacy 1870. Patient signed up vaccine online.   I saw on her form that she had a reaction to vaccine. , and discussed the vaccine reaction with her.  She said she had hives to influenza vaccine five years ago, but had influenza vaccines every year since including 2020 without incident.        I gave her the vaccine (Janssen) and almost immediately she said she felt tingling in her arm.  I had her sit in site of my gatekeeper for the vaccines.  In less than 5 minutes, she was swelling and red in the arm and it crossed over to her chest neck and the other arm.  She asked for a benadryl tablet and we complied, but the swelling continued to get worse. We immediately called 911 and the paramedics arrived in about 5 minutes. They gave her iv benadryl and transported her to hospital for observation.  Employee followed up with patient this afternoon.  She had been released from hospital and is doing well.  She was very pleased that we called to ask about her well-being.

Continued nocturnally for 4-5 nights before beginning during daytime hours encompassing both legs &amp; both feet. Spread to left arm on day 5 &amp; then to include right arm a day later. Weakness in all limb muscles. Difficulty walking. Unable to carry heavier items, unable to lift over 5lbs with both arms, unable to move arm from plate to mouth at its worst.

                                                Fevers and shaking chills, nausea, and some dizziness  started about 7 hours after the vaccine.  I lost hearing in my left ear at about the same time.  The hearing came back a few hours later but was muffled and echoed in the left ear for about 48 hours following the vaccine.  I tried decongestant medications and tylenol without improvement in the hearing issue.  The left ear has mostly resolved at this time but the ear is popping at times with muffled hearing intermittently.   All other symptoms are resolved.

                                                Patient complained of left arm heaviness at 12:44pm. BP was 158/98 Pulse was 101 and O2 saturation was 99. No other complaints at that time. After observation period patient went to the bathroom around 1:00pm and vomited in the restroom. She returned to post vac area where BP was checked (208/124) Pulse (107), O2 saturation (98), and respirations were at 28. No blurred vision, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Due to elevated BP we elected to call EMS for further evaluation. While waiting for EMS BP was taken again at 1:30 pm and it was  170/92 and pulse and apical HR were at 96, respirations at 24, O2 Sat at 97% and pt. reported arm was less heavy but she felt a tingling sensation from her arm to her wrist. EMS arrived at 1:35 and BP was 220/120 and temp was at 97 degrees.

                                                Right away I started to feel very hot. I waited the time (15 minutes) they recomemnded to stay at pharmacy. I drove home and started to feel nausea, a light headache, and mildly dizzy. I started to get short of breath about 45 to 50 minutes after the injection. I climbed a flight of stairs and was completely winded I was having trouble catching my breath. My lymph nodes in my neck swelled up a lot and I was developing a sore throat and small bumps on roof of mouth. I called the nurses line and was directed to take a 50 mcg dose of benadryl and that if the shortness got worse to call 911 and use my epi pen.  After about 2.5 hours the breathing seemed to primarily resolve itself and resume more normally. I woke up this morning with a very sore arm, body aches, a mild headache, congested sinuses, and with a sore throat. I do feel like I am not tasting as well as normal, it could be the congestion. I do not feel great but only seem mildly winded and short of breath walking across the house.

I escorted her to a chair in the waiting area for 15 minute observation and she said she didn?t feel right and I should get her husband .  She began seizing in the chair and I held her safely during the episode.  Her husband came in and she became oriented, but still complained that her arm hurt from the injection. .  Before her vaccine I questioned her about her seizures and she said the seizures were being controlled by medicine.  After the episode when talking with the patient?s husband he said her seizures are quite frequent, the last one being  about 1 month ago.  EMT?s came to the pharmacy to monitor her before she was released to go home.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid in January 2021 and have not regained my taste or smell.  I was in bed for 2 weeks and had a prolonged fever up to 105 degrees--so high that I had visual and auditory hallucinations.  I had hair loss in the following months and I also continue to be fatigued.    I received the vaccination on 4/6/21 around 11am; a slight headache and face flushing occurred about 30 minutes after shot, but generally felt ok.  Woke up at 4am on 4/7/21 with chills, extreme joint pain, body aches, migraine headache, and a fever of 101.5 degrees.  Took Tylenol around 6am and went back to bed.  The migraine headache, chills, body aches, and extreme joint pain continued.  I was dizzy and extremely fatigued.  Woke up around 9 am and fever was at 102.7 degrees.  Joint pain and headache were almost unbearable at this point and I took a hydrocodone.  Took temperature around 12 pm and it was 103.5 degrees.  Fever continued rising to 104.4 degrees at 2:30 pm.  Took another Tylenol and went to sleep.  The next day, my fever had fallen back down to 102.5 degrees.  I continued with Tylenol to control me fever to around 101 degrees.   My fever persisted for 3 days.  I still have extreme fatigue, joint pain, burning scalp (which will likely mean more hair loss), zero appetite and weight loss, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.  The side effects are exactly how i felt when I got Covid in January.

After I arrived home, on or about  10: 45, I ate an egg sandwich and the dizzy sensation faded. However, severe fatigue set in  and by 1 PM I went to lie down.  On or about 1:30PM, I awoke with severe chills and a fever of 101.5.    The Chills lasted from about until about 3AM on April 9th.  The fever, however, went down after I took Tylenol at about 8PM.  I remained in bed on April 9th until 8AM and proceeded to work from home with fatigue and a headache that would not go away with Advil.  By April 10th the a majority of the initial symptoms abated and only a sore left arm with a slight tingling sensation remained.  On Sunday, April 11th, my right ankle started to swell and left leg had some pain (behind the knee) .   Elevated the leg and the swelling went down on the right ankle and left leg felt better after massage on the 12th.

Took 1 dose of sumatripan (100mg) for what felt like a migraine approximately 4 hours post vaccination. Vomiting 7 hours post vaccination (do not ever have vomiting with migraines in previous history). Severe headache and nausea continued through the next day though no more vomiting. After consulting with doctors office approximately 20 hours post vaccination, took 1 dose of tylenol (500mg x2) to help with headache. Tylenol dulled headache but did not eliminate. Nausea continued throughout day. Approximately 48 hours post vaccination nausea ceased and headache was mostly gone.

                                                Thursday 04/08/21 - 1:35 PM Went to Fairgrounds to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson - Janssen COVID-19 vaccine shot with my husband. Both of us wore our masks, walked in together, went through the line together, we both got the shot in our left arms and then set together and waited the 15 minutes before we could leave. A little later at home we were working on some landscape lighting and I felt a bit foggy, light headed and kind of out of it. I was drilling into masonry and the first hole went fine but the second one for some reason just wasn?t going and I touched the drill bit with my fingertip on my left hand to see if it had smoothed out and I knew in my head not to do it and that it should be hot as heck but I didn?t feel anything at all so later that evening when I took a shower my finger was burning and I knew I had burnt it. That evening I begin to feel crippling cold, my fingernail and toenail beds had turned purple and I was shivering violently. I got under a pile of blankets with my dog and  tried to slow my breathing I could feel my heart beating in my chest and it felt like the air I was breathing was cold and frosty. I had a 104&#43; fever that night. My husband got me some aspirin a cold washcloth for my head a popsicle and water to help bring down the fever. And I was able to sleep on and off that night. When I woke up I had a 103&#43; fever and a tingling and numbness in my arms. Before the fever my arms felt tight and cold and I had a tingle that ran from my elbows to my fingertips. Again it was aspirin cold washcloth and lots of water to drink to try and get my fever down.   Friday 04/09/21 Was spent in bed trying to drink water and sleep through it. My arm was sore, not at the injection site but the whole top part of my arm felt like I had been hit by a truck. I had a fever again that evening.   Saturday 04/10/21 I thankfully woke up fever free but my arms were tingling. I had to take my husband to the airport that morning at 6:30 AM. I came back home and went back to bed until about nine when I woke up my arms were cold and sore and tingling it seemed to be getting worse in my left arm and I felt shots of electricity from my elbow down to my fingertips. At one point I took a picture because my left arm hurt so much more than the right and my fingertip beds were purple on my left and pink on my right. I took aspirin and took a nap. I couldn?t hold my phone with both hands hands like normal sitting in bed because my left hand goes cold and achy. Woke up worried that both my arms were aching and tingling from my elbows to my fingertips seems to be where it stays the most. Then that pain subsided and my lip started to tingle. After a few hours that stopped but the tingling in my arms is about constant not as strong sometimes, not in both arms sometimes, it seems to almost always be in my left arm and at one point scary enough that I almost went to the ER. Went to bed around 11:30 PM and the tips of the toes on my left side were tingling and it went to the whole leg.  Sunday 04/12/21 I woke up with a coughing fit  and mucus at around 1:00AM and my right leg with a little tingly at 4:24 AM awake again and coughing woke me had to get a drink and my stomach was buzzing and stopped now just back to the bottom half of my left leg. All of a sudden after a coughing and sneezing fit I got a tremendously sore burning throat out of no where that only lasted about five minutes. I noticed my left arm straining to hold up the pizza box tonight when my right arm had no trouble at all. Then a little later in the day stiffness in the back of my neck. It is a weird strong dry cough and I was scared to go to the ER because my symptoms were so varied and ever-changing I didn?t know what they would do with me and I didn?t want to just get stuck in there for days with him not knowing or making it worse. I told my husband ? It?s so random I?m a little scared no one is going to know what to do with me...?I?ve had issues with allergic reactions and no one being able to diagnose them and me having to figure it out on my own on the Internet that I had Thyroid problems and that I was allergic to the sun for a few years in the past and aloe vera... I didn?t wanna wind up going, them not fixing anything and having a huge bill to pay. But this whole time my body is buzzing and tingling and going through something strange. At this point I am just telling my family I?m okay and what random symptoms I have had since we spoke last. They are on standby to watch my children if I need to go to the ER. The constant buzzing, numbness, cold tingling in my arms is worrisome.   Monday 04/12/21 I am use to the numbness and tingling being a constant thing on some part of my body... There are times when I feel fine but I know it won?t last long. We can add an upset stomach and diarrhea to the list. I had a metal taste in my mouth for a little bit today. Both arms legs and my lips have randomly buzzed, ached or tingled. The websites say call 911 for emergency or call your local medical provider for assistance so I called the local ER to see if they could tell me if my symptoms were normal or if it?s something I should come in for and they couldn?t give me any advice... I was told if you feel like you should come in then come in. I had a very strong sharp pain at my elbow of my right arm tonight that made me sit up in bed...   Tuesday 4/13/21 My left arm is still sore if people touch me or if I try to sleep on my side like I normally do it hurts trying to hold my phone with both hands my arm still goes cold and achy. So far this morning my arms are both tingling and my left leg and my lips so at this point I just say I?m buzzy. 11:25 AM randomly my right arm decided to feel worse for a change but is back to a low buzz... after a few minutes. I find myself holding them up or lifting them when they hurt it seems to help a little to elevate my arms to my chest. I am just waiting to see what comes out in the media, or to see if this gets any better, or if they learn what to do about it... It isnt over, it hasnt stopped yet.

After 1&#43; hour felt mostly better so left .   30 minutes into my drive home felt sudden onset of nausea, left fingers tingling &amp; numbing with save wave of extreme dizziness. Pulled onto median and called 911. My face started stiffening into a pucker like position and my muscles all through my body stiffened, but weakened with sharp tingling. I couldn&#39;t stand so they carried me out of car and took me to Hospital.   The rooms were full so I  was in wheelchair waiting for room, shaking profusely, blue fingers, nauseous, dizzy and couldn&#39;t stand on my own. I was able to go to restroom w/assistance but My muscles were stiffened for 1 hour&#43; and over and i felt awful. over the course of 5 hours I gained strength back and started to feel better with just mild headache and nausea.   They did EKG, blood panel and chest xray which looked ok. Diagnoses as allergic reaction and told me to come back if more issues.   The day after shot and every day since have had a headache at base of neck and pressure in cheek/forehead &#43; nauseau &#43; dizziness and extreme tired. Today is 14th and no headache today.

                                                I had a headache the next morning but no other symptoms initially.  Then, Saturday evening, just over 24 hours after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine I was sitting in landscape pavers outside in jeans and a long sleeve shirt next to the pool. My husband looked over and said what is wrong with your feet, they are blue. He said that is not good with circulation and you should probably talk to your doctor. Unfortunately I did not take a picture at the time and noted I was a little chilly but would reach out to my doctor if it continued and didn?t think anything more of it until I saw the reports Tuesday morning of them recommending to stop the J&amp;J vaccine.   I called my doctors office Tuesday morning and they asked me to come in over lunch to see the doctor. While sitting waiting to see the doctor my feel replicated the situation from Saturday  night. My toes were especially blue up through my ankle and the doctor pointed out I had red patches looking like a rash. She also noticed my right leg was worse and more swollen up to just below my knee. We did take pictures that we can share if prompted.

The &#34;electrical feeling occurred on the legs. This was very short and fast, not ongoing. I felt the sensation on my left leg and numbness started to occur on my left lower leg. The numbness radiated and has not gone away. There is no prickly/spider type sensation as normally felt if leg falls asleep. It is a numb feeling, similiar to loss of feeling or sensation after a surgery incision. I describe it to be anywhere 10-20% feeling gone. It is mainly on the calf below the knee. It feels wierd when clothes or anything touches the leg. No swelling, discoloration or pain. My left leg is STILL NUMB! Please contact me!

Arm started to be really sore and a tight swollen bump at injection site. Severe nausea and dizziness immediately following by 10 am and extremely tired. Now almost 9 days later the lump at injection site is still there and sore. I find this very concerning and uncomfortable.  The nausea lasted about 12 hours. The tiredness and dizziness lasted about 7 days. The bad pounding headache lasted all day followed by mild headaches throughout the week.

A week later as I was traveling I had a very bad allergic reaction that required me to call 911, as the throat swallowed. I am still experiencing leg pain when I walk. Sometimes the face feels tight also and I?m not sure this is something from the vaccine.

Started in my knees on April 9 then progressively got worse over the weekend.  Saw doctor on Monday and they prescribed meloxicam.  Went to er on Wednesday because condition wasn&#39;t getting better and was in a lot of pain and they prescribed a steroid for 6 days.  After 6 days and not feeling any better I contacted both the doctor and the er and never got a response.  Very concerned at their lack of concern.  Im not a doctor but I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t just wake up with severe arthritis after never showing any symptoms?  Really just need someone to assist me because I&#39;m not getting better and its becoming extremely debilitating

                                                At 5:30 pm, I started to have a headache, so I took some Tylenol.  I started to feel a little better.  From about 7:00 pm to about midnight, I felt awful.  I couldn&#39;t walk down a short hall without assistance.  I was so sore and achy I couldn&#39;t really sleep.  I felt insanely hot, yet had chills and I had a terrible headache.  I am type 1 diabetic, and my blood sugar spiked to over 200, where it hovered between 200 &amp; 300 most of the night, despite the fact that I used insulin to try and lower it.  From 10 pm to midnight, I felt nauseous.  Overnight was ok.  I still had some of those symptoms, but could sleep off and on.  I probably woke up every couple of hours.  I was till very sore and hot, but not as hot, and still had a headache.  Today, I took Tylenol this morning.  I still have a mild headache, sore body, tired and a little slow, but significantly better than last night.

Area has a knot in the muscle and is hot and extremely tender.

                                                I started to develop a headache and extreme fatigue about 4 hours after getting the shot. By 6pm I started getting severe chills and body aches. About 2 hours later the chills were alternating with fever and I could barely stand because I felt so weak from the muscle aches. I was in so much physical pain I didn&#39;t sleep at all that night. The fever lasted until late afternoon the next day (about 24 hrs total), and the body aches lasted until late afternoon the day after that (about 48 hrs total).

In addition to the shaking, I ran a fever of 102 F, and my heart began racing - my husband is an RN and he checked my blood pressure which was normal and my heart rate which was 122 ( normal for me is about 72). Until about 6am my heart continued to race, and even with Advil and Tylenol my fever didn?t stop until  the next morning.    The next two days I felt pretty beat up, had a headache, and have been very tired.

                                                Dizziness immediately following vaccine. Slight headache, moderate muscle aches, severe pain at injection site. It was also swollen with redness, itching, and it was hot. . Never had a fever. I immediately started taking Benadryl every 4 hours. I had really bad nausea (no vomiting)  to the point I was unable to eat and lost 7 lbs. I had really bad cold sweats so bad I was drenched with sweat multiple times a day for over a week. I ended up going to the walk in clinic about 5 days after the injection and was given Zofran for nausea.  I was also told I had a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine and any other time they would start me on steroids but they said if I took steroids it would make the vaccine not work. So I was told to continue Benadryl and deal with it.  To this day which will be two weeks tomorrow since I received the shot I still have a hard hot lump in my arm, I still break out in cold sweats, and still have a little nausea.  Never had wheezing or issues breathing though.

                                                Approximately 20-30 minutes after receiving the vaccine left arm became slightly numb, noticeable during the short 10 minute drive home. Within 30 minutes of getting home there was notable numbness in the left arm, especially below the elbow and into the hand with last two fingers being the most affected; numbness was also up into the neck and felt in the left cheek/jaw up to near the left ear and the scalp. This diminished over the course of the evening. The next two days there was lingering soreness in the left neck from where neck meets shoulder and slight tingling in the last two fingers. Ibuprofen 600 mg was taken to assist with any pain, usually in the morning with other medication before going to work. By two to three days after the vaccination there was no more soreness or numbness. While no bruising ever occurred, firm pressure on the site of injection two weeks later is still mildly painful.

STARTED TO EXPERIENCE NAUSEA, NUMBNESS AND TINGLY SENSATIONS, RASH ON ARMS, LEGS, SWELLING IN ELBOWS, KNEES, CHEST PAIN, CHILLS, SLIGHT SHORTNESS OF BREATH.  THESE SIDE EFFECTS PROGRESSED AND WERE WORSE 4 HOURS POST-VACCINATION.   THE DAY AFTER VACCINATION, AFTER REGISTERING WITH V-SAFE, A REPRESENTATIVE CALLED A.C.  AND TOLD HER TO TAKE 75 MG DIPHENHYDRAMINE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT A.C.  WAS HAVING A MODERATE REACTION TO THE VACCINE (A.C. DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANAPHYLAXIS).  MOST OF THESE ADVERSE REACTIONS IMPROVED AFTER TAKING THE DIPHENHYDRAMINE.   TODAY, 2 DAYS POST-VACCINATION, A.C.  IS NO LONGER HAVING ANY SIDE EFFECTS AND IS RECOVERED.

Parked the car. Car was in park but still running. Attendant at the clinic instructed me to move my car forward. I put the car in ?Drive? and as I moved forward I lost consciousness. Completely blacked out. Foot released off brake and unconscious in the car, the car rolled for some distance and crashed in a parked car. I was revived once someone tried to wake me up. I was white and delirious and had no idea what had happened.  Presently have no smell and have been very tired with the chills. I was sweating in my sleep, shivering and woke up in a wet bed from all my sweat. The next day my arm is extremely sore and I am running low grade fever. If the car attendant did not tell me to move my car I would have blacked out in a stationary car and not cause damage to someone else?s car. This has caused nearly $7000 in damages to my car not to mention the other car.

I was dizzy, but almost more feeling like my thoughts were jumbled and I had a hard time speaking. I began to get a terrible headache and then began vomiting. I was shaking and out of breath. I was terrified because this was something I had never felt before. The symptoms began to fade within 4 hours and then I experienced the &#34;normal&#34; side effects, such as arm pain and tiredness.

                                                Within 5 minutes of shot I was nauseous on scale of 1-5 1 being hardly and 5 being Extremely I was 4. This remained at a 4 for over 36 hours. By 930 pm approximately 12 hours after shot I was running a Very high fever and had EXTREME chills, body aches, latharic and my arm hurt bad. There was no discoloration or swelling in the arm however. I expected these side effects but they were so much worse then expected or discribed. My husband had same effects. We are both very healthy and active young adults. This felt like a SEVERE 24 hour flu. Not, &#34;flu-like&#34;. I would be very afraid of we had ANY underlying health conditions. Also my heart had a cramping burning pain that came and went. No fluttering, it felt like the muscle was contracting around my heart or the actual heart was contracting and staying contracted for about 5 minutes at a time. This occured only to me and happened about 3-4 times withing the first 24 hours with the first experience while I was at the pharmacy being monitored for the 15 minute post shot. I have no known underlying heart issues and have never been diagnosed with any heart problems or been seen for any such issue. But it was real and it was scary.   I took 1, 500mg tylenol at 930pm the day of the shot for the fever and aches.  I took 1, 500mg tylenol at 9am the fallowing morning, as I was still experiencing aches and a low fever. It has been 48hours and I am still feeling lathargic. But more as expected.

Ended up leaving work a little over 2 hours after I started.  I was feeling nausea, achy, chills, fatigue, dizziness/lightheaded, sore arm.  Went home and to bed.  Still fatigued, sore arm and a little achy the next day.  Now on day 4 since vaccine and am still experiencing a sore arm &amp; fatigue(improving but not back to my normal energy level).  On a positive note my ongoing sinus symptoms(since June 2020) have improved.  They are not gone but noticeably improved.  I&#39;m thankful for that and hoping it lasts!!!!

Arms, thighs, lower back and neck were all sore when moved. Throughout the next 12 hours symptoms increased in strength and spread to entire muscle system and joints of arms and hips. Throughout the 12 hours I also experienced alternating periods of chills and overheating as well as a migraine. I used an electric heating pad to warm various areas (feet, legs, arms, neck) from hours 30 to 33. I also used tylenol rapid release 500mg at 19 hours and then again at 43 hours. At 43 hours felt symptoms retreating to feel similar to 19 hours in. By 53 hours only slight tenderness in muscles remained. Muscle tenderness was gone at around 70 hours.

                                                I had the normal reactions fatigue, fever, and body aches within 8 hours of the vaccine. However on 4/12/21 I woke up feeling extremely itchy. I broke out in hives  and whelps on the front of my neck and chest. It spread across my jaw as well by the end of the day. I was extremely hot and my skin felt like it was on fire. My head was extremely itchy. I took a Benadryl which did help the hives/whelps to clear a little after two doses bower I am still extremely itchy. I can?t stop itching. It?s everywhere to. Legs, arms, back head, shoulders...just everywhere, but no more hives. It is very frustrating.  This doesn?t appear to be reported as a side effect and I?m very concerned.

Numbness and tingling in left foot and leg as well within 10 minutes. Started to move to hands and arms and went to the ER. Tingling and numbness in face at 20 minutes. Treated with IV steroids and benedryl, no effect. Did bloodwork and showed hypocalcemia. They gave me an oral calcium supplement, tingling and numbness did not subside until next day. Intermittent tingling and numbness in legs continuing to present, 3 weeks post injection. Bloodwork by PCP on 3/30/21 showed normal calcium and protein levels but decreased GFR and low vitamin D despite regular supplementation of 6000 IU/day.

                                                On Wednesday April 7  started to feel like she was getting a cold. Because her husband tested positive for Covid  April 6 and her daughter&#39;s were showing symptoms, she and her daughters were tested. All of their tests were positive. So her first positive test was April  7th  which was a PCR but was taking long to come back so she got a rapid test on April 9th and that was positive as well. She had cold like symptoms, a low grade fever that never went above 100.0 and cough for about 5 days.  She felt tightness in her chest but no shortness of breath and her pulse ox was 98-99. She took Tylenol every 6 hours as needed.  The cough and fever resolved after about 4 days but the nasal congestion is severe and very uncomfortable.  She also has a burning sensation of nose and no taste or smell. She is also very fatigued but able to maintain ADL&#39;s and care for her family.

I broke out in buckets of night sweats.  The following 2 days I was generally fatigued and had sniffles.  After that I was fine, until Monday night (Day 10). I suddenly experienced a sudden onset of a painful and raised red rash at the base of my spine on my lower back. Within hours it migrated up to my head, face and then to the front of my torso. My eyes and throat closed. I took benadryl with no relief.  I called Dr. on Demand and they urged me if the symptoms got worse to head to urgent care/ER.  The next day (Tuesday 4.13) I went to the ER where they gave me a steroid shot, and prescribed me predisone and Prilosec to block the histimines.  I am still having rash symptoms,itchiness and burning.  While I have a history of seasonal allergies they&#39;ve always been stuffy nose at the most. We had no new dietary introductions or new habits.

There was an immediate suspicion that I may have blood clotting even being on Eliquis or bleeding in my brain. A brain cat scan and other tests were performed. I was discharged from the hospital the same day.  I am past a monthly the Janssen vaccine now and still have left leg cramps and headaches. My body feels weak and is restless.

As the day went on, started feeling more soreness and headache. By 7 pm that night, I was extremely fatigued and nauseated. Pain very bad in my arm that night to where I could not sleep. Each day that has gone on, I have had worsening fatigue, headaches, and an increase in my heart rate, and a decrease in my blood pressure. I&#39;ve had an increase in brain fog and an increase in sleep issues. The pain in my arm went away after 4 or 5 days.

This began the day after the vaccine (4/9). By the afternoon of 4/12, it was feeling more intense. That&#39;s when I realized I had a skin irritation on my lower back and stomach. I went to my doctor and it was diagnosed as shingles.   My doctor said it was not caused by the vaccine but a stress reaction to the vaccine &#43; normal stress in my life.

Pt reported she awoke from sleep late 4/7/21 early 4/8/21 with severe pain in her left leg. She reported it hurt so bad she was &#34;screaming&#34;. She stated it felt like a &#34;charley horse&#34; and her husband noted a knot in her leg. She went to the ER on 4/8/21 due to the inability to put pressure on her leg and/or walk on her leg. She reports having a CT scan of her chest at the ER and no clots were noted. She stated they did not image her leg at that time and scheduled an ultrasound/doppler for around 4/27. She was prescribed some oral blood thinner, but could not recall the name. She stated she stopped the blood thinner on 4/12/21 after the new reports regarding the J &amp; J vaccine and not using blood thinners to treat. Today she states her leg is purple, black and blue and is swelling more when she is up on it at work. RN instructed pt to call her primary provider regarding stopping the blood thinner and to see if re-evaluation of her leg is needed. Pt also instructed to seek emergency treatment for increased swelling or pain to her leg, headache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns. Pt plans to speak with or see her primary provider today.

                                                Received the J&amp;J Covid Vaccine shoot on Sunday, April 11th at the  Clinic. The night of receiving my shot, I had a migraine and neck pain which resulted in trouble sleeping.  When I got up in the morning, I started having severe muscle pain in my thighs and in my calf, mild cramps in the abdomen.  The leg pain lasted the entire day with exhaustion, which interfered with my ability to work a full day.  When I went to bed later that night, I still had pain behind my left knee and I was worried about if there was a blood clot.  I got up the next morning and my legs were still cramping but improved from the prior day.  When I saw the news discussing the blood clot issue associated with the J&amp;J vaccine, I felt it was important to contact my Dr. to discuss the leg pain.  They did an ultrasound (vascular scan) on my left leg and follow up with my doctor&#39;s office walk-in clinic after the scan.  My legs were examined and no clots were identified.  We discussed things to watch for.

                                                Patient reports: &#34;I received my covid 19 vaccine on Friday April 9th (J&amp;J) and need to report my reactions afterward. Had the usual immediate arm pain after injection along with nausea. Took a Benadryl and napped when got home and woke up 6 hours after injection with a tingling and swollen lower lip and constricted breathing. Took 3 Benadryl in fear of going to hospital and waited it out. Once lip went back to normal as well as breathing went to bed since it was late and slept all day Saturday. Woke up Sunday in agony from lower back pain and tailbone. Now, thurs 4/15 still in extreme pain in my tailbone. Went twice to chiropractor to help and nothing is alleviating the pain and have been practically bed ridden since Sunday. Can?t work, can?t sit, can?t walk can?t stand can?t anything without extreme pain. Been taking ibuprofen everyday and not helping.&#34;   She had a visit with us on 4/15/2021: &#34;Patient here for extreme pain on her tailbone. She had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine about 6 days ago and about 6 hours later she woke up with a tingling and swollen lip, constricted breathing, and dizziness. She wanted to avoid the hospital, so she took benadryl 75 mg and it slowly resolved her symptoms. These symptoms have not returned since. She was finally able to fall asleep that night and then slept all day the next day. The following day she woke up and experienced extreme pain in her lower back and tailbone. She saw her chiropractor twice this past week, which helped to resolve her low back pain. Per patient her chiropractor noted that her back seemed very inflamed. However, she is still having extreme pain with her tailbone and is unable to sit, stand, bend or work for more than 20 minutes without extreme pain. The only thing that seems to improve her pain is laying on her back with several pillows tucked behind and all around her. However, she is only able to stay in this position for a period of time before her body becomes stiff from immobility. She has been taking ibuprofen 600 mg TID, flexeril PRN, icing and applying moist heat to her back, but none of these measures seem to improve her pain. Lastly she has noticed that when she sits/stands for too long, her buttocks start to spasm. Denies fever, chills, n/v, numbness, tingling, incontinence or loss of bowel/bladder function.&#34;

I felt ok the next day, just a little strange (hard to pinpoint issue ... but &#34;off&#34;). Took another 2-pill dose of Tylenol just in case.

                                                On 4/10 I got the J&amp;J shot at Medical Center at 8am.  12 hours later at 8pm I experienced the normal side effects - body aches, tired, arm pain.  I slept it off and the next day felt better - took a nap, but no problems.  8 days later on Sunday (4/18) I started to get a headache, on the top of my head (where a hat would go) and the back of my head.  It was on / off, but it&#39;s out of character as I don&#39;t normally get headaches.  On Monday, it continued on/off so I wrote my doctor...on Tuesday it continued more &#34;on&#34; then off - she recommended I go get bloodwork for low platelets and I did (at medical center). They came back normal.   On Wednesday (4/21), the headache became a migrane and was screaming at me - all day with no relief.  I&#39;ve never had a migrane in my life and needed to be in low light - screen time became hard to deal with.  I did get a Covid Test to rule out that and it came back negative Thursday morning.  Thursday morning - same....screaming headache.    Friday, less screaming but still not great - I met with my doctor on telehealth and she recommended I go to the ER to get evaluated.   I went to another hospital on Friday afternoon to get evaluated.   Since my bloodwork from Tuesday was all clear - they believe the migrane was inflammation from my immune response to the vaccine - especially because i never had a migrane before.  They gave me anti-inflammatory meds via IV to mellow out the pain.  They said if the pain came back or if I had other symptoms in the coming week to check back and likely need imaging.    Today is Saturday (4/24) - the anti-inflammatory meds have helped but not 100%.  I do still have some throb on/off and had a few dizzy feelings earlier.

Wed 4/14/21 - Sharp pain in pelvis (right and left side) same location I experienced pain the day of receiving vaccine.  Occasionally felt this pain 2 or 3 times / day for 2 days.  Sought medical attention at ED on the advice of our Nurse Call Center.  Was evaluated for blood clots, none found on this day.  CT scan, ultrasound of both legs, blood tests.  Returned home with directions to take Extra Strength Tylenol for headache. Thu 4/15/21 - Shooting pain in random parts of my body, mostly legs and arms.  Experienced throughout this day only. As of 4/27/21, 22 days after being vaccinated, I am still experiencing headaches.  More noticeable when I am exerting myself - walking outside for 1-2 minutes triggers the headache.  Headaches are usually located in the lower back of my head.  Before being vaccinated, I would experience less than 1 headache per month, and they go away within the day.

The bruises usually lasted a week and a half. I was getting different bruises at different times on my legs. They were not painful but at night when I lay down my legs were a little numb.

That night I ran a fever of 102 and had horrible chills and nausea. The next day these were gone but I had a horrible headache that even Tylenol wouldn?t get rid of. The second day these symptoms had stopped.

Couldn&#39;t walk was shaking so much.  Speaking was difficult.  Breath was labored.  It was so scary my husband called the doctor.  Shook violently with teeth chattering for 45 minutes then would break for a few minutes before shaking again.  The shaking was probably 60 minutes total.  Then fever set in.  Fever hit 102.4 at 6:15pm.  102.9 at 6:40pm.  103.8 at 8:15pm.  Fever ranged between 102.3 and 103.8 for 8 hours after starting then finally broke 1:45am (8 1/2 hours after the shaking started).  Was able to get out of bed 8:00am today.  Massive headache for the morning but no fever today.  26 1/2 hours post vaccine new and I just feel very tired and drained.

I sat on the floor and started vomiting. I kept gagging nonstop for several minutes. During that time I urinated on myself, I felt strong stomach aches, headache, and my body felt extremely fatigued.  I was dizzy and sweating. All these symptoms came back again a few minutes later. I do not remember how long everything lasted. I woke up the next day with a slightly upset stomach and headache.

Left Arm immediately felt odd---sore, heavy, tingly all the way down to my wrist.  By noon, I was asleep.  Slept for about 3 hours.  Up for 3 hours.  Slept for 3.  Up for 3.  Then slept all night.   I had a headache and slept most of the next day.  Definitely felt like my body was fighting something.     I have an approximately 3 inch diameter circle around injection site that is a red, swollen, hard, lump,  It is hot to the touch and extremely sore---at times it itches.  I am shocked how big and hard the knot is.  Its crazy!  I cannot put weight on that arm.  Extremely sore.  It is now 4 days after the vaccine and the knot does not seem to be getting smaller.  In fact, it may be bigger.

                                                13 hours after the vaccine, I experienced intense headache, body aches, and nausea.  I vomited violently 3 hours after the onset of symptoms.  I took 400 mg of ibuprofen and was able to sleep.  The following day I had intense body aches and extreme exhaustion all day long.  I managed it through doses of ibuprofen.  I was able to sleep all night the following night with some NyQuil.  The second day, I woke up feeling still a little weak and tired, but the body aches have subsided significantly.  It&#39;s nothing crazy, but it felt like I should report so there is more information for the researchers and public.  I did have COVID March/April 2020.  I had body aches, fatigue, chest tightness, loss of taste and smell, but NO FEVER.  It was undiagnosed at the time (no fever), but in October 2020, I gave blood and I did have COVID antibodies.  I gave again in January 2021 and I still had the COVID antibodies.  I received the vaccine March 10.  Thank you!

I said I wanted to give her benadryl and patient refused. Sat with patient and she reported no changes, just felt different and tingled a little. Patient stated that it did not feel like allergic reactions she has had in the past. Checked tongue and lips for swelling, no sign of anything like that or other signs of anaphylaxis. By the end of allotted 30 min waiting period, patient said she felt normal again. She stayed in the store for another 30 minutes and reported back that she was fine.

                                                Around 7 pm on 3/13, I developed brain fog, trouble walking, and then fever, severe muscle pain worse in legs, and chills.  Most of these symptoms seemed to improve on 3/14, but then on 3/15, I developed new onset of shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  On 3/16 around 1 pm the shortness of breath worsened and I went to the emergency room.  I felt that I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath in and I had chest discomfort on the left side of my chest worse when taking a deep breath.  My legs were hurting as well, especially my left leg.  I had sinus tachycardia (heart rate 106-120) and increased respiratory rate (rate of 20)  with O2 sats 100% on room air.   My breathing and heart rate improved somewhat with 1 liter oxygen therapy, 1 liter of IV fluids, albuterol inhaler, and decadron 6 mg orally.  It was thought that I had a delayed asthmatic/allergic reaction to the vaccine.  I do not have a history of asthma.  I was prescribed a Medrol dose pack and albuterol inhaler.  My hands and feet are very cold and tingling on 3/18.  Shortness of breath and chest pain seems to have improved but not completely gone as of the time of this submission on 3/18.

                                                My left arm started hurting on Friday  March 19 and is still hurting. I can not sleep on the left side since getting the vaccine. It hurts to move the arm different ways. Many times, I have to lay flat to  get relief from the pain. I don&#39;t have alot of strength in my left arm since getting the vaccine. I consulted the school nurse about my effects and she stated it could be an inflamed nerve.

                                                Left foot became tingly as if it had fallen asleep starting at around 8:00 pm the evening of the injection. I was sitting on the couch with my legs outstretched and crossed at the ankle in front of me. I thought it was because I had my legs crossed. I uncrossed them. The feeling did not go away. It is now the next day and the feeling is still present. I sit this way often and have never had this happen before. I assume it is due to the vaccine.  It is extremely weird to feel pins and needles constantly in your foot.

                                                As soon as the shot was administered in the deltoid muscle within 3 seconds my axillary node was on fire and I couldn&#39;t put my arm at rest.  Extremely painful in my armpit.  The injection nurse said that is not normal and gave me a sheet to report to the CDC scan code.  My entire left arm was on fire within a minute.  She had me sit for 30 minutes.  I had no other reaction.  My arm was subsiding a little bit to toleration.  I went home and rested, drank a ton of water.  I went to bed and woke up at 2 am in a cold sweat, I felt like I was freezing and could not stop shaking.  My teeth chattered.  My husband put on many blankets and helped me get warm.  He said I was burning up.  My muscles were so weak and painful, joints hurt and extreme head ache.  I took some Advil and he warmed me up.  My left arm was numb up my left side of my neck and my left cheek.  I took the day off work.  In addition, in the morning I felt like my left leg and foot had minor numbness and prickles.  I could walk but it was colder and prickled on the foot each step.  The next day I was 50% better and made it to work barely.  It took me 3 days to recover from the flu like symptoms.   My left arm continued to feel numb and had bouts of prickles and tingling.  The muscles were hard to use in my left arm and I really didn&#39;t use it at all.  Over the course of 2 weeks things have improved.  I still have not recovered feeling in my left pinky and ring finger.  They are weaker still today.  Every morning my left arm is numb for a little while (I don&#39;t sleep on my left side) but recovers to about 75% except my pinky and ring finger.  My left neck and cheek have a warming prickle feeling every morning for about a half hour.  They mostly wake up to entirety.  My L foot at the bottom has period/episodic prickles.   Daily my left arm is colder and is weaker than before.  I am a high school teacher so I don&#39;t have to use my left arm very much but it is causing pain and negative sensations and is reducing the amount of use of my left arm.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA:  Immediately after the vaccination my arm was sore and shortly after my right hand was stiff.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccination I began to have extreme chills and a fever that was near 102 F.  I had a fever and chills all night and woke up with a migraine.  After sleeping most the day from extreme tiredness I woke up to my head feeling very weird and I was acting very sleepy and irritable according to those around me.  After 24 hours, most  reactions have gone away except for soreness at the injection site and a pain in my right leg.

Around 3-4 hours later is when the real symptoms began. First, an extremely rapid heartbeat. My left arm began to feel numb. And I was seized by an episode of extraordinary fatigue. 6 hours after the shot, I was having muscle and joint pain to the point that I felt like I was being stabbed with knives - particularly in my tailbone, ankles, and shoulders. High fever followed, uncontrollable chills and shivering, intestinal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal cramps. The following day I had a headache and continuing extreme fatigue as well as pain in both arms.

                                                The patient called today complaining of pain, primarily in her legs, that had not improved since receiving the Janssen vaccine on 4/10. She thought it felt muscular but wasn&#39;t sure. The pain was affecting her ability to work today. I advised her to contact her primary care dr&#39;s office or go to urgent care. She called back after seeing her dr today - the dr recommended ibuprofen for pain and said she had a &#34;strong reaction&#34; to the vaccine. According to the patient, no further concerns were identified.

Sensitive to light and noise. No over counter headache medicine was helping. Same night, a painful blue line, (like varicose vein) formed in left calf. On Tuesday, April 13, 2021 went to Dr. office who agreed that these reactions are a concern and went to Hospital.

It felt odd but no other symptoms.  I was at the grocery store and while reading the label of a mustard jar I inadvertently dropped it which was also odd.   This was 2 days ago and at the time it seemed like a harmless mild side effect but now that I see incidence I&#39;m reporting it.

Tuesday the raised hard bump has a slight peak similar to a mosquito bite and is becoming itchy. Today/Wednesday there has been no decrease in symptoms.

I called the neighbor for help. I couldn&#39;t communicate, my body was shaking, trembling, I stuttered as I was trying to form words. I was taken to hospital by ambulance. I was unable to speak, I was shaking and my blood pressure went up and down. I was given IV fluids and Ativan for anxiety, dysarthria and altered mental state.  As of 04/14 I have memory loss, loss of taste and appetite, extreme fatigue

                                                Around 06:00 pm, which was about 9 hours after having received the J&amp;J vaccine, I began having a slight fever and chills.  The most pain I had was in the back of my legs.  Both of my calves felt as if they had both been kicked and were badly bruised.  It was painful to walk for about 48 hours/2 days (Sunday - Monday).  That was the first time in my life that I had that kind of pain in my back calves.  Never had before from running or walking.  Then around 09:00 pm on Tuesday, a reddish dot appeared on the left side of my cheek.  I thought it was just a big zit.  But the following day, the dot got bigger, and looked like a scratch.  On Wednesday, it was definitely a scratch-like shape (2 lines, less than an inch long) and had begun to feel itchy.  That was when I had realized that it had the same pus-like dotted features of a cold sore.  But oddly, it&#39;s not right next to either side of my lips.  Instead, it is further down, towards the left side of my chin.  It is very rare for me to get cold sores.  I can&#39;t remember when my last one was, as it was years ago.  So I am wondering if this cold sore is due to having received the vaccine.  The fever, chills, and leg pain have not returned after those first 2 days.

                                                My arm was immediately sore and was sore for a week.  Within a few hours from the vaccine being administered I was tired, hands and feet very cold, chills, headache and a fever.   This lasted for 3 days.  I was and am still fatigued and it has been 2 weeks since my vaccine.  On Friday, April 9, 2021  (8 days after vaccine) I woke up with a sore throat and a swollen gland in my neck on the right side (side of my injection).  The sore throat and my swollen gland is starting to subside on Day 14.  Throughout these whole 14 days I have had hot and cold &#34;flashes&#34; and while I already have anxiety my anxiety has been much worse (feeling of a pounding heart) since the vaccine.  It is not my normal anxiety.  On Day 11, Tuesday April 13, 2021 I woke up with a black spot on the right side of my chin closer to my bottom lip.  It does not hurt, not raised and it is just a black spot.  It is still there on Day 14 and slowly starting to fade but not by much.

                                                Three days after the vaccine I started to get a feeling of pressure on my chest. I woke up during the night because it was hard to breath. I had leg  pain in both my sides.  The leg pain lasted three days. I took it easy for the next two days. I called the doctor and she advised me to go to the ER. I was given an EKG and Chest X-Ray and blood work. I still have the feeling of pressure on your chest after two and a half weeks. It is a similar feeling to when I had the Covid-19 in October of 2020. It is not any better or worse than when it started.

Day five, I broke out in a full body rash - Saturday evening. It started on  the right arm and it spread all over my body. It lasted off and on for thirty-six hours. It migrated over my body. I went to the ER, and they said I was having a reaction to the vaccine. She prescribed me steroids, I didn&#39;t take them because I was hoping the rash would get better without them. I went to my Dr. the next day - by the time I did see my doctor the rash was getting better so she said I didn&#39;t have to take the steroids. I was taking Benadryl from the time the rash started and continued until it was gone. The rash ended on day 7. Once the rash went away, I had fatigue for four days.

These symptoms persisted and my doctor advised me to go to the ER for brain imaging 24 hours after the vaccine. On day 3 after the vaccine, my symptoms had diminished but not subsided and I began to have new symptoms: extreme heat and pressure starting at my right ear and spreading through my face and head. The heat has subsided but not the pressure, as I am writing this it is day 13. Tests came back normal, but weakness and pressure neurological symptoms persist.

                                                The day I received the Janssen vaccine, I had pain at the injection site immediately, which was to be expected. My arm was very sore for over a week. I felt ill at dinnertime but was able to eat. Around 10:30 PM I started to feel like my skin was on fire. It was hot to the touch as well. However, I was freezing and couldn&#39;t get warm. My teeth were chattering. I started crying uncontrollably. I have never had tears run so hard down my face. The tears felt like they were burning my skin because my skin felt so hot. I awoke my husband to help me. He wanted to take me to the Emergency Room, but I wanted to wait. My muscles ached terribly. I had to pace back and forth because of the intense pain. My head also felt like it was going to blow off of my body. It wasn&#39;t like a normal headache. It felt like I had swelling in my brain. The left side of my head was sore for days afterwards. I then became terribly nauseated. I didn&#39;t throw up but felt like I was going to. I also felt extremely dehydrated. I was able to drink some water. It was a very long night. Looking back, I probably should have gone to the ER. My husband worked from home the next day so he could be available if needed. It took a long time for me to fully recover. I woke up exhausted and struggled with fatigue for a while and had extreme exhaustion in the evenings. My ears would turn bright red in the evenings and feel hot to the touch. I still have some fatigue now but am mostly better.

Denied and did not exhibit signs of urticaria, angioedema, cough, dyspnea, wheezing, CP, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, weakness, pallor, tachycardia. Discussed giving her diphenhydramine and she agreed stating she had no previous adverse reaction to this treatment. At 5:56 pm, I gave diphenhydramine HCL 50 mg/ml 1 ml IM in her right deltoid muscle. Around the time of the injection (approximately 5:59 pm, pulse was 76, oxygen saturation 97%, BP 138/90, lungs clear, heart RRR. Within 20 minutes (6:22 pm) of diphenhydramine injection, she reported that the tingling had largely subsided (only remaining in lower legs) and her pruritis was improving. Her pulse was 77, oxygen saturation 96%, and BP 126/82 at that time. She also reported she had not developed any new symptoms (see above). By 6:28 pm, she reported no further tingling nor pruritis and feeling well. We released her at that time as we deemed her recovered from the symptoms. We advised her to call 9-1-1 if the symptoms returned especially with one or more of the above symptoms she had twice denied experiencing. 3/9/21 11:47 a.m. Called to check on status. No answer.

                                                My injection was on a Monday at 1pm. I had no issues for about a day and a half. On Wednesday afternoon I started having itching and redness on my forearms and top of both hands. Both arms on Wednesday evening were swollen, quite red and sore (a bit of a burning sensation). It almost feels like a bad sunburn at times. I took an antihistamine to help with the itching and swelling and this morning actually put calamine lotion on my arms to help soothe the burning feeling. It is more irritating that painful and nothing needing medical attention but I thought it should be reported.

                                                A bumpy itchy rash started first in my arms and after in wrists and hands so i took 2mg of betamethasone and after 45 minutes another tablet of 1 mg. After 2,5 hours the rash calmed down on the upper part but it started on legs, tighs and foot. I was on fire and to have a bit of relief i put a wet cloth on the skin and i took another tablet of 1 mg of betamethasone and 1 of benadryl allergy. Around 11 pm the rash stopped and the skin became normal. I slept with no problem, but the next morning after 20 minutes I woke up the rash started again in all the body so I took 2 mg of betamethasone and 1 benadryl allergy. I went to the vaccination center but there wasn&#39;t any doctor, only a nurse that told me to keep on taking antisthamine and corticosteroids.  It calmed down around 12 am and started again in the late afternoon.I took a benadryl, i used the wet cloth and around 10 pm stopped. Night with no problem, but around 9.30am the rash started again so i took 1 mg of betamethasone and 1 benadryl. Around 1 pm calmed down and at 2pm i took 2 benadryl. Around 8 pm i had some itchy spot on the legs but it didnt turn out in rash. Today after 30 minutes i woke up i had some spots on the legs, i took a benadryl and after 1 hour disappeared.

I didn&#39;t take my temperature. Another thing that happened was the tip of my right middle finger went numb for a few hours. I noticed this around 7pm the day I got the shot. This numbness has never happened to me before. My fever lasted until the morning after I got my shot. Fatigue lasted into the second day after the shot.

                                                So I reacted pretty severely to the vaccine. It&#39;s almost been 24 hours now, and my symptoms are almost gone. I had, in this order, compounded, with the peak happening about 12 hours afterwards: immediate dizziness about 10 minutes after the shot, nausea started about 30 min, at 4 hours a strong headache that didn?t go away until now, took Tylenol at 7pm, stiffness in the joints, hands, and feet started about 6 hours of shot, at 8 hours pain in the shoulders and neck, at 12 hours cramping all down my back and my hips and low fever. Fever continued until around 6am despite taking more tilt at 2am. Finally got to sleep at 6am. Woke with remaining stiffness and headache at 7:30am. Nausea continued for another 6 hours. Headache continued for another 6 hours. Muscles remained sore due to severe cramping last night.

Dr ordered ultrasound of site. Determined 2 lymph nodes were enlarged. Prescribed cephalexin 500 mg 2 times a day for 10 days, ibuprofen and warm compresses.

When I got up the next day, I had a horrible migraine and I felt like I had COVID again. The migraine continued and I went to the doctor on Thursday. I took Tylenol, but it only provided like 2 hours of relief. It didn&#39;t resolve the pain, but it did lessen it. My doctor told me to try an OTC med first, so I tried Extra Strength Excedrin and it went away. The first day that I didn&#39;t have a headache was exactly a week later. I&#39;m not sure if they will return, but you&#39;re fine right now.

                                                I had burning with the actual injection.  It burned as it went in and went down a small ways into my left arm.  The rest of the day I had the normal symptoms- Pounding headache, nausea, horrible body aches (couldn?t lay down or stand to be comfortable).  That night around 11:45pm I got up to let my dog in and I started seeing small black dots- blurry vision.  I felt nauseas.  I ended up falling on the floor.  I was able to get up.  I then ended up waking up in the bathroom on the floor and had no idea how I had gotten there.  My hands were vibrating.  I called my husband from work to come help me up.  I was able to sleep and didn?t seek medical attention.  I am not sure if it was low blood pressure or what could have happened I have never experienced that before.  I did contact my doctor?s office this afternoon via (online) but haven?t had a response yet.  I have been in bed all day today.  - Body aches, nausea, pounding headache

Called again at 4:41p and patient said she now had a headache, nausea, chills, hot but no fever.

                                                9pm - 7 hours after receiving the shot I was extremely itchy all over and took Benadryl  2am- I woke up unable to move my arms, hands, legs, and feet. I wasn?t able to wake my husband and remained as calm as possible. I drifted in and out of sleep. By 4am I was able to wake my husband. He used our elevating bed to sit me up and gave me ibuprofen and water through a straw (not sure why that was his solution and just thankful I?m here today to type this response). By 6am I had terrible shooting pains in my hands, fingers and then Charlie horses in my feet and calves. That is when the ability to move came back. At that point I was extremely fatigued and exhausted and felt like I had a terrible flu. I was in bed for the next 6 hours clammy and  sweaty and in a very achy.  24 hours after the vaccine I was back on my feet.  50 some hours after the vaccine I still have an aching in my hip on my left side and tenderness at the injection site.

                                                Event took place at an off-site event, in a detention facility. Pt received Janssen COVID vaccine around 4:00 pm. Pt immediately reported nausea. Nurse accompanied pt to the restroom about 2 minutes after receiving vaccine, where she gagged into the sink and spit up a little clear fluid. Pt reported feeling hot and sat down in a chair available in the restroom. Pt and nurse joined by a second nurse. Shortly after sitting down pt complained of feeling dizzy and was moved to the floor to lay down. When laying down, pt appeared flushed under her chin and complained of chest tightness. She requested to sit up to help with breathing. Called 911 and first dose of epinephrine (0.5 mL of 1mg/1mL) administered, both at 4:10 pm. Pt reported no change in chest tightness following epi, but continued to respond to questions. She said she felt tired and wanted to go to sleep. Pt continued to report difficulty breathing, and another dose of epinephrine administered at 4:15 pm. A physician at GEO arrived and administered oxygen. He listened to pt&#39;s heart and lungs and reported that there was air movement in her lungs. Pt ceased to respond coherently to questions, slurring and moaning, but did not lose consciousness. Pt started tapping her lips and, upon questioning, said they felt numb. Third dose of epinephrine administered at 4:20 pm. Nurse continued to jostle patient and ask her questions, and patient continued to respond with short, slurred answers. EMS arrived at 4:23 pm and transported patient to the hospital.

If I move my arm a certain way, I will get a tingling shock in the area (feels like hitting funny bone). Muscles up and down arm burn after non-strenuous activity.

I was laid on the pharmacy floor immediately after reactions with a cold pack under my neck and my feet elevated. Within 5 minutes I was able to open my eyes and able to stand. I left with some dizziness and a headache that remained for a few days. I also had severe body aches for a couple of days and fatigue. Only thing is the arm pain and a little tiredness today.

                                                Visited ER as I thought I was having an allergic reaction. Treated with Pepcid, prescribed prednisone and streeted. Visited personal allergy physician 4/9/21. per MD Allergist/Immunologist DXd = systemic immunological vasculitis. Most probably a delayed hyper immune response to my vaccine. Legs, arms and sides covered in innumerable petechial eruptions beginning 6 days post vaccination and 3 days post vaccination side effects (chills, headache nausea) subsided. Eruptions spread consistently for 36 hours and are constant not intermittent. They are hot, painful to the touch, and do not blanch. I?m on 60mgs of prednisone for 5 days (the highest dose given outside a hospital) and then 40 for 5 days and then 20 for 4 days. If I get any mouth nose or eye or interior genital irritation I have to go to the hospital and be admitted for higher dose steroids and constant monitoring. Dr advised  this  will take weeks to resolve and the eruptions will likely fade slowly and possibly peel.

I walked down my hall and saw black dots and felt dizzy with nausea.  The next thing I knew I was on the bathroom floor and didn?t remember how I had gotten there.  It is Friday and I now am experiencing shooting pains in the side of my head.  I also have been experiencing pains in my calf muscles and some chest pains.  I am still extremely tired and having abdominal pain.  I have contacted my doctor?s office about the fainting but I am going to call Monday to get an appointment to get checked out.  I am concerned about possible blood clots.

                                                Starting  the day following the vaccine, I had shooting pain (nerve pain) in all of my limbs? both arms and legs. It has been more severe in my legs. The only time I experienced any similar pain was several years ago when I had shingles, except that pain was isolated to one side of my body and only in my arm. This pain is exactly like that except it is bilateral and is happening in arms and legs. I did also have the standard muscle ache post-vaccine, but this shooting pain is in addition to it. The nerve pain peaked about 32 hours post-vaccine and has persisted in my legs through today, which is 4 days post-vaccine. I have only self-medicated with ibuprofen or acedomenophen, which reduces but does not eliminate the pain. No signs of this pre-vaccine. Was feeling totally healthy? to the extent that I exercise daily and ran a half marathon a month ago.

That mostly resolved after 2 days.  Then 1 week later on Saturday, I started having pain in my left leg where I had had RFA of the greater saphenous vein 6 months prior.  Leg swelled up got a hard knot.  I got dizzy &amp; nauseated.  The pain increased, &amp; I went to the ER on 3/21.  They diagnosed it as thrombophlebitis.  The pain &amp; inflammation  has continued  for 3 weeks now despite the use of anti-inflammatory meds &amp; support hose.  I have also had rapid weight gain of 12 lbs and edema not relieved by lasix.  Two weeks after the shot I also started having severe nose bleeds.

I stayed in bed for a couple of hours. At 5am I got up with all the same symptoms and took my temp which was 101.4. My head hurt like there was too much pressure in my skull. I ate toast and took some ibuprofen and went back to bed. These symptoms lasted for 10 hours. Then for the next 5 hours I just had a fever off and on and fatigue. 3 days after the shot the gland in my left armpit became swollen. It has gone down in size but still sore 5 days later. I still feel tired too.

                                                Johnson and Jonson vaccine given in my left arm.  Within 5 minutes I passed out cold.  When I came too I almost passed out again.  The strange thing was that I was having a hard time not passing out for at least 10 minutes after this shot.  I have never experienced this before.  I had no energy for the rest of the night.  By the next day I had a fever and felt like i had the flu for over 24 hours.  My husband did as well but he did not pass out.

It came on slowly but by 930 that evening I was shaking uncontrollably for about 3 hours with chills and severe joint pain. My headache grew worse and lingered for several days after as well.  I still have a mild headache today (4/13/21) and feel lethargic and almost foggy.

Ran fever of 101.3 overnight. Next morning, vomiting occurred, I belive due to the excessive pain caused by headache. Was extremely nauseous and tired on day following vaccine. Fever dropped, but headache and nausea persisted until about day 4 following vaccine.

                                                I received the vaccine at approx 930 am, Wed, March 17 (Johnson and Johnson Lot 1805020) at the Facility by Fireman(Emergency Responders). Vaccine was from Health Care. At first, after about 15 minutes I was feeling a little flush, there were light red splotches on my skin (only a couple, very light red - like when i get really nervous and get red splotches on my neck.) I felt a little nauseous and dizzy off an on for about an hour (but i had not had anything to eat or drink yet that day either). The site of the shot was a little sore and warm about an inch or two away from the needle injection site, but not a big deal. That night my right arm (which is where i received the shot) ached terribly, all the way from my shoulder to my fingers. The next day (Thursday, March 18) was the same. Sometimes my left arm tingled like it was starting to fall asleep. This went on the whole next day. Injection site still sore too, and warm.  The day after that (Friday, March 19) the injection site was sore (like a sore muscle) and that was it. Saturday, March 20, the same until about midnight. Around midnight my son, and I came upstairs from watching tv and my arm (at my wrist) was aching intensly! I looked down and there was a small lump where one if the veins are. I can see my veins easily here and I am very light-skinned. Son could also see the lump. My arm kept aching so badly! I was messaging the lump over and over. After about 5-10 minutes it went down a little bit, ached a little less, and i left it alone. The next day it looked like i had a bruise on my wrist and hand (where the meaty part of your hand is  going to the thumb. The next day, Sunday, March 20th, a neighbor said it could be a blood clot and i took an aspirin.    Today, Wednesday, April 14, 2021.   Approx 1130am, after getting out of bed, getting some coffee. I was sitting at my desk in my home office, took my medication and took my first sip of coffee. All of a sudden, my chest starting hurting. I cant say where the pain originated, it was in the chest/upper stomach area. It ached a lot, I felt very flush, I honestly cant remember if it were hard to breath, all i could think is &#34;what is this?&#34;. I didn&#39;t know if i would throw up, burp, pass out. the aches starting migrating, still saying in the chest, but expanding to my lower back. I got out of my chair and tried to move around...it took a good 3-5 minutes before it started to dissipate and I took another aspirin.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, patient experienced central vision loss or &#34;white out&#34; vision as she described it. She could still see things in the periphery, but her central vision went completely blank. This lasted for four to five hours and over time her symptoms gradually improved. She still has some double vision and difficulty focusing. Of note, she saw the eye doctor last month and had her prescription updated but has not picked up her new glasses. She only wears her glasses for driving and occasionally at work. She has chronic headaches and has not had any new/different headaches than before. No weakness, but her right leg did feel heavier than normal after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I developed a significant headache and nausea.    Approximately one hour later if I was in the sun I became overheated, flush and an overall feeling of nervousness,  I adapted to these symptoms knowing they would considered normal but I no longer feel these should be considered normal.  Around 7pm on Monday I started running a fever that started at 101.1.  Between Monday night and Thursday morning it bounced around but stayed between 101.1 and 103.2.  It did not go away completely until Thursday morning.  At least I hope it is gone for good.  On Wednesday around 10am I developed abdominal pain that by 4pm had me sitting by my car unable to continue for about 10 minutes.  It was extremely stressful and still to the time of this report is still has not completely gone away.  The most concerning for me is the back pain with it.  At the time of this report I still have a headache, nausea, abdominal pain with back pain and vertigo.  I have contacted my doctor&#39;s office and they have made notes but suggested I report everything here.  They have started me on baby aspirin and electrolytes as I am also experiencing interment diarrhea.

Then I got the chills and bundled up. And then the body aches started really bad. I could barely walk to the bathroom. I went to bed. The next morning I called in to work and stayed in bed all day. I could barely wake long enough to go to the bathroom and still body aches bad. I slept till about 8pm. When I ate and went back to bed.

                                                The first side effect I noticed was hives on the arm of the injection site as well as the arm being painful. I became light headed and very tired after the first hour of getting the vaccine. As the evening progressed I begin to get chills and a fever. My body ached from head to toe. I was nauseous and achy all over.  I was feeling sick for the next 24 hours, I stayed in bed and could barley move because my body ached so bad. I had a extreme head ache as well.  By the 3rd day I felt much better and only had pain in the arm of the injection site. After day 10 I noticed a lump near my collar bone and assumed based on web searching that it may be a swollen lymph node.  It&#39;s day 12 and I still have a little tenderness near the injection site and my lymph node is still swollen.

                                                Severe R shoulder/arm pain since injection.  Upon receiveing the injection I experienced severe pain in my R shoulder joint, but the nurse told me that was normal.  Over the following hours/days/weeks the pain began to radiate up my neck, down my arm and into my scapula and lat areas.  My range of motion (ROM) had become severely limited and I began to experience neuropathies in my right arm and hand.  I tried all OTC pain relievers which had absolutely no effect.  On April 6th, I was in so much pain that I went to an urgent care clinic.  They provided me with prednisone, soma and celebrex (upon completion of steroid).  In addition, I started myself on gabapentin which was provided in the past.  I have one more day of celebrex remaining.   While my symptoms are not nearly as bad as they were, they have not resolved.  I continue to have pain in/around my R shoulder, neuropathy in my R arm and limited ROM/weakness cross-body and above 90 degrees.

Pt was lowered to the floor and placed in trendelenburg.  BP 132/71, HR 93, 98% on RA.  BP 10 minutes later with pt lying down dropped to 83/49, HR 52 and 99% on RA.  Each time we attempted to have pt sit up, Pt would begin to have tingling in extremities and ringing in ears.  EMS called.  BP eventually raised to 127/66 with pt sitting upright but EMS preferred to transport pt to Hospital. Pt evaluated in ED and notes indicate that EKG was done and revealed normal sinus rhythm. Determined to be vasovagal reaction leading to syncope. Pt discharged to home in stable condition.

                                                Not too many adverse symptoms the day of and after vaccine... tired at times and sensitivity to light but continued to eat and helped w energy.   Also, warm left side of neck and slight red rash.  Not expecting to have leg pain in my calf 6 days later then moved to quad muscle and entire left leg felt achy.  CDC at this point said to check out any leg pain.  Pain was not severe but bothersome... had STAT ultra sound at ER on day 7, turned out negative for blood clots.  Returned to my physicians office day 8... still not feeling right with more of a rash on left side of neck and warm to the touch. Tired and slightly light headed and slight pain in left upper chest.  Digestion not the best starting day 5 thru 10.  Blood test returned normal for platelet levels but low eosinophils... either allergies or body is fighting the vaccine and creating antibodies (most likely).  No known allergies besides maybe skin reaction to Timothy Bluegrass.  Moderate headache day 9 and 10 which made me more fatigued (pain on both sides of head above ears and temples)... normally I do not get headaches.  Also, loss of appetite or feeling slight nauseous on day 8, 9, and 10 after the vaccine.   Now on day 11 and 12.. feeling better but still not quite right.  Lightheaded and feeling fullness in head but more energy than day 9 and 10 by far.  Never heard of people having symptoms after day 1 or 2 of the vaccine, so obviously I think this should be more documented for patients especially after blood clotting as a possibility 6 days after the vaccine.

                                                I had the vaccine n Sunday, Tuesday morning I woke up with a very tight feeling across my chest/ rib cage area, particularly on my right side, underarm, under breast area. I also had some weakness in my left arm where the shot was given. The tightness in my chest was not affecting my ability to breath, I was able to go on my usual daily hour-long walk but it was concerning me enough for a call with a Dr. I had spent the day before (Monday) using a wood pellet BBQ so I though maybe the issue was related to smoke. The Dr prescribed a salbutamol inhaler which I have used before for seasonal allergies but that didn&#39;t really d anything to help with the tight feeling. The feeling of tightness remained all week (and still does to some extent 11 days later).  On the Friday I noticed a small dark spot, approx 2mm,  a bit like a blood blister on the back of my right thigh. I have had these before fairly infrequently, and I see a dermatologist once a year for a check up and they are not concerned, and they usually go away on their own. But, the combination of a new blood spot and the continued tight feeling across my chest had me concerned enough to call my regular Dr&#39;s office.  I was also feeling occasional sporadic aches in my legs in varying places. I spoke to a practice nurse who was very reassuring that she had spoken to many other patients that had also been experiencing chest tightness that had gone on for days after the Janssen vaccine, so after that I felt less concerned about the symptoms. I am still experiencing the tightness in my chest which has affected my shoulders and neck with what feels like muscle tension, and also been accompanied by some mild headaches at the sides of my head. I was pretty anxious about getting the vaccine which is not something I usually struggle with and on the Tuesday after the vaccine I felt particularly irrational and also very tired.

                                                At 3:00 pm the day after I received the Johnson&amp;Johnson COVID-19 vaccine I developed a red, raised, swollen, hot, painful circle 5&#39;&#39; in diameter on my left arm under the injection site. My arm is hot to touch, swollen, and still painful the next day and the circle has spread more and has started to turn purple.

I could hardly move and felt an ache in all my muscles and bones.  It was very intense pain.  The entire next day I had severe body pain and severe fatigue.  I tried to go for a short walk and felt dizzy.  Everything hurt.  I took Tylenol regularly all day and mostly slept.  48 hours later I was feeling better.  Slowly regaining stamina and pain is now diminising.

Woke up around 7 am feeling better. Mild heat flashes until about noon. Felt fine the rest of the day. On Thursday 3/25 around 6pm I started developing hives, itching and red rashes on bilateral lower legs. Thighs, knees, feet and ankles. I waited several hours to see if it would go away and it did not. By 10:30 pm it was much worse. I took a 25mg Benadryl tab. Rash went away. On Friday 3/26 rash and hives, itching and red rashes returned. Both kneecaps very red and hot. It mainly stayed on lower legs until about 5 pm. The rash then started on bilateral arms. I took another Benadryl at 6pm. It is currently 7pm.

About 2.5 hours after my injection I noticed numbness starting at the tip of my toes on my left foot. By 5 hours after same on my right. At 24 hours it was up to the base of the toes. Now 2 days after I have numbness to the balls of my feet. I also have numbness around the injection site. Although this is fairly normal for me. Typically lasts about 3-7 days of progression with 1-2 weeks to resolve. So far the pace is spot on for my history. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Fingertips still feel like electricity is running through them and fingers/hands still hurt; extremely hungry/thirsty from 03/25/2021 - 03/29/2021; fatigue, pain at base of skull under ears, tinnitus extremely loud and both ears feel like ear ache; During the night of my high fever, lower back where kidneys are started hurting very badly.  What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

(Same side as the injection). It passed within a couple of hours but I am still experiencing some mild twitching on my left cheek. It&#39;s more annoying than anything but wanted to report it since the vaccine is still in trial.

                                                From 330 until 1030 pm I FELT great, no soreness by injection sight, no signs at all of any side effects BUT by 1030 pm, 7 hours after the shot I was ICE cold, teeth chattering, and could not get warm at all. NO FEVER but major body aches and soreness. AFter the chills wore off I was in a sweat..this pattern of chills, vs soaking sweats continued throughout the night. Add to that dry heaves due to nausea but no vomiting. The dry heaves just added to the muscle pains that I already had. I was in bed until 5 pm the next day, no energy, sore body aches to the point that my skin hurt. still no soreness in my arm at all. I finally had the strength to get out of bed at 5pm took a shower and ate 2 pieces of toast to combat the nausea. Fast forward next day, felt fine and arm was mildly sore at injection sight. SO glad J and J is only one dose.. I would have dreaded a second day like that.

Dizziness lasted for a few minutes which created nausea. Sat at site for approximately 25 minutes after shot. Left arm was sore between shoulder and elbow, which was to be expected. Later in the evening, experienced fatigue. When trying to go to bed around 11pm,  my left are was throbbing. I did take Tylenol at about 6pm. Throughout the AM hours, sever body aches started, extreme fatigue throughout the following day. Flu like symptoms continued the next day.  I had heard of these symptoms for the other shots but not for Johnson and Johnson. Hungry but too weak to actually cook.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 1:08 pm.  Once administered I was instructed to sit in the auditorium for 15 minutes for observation.  During that time I had a few heartrate increases and nausea but nothing out of the ordinary or concerning.  After the 15 minutes, I walked out to my car and thankfully my husband had driven because what happened next would have caused an accident.  Our drive home is approximately 20 minutes from where vaccine was administered.  In the car I began to feel a tingling all over my body that gradually began to feel like ?pins and needles? (like when you sit on your legs for too long and they ?fall asleep?), with the worst of the feeling being in both of my hands. I began opening and closing my fingers to try and get them to feel normal.  By the time we pulled into the driveway, my hand had locked up in a weird position and I was no longer able to communicate with them and make them move.  They were temporarily paralyzed.  My husband opened the door for me because I wasn?t capable of doing so.  Once I stepped out of the car, my body began to convulse and shake.  We stood there for a few minutes because one, I couldn?t make my body cooperate and two, we didn?t want our children seeing me that way.  My husband kept asking me if he should call an ambulance.  Of course, he should have but I think he was so scared and shocked that he just didn?t know how to react.  I had trouble forming words and sentences at that point and could not tell him to call. I felt pretty calm considering what was happening to me and I could not control myself.  My husband decided to walk away from me and coerce me to go to him.  I stood there for a few minutes trying to communicate with my legs.  Once I took my first step, my body stopped shaking and I started to regain feeling in my hands.  I went and laid down for a bit and began to feel a bit better.  Around 7pm I was feeling extremely cold.  So cold that I put on three layers of clothing and two comforters to try and warm myself.  That did not work though, as it was more of a cold from nerve endings than it was from temperature.  I went to bed around 9pm but didn?t fall asleep until around midnight.  I was feeling waves of cold down my body. Like a skin prickling when you hear a beautiful song and you get goosebumps and your hairs stand up.  I woke around 3am to an extreme headache and a fever of 102.6.  I took Tylenol and went back to bed.  When I woke in the morning, I felt better but had weird and random muscle twitching.  For the past few days I?ve been suffering with extreme fatigue which is not like me at all.  Even when I?m tired, I can still manage to function throughout the day.  Not only have I been tired, my body is weak, my muscles are weak and my joints hurt. I?m hoping this ends soon and doesn?t get any worse. It will be two weeks this Sunday.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I was vaccinated on Tuesday, 4/6--on Wednesday, I had the typical side effects of a sore arm, fatigue and muscle aches. On Thursday, 4/8, my arm was less sore and my fatigue and muscle aches were almost gone, however, I woke up with chest congestion and a cough. No fever but the coughs were painful--it almost felt like I had bronchitis. Nothing dire--I can breathe fine, no fever, I don&#39;t feel sick, but I just have this deep cough. When I looked up the side effects, I didn&#39;t see cough or chest congestion so I thought I would report it. Today is Friday, 4/9 and my cough seems to be getting better, although it&#39;s still there and I don&#39;t feel 100% yet.

                                                Shot at 12:18 Friday afternoon.  One hour later increased pain in neck where my cervical issue is a current problem. Around 7:30pm overwhelming fatigue and the beginning of chills and the start of low grade pain in joints throughout my body.  I took my medications and was in bed by 8pm. Over the course of the next 6 hours, The chills increased, sweating, fever 99.5, the feeling of my muscles and tendons tightening up and I would have to repeatedly stretch to relieve the accompanying pain, extreme thirst, nausea - at one point vomiting bile. The pain in my joints was around a 7 on pain scale. I could not get comfortable and was writhing from side to side. Around 2am I took a 2nd Hydrocodone for the pain. At 10am  I finally took Nurtec for the massive migraine.  At 11:30am (about 23 hours after injection) the headache was relieved, the joint pain had significantly decreased. My neck still ached. I was very fatigued and it was with effort to move from the bed to the couch. I slept on and off throughout the remainder of the day.  I had no appetite but forced myself to eat yogurt with fruit. It is now 11:44am Sunday. I still have no appetite. With exception of some mild fatigue and loss of appetite, all other symptoms have improved.

                                                About five minutes after receiving the vaccine I began to feel something was terribly wrong. I then blackout for several minutes. From my son&#39;s description I believe I might of had a seizure. He said my eyes were wide open, I was slumped over, and gurgling. I was completely unresponsive to him. He summoned the paramedics who loaded me in an ambulance soon after I came to. They checked my vitals. My heart rate was 47 bpm and blood pressure was 80/40. They also checked my blood sugar. It was 116. They decided I needed to go to the hospital and began giving me iv fluids in route. At the hospital an EKG was taken, which came out normal, they continued iv fluids, and did a urinalysis on me. All test indicated I was healthy. It about three hours before my blood pressure and heart rate stabilized. Just as long for me to feel like I would be ok. They discharged me at this point. Since they I have just been extra tired and have had muscle discomfort.

They didn?t happen before the vaccine but I can?t verify they are occurring from the vaccine.

                                                I had the J&amp;J vaccine on 4/1/21.   I have a history of blood clots. I have tested positive twice. Once back in 2001 when I was pregnant and later on around 2008. I have had these symptoms before, but since I have a rare bone disease and have medical issues I really don&#39;t like to complain and just deal with this stuff with the pain pills I have a prescription for.   Anyway, yesterday I was feeling a little off. My hands, feet and limbs in general tingling. I had a headache which is rare for me and tried to drink extra water, but by 5pmish came I took a handful of tylenol since I had an after work walk to go on with a girlfriend. After the walk I came home and had a desire to lay down and go to sleep. my leg was starting to go from tingle to burn. i decided that i needed to eat some dinner. after dinner i was struggling with breathing while sitting in the recliner chair watching TV, so I told my other half I needed to lay down, this was around 7pm. Then it was just a crazy leg burn from the back of my knee into my foot. I was describing it as if I someone pour gasoline on me and lite the match and I was burning alive. I took a muscle relaxer and forced myself to sleep.   The day after the J&amp;J shot. i had chills and was so cold that mid day when I had breaks during my work from home, i climbed in bed with a heating pad to warm up. the shot also left a scare on my arm, which i found odd since i give myself six injections a week for my bone disease.   I tested positive with Covid December 20th, 2020 and it was a rough first week, but after about 10 days I was pretty much back to walking around and feeling better.    You&#39;re more than welcome to have all of my medical record information, just let me know what you need.   My doctor switched over to a different portal that I don&#39;t have access to and I haven&#39;t talked to her or her office since I had covid back in December and it&#39;s still a few hours before her office opens to report this, but I saw this on the news.   My leg is still tingling and stiff.  Again this is not my first time going through this, so I usually just push through it, but since I saw the news I am reporting it.

The johnson and johnson shot made me feel dizzy and I got so stiff that I could not walk. I was shuffling my feet to get anywhere. I would fall all on my bad and then gradually move my self by holding onto the head bead to actually get in the bed. This lasted 2 days and I had stopped taking the antibiotic because I felt so ill from the shot. I then began vomiting. My entire body hurt it felt like every cell in my body was transforming and the pain was unreal I was so weak I couldn?t open a water bottle

                                                I received the shot in my left arm and experienced the expected symptoms of a sore arm and tenderness at the injection site the day of the shot and the day after.  Yet on the third day when symptoms were supposed to be getting better, I developed severe pain in my upper left  shoulder and across the back of my neck into the middle of my back.   My collar bone area on both sides was also sore.  I did nothing physically to explain this additional pain.  It was so uncomfortable that I spent most of day  3 and 4 after the shot laying around while taking Tylenol around the clock.   The worst of the pain was gone by day 5     but I continued to have discomfort in my left shoulder for almost another full week so much that if I wore a bra, I would have to take it off half way through  the day because it caused so much discomfort with the strap on my shoulder.  Everything feels ok now  that it has been 3 weeks since my vaccine but the muscle pain and discomfort was very painful and unpleasant way past the listed side effects of the vaccine.

As injection was being administered I felt pain on inside upper arm down to wrist. Pain subsided. Day progressed. I used my arm to grocery shop. About 6:30 -7:00pm I noticed stiffness and inability to lift arm with extreme pain in attempts to lift arm. During the night had restless sleep. Had to use other hand to move arm into resting positions. No comfortable position.  Saw general practitioner on 4/12/2021. Received a paper with physical therapy exercises. Today, 4/13/2021, Still extreme pain to stretch arm to side and in front.

Chest tightness and heart racing ? Simply felt I was going to die ? of course I didn?t but it was the worse feeling in life worst than flu symptoms

I tried to drive to the ER but stopped at urgent care since they were closest.  They found that along wit my breathing issues my BP was also running higher than normal.  I was given a steroid to get my breathing and BP under control.  I was released to go home, but told that if symptoms returned that I was to go to the ER immediately.  Given a 5-day prescription for Prednisone to keep future symptoms at bay.  The next few days my face and neck were very swelled, but I was able to breathe.  I was given the vaccination in my left arm, and my fingers have been swollen on my left hand.  The fingernails on my middle, ring, and pinky fingers are also very sore to the touch.

Called 911.  Blood pressure skyrocketed, as well.  Event continued for several minutes before heart rate and blood pressure  lowered but took quite some time to become normal.  I also experienced hot flashes for several days.

My husband would ask me questions and it took longer than normal to respond.  That brain fog seemed to have subsided late afternoon.  By 7pm the same day, I had chills, low grade fever and by 10pm the same day, I experienced extreme body aches, headache, and fast rate heart beat.  I took an Aleve and by 2am, I was able to sleep and my heart rate was down.  The next day, 4/12, I had a hoarse voice, body aches and a headache, no fever.  Heart rate was still pretty fast.

An hour after the injection I started to hurt and ache, which was expected. But it soon eclipsed the achy miserable feeling one normally gets with a flu shot. The left side of my body started having fibromyalgia nerve pain that was so severe I had no option but to lay in bed and endure it. The lightest touch felt like touching raw nerve endings similar to  getting sugar into  a severely bad tooth. I experience pain on a daily basis and this was something above and beyond any fibromyalgia pain or nerve pain I have experienced in the past. It was so bad, I would not have wanted to live the rest of my life in that level of pain.  I took a Phenergan like I do for my chronic migraines and it allowed me to get some rest and thankfully in the morning it had mostly abated. I continue to have worse than normal fibromyalgia pain for 5 to 6 days after the injection.

                                                I received my shot around 5pm on April 7th at the pharmacy. My left arm was a little sore and I felt a bit woozy but aside from that everything seemed okay. Approximately 5-6 hours after my vaccine my period started back up which was strange as I just finished my cycle on Friday, April 2nd. My period was pretty heavy in comparison for the first 3-4 days and then finally stopped again on Sunday, April 11th.  I am 1 week past my vaccine and everything seems fine for now and I hope it continues.

Feels tight and as if strained, but I have literally done nothing but walk or sit at my computer in the last week and cannot pinpoint an activity that would have strained a muscle.

Patient presents with concerns related to possible reaction to the J&amp;J COVID vaccine she received last week. She developed some face tingling/numbness, then felt like her throat was closing - not sure if due to lymph nodes swelling or possible reaction. She thought about going to ED or using epipen, but ultimately did not need to do either. She has been on zyrtec for her allergies which have been really bad too, so was not sure if that could be contributing. Later that evening she developed headache, chills, joint/muscle pains and fatigue which continued through the night and into the next day. She also had burning of her skin, specifically her hands and feet. She continues to have some fatigue, joint/muscle pains and mild headache. She is worried about recent development of potential clotting with J&amp;J vaccine - she has factor V Leiden and is supposed to travel later this week. Headache not described as severe, no SOB, leg pain or swelling or abdominal pain reported. Tachycardia  &#34;

                                                I am a runner and run regularly. On 3/23 I was running with friends early in the morning and got a strange cramp in my left calf. I?ve never had that happen before. It was so strong that I had to stop running and walk the last mile home. The strange cramp/pain lasted about 4 days.  Then last week my family and I were skiing and I got a sharp pain in the shin of my left calf.  Nothing brought it on, it was intense and just started out of nowhere. The pain lasted about 10 minutes and then subsided. It was very strange. That night I had a large bruise. The next morning the bruise was the size of the palm of my hand. The bruise was gone after about 4 days. I don?t know if these are related but I?ve never experienced things like these in the past without something causing them.  So after hearing reports of adverse reactions these seemed worthwhile to report.  As a side note, I also did get sick during the 24 hours after my shot. My symptoms included intense body aches, headache, sinus pain, sore throat, fatigue, nausea and a fever of 102.4. These symptoms all subsided after 48 hours of my vaccination.

At night I woke up from deep sleep and started crying that my leg  was hurting badly and felt like something was stuck in my knee couldn?t  move for couple min.  5 min later I got up to take pain medicine and try to walk  and  I was able to walk after that so went to use bathroom ( to urinate) while I got up.   After that since I had pain in my leg earlier  I went to grab  pain medicine than again I started crying and saying I don?t feel good than I passed out completely and was unconscious.   My husband picked me up and brought me to bed and said I had black out and fell on my face  on floor .

                                                I woke-up on 4/7 with an itchy throat and hives were starting to form on my stomach.  As the day went on, the hives were all over my torso and went up to my neck as well.  When I have hives on my neck, they usually start to bother my asthma/breathing, and this happened on 4/7 as well.  My allergist said to up the dosage of Allegra 24 hours from 2 tablets a day to 4.  I also took my Albuterol inhaler to control the wheezing.  My doctor also gave me a prescription for Prednisone in case I needed it over the weekend, and recommended I go to the ER if my symptoms got worse.  Luckily, the extra Allegra and asthma inhaler calmed by symptoms down.   Things calmed down over the weekend and by 4/14, the hives were completely gone and I was not longer experiencing any side effects.  I did not need to do any in-person doctor&#39;s visits; I just talked to my doctor on the phone.  Please note that I also had the &#39;flu-like&#39; symptoms after the shot as well.  I felt great after the shot and even exercised on my elliptical around 7:45 that night.  At around 9:00, I had extreme chills, where my body was shaking, as well as sweating.  I also had extreme fatigue, a headache, and some body aches as well.  I slept for 16 hours that night and felt somewhat better when I got up.  By that late that night, all the flu-like symptoms were gone.   I took some Tylenol for the headache.

                                                Within a half hour of injection, I experienced pain in my left leg (thigh muscle mostly). Throughout the day the pain spread to my left hip and left calf. Additionally, I felt like my muscles were ?on fire? on the left side of my body. I also felt a ?tingling? in my body, fingers and toes, leg muscles, primarily on left side. (I assumed at that time that this was ?normal?.) About 11 hours after injection, I experienced extreme muscle pain all over my body, lasting for about 12 hours. (Flu-like muscle pain and the feeling that all of my muscles were on fire.) The following day, I began to feel the feeling of pins and needles everywhere but primarily on left leg, thigh and calf.  By Thursday evening (three days following injection), I felt the most severe pins and needles feeling as well as ?itching? primarily in calves and hands and feet. I was so uncomfortable and panicked, I couldn?t sleep. On Friday evening, I felt intense leg pain and ?heat? on left side in both calf and thigh muscle and couldn?t sleep. On Saturday evening and all day Sunday I had a headache which I can?t say was related but caused me great concern. Now, eight days later, most of the pins and needles feeling has subsided but the pain in my left leg (thigh muscle) is at an all time high. Extra strength Tylenol is not helping. I did have a consult with my doctor last Thursday and I called again yesterday and I?m waiting for a call back. (Last Thursday, she agreed that my symptoms were unusual and thought I might need to see a neurologist.) Additionally - my left knee has bothered me and feels like someone hit it with a bat. I?m not sure if this is joint pain?  FYI - I have no apparent swelling in legs, no numbness, no trouble breathing and no significant headache today. I never had a fever or chills. The injection site burned for a few days (mild)  but was never red.

                                                I?m writing this as a former, trained healthcare professional  (physical therapist).  30sec-after injection I raised my left (injected) arm and my deltoid/bicep had a sudden hard spasm. I told my husband (who was in the middle of getting his shot) and the administrator that  I was passing out.  I blacked out. They ran over. They said 5 minutes passed in which my eyes were wide open and dilated. I suddenly began profuse sweating  and convulsions/ severe full body shaking. They could not keep me lucid, and called 911.  Paramedics came and got a systolic BP of 36 (I?m unaware of the diastolic BP) with blood sugar at 111 ish. I could not form words and kept going in and out of consciousness. I was transported by ambulance to the ER. A few minutes into the ambulance ride I was able to form words, and vitals stared to return.  I?ve passed out a few times and this WAS NOT a normal episode of syncope.

By 4 pm I had a fever of 100.7, really bad shaking chills, body aches, and nausea. My chills went away by the next day. My fever, bad headache, and ringing ears continued. My fever reached 101 but never went over. It lasted until Sunday evening. It has been 2 weeks and 1 day and my headache has never gone away, though it is manageable and mild now, although it was really bad last night. My ears/head continue to ring non-stop. Nothing helps with that.

RN asks patient to elaborate on reasons why she is needing to ambulate and encourages patient to sit for assessment.  She states, &#34;No, I really don&#39;t want to sit, I feel like I need to walk.  I have a tingling down the back of my neck, it really feels warm actually hot, I think if you take my vitals it will only make it worse&#34;.  RN again requests that patient sit and allow for vital signs to be taken, patient refuses, and asks for water.  RN provides a bottle of water for patient and she says that she would like to stay in recovery a little longer.  Patient ambulates in area for (with RN observation) and verbalizes that she is feeling a little better with walking.  Again, upon visual examination no changes noted in patient skin on neck or sholders.   At 1248 patient agrees to sit, but again refuses additional assessment.   By 1247, patient states that she is feeling better, denies dizziness and states that heat in neck has decreased.  Patient reports having similar reaction after taking Compazine. By 1250, patient verbally expresses that she is ready to depart clinic.  Advised to seek medical attention after departure if necessary, with increase or significant change in symptoms. Patient verbalizes understanding.  Ambulates from clinic alone at 1251.

                                                I discovered patient on the floor at approx. 3:03pm. She was lying face down on the floor next to the chair she was sitting on during her 15-minute observation post-covid19 vaccine. Unknown person turned patient over face-up, Face was clammy and warm/hot to the touch. Pulse was taken (weak). Sweating. Eyes were closed when EpiPen was injected on left thigh through pants. It was decided to inject patient as we did not know what exactly happened, why she was on the floor, and she was unconscious at the time we initially thought to give epi injection. 1 pen injected. Pharmacist called emergency services at 3:05pm. Patient eventually regained consciousness while waiting for the paramedics. She was able to talk and answer questions. She was taken outside the gym on stretcher, but her son met us at the school to pick her up. She declined going to the hospital for further treatment.

It felt like my bones were made out of glass and someone had taken a hammer to my bones.  My face was swollen and red.  Unable to sit up.  Walk from bed to toilet only.  Overall, I would say extreme flu-like symptoms.  Temperature 99.6 all day.   I could not take the pain any further at 4:20 pm and took 1,000 mg of Tylenol.  I finally fell asleep and woke up at 8:30pm and could walk again and my fever had broken.  I still don&#39;t feel great, but I think the worst is behind me.

                                                Immediately broke out in a sweat and was very hot.  Didn&#39;t think much about it.  The staff noticed I was in some distress and kept asking if I was okay to which I replied I thought I&#39;d be fine once I got some fresh air.  Left the facility to drive home and didn&#39;t feel right, Within 30 minutes, developed chest pains, rash and labored breathing.  I recognize the symptoms as the same symptoms I get when I&#39;ve had morphine, which I now must list as an allergy.  This lasted 4 hours, then got better.  The next day around 1:00, I became ill again with flu-like symptoms and had to leave work.  Headache and body aches mostly.  I was ill with these symptoms for a 24 hour period.  Hopefully all symptoms have passed, except my arm which is red, swollen, itchy and feverish.

My husband was monitoring me, laid down and elevated my legs above my head, took Benadryl, hydrated, and rested. When I could stand, I took a pure hot shower to warm up. I thought I was going to die. The episode started to lessen about 45 minutes after taking Benadryl and elevating legs. Much better today but still not feeling well.

Because of this, I was getting nauseous and fever spikes. Then about 3:30am, I had water like diarrhea. After that, I started to feel dizzy (I was fine as long as I still) with cold chills along with being very tired.  When I got home, I took some Ibuprofen and took a nap (4 hour nap). Began to feel much better. When I woke up, I felt better but still had a stiffness in my shoulder blade area and left side neck.

I was monitored and was given a shot of benedryl and was sent home after a while.   The next day I felt really groggy, latargic and had diarreah.  That monday the numbness went up to my ear and I reached out to my PCP who prescribed a steroid.   Later that evening I got a really bad headache and the tingling and numbness hit my feet then went up my legs, my arms and up and down my body.  Its a feeling as if my body has fallen asleep.

My arm was so super sore I couldnt lift it over my head.  On 3/10 the headache was still there but I  felt a little better.  But the ringing in my ears has been since day one and the headaches have been off and on as well since then also and on 3/25 I couldnt take it anymore so I went to see my PCP who referred me to an Audiologist but that appointment isnt until 4/29

Over the next 10 minutes, I noticed swelling in my throat (swallowing felt somewhat obstructed).  These persisted for an hour or so until I took Benedryl which seemed to ease the numbness but the swollen throat persisted..

                                                Lips and jaw felt significantly numb and tingly, dizziness and faint feeling, approx. 30 minutes after injection. Symptoms lasted about an hour. Pharmacist had instructed me to wait 15 minutes after injection in case of a reaction, which I did. I felt fine when I left the store and got into my car, but while driving home, I began to have the symptoms described above. I pulled into a hospital ER parking lot and stayed in or near my car until the symptoms subsided. I called my GP and talked to a nurse, who said if I could breathe and swallow, I was safe to go home. I did not enter the hospital ER or seek medical treatment because the symptoms did not get worse. After returning home and waiting about another hour, facial numbness completely subsided.

The next day, sysmptoms worsened, with a fever of 101, and increased pain in my arm. It is now April 9, 2021 and my fever is gone but my arm feel numb and I have swelling in my arm pit by lymph nodes and painful to touch. I feel like my vaccine arm is not as responsive and slow. I feel tired, short of breath when I walk which keep me from my usual workout routine.  I work out three times a week and before the vaccine, considered myself to be in very good health. I did have Covid 12/31/20 and my symptoms were far more mild than what I experienced taking this vaccine.

                                                Around five hours after shot I felt what I would describe as brain fog and light headache, by the evening I was aching, chilling and had 101 fever. Aches in my muscles and joints as if I had Rocky mountain spotted fever again. That is what the side effects reminded me of. This went on for over 48 hours. I have never been so sick. Very nauseous by next day. Also fell to the floor from nearly passing out the following morning. Took a minute for the light headed To pass. Arm pain still today. It was very scary and seemed to be a very serious reaction. Friday after noon finally started feeling better. The other strange part of this is that my daughter and best friend and I received the shot together in the same lot number and every one of us was deathly ill with the same symptoms. I am the only one with the fainting spells. Still feel fatigued today. And shoulders and left arm injection site still sore and achy.

                                                Pain and soreness where the shot was administered that lasted for 2 days. The third day arm was much better with mild pain and soreness. Fourth day, no pain unless you push on site. Also experienced achy legs the day after getting the vaccine for a day.  3 days after getting the vaccine, I started to get mild headache mid-day. Took some Tylenol and headache eventually went away. The next day, headache came back in the evening and not going away this time with Tylenol or with a nap.  Will keep taking Tylenol and with time headache will go away.

                                                55 hrs after vaccination, I was doubled over with severe abdominal pain. Continuous waves of severe pain. Shortly after severe pain started, tremors/teeth chattering chills even under seven heavy blankets, lasted for hours. Headache (which had been there since 6 hrs after vaccination). Pain was so severe that I was getting ready to go to ER and then vomited. Felt a tad better only to vomit again three hours later, body in a pool of sweat but no fever. Aches, tingling hot prickly sensation running from toes to head, almost passed out. Diarreah every hour after second vomit, stomach pain started to subside then but never went away completely until 3 days after.

Called personal physician who recommended going to the Emergency Department. Took one 25-mg benedryl and went to ED where physician confirmed allergic reaction to the vaccine and administered 20 mg prednisone and pepcid. Symptoms improved over two-hour observation and was released. Continued 20 mg prednisone, pepcid (twice daily) and benedryl (every 6 hrs) daily for 4 days, followed by Allegra and Zyrtec once daily each until 4/13/21. Swollen throat, dry tongue, excess thirst, shakiness, weakness, ears full, headache, and increased heart rate/palpitations persist 7 days post-vaccination. Had in-person visit with primary care physician on 4/13/2021 who recommended Nasocort twice daily for two weeks for fluid behind ears and antihistamine once daily for 5 additional days, and will refer to local allergist for work-up.

While laying down  and as time progressed, my head started aching very bad, my arm that received the shot started hurting,  I had chills, joint pain, it hurt to touch my skin, off balance when trying to walk,  some nausea but I could eat some, I felt  pen sensation poking areas in legs but mostly my abdominal area. Overall a feeling of ratchetness,  pain, and misery.  Next morning I woke with the headache  and sore arm but I felt MUCH better. By Monday, all I had was sore arm and slight headache. Now, today, Tuesday, I have small headache, some coughing, sore forearm and thigh (really weird because this just started). Overall I feel good and I am glad that Saturday is over!

Saturday night/Sunday -- not 100%, no appetite, intermittent nausea, but able to work/do normal activities. Monday 4/5--nausea at an 8-9 in the morning and kept a trash can next to me during virtual hearings I had that day.   Intermittent nausea throughout the week and not much appetite but made sure I was eating/drinking despite that.   Wednesday night 4/7 -- I went to use a PT stick on my left leg b/c I had felt a little pain in my left knee and figured my quadriceps were fibrotic.  I could barely put any pressure on my left thigh. I had never experienced anything like this.  As soon as I started rolling the stick on my leg, my skin was immediately red and warm and my leg was so sore and tender I had to stop.   Saturday 4/10 -- woke up with severe headache and later that morning felt very weird in my head/heart, like heart racing and my head felt &#34;spinny.&#34;  Felt like I might pass out at one point so I had one of my kids sit on my bed with me until I felt a little better. Sunday 4/11 -- had another episode like Saturday (headache and lightheaded/spinny/pass out feeling/slow speech) and asked neighbor (an RN) to take my BP.  her at-home device said 147 over something and she suggested I go to urgent care just to double check.   About three hours later, I was seen at  urgent care.  BP was normal, heart rate normal, oxygen was 96.  4/13--followed up with primary doctor.  Send me for blood work to check platelets, etc.  Feeling pretty good today but nervous after the news and the pause.

Next day, fatigue and muscle and joint soreness. It continued for almost three weeks. The third week I got calf pain that was very painful. I went to Urgent Care. It lasted until the next day (so for two days total). When I woke up on the 6th it was gone like it wasn&#39;t even there. The third day after the vaccine, the injection site started hurting - but not swollen or anything. The muscle at the injection site still hurts - the pain comes and goes.  I did get an iron transfusion (march 8th) before the vaccine - I had a doctor&#39;s pass to take the vaccine.

                                                About 4 days after I started having abdomen pain, it was like having contractions, then bleeding and spotting, and it was a different type of color instead of a period color, more burgundy. it lasted 26 days, when I&#39;d eat it would start again, I started having headaches, and had vision problems, then SOB started and I used the inhaler to help. I also had a low grade fever of 99.8 - 100 that lasted up until about 5 days ago. I started having bruising and leg pain, the bruising would be if someone helped me get up, I have little bruising dots over my body.  I went to the ER 3/16/2021 because the stomach and headache pains, they did a MRI and Ct and said it was acute stomach pain and migraines and told me to see a OBGYN for the bleeding and gave me meds for stomach pains. Bentel for stomach and Floraset for headaches but it never worked. I had a nerve block on my head for the migraines but it didn&#39;t work.  The GYN gave me something to stop the bleeding and she&#39;s wants to do a D&amp;C. I&#39;m waiting to see my PCP on the 19th.  I still have the purple dots and headaches, I still get the contractions and the stomach issues have settled some.

                                                Headache and general tiredness began 30-45 min after shot.  Muscle soreness (injection site, rib muscles, leg muscles, back muscles and neck muscles) began soon after.  By 6pm, muscles had become painful.  I had chills but no measurable fever.  I got in the bed but unable to sleep due to muscle pain and discomfort.  Hip joints and back began to ache.  Fever and chills worsened over the next several hours to measurable with highest at 102F.  I took 1000mg tylenol generic which did not lower fever but fever did not rise higher.  Throughout the night, I experienced calf muscle cramps and foot cramps, stomach pains, joint pains, inability to sleep, worsening injection site soreness and armpit soreness (likely lymph node soreness).  Once in middle of night I may have felt chest tightness but I even doubted that I really experienced it as I had been thinking about all the AEs I was experiencing.  Symptoms continued through night.  Next morning, developed a cough so I made appointment to get a COVID exposure test at 1pm on 13th April because I had flown in plane on 10th April.   Cough could have been due to allergy type post-nasal drip because of high pollen in area.  By late Tue evening, I felt better.  Headache had resolved and muscle symptoms improved.  Now (3:45pm on 15th April) I am still experiencing lymph node/armpit soreness and general inability to focus, think clearly.  I feel like I am in a fog.  I emailed a message to my physician and reported this through VAERS

                                                I got the vaccine on Saturday, 4 /3/21.  Not sure if this is a reaction from the vaccine or just something new I&#39;ve developed in the last couple days.  Tuesday afternoon (4/13/21), I was feeling twitching around the outside corner of my right eye/cheek area.  I didn&#39;t pay it any attention.  Wednesday morning it was happening again.  I started paying attention after a couple times.  It feel s like someone has a string from the top of my head area that passes down the outside corner of my right eye, down my cheek, to the outside corner of my mouth; then starts tugging on the string.  Also, a pain starts in the lower part of my head, behind my right ear.  It&#39;s happening more often, to where I&#39;m getting annoyed with it.  I got an automated call about the  vaccine; if having any (insert list of symptoms) please contact your doctor or clinic.  I contacted my doctor, she suggested I report as an adverse reaction, just in case, and to get checked out in the ER.  I have not yet gone in.

                                                The evening after the vaccine was administered I experienced severe pain in my right leg (4/10 at 7:30pm). The pain occured in the groin and knee area and mostly through the thigh. I took 1000mg of Tylenol and it helped resolve the pain. The following day (4/11) I experienced the same leg pain and continued with Tylenol which helped. Monday I had dizziness and almost fainted so I went to the ED to get examined (4/11). I have a family history of blot clotting and carry the prothrombin gene mutation so I&#39;m aware of issues with leg pain and get evaluated. The pain has continued over the week and is now in my left leg with mild pain. Visited walk in clinic to have a follow up on 4/15 and they administered a Covid test.

I had chills, muscle aches up and down my legs, fever, extreme fatigue and hot flashes. Site of injection was not sore at this point.  Throughout the day I felt weak and could not keep my eyes open for longer than 20 minutes. I fell in and out of sleep and took two aspirins every six hours.  The headache went from very bad to a dull constant headache that lasted for three days.   When the muscle aches in my legs subsided on 4/10 they then moved to my buttocks muscles. I could not keep my eyes open but kept waking up with chills, headaches, body aches, hot flashes and fever.   On 4/11/2021 I woke up feeling better but still had a headache. I felt weak and tired. Symptoms eventually got better throughout the day.   I did not feel any soreness in my arm until day three and four. Headaches subsided on day three.

On 3/27 patient stated she couldnt move and felt like a tingling sensation on the left arm (felt like ants crawling on body), felt dizzy, headache. She stated she then went to the ER on 4/15/21. CT scan (chest) and ultrasound(legs) was done and she wasnt sure of the results (the ER doctor only informed her that she wouldnt be #7). Then on 4/17 patient state she felt fine and was back to exercising and running.  Then on 4/24 she stated she went to the beach to run and felt a sting/cramp on right leg, she looked and noticed a bruise and then as of 4/26 her leg is sore, it&#39;s not red, not hot and not hurting, just sore to touch. Bruising is going away but just uncomfortable to touch.  Patient states she been feeling a little more fatigued and winded out when doing things now more than before  and before taking the vaccine.   Been a 1.5years since her last asthma attack. Since a month ago is when she started to feel that she needs to catch her breath more often. Patient stated she saw her PCP on 4/19/21 and she was prescribed another inhaler (can&#39;t recall the name) and antibiotic.   CT scan was done when she was in the ER because pt had chest pain. No pulmonary embolism indicated on results but she states her scan came back with something on it but she wasnt able to explain what was on there. When she was in the ER the doctor didnt prescribe anything but when she went to see pcp her MD prescribed her an antibiotic (cant recall name, she picked up the rx but hasnt started taking it yet- wasnt home to obtain the name).   As of 4/26 her headache, leg cramps have subsided, she just feels very fatigued. She stated that every time she has a headache she takes tylenol. The last time she took tylenol was on Sunday 4/25/21.  Advised patient to start taking the antibiotic as prescribed by the pcp and to take the inhaler when she feels winded out. Also advised her that if she feels chest pain or extreme sob then to either contact her pcp again or urgent care  She has no follow up scheduled with her PCP.

Arm was sore but no more than any other vaccine. close to 4 hours later, headache started, felt hot and cold. Hard to sleep, sweating a lot during the night. Headache was so bad it felt like a combination of a bad flu with a hangover. felt very thirty. In the morning I was dizzy, hot, cold, temp 99.8, sick to my stomach, coudn&#39;t taste food very well, just like when you have the flu, nothing taste good. I spend the following day in and out of sleep, very tired, hard to focus. The sensation for being hot and cold continued. Took Imitrex to alleviate the headache/migraine . I did help, but not much. Hard to eat due to an upset stomach. Today is the first full day. I hope I&#39;m better tomorrow

Shakin lasted for over 2hrs at which point I took 2 Tylenols. After 20min the shaking decreased. The shaking came back about 1.5hrs later. At that point I took 2 ibuprofens. The shaking went away. The entire following day had mild fever. have been tired physically for a week now after receiving the vaccine. Lost sense of smell and taste on the 3rd day after vaccination. It has since slowly improved. Botox injection sites (received Botox injection for migraine on March 4, 2 days before the J&amp;J vaccine) are still slightly red a week after the vaccine. My facial skin is breaking out also. Vaginal yeast infection started 4 days after receiving the vaccination. I feel slower than usual in my thinking processes since the vaccination.

                                                Within 3 hours of vaccination, headache, nausea, dizziness, extreme fatigue, felt like I was freezing - fever of 100.8 (normal for me is 97.4).    I couldn&#39;t stay awake for more than about 15 minutes at a time.   Medication taken was 400mg Aleve (Naproxen Sodium). Fever lasted through the night.  As of today (3/16/21) all other symptoms except nausea persist.  Headache comes and goes.  I can stay awake for longer periods of time, but if I get up for anything for any more than a few minutes, I feel weak and dizzy again.

All over body aches, no appetite, weakness, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, burning eyes, ataxia, lightheadedness. Took my AM meds including hydrocodone-APAP which caused the fever to break but stayed low grade until the following afternoon around 2 PM. Helped with the body aches somewhat as well. Appetite started to return this morning, 3 days after the vaccine but the fatigue, weakness, muscular pain and a general unwell feeling continues.

When I got out of bed I was lightheaded and passed out in the bathroom as I was getting Tylenol.  I took 2 Tylenol and had diarrhea about 10 mins later.  I went to get some gatorade and passed out again in the hallway on the way to the kitchen.  About an hour after taking Tylenol symptoms began to improve but became nauseous and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  As of 2pm Sunday current symptoms are extreme nausea and extreme exhaustion.

                                                The next day after the shot, I had a small rash on my wrist.  It disappeared during the day.  Saturday evening, my right thigh felt like it received a trauma like a hit, but I did not have an injury.  An area the size of my hand is slightly pink on the thigh.  On Tuesday, I tried starting ibuprofen, but it did not really remedy the pain.  I went to urgent care Wed. evening.  They sent me for an ultrasound to rule out blood clots.  No blood clots, but lymph nodes were visible in ultrasound.  They suggested I follow-up with PCP.  On Thursday and Friday, the leg felt crampy but less painful.  Friday night the pain traveled down my right leg to ankle as well as right lower lung had dull ache.  Returned to urgent care.  They are treating the leg for cellulitis (1000mg daily of generic Keflex.)  They said if the leg felt better in 24 hrs, probably cellulitis, but if not, it might be a response to vaccine.  There is no relief after 3 doses and 24 hr &#43; later.

I had vomiting and diarrhea for seven hours. I had hives about an hour and a half after the shot all over especially and my feet. The hives were extremely itchy, and my skin felt like it was on fire. The next morning, I went to urgent care and gave me an anti-itch medicine/antihistamine Hydroxyzine. The prescribed medicine knocked me out, but it only helped a little with the itching. The hives stayed for another four days. I have also had severe joint pain that is still lingering in my feet and hands. I don?t normally have joint pain, but it started the day after the shot.

                                                Approximately a half hour after the Janssen vaccine was administered on Monday, March 15, 2021 at 2:00pm, I felt a dull ache/sensation in the back, lower part of my head. No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

                                                Had the typical side effects, started with fatigue then came headache, body aches, fever. Fever went up to 101.4. After the majority of the body aches subsided, I ended up with facial pain from my temples all the was into my neck. This pain occurred on both sides of my face and was so bad that I couldn?t lay on my side with the side of my head on the pillow. The pain felt like severe joint pain, but also felt like it was in my glands. It felt like my salivary glands wanted to burst.  I used CBD cream topically to try to help with the pain, also CBD tincture internally. Finally resorted to Acetaminophen 1000mg. The acetaminophen seemed to help the tiniest bit. Then my fever broke. Once I began sweating I could feel the pain in my face almost melting away.  This lasted about three hours. When I woke up at 8:00AM the side effects seemed to have all subsided. I still had a very mild headache.

Basically every muscle hurt and I really couldn&#39;t move.  I spent the entire day in bed unable to eat or even move. I had to take the day off from work.   I think I had Covid in Feb 2020 before testing began. The symptoms I felt in February 2020 were exactly the same beginning 12 hours after the vaccine.

                                                I received the J&amp;J shot in the arm at 12:30 PM on 4/6.  At 7:00 PM -I started experiencing severe muscle cramping in both arms and both legs.  By 9:00 PM  chills started and were added to the severe muscle cramping experienced earlier. I took one Ibuprofen pill at 10:00 PM and tried going to sleep.  I was up all night with insomnia and muscular pain.  I had a low grade temperature of 100.3 starting around 12:30 AM.  Today, 4/7 I&#39;ve had low grade temperature around 99 and severe muscle cramping in both legs early morning.  Right now at 4:30 PM on 4/7, my temp is gone but I remain extremely fatigued and have muscle cramping in both legs.  I tried taking a nap today and failed to sleep. The last time I was able to sleep was Monday night 4/5. I am hoping this will resolve itself by tomorrow 4/8.  If symptoms don&#39;t resolve by 4/8 I will contact my PCP on 4/9. Thank you hope this information helps. I didn&#39;t expect to have insomnia as a symptom of this vaccine.

                                                I was held for approx 30 minutes. Drove out and when driving home started to get short of breath, so turned towards the hospital rather than home and called them. My significant other also had his shot, so we switched spots driving at that time. I called the hospital on my way when I started to feel my throat start to close at exactly 1829 on my phone (6:29 pm.). Appointment was at 6pm for shot. Hospital was 13 minutes away. Half way there my tongue started to swell and my lips slightly with tingle. My breathing was more labored to keep up effort as I could not expand my lungs to capacity. I was always able to breath and speak, my voice did become more raspy.    Upon ER, Blood Pressure was very Hypertensive around 140s/120s with my respiratory effort to get in. Pulse was stable around 70-80. O2 was 97-99.  I was able to lay down and relax my breathing which relaxed my blood pressure to 140s/ 80s. I was given IV Benadryl, IV Dexadron, PO Pepcid with a liter of fluid. Monitor up until after 8pm when I was released with still mild tonge swelling but breathing ok. Continue Benadryl at home with my Epi pen for bees stings available.    Did go to work today 07/08/2021. Was wheezy, SOB, no throat swelling, tongue swelling at base. Kept up with Benadryl. Made it 1/2 day and went home. Walking and movement makes increase lung workload. My staff concerned with effort and flush skin while getting supplies. But flush and redness does subside some with rest. When talking need to take a break to breath. But can today notice when Benadryl kicks in. No history of Asthma ever or breathing issues ever. Very active on my farm and at work.

I took 25 mg. of Bendryl which helped with the breathing. I felt very faint and experienced episodes of high blood pressure which lead to  uncontrollable shaking. I broke out in hives accross my arms and chest.  I laid with my feet elevated for one hour at which time symptoms subsided and I was able to leave the pharmacy. I had no further allergy type symptoms after leaving the site.

                                                Site of the injection started to burn as I sat in the waiting area.  The best way to describe the burning feeling in my arm  is the feeling of when you receive a local anesthetic or a nerve block at the dentist.  It lasted for 30 seconds to 1 minute .  I began to feel nauseous and hot, I broke into a sweat and called over someone as I felt like I was going to pass out.  All happened within the first 3 minutes in the waiting area.  I sat with the medics for a few minutes and I returned to normal.  I never lost consciousness.  I was able to leave after the 15 minutes.

The RN and MD had me stay almost and hour for observation but the feeling was still there. The night of 4/2/21 I had a fever of 99.4 at 11:30pm. As of today, I still have the numbness and tingling in the left arm that goes down to the wrist and hand but it is a little better. I feel pins and needles in fingers occasionally and my palm and hand feel extra warm.

Pain in legs became increasingly worse throughout the early morning, from the waist down. Became nauseated, chilled and fevered with severe headache and leg pain until 04.07.2021. I took an 800 MG ibuprofen on 04.07.2021 which seemed to help decrease the deep cramping leg pain and eased the headache. I did not seek any treatment because I figured there would be some side effects from the vaccination. I am still experiencing slight chills, leg pain, tiredness, mild joint pain and moderate chest and head congestion.

My initial symptoms included tingling, numbness, and inability to walk.  The doctors confirmed during MRI that I had had a stroke.  I was in the hospital for four days, and released to PT/OT three times a week for the next 4 weeks to regain full use of the right side.  I  am also unable to work during this time.

On Saturday evening my right arm started to hurt from my bicep to my fingers. When I woke up Sunday morning I couldn?t move my arm without extreme muscle and nerve pain. I wasn?t able to make a fist or grip anything in my hand. It eased up throughout Sunday and by the evening it was fine. Also on Sunday morning I vomited twice and once in the evening. By the evening I also had diarrhea, which is still going on. I woke up Monday feeling sore all over had a fever of 101.9. The fever broke the same day. Throughout Monday and more so on Tuesday and today I am constantly itchy especially my fingers. It feels like I have things crawling on me. I called my pcp yesterday (Tuesday) gave them my symptoms told them I had been vaccinated on 4/6. They didn?t call me back until today (Wednesday) &amp; wouldn?t let me split the office fee in two so they wouldn?t see me. I also called the pharmacy on Tuesday  spoke to the pharmacist was advised what was going on is side effects and I needed to report it. The diarrhea and itchy feeling is keeping me from being able to work and I?m not sure what to do from here.

I was standing in my kitchen and all of the sudden I became dizzy, my heart rate shot up, I became very nauseous and my  entire body became sweaty and hot and every muscle in my body hurt. My husband also received the J&amp;J shot at the same time and day and at 11:45 pm (15 min after I got sick) he was abruptly woken up out of a dead sleep to find himself running to the bathroom with severe nausea and vomiting. He was very pale and very very dizzy, his heart rate was elevated and this lasted for about 24 hours for him. We are about 10 days out from getting the vaccine and I still have muscle pain in my legs.  All other symptoms lasted about 24 hours.

                                                I am not sure if my event was caused by the vaccine I received on  April 8, but I have a very strong feeling it is, as never in my life have I experienced anything like it.  My day began normally, and I just had returned home from an appointment.  I had some lunch, and a few minutes later as I was standing in my kitchen,  I began sweating terribly,  heart was racing, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I  managed to make it to a large living room chair, and once I say down and put my head back, I passed out.   My daughter witnessed everything and said when I passed out, my arms were trembling and my eyes rolled back.  This lasted for about 30 seconds.  She was unable to arouse me for a bit, but when I came to my speech was slurred.   I did not know what had happened.  My daughter called 911.  By the time medics arrived, I was feeling much better and aware of everything happening.  The checked for signs of stroke, vital signs, blood sugar, and everything was normal.   I was transported to the ER, and my work up there was normal, including EKG and blood work.  The physician that I saw diagnosed me with  vasovagal syncope and did not feel the event was related to the vaccine.  I  completely recovered, and like I said  I?m not sure if it was related to the vaccine I received or not.  I just feel that it may be worth noting since I?ve never had an experience like this and  I?m pretty healthy with really no medical history.

If I had been home, I absolutely would have been laying down. My heart was also racing. I then felt cold all over. My experience lasted about 10 mins and probably 7 mins into it, I did start to feel better. The experience was quite scary. I thought I could have ended up in the hospital.

                                                Progressive slight numbness in my left arm follow day. Most noticeable in fingertips. Just didn?t feel right through day and took blood pressure at approx 5pm. Reading was 171/108.  Took a clonidine (which I have on hand in emergency. This was only the 2nd time I?ve ever taken it) I emailed my doctor a short time later. Doctor advises if symptoms progressed to go to ER(although sent following morning, I did not see until Thurs evening) Friday morning met with Doctor.  Fingers still feel peculiar but BP ok.

But around 8 maybe? sudden chills-freezing, shivering, teeth-chattering lasting maybe 30 to 45 min? then chills stopped, sudden switch to fever that kept going up despite tylenol last temp taken was 102.8 (my normal temp is about 97 and I never get fevers). Skin felt like it was burning on legs and arms, felt like rug burn. Sore throat, terrible headache...the worst of this tapered off within two hours or I would have gone to Emergency Room. Was sick for another 48&#43; hours but by then more mild flu symptoms not crazy horrible sickness that first night.

                                                Headache started late afternoon/evening, around 5pm. Was also feeling chilled and lethargic/tired. Around 9:30pm, woke up (after about an hour) headache was really bad including stomachache, also I was shivering uncontrollably even though I felt like I was burning up. I took Tylenol around 5:30pm and 9:30pm. Later during the night, around 2am, my headache continued to be bad with stomachache and still feeling chilled. I took Motrin around then. That seemed to help enough for me to get some sleep. When I woke in the morning the headache was faded. The rest of the day I was tired, felt like I was recovering.

The next day woke up with a severe migraine (with its usual accompanying symptoms), lack of appetite, and body aches. Body aches particularly acute in areas where I have had past injuries and surgeries...indicating strong inflammatory response. No fever, but essentially felt like an intense case of the flu. Symptoms abated by 5 pm on 04/08/2021 after complete bed rest. Lethargy continued for the next few days, however, that is usual for me after a migraine on the higher end of the pain scale, and may not be a direct result of the vaccine itself.

                                                I got the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/10/2021 at 11:40am.  Later on that day, my left arm was sore so I took Tylenol.  After my shower that night around 10pm, I felt cold/shaky/chills &amp; had really weird dreams.   The next morning (4/11/2021), I slept in late &amp; was very tired when I woke up.  I also had a headache, fever (100.2F) &amp; nausea. Took 2 Tylenol 500 mg each  &amp; these symptoms went away later that night.   Two days after the vaccine, on 4/12/2021, I woke up with itchy red rashes all over both of my legs &amp; feet (~30 small-med size). Took 2 doses of Zyrtec &amp; Benadryl 50mg twice that day so it wouldn?t itch so much. Also applied mometasone ointment to rashes.   On 4/13/2021, I did a video visit with a doctor.  She said my rashes were probably due to an immune response to the J&amp;J covid vaccine (meaning it is working) &amp; it didn?t look serious since it was only on my legs.  She said to continue the Zyrtec up to 2x/day, Benadryl every 6 hrs if needed, &amp; apply mometasone steroid ointment for the rashes 1x/day.  On 4/14/2021, the rashes have improved and I had less than 10 rashes on my legs.  Since I still had some rashes, I continued to take 1 Zyrtec 10mg in the morning &amp; applied mometasone ointment to the rashes.   On 4/16/2021, the rashes had resolved.

Felt like my motor skills were shutting down and was getting weakness like I was about to pass out. Although I have a lot of allergies to medication, I have NEVER had a reaction to a vaccine before. I was taken in for observation and this was reported. The day after the shot I woke  up with a excruciating  headache that last all day intermittently for five days with no relief from ibuprofen.  Right leg throbbing pain and hot on second day. Third day had very severe pain in the abdomen like a lot of gas early in the morning while sleeping.

                                                On the night of my J&amp;J my vaccine , I felt very tired and sleepy but I could not sleep. The next morning I felt a burning sensation to my eyes as well to my right ear and that went away. I went to see my PCP that day as well because I was having a pressure sensation down my right calf and leg. On Wednesday I felt numbness sensation down my right arm and the right side of my body was weak. On Thursday, I called my PCP who advised me to go to the ER and to get monitored for thrombosis. I also began to have headaches and blurry vision. At the ER they performed an ultrasound and did lab work. The ultrasound exam did not show evidence of thrombosis or blood clots. The ER physicians told me to rest and elevate my legs. I also noticed that  my BP was 130/90 which I never had before. To this day I still have throbbing sensation to my right calf and leg.  I again went to the ER and thy monitored me. They told me to take Ibuprofen for pain and again did an ultrasound which did not show any blood clots. I then started to have a burning sensation to my skull and scalp and also my left arm. I have not fully recovered from my symptoms.

                                                I had an EMG performed last week which was normal and a F/U with the neurologist because I am still experiencing the numbness to the right side of my body and when performing activities it gets worse.  I have developed a limp and I dont have the strenght in my hands and feet that I once had.  When I push myself to perform activities the numbness , fatigueness, and pain is just so intense that its nearly impossible.  If I continue to try to push myself to perform activities its as if my body begins to shut down and does nothing.  Its as if im ok until I begin to perform any body activities.

Went to bed for the evening, Monday 4/26/2021 and woke up at 1:50am on Tuesday morning, 4/27/2021 in full body sweats, dripping with sweat.  So weak I couldn&#39;t get up or lift my head.  My husband took my temperature which was 103.  Massive headaches, full body aches and pains, chills which made my body shake uncontrollably.   My whole body hurt.  Could not get up to use the restroom, tried and fainted back into the bed.  Heart felt like it was beating out of my chest.  My husband wanted to call 911 but I didn&#39;t want to.  Felt like I had COVID again.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms within an hour after receiving vaccine injection:  consisted of right-sided facial numbness, right-sided eyelid droop, right-sided mouth turn, right-sided tightness in neck muscle, pressure behind right eye, headache, loss of balance, difficulty speaking.  The injection was at 3:15 pm and started with arm soreness and stinging, a slight headache, and some tingling in my right hand while waiting 15 minutes after the shot, I had also felt a sensation going up the right side of the back of my neck almost immediately after the injection.  The Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms started by 4:00 pm.  I had a low-grade temp that evening of 99.9.  I emailed my neurologist who I see for migraines, of my symptoms.  The following morning on 03-10-2021 I woke with a severe migraine, fullness in my right ear, more pressure behind my right eye and it is watery, with new ringing in both ears, louder in the right ear.   Still residual numbness and drooping of right side of face and eye, tightness in right side neck muscle in front, and speaking better.   Woke up on Thursday morning 03-11-2021 with flu symptoms and migraine gone.  Eye pressure still there and now having significant pain moving my eye and now more feeling of fullness in my right ear.  Eye pain was concerning.  Dr advised me at this time if symptoms have continued or gotten worse to go to the emergency room.   Today, Saturday 03-13-2021, I am still experiencing moderate eye pain behind/above my right eye with pressure.  I am continuing to treat the pain with oxycodone prescribed by ER Physician.

Patient stated she has some full budding numbing experience but no anaphylaxis. We gave her the J&amp;J covid 19 vaccine and asked her to wait 30 minutes to be monitored due to her past allergies. Around 20 minutes patient let one of the pharmacist know she was feeling very flushed and dizzy. We brought her over to the side to be monitored more closely. We had patient elevate her feet to help with faint feeling and drink some water.  Within 5 to 10 minutes her symptoms  started worsening. Tingling sensation started going up her side of head and neck. It started moving to the front of her face. Once that happened I asked how her breathing was and she was starting to get short of breath. Soon after patients throat started to close. We administer 0.3 m of epinephrine and called 911. Pt was able to breathe a little better but within 5 minutes she was back to gasping for air, we administered another 0.3 mg of epinephrine and the paramedics arrived.

Also instructed to increase fluids. After a few hours by 9 p.m. fever is 100 and chills have subsided. Still have mild headache and general discomfort.

We gave her a cold pack to place on her neck/face and continued to monitor her bp every 5 minutes. Each bp reading was higher than the last (98/62, 126/77, 116/83). After the fourth bp reading, the patient reported that she felt well enough to go home and she left.

Day 7-present Knot harder and maybe bigger. And the tingle in the arm and fingers  is back. I&#39;ve done some  research and this is not mentioned anywhere. Especially at 12 days. Nor anyone i know with this symptom. I thought it was worth mentioning. Will call doctor if arm tingle doesn&#39;t go away by early next week.

                                                So after I got the shot I had a sore arm for 4 days and when I mean sore I mean pretty sore, if I lifted something it would hurt. It was more sore than the normal for a shot. On Sunday the 14th I woke up with a fever (103F) shortness of breath and a headache, on Mondya the fever was a little lower in the 100s and I still have the shortness of breath. The next day I only had the fever and the whole week I just had a low grade fever (in the 99s) and on Saturday I woke up with high fever again and decided to go get a covid test. My fever broke when I was at the covid test site (Urgent Care) but at night it was back again. My test was negative. I noticed that every time I had high fever, 100s I had shortness of breath - the fever lasted 14 days (low grade for most part). Monday 03/29/2021 at 1:15 I have an appt with my PCP.

                                                I am having neck pain and left arm pain.  I would say that the arm pain may be muscular.  I have been taking  ibuprofen and tylenol fo the past few days.  I went to the Chiropractor and had temporary relief of the neck pain.  It lasted for maybe 10 minutes it is hard to turn my head to the left.  I am just letting you know about the reaction.    The other thing is that the injection area the first day was very itchy I know better than to scratch it.  It becomes very itchy on and off yesterday and today.  These are probably not what you want for adverse side effects but I am letting you know that this is the case with me.

                                                The patient received the Janssen Covid 19 vaccine (lot 1805022) on 3/17/21. Today (4/5/21) the patient called to report several adverse reactions. She stated that she had body aches and chills the day after the vaccine. The aches went away but the patient reports that the chills in her hands, legs, and feet have persisted. The patient also said that she started to have facial paralysis on 4/3/21. Also on 4/3/21 she reported developing multiple skin rashes on different areas of the body. She also said she went to the ER and had multiple tests run, including an MRI to rule out stroke. She did report to her primary care doctor who advised her to see a Neurologist. I offered to reach out to her primary care but she did not provide the information. I advised the patient that she would need to seek care from a provider who could assess and treat her as needed. I called Janssen and they said the facial paralysis is a very rare possibility but did not have any additional information to provide me. They advised me to tell the patient to seek medical care as necessary. I spoke with the patient multiple times this evening and provided her with the information to VAERS and Vsafe. I also let her know that I contacted Janssen and gave her the information they gave me. I expressed to her that I understood that she was concerned and she could reach out to me if needed. I also will follow up with her later in the week.

                                                The patient received a Janssen COVID vaccine on 4/8/21 at around 5:00 pm.  The patient was nervous during the administration and reported never receiving a flu vaccine in the past.  The common side and serious side effects were discussed with the patient.  The vaccine was administered to the patient without issue.  The patient and husband instructed to wait 15 minutes after the administration of the vaccine as is the recommendation per the CDC.  About 5 minutes after the administration of the vaccine, the patient&#39;s husband notified the pharmacy staff that his wife was not felling well.  Pharmacist responded to the patient.  The patient reported shortness of breath and feeling hot and stated she was about to pass out.  Pharmacist was instructed to retrieve the Epi-Pen from the immunization cart and assist.  Code White was called and Division 1 staff responded and assisted.  The patient was lowered to the ground and her feet were elevated.  It was at this point that it was determined that the patient was not experiencing anaphylaxis based on the symptoms she was reporting and exhibiting.  The patient was instructed to remove mask to help obtain better breaths and remove the patient from hyperventilation.  An icepack was obtained and placed on the patients neck once she was able to sit up.  The patient&#39;s symptoms improved to the point of moving to a chair.  The patient sipped water and continued deep breathing.  The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to improve and she was able to leave.

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday - I had headaches and I had extra fatigue (I already do have fatigue because I have insomnia). My arm soreness was on the other arm not on the one that I had an injection. Friday and up until yesterday, I had nausea. Saturday, I had headache and being tired. Sunday, I had chest pain (woke up with it) like a burning in my chest. My left arm, I felt a tingling down my arm to my legs - it almost felt like a blood clot was there in my arm. I had to put heat on and then ice. I couldn&#39;t extend arm because it hurt. Midnight on Monday, the burning and the chest pain was too much and I was getting worried. The only thing I have is asthma, otherwise I&#39;m healthy. I went to ER - they gave a Cocktail of Lidocaine; Malex and something else to see if it would help with the burning in my chest.  Monday, I took Tylenol. Tuesday, the chest pains were more intense.  03:00 on Wednesday am - I went back to ER. They brought me to a full chest x-ray - front, side and back and a CAT SCAN and gave me another Cocktail and also put something in my IV. This time,  they sent me home with four different medicines. The meds are: Generic of Nexium; Aspirin low dose of 81 mg - bayers children - one a day; Generic version of Bentil Triacetin   - I take this when I want to be still; Generic version of Valium - they gave me four of these - and I have one left that I will take tonight so I can sleep. I am taking Vit D. I haven&#39;t taken Tylenol since getting on these. I try to stay hydrated.  I still have a really really funny feeling inside me. Last night, I was very restless and couldn&#39;t sleep. It makes me on borderline and dizzy and my heart starts palpitating. It&#39;s a scary feeling in my chest.

                                                At 4:40 side effects began with shooting pains in fingers and legs followed by body aches and chills and skin sensitive to the touch. Fever followed and reached 101.2. Intense headache next with nausea, Around 11pm I began wheezing. Just before this I noticed my heart had begun racing. I drank a lot of water during this time, drank soda to settle my stomach and ate 2 crackers. It seemed as though the crackers gave me heartburn. By 6am the following morning fever had come down to a temp (99.2). My headache was just mild and body aches seemed mild. and Some shooting pains remained. On 4/10 around 3pm I felt as though body aches and my headache were worsening. My pulse sped up and my temp began to rise. My temp had risen to 99.8 and my head was becoming much worse so at 5pm I took 3 extra strength Tylenol. This helped a lot.

I had a very severe headache and felt very nauseous.   I was not able to sleep well during the night.  The next day, between 7 am and 5 pm, I stayed in bed with the most severe headache I have ever had, severe nausea and extreme fatigue, and sometimes felt hot and/or had mild chills.   I was not able to go to work, as I could not get out of bed.  I was finally able to get up around 5 pm (24 hours after shot) and eat a little something as the nausea had finally subsided.  I was still very fatigued and had a less severe headache.  I was able to sleep well that night, and woke the next day (about 36-37 hours after shot) with only a slight headache, which went away with a few hours.

                                                During my 15min wait (about 5 minutes after the injection) I started to become very hot and sweating profusely.  My ears started ringing and the noise in the room sounded like it was in slow motion.  I started to feel dizzy and clammy like I was going to pass out.  I got up and walked over to the paramedic and he sat me down and took my vitals.  All of my vitals were fine and I started to come out of the feeling of passing out.  After waiting another couple of minutes I went outside to get fresh and was able to go home.  I felt very tired and just not quite right the rest of the day and slept most of the day.  I was ok after that with just a fatigue and headache in the following days.

                                                On the day of my vaccine I had typical symptoms - chills, fatigue, and headache.  The next day I felt better, just tired.  On Tuesday the 23rd I returned to work and felt fine, but I did have an occasion of dizziness and I was tired.  I felt good on the 24th and returned to life/exercise as normal.  I woke up on the 25th in the early morning with a strange sensation in my head.  (I described it to my husband that it felt like I had worms in my head.)  When I got up I experienced dizziness that seemed like vertigo.  I tried to proceed with my day, but I got an intense headache, loss of appetite, and sore upper leg muscles.   I reached out to my doctors office.  I saw a doctor on the 26th.  (My dizziness was better, but I still had a headache and muscle aches.)  We discussed vertigo and possible reactions to the vaccine.  He also found some liquid in my ears and so we questioned allergies.  I got allergy medicine and took it when I got home.   The next day in the early morning the headache and muscle aches returned and I called a hotline through my doctor&#39;s office.  (The headache was quite intense.)  I spoke with a nurse - I was concerned that I may have Covid.  We discussed my reaching out to get a test if my symptoms were not better by Monday.  By Sunday I was feeling a bit better.  My headache had improved but I still had muscle aches in my legs.  I determined I would be able to go back to work on Monday.   The last symptom to remain was aches in my legs.  On Wednesday the aches were in my upper legs , by 3/30 the aches were in my ankles.  I was feeling better by early April.

                                                Patient immediately felt pain in her arm and then described feeling &#34;woozy&#34;. She was given a quiet place to sit and then lie down. She was given water, juice, and snacks. She felt dizzy and a bit nauseated at times. She admitted to not having eaten anything prior to the vaccine. At 1500, an hour after she received the vaccine she felt like her heart was racing and she reported that the whole right side of her body felt cold. People with her that knew her well stated that she &#34;was not herself&#34;. She also reported at this time that she felt like her heart was racing. This nurse recommended, by phone (patient had left the clinic site by this time) that the patient&#39;s mother take her in to urgent care or the ED, just to be sure everything was okay. Upon follow up, the patient did not go in but called the ED triage nurse. She was told this was likely a normal response to the vaccine. Patient went home to rest and her mother stayed with her overnight. Today client is back at work- tired and sore but nothing more reported.

                                                About eight hours after I was vaccinated, I began to experience fatigue and full body ache. I went to bed around 6:30 pm, and I was violently trembling with chills for hours. The body aches became as bad as I have ever experienced, and, although I was lying still in bed,  my heart rate was alarmingly high for most of the night --around midnight my heart rate was 120 bpm. My usual resting heart rate is in the 60s. It continued to be very high, and it got as high as 130 bpm between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. Meanwhile, I felt like I had a fever (although I couldn&#39;t find a thermometer). I drank a lot of water during the night hoping it would help my heart rate go down. I put a cold cloth on my forehead, and I took four Advil around 4 a.m.  My body aches and elevated heart (90-110 bpm) rate continued throughout the next day. My heart rate finally came down during the following night, and fatigue and body aches dissipated over the following day.

My chest pain was sharp, stabbing pain that comes and goes, intermittently. I am on day 24 with chest pain. I was referred to the heart doctor, they did an EKG which was normal. MY PCP did a tri-triponent blood test was normal, an also ordered a D-dimmer and it was elevated, i was sent to ER to check for pulmonary embolism which was clear. Another EKG was done and it was normal. My electrolytes were normal. I had stress test this morning 04-14-2021. My PCP ordered platelets due to my left leg pain and heavy feeling and burning feeling that comes and goes. My platelets were normal. My WBC is very low and  I have an echocardiogram scheduled on Monday. The ER doctor said that the vaccine caused the inflammation on my body and my chest, having an auto-immune reaction.  I still have chest pain.

While driving, my entire left side went numb.   I kept checking my face in the rear-view mirror to see if it was drooping.  It was not.  My upper lip  appeared and felt swollen.   Six days later, on March 28th, I came down with a really bad migraine.  It started in my left eye and then was a really bad headache.  I called the eye doctor the following day because the pain was not subsiding.  The migraine lasted from Sunday, March 28th to Wednesday, March 31st.   Following the migraine, I have been getting headaches (not as severe, but still painful) almost daily.   The headache is not over my eyes or in the temple.   Instead the headaches are on the top of my head and towards the back.    Today is three weeks and two days after my vaccine, and I am still having headaches on the top of my head.

Light nose bleeds - mostly when blowing nose - chunks - persists. Also, have been menopausal but am now having a cycle - thin and light bleeding.

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the , vaccine on April 5 at 3:15 pm, I had uncontrollable shivers and chills, shaking violently through my whole entire body.  I was freezing cold to the bone.   I felt nauseous and threw up my entire dinner.  That didn&#39;t make the nausea go away - I continued to throw up that evening 5 or 6 more times.  The nausea continued the next day making me throw up 3 more times.  And yet the nausea persisted for a whole entire week.  I had a horrible headache that night that has stuck with me these last ten days.  My muscles ached and shot strange pangs through my body.  I was exhausted.  I could not stay awake.  I was so weak and tired.  I had no energy and just laid in bed for a solid four days. My throat hurt, my neck hurt, my head hurt, my arm where the shot went in hurt so bad.  Very strangely, my stomach was constantly bloated and hurt inside like a bad stomach ache - even if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything it still bloated and hurt.  The painful stomach lasted seven or eight days.  I had diarrhea for those seven /eight days.  I was completely dehydrated.  The diarrhea lasted way too long - it was difficult to return to work.  The second day after the shot I woke up to my left eye red, like some blood vessels had burst.  It took four or five days for my eye to go back to normal.   my heart has a stabbing feeling randomly all the time now and it is hard to breathe.  I wheeze and cough all the time.  It is very uncomfortable.  This heart issue has persisted the entire time since getting the vaccine.

                                                Monday night had very bad sweats/chills and was tired/sore as expected. Tuesday my lymph node glands in my throat on the side where I got the vaccine swelled nearly three times their size. I felt flu-like symptoms: fever, exhaustion, weakness, body aches and a headache. Wednesday I felt the same and nauseous in the evening. I had iced my lymph nodes and that helped a little with the soreness. (Took IB off/on since Monday as I thought I had a low fever and was achey/headachey). Thursday, I noticed that the soreness/pain in my lymph nodes moved up my jaw and to my ear (on the side where I got the vaccine). I still felt weak and tired. I tried to work at 11:15a and felt my brain couldn&#39;t quite think straight. Today (Fri.), pain in jaw/side of head and headache continue. Think the swollen glands are making it hurt when I swallow. Felt a little something in my leg; but would not say it was painful. NO abdominal pain or trouble breathing.

                                                On March 21, 2021 at around 5:30 I had fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness. The next day, March 22, I had heart palpitations, dizziness and still fever.  On March 24, 2021 at approximately 8:00 pm, my right leg became heavy and felt numb. On March 25 I woke up to my mouth locked with Bell&#39;s Palsy like drooping on the right side of my face.  My mouth remained unable to open fully for the next day and the numbness and pain in my leg increased.  On March 26 I went to the ER because I was afraid I was having a stroke. They gave me tests and said I did not have a stroke. They gave me steroids and they helped with my jaw but the pain in my leg increased. The pain in leg continued with more pain in my knee. I followed up with my family doctor and they sent me to have an ultrasound of my leg to check for a blood clot on April 9th No blood clot was found. Pain continued and increased so the doctor sent me for an MRI on April 14. MRI showed moderate effusions to the knee joint and I have an appointment with a orthopedic doctor on Tuesday April 20th. I continue to have stabbing pain in my knee and swelling and discomfort.

Also the left hand freezes up when I am hold the phone. At work if I am at the phone and writing with my right hand the left is freezing numb.  Bother hand also free when I am sleeping.  I thought it would go away but it has not. I got vaccinated on 3/25. I am a bit worried now. I called the doctor&#39;s office and hope I can see them this week.

At 6am I got up and was very dizzy. I had a bath to reduce the pain.  Dried off and blacked out. I awoke a few minutes later on the floor with a concussion which I am still not recovered from.  I do not know if there will be permanent damage.

It has been 12 days now and I still have muscle aches, lightheaded, cold sweats, fast heart beat, anxiety and insomnia. I have not been able to work since. Blood pressure has been up and down and doesn&#39;t seem to want to regulate itself like normal.

I had a headache, body aches fever and chills. I experienced nausea for a couple of days and a rash on my back. It was a bumpy rash started a week after the shot and is still present. I was very unsteady on my feet and needed help to the bathroom. I missed work that day but went to work the next day. I felt very poorly with no energy for a week. I was super achy and have no balance. I have gotten stabbing pains in my legs especially in my right thigh which dissipate after a while. It has been ten days and I am still very tired with intermittent headaches, but I was able to work out today. My leg pain is less often and less than it used to be.

Achiness on the left side of my face, neck and shoulders that lasted till the 8th day.   By the 14th day, the swelling in my left armpit had shrunk to the size of a large acorn with an enlarged vein like tissue protruding down my inner armpit.  This area was still sore.  On Day 21st I saw a doctor who suspected a blood clot and ordered an ultrasound at the hospital and blood work.  After an ultrasound for approximately an hour the technical did not detect a blood clot and sent me home. The doctor phoned me to tell me they did not find anything and that if the pain and swelling continues I could see a surgeon to have the enlarged area surgically removed.

I used my inhaler prescribed to me from having covid in November of 2020. That helped. Then about a week later I started to have leg pain. Not sharp pain, but achey pain in both legs that can not be controlled by Tylenol or Ibuprofen. It has been occurring every few days and some nights like last night are bothersome and I can not sleep well. Also after about a week, I had dryness and redness on the bottom part of my mouth and chin.  In the last week I have had flush on my neck and chest.  It is hot, sometimes causes dryness and pealing and is sometimes itchy.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

                                                About 5 or 6 hours after the shot , I developed body aches and chills and had a fever of 101. This lasted through the night, along with a sharp pain in my chest that developed in the night and radiated from front to back, which made it difficult to sleep. During the night, I took some rolaids and moved the couch to sleep more upright, because I think the pain may have been heartburn or some other GI thing (I rarely get this feeling, but I have had it before, and my last meal of the day was several hours before i went to bed and before my symptoms started). By morning the next day (Sunday), my whole left arm was achy, down to my hand and fingers, and my right arm also but not as severe. My left armpit felt tender (and still does today, but not as bad).  By mid-day, I started to feel better, the fever was gone, and by late afternoon, the body aches were gone. My left arm and hand was still tender, but not as bad. By Sunday night i would say I was back to about 80%, and by Monday morning, 95%, and by late Monday morning, back to normal, other than the slight tenderness I still feel (today being Tuesday) in my left armpit.

                                                I felt cold and back pain at 9:30pm the same day of the Vaccination. I shivered inside the blanket in the bed for an hour, then I got fever. I drank some Tylenol and fell in sleep. the next morning, I still have fever, felt so drowsy and the back pain still hurt, I slept whole day. I also felt chest pain in my left chest as well as some arbitrary pain in many places. I drank Benadryl twice. All symptoms gone when I got up the third day (22nd).

Up all night in extreme pain and with fever weakness body aches internal pain, migraine. took some oxy and ibuprofen in the early evening when pain got too bad to bear around I think 7pm. That helped, fever went down to 99, then the meds wore off chills and pain returned. Started taking oxy and ibuprofen every hour on the hour from 2am until 2pm following day when I was then able to sort of sleep for 2 hours. Stopped taking meds. Took NAC to protect against all that ibuprofen. Took warm bath with bathsalts. Still feel sick but head pain and muscle aches have receeded.

I went in to see my PCP and he checked me and only thing he came up with  due to my auto immune disease it triggered inflammation.  I&#39;m still in pain everywhere and can&#39;t touch certain parts of my body, my Dr. can&#39;t figure out where it&#39;s from and believes it&#39;s from the shot. If it&#39;s not better in a week he wants me to go back.

                                                I had the shot on weds afternoon. On Thursday I felt ill with flu-like symptoms, mainly body aches and headache. These symptoms were gone by Friday and I felt great. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:30am and needed to use the bathroom/, which is about 10 steps from my bed. As I entered the bathroom I completely blacked out, causing me to fall and break my ribs. This has never happened to me, and there was nothing else wrong with me (I spent 2 days in the hospital checking heart, brain, inner ear, etc). In addition to the 4:30am blackout, it also happened again several hours later at 11am, saturday morning. This time I again got so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stay on my feet, and while my husband was right there lowering me to the floor I was in a daze, a cold sweat, and absolutely no control over it.

                                                The night of my injection I woke up with extreme left arm and scapular pain.  It radiated down to my fingers.  It all was heavy and number and tingling.  That continued most of the day.  The next day I was extremely fatigued and weak and stayed in bed.  I think had left ear and lymph node pain on the left side of my face and neck.  This continued for days.  By the 1 week mark after my injection, I ended up at the urgent care with facial swelling and extreme lymph node pain.  They stated it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine.  As of yesterday, I continue to have some swelling in my jaw and occipital region as noted by the PTA where I go for physical therapy.  I continue to experience extreme fatigue, worse than normal and dizziness.  My left pinky still has some tingling and vibration feeling.  I also still get cramping on this finger and on the ulnar side of my palm.

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

Later that evening I experienced some difficulty breathing, severe muscle pain in my legs, arms and shoulders, and moderate to severe headache. Burning but no rash around my hips and back that felt like severe razor burn.  Today, I am still experiencing leg pain, burning sensation and headache.

                                                An immediate burning sensation at the vaccination site as the vaccine was being injected. The burning sensation spread from the injection site upward to my  neck all the way to my right ear. The burning sensation then started from my injection site down to my elbow. The burning sensation stopped after a few minutes, then I felt silently nauseous and lightheaded.   After waiting 15 minutes I felt fine enough to go home. However, the pain and stiffness in my neck was ongoing throughout the following day and night and was only slightly relieved with 500mg doses of Tylenol every 4-5 hours.  On a couple of occasions the day of and the day following the vaccination I did feel fleeting chest pain, but not enough pain or intensity to warrant a trip to the doctor. This morning (4-11/21) the aching sensation in my neck and arm (primarily neck) have lessened, but still present.

                                                5 hours after administration chills. Six hours after violently shaking, unable to get warm. Seven hours later temp 104.2 degrees on mercury thermometer and 103.8 on digital. Tylenol taken. Eight hours later unable to move due to shivers and shaking.  Husband and son believe should go to hospital, I did not lose consciousness so refused. Saturday 1AM temp not budge took Advil 400 mg by 0600 temp to 102. All day Saturday taking Advil 400 mg every 5 hours temp 102 and feeling wiped out. Sunday able to move around temp 101 with Advil. Monday AM temp 100 with out Advil-need to take day off of work. And since vaccination have had a feeling of nausea I can&#39;t shake. Today -three days later able to eat some but nausea continues.

                                                Approximately 5 hours post vaccine severe chills occurred for the next four hours. Intense shaking to try to warm up body, I used three comforters in room set to 70F in order to achieve any warmth. Just prior to the immediate onset of chills I felt tired as if at the end of a busy day. After severe chills I had extreme body aches mostly in lower half ( butt and legs and lower back). About midnight through the next 24 hours I had severe fever (~ 102 when measured), 2 x 200 mg ibuprofen did not reduce however 2 x 500 mg of tylenol did help but effects wore off before next recommended dose. Spent 24 hours in bed with fever the day after the vaccination. In addition to the severe chills and severe fever and sever body aches, there were times of nausea. Appetite was ok, actually hungry during the fever. 36 hours post injection still no arm pain, lower back starting to feel better, but still have small fever. I typically walk 3-4 times a week 4-5 miles each time, no medications, no high blood pressure, no allergies. Had flu shot in Sept 2020, no effects.

I had severe nausea, body and muscle ache through the night. My fever spiked as high as 103.5 several times during the first night. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and it did bring it down.  All symptoms continued through out the next day 04.09.21.  About 2 am on 4.10.21 I woke up and felt much better and that continued through out the day. Sunday 4.11.21 I started experience nausea again with slight fever of 101 no chills. I have since developed some nausea in the following days but no other symptoms.

                                                Vasovagal syncope.  Had vaccine on the 17th on the 25th in the early morning hours I got out of my bed, passed out or had a seizure in my kitchen.  Went to doctor 4 days later because I was in pain mainly in feet, was told I broke my foot.  I asked if vaccine could have caused it and was blown off by 3 different healthcare providers, I thought by law they were supposed t report adverse effects like this.

                                                Few days after vaccination on 3/23/21, started having chills, both arms felt heavy, tingly and pain, all bones ached, headache, diarrhea, abdomen hurt, stayed in bed all day. General malaise after this episode, symptoms come and go since then.  On April 7th, S/S resumed,  fell out of bed that morning since arms and legs felt minimal sensation and tingly, &#34;like I couldn&#39;t feel them&#34;. This went away after a short time and mobility returned. Ran fever (felt hot) first day of vaccination and off/on since then. Continues to not feel very good.  Referred to clinic for evaluation of symptoms.

                                                I became extremely dizzy and had to stop working for the day the day after the shot, originally thought it was my sinuses because of the dry air in the house but had never been that dizzy where I could not function and had to stop working.  Slight dizziness the following day intermittently but not too bad but dizzy while walking the dog midway through the  20 minute walk.  Woke fine the next day and the next. Saturday night it felt like I was coming down with something as I started running a small fever, felt burning hot, nausea( no puking), loss of appetite, dizziness, clouded head, stuffiness.  Thought it was allergies to the cat but I have never had such a reaction, ever, and I have been near this cat numerous times before.  Woke up in the morning feeling fine like nothing was wrong, except slight loss of appetite but was eating.  Have been fine since.

                                                I begun experiencing leg and chest pain about three  weeks after receiving the vaccination. On April 13, 2021 I contacted my PCP nurse triage; at which time I was instructed to dial 911 or go to the ER due to listed symptoms; thereafter my husband transported me to ER. I was examined by an ER physician who ordered an ultrasound of both legs; results were no concerns. I was instructed to take OTC Advil/Tylenol for pain along with an OTC acid reducer for chest pain and to follow up with my PCP as needed.

                                                I developed a low-grade fever nine hours after getting my shot on Wednesday morning. The next day, Thursday, I woke up with achy joints. Acetaminophen helped with the pain and the fever and so I felt better and was up and about by 3 pm that day. I was perfectly fine on Friday, but by Saturday late morning, I had a mild, migraine-like headache, like the feeling of having an elevated blood pressure. By late afternoon the headache started intensifying. I had a severe headache and great pressure in my head from Saturday night through Sunday night, and the acetaminophen wasn&#39;t helping much. By Monday morning, the pain had lessened, and I managed to get out of bed. It&#39;s been a week since I got vaccinated, and although I no longer have a headache, I am feeling woozy every now and then, like there is still pressure in my head.

Except minor pain from the arm, I felt all fine till going to bed that night. I started to get a headache and discomfort all over my body that night and couldn&#39;t sleep at all. Next day Apr 8th, my headache became much worse. I also felt extremely tired and got a low fever (98.3 - 99 F). I had to lie in bed for the whole morning. After taking Tylenol in the afternoon, my temperature came down to normal and my headache was also relived. I got a normal sleep Apr8th night, and felt all fine from Apr 9th till now (Apr 14th).

                                                I received my shot at 10 a.m. on a Thursday morning. Around 6 p.m. on the evening of the shot, I began experiencing severe chills, and I threw up once. The chills lasted approximately four hours. In addition, I had an extreme headache. Once the chills subsided, I began sweating profusely through my clothes. I still had the headache. Around 2 a.m. in the morning, I was unable to stand or speak for about an hour.  Once I was finally able to move again, my skin - not my body, but my skin - hurt all over. I could not lay on my back due to extreme pain in my skin, particularly the skin on my back, shoulders and buttocks. Anything that touched my skin, no matter how light of a touch, felt like I was being severely bruised. My skin was in pain for about four hours. The sweating continued through the following Sunday morning.  I soaked through multiple sets of clothing and woke up every morning completely drenched. When I weighed myself Sunday morning, concerned about dehydration, the scale reflected a 4.2 pound weight loss over the course of less than three full days.  The headache lasted through Tuesday, April 14th, a total of five days with a strong headache. I am still experiencing some sweating but not like the initial round of sweating. Because my shot was given on a Thursday, I only missed one full day of work. However, had the shot been given at the beginning of the week, I am confident that I would have missed at least three full days, it was so debilitating.

                                                The night of the vaccination (3/8), my body felt very hot (not fever) like it was going to catch on fire.  I took Tylenol to be safe and went to bed taking it as a sign that the vaccine was working.  I thought I was mostly over the next day, but four days later on 3/12, I started bleeding only two weeks after my last period, and the it was quite different than usual - very fresh blood and lots of it.  This continued for 15 days at time with very heavy flow - I bleed non-stop, and I worried that I was going to bleed to death.  The worst adverse effect happened 10 days after the vaccination on 3/18.  Out of blue without anything unusual, I started feeling very dizzy, nausea, and vomiting.  After much vomiting, nausea stopped, but the dizziness just got so bad, I couldn&#39;t move or even keep my eyes open (things were spinning even with my eyes closed).  I couldn&#39;t even stand up by myself.  This most horrible severe vertigo lasted two and got gradually better.  It took about 5 days before I felt safe enough to be alone by myself.  During this time, I had a excruciating headache on my left side.  It was so bad, I quickly took some painkillers which knock me out for a day.  The important thing is that I don&#39;t ever get headaches; this is the first one I had aside from one I had when going through IVF more than a decade ago.

                                                A couple of days after vaccine, I experienced more blood in my nose that was fresh and kind of clump-like as the day progressed. But I called the Dr and the doctor doesn&#39;t think it is sinus related. I switched nasal sprays - got off the Zyrtec and Flonase - and I got on Nasacort and I was better with the nasal issue when I did that. Then in the past, I have had discomfort on the left side of my ribs - on and  off - but the last week to week and a half it has been pretty consistent. For the rib issue, I&#39;m taking a med for that  - Naproxen. That med may have helped a little but I do still feel like I have something that is not right on that side of my body. It did not alleviate it completely.  April 7, I have had a bad leg cramp when I woke up and each morning since it felt like I was going to cramp up and they felt painful when I was sitting for a long period of time or when I was laying down getting ready to fall asleep. For the leg cramps, I am taking leg exercising and trying to get more Potassium in my diet. I saw a dr yesterday and he doesn&#39;t think they are related to the vaccine.

I got the vaccine at work and I continued to work, but about 2.00 p.m. I got a headache. I finished with work at 3.30 p.m. and I went to our nurse at work. She gave me some painkillers. When I came home, the headache was getting worse and I started to shake. My whole body was shaking and I got a fever. In the night my whole body started to be very painful and my head was horrible painful. My fever was 39,6 C. I was suffering next 5 days from pain. I had also a fever, but it wasn&#39;t so high like the first 3 days. I had all flu symptoms, but my head was the most painful. It was a pain I never had before and it didn&#39;t stop 5 days. After 5 days I still had pain, but it wasn&#39;t so horrible. I was in pain 8 days after the vaccine. I was very exhausted and I couldn&#39;t eat anything. After 8 days, I started to get my energy back and get back to normal life. But 3 days ago, I got a bad allergy. I don&#39;t know if the allergy is connected to the vaccine, but I never had any allergies in my whole life. I still have the allergy. I got some medications prescribed and a treatment creme, but nothing is really helping at the moment.

THE ER DID NOT FIND ANY REASON FOR HER FAINTING. SHE WAS HYDRATED AND THINKS IT WAS ANXIETY BROUGHT ON BY HER EXPERIENCE.  SHE CALLED ME TODAY 4/15/21 TO TELL ME ABOUT HER SYMPTOMS AND EXPERIENCE. SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD A NEW SYMPTOM OF A SHARP PAIN IN HER BACK SO I STRONGLY SUGGESTED SHE GO BACK TO ER TO CONTINUE TESTING IN CASE THE PAIN WAS SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE VACCINE INCIDENT. SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO TO URGENT CARE IF SHE FELT THE PAIN WAS BAD ENOUGH.

                                                After I drove up and got my shot, the people had me drive to the next parking lot and park.  We had to park every other space.  By the time I got parked, I started to feel dizzy.  I was afraid to tell anyone because I didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital.  At first, I felt extremely dizzy so that I would not have driven if I had been allowed.  Then, My heart then started to race for about 5 minutes before it started to calm down.  The person who gave me my shot wrote on my paper on my dashboard that I had to sit for 20 minutes after my shot.   I sat there for the whole 20 minutes and by the time I left, I felt much better, but it scared me it a bit.  I was told to beep my horn if I had a reaction, but I was afraid too.  I sat in my truck and waited to see if it got better or worse.  It did get better.  I was told by friends that I should report it so I am. I have been fine this week since that happened after the vaccination, without any dizziness or heart racing.  But, I am having pain in my left leg and I&#39;m a little worried about that because people are reporting blood clots.  I think I have a vein that is bad in that leg, although I have never been diagnosed with it.   That area has caused me pain in the past but I am so used to it that I normally just ignore it.  There&#39;s just a spot on my left thigh that hurts where I think the veins are bad.  Since the vaccination, I have had more pain in that area.  I don&#39;t know if I need to be concerned with that.  I have been trying to wait that out too.

I didn&#39;t know what it was as I hadn&#39;t considered it to be PMS. The next day, day 14 post vaccine, I got my period and ended up in bed with lower back pain, heavier than previous bleeding and headaches. Today, is day five of the menstrual bleeding. While the bleeding is lessening, the cramps and headaches are not. This is not typical for me based on my recollection of PMS/MS. I am concerned that the cramping and headaches have not subsided and I am concerned as to why I am having a period after 13 consecutive months of nothing.

Will continue prescribed Naproxen at this time and may also use tylenol. Should avoid any additional NSAIDS (ibuprofen, motrin). Rest and hydrate. Notified that we will check in with her on Thursday to see how she is progressing. Instructed to call wellness center sooner if symptoms are worsening.

                                                I am typing with an update of a possible issue with my Janssen Covid vaccine. I received it on March 31, 2021. I did not have any immediate ill effects noted other than a out of severe fatigue April 3/4, which may or may not have been vaccine related. I had a temperature 2 degrees above my normal for less than 24 hours on April 8 (99.7F temporal). I am currently having hotflashes which are not my baseline. I am aware that I am the age when I could be showing signs of menopause. I am also aware that the Mirena does not stop the symptoms of menopause. That said, I am aware that there have been questions related to female fertility and hormonal changes with the vaccines. I feel my new symptom of hotflashes should be reported for that reason. The hotflashes started on April 14, and having been growing in times per day I experience them (I had six yesterday, April 21). I do not believe I am having any life threatening ill effects, and do not seek an appointment at this time, but wanted to file a report. Thank you.

                                                I had 2 adverse reactions to the Janssen Covid-19 Vaccine EUA: AE #1) Roughly 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, the lower half of my face went numb for approximately 3 hours. The people who administered the vaccine made me stay at the site for about an hour and a half to make sure that the reaction did not get worse. AE #2) 10 days after receiving the vaccination, the lower part of my left leg began to swell significantly. I went to the emergency room on 4/13/2021. When I was there, they did tests and confirmed that I have a blood clot behind my knee. To treat the blood clot, the emergency room doctor gave me lovenox 110mg and warfarin 5mg. Since then, I have followed up with my primary doctor who has me taking warfarin 10mg ( 1x daily) and lovenox (as needed).

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included overweight, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 207A21A expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 06-APR-2021 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 07-APR-2021, the patient experienced a mild fever. On 08-APR-2021, the patient was achy and had a mild headache. The headache continued for several day and became pretty bad for about two days. On an unspecified date in Apr-2021 the patient was treated with Tylenol for headache. On 12-APR-2021, the patient experienced leg cramps in her right leg. On 15-APR-2021, the patient had an ultrasound and a blood clot was found in her right leg. The patient started on Apixaban (Eliquis). The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from headache on an unknown date in APR-2021, and the outcome of blood clot, ache, leg cramps and fever was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old female was found to have blood clot in her right leg 9 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. There was reported mild fever, headache, and &#34;aches&#34; 1 to 2 days after vaccination that was treated with Tylenol.  The symptom reported was leg cramps on right leg 5 days after vaccination, and ultrasound showed blood clot in her right leg 3 days after the symptom of cramps was noted.  No other laboratory/diagnostic test reported.  The patient was treated with apixaban.  The outcome of blood clot in leg was not reported.  Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.

Called clinic nurse for advice. Told me to keepdoing what I was doing. Fifth day started to dissipate to the point of not wanting to cry all the time and could resume normal activities, such as bathing, cooking etc. Sixth and seventh day the pain was still noticeable but did not take Tylenol or use heat anymore. Eight day pain was barely noticeable.

Also started feeling some tightness in the left eye today. Have a Dr appointment but on May 17th and going to urgent care today. Advised to go to HCF instead of urgent just to ensure they can get imaging, US and appropriate testing&#39;s to r/o all cause of complications.  4/20-f/u pc to caller; couldn&#39;t sleep last night; used a heating pad on her leg but didn&#39;t work; states both legs hurt; feel tight; 4/10 pain; worried when also saw spots on her left leg and became concerned because saw news of clots; the episode started with tightness of her right leg which progressed to most of leg as well as left leg. Has not gotten worse today and denies any concominant effects. Normally healthy. Did not go to the hospital because says she wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it. Has appointment with primary care in 2 weeks.   rec&#39;d that since she is still ok today then it&#39;s likely ok to skip the ER and go see MD as planned; warned to go to the ER right away or dial 911 if any of the following effects: sudden shortness of breath, severe headache, vision changes, loss of motor or/sensory function, chest pain. Call us back if having any effects at all besides the ones already noted so we may help determine if needs ER care.

                                                After the vaccination, I felt a little dizzy waiting in the parking lot and had a sore arm, but felt fine otherwise.  (12:00-1:00 pm)  After returning home, I felt increasingly tired and warm.  I laid down  and took my temperature after walking the dog around 3:00 pm.  My temperature read 99 degrees.   I drank a lot of pedialyte to hydrate.  Throughout the afternoon, I felt sluggish and the glands seemed to swell up on the side of my neck. I also got a headache.   My temperature dropped down to 98.7 before I went to bed, but this morning, my glands under my jawline are a bit more swollen and I still have a slight temperature; 98.9 degrees.  My eyelids are puffy and I feel a little feverish, but it is tolerable.

Emergency Department Attending Attestation Note   See resident/PA/student note for further details of HPI, history, exam, ED course, and diagnoses.   Briefly, this is a 51 y.o. female with PMH reviewed in chart and w/ patient notable for insulin dependent diabetes, depression, prothrombin mutation, migraine, p/w concern for allergic reaction.  Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.

                                                Day of shot (April 1): Immediately after shot, left arm was sore. Developed fatigue at 2pm. A few hours later, I had a 101 fever, chills, stronger fatigue, strong headache, muscle aches. Around 6pm, I began vomiting continuously. I spoke with an advice nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room. I continued to vomit until about 11:30pm, I was weak and felt like passing out a few times. Later in the evening, I took a Tylenol and finally went to sleep. On April 2nd (day after shot), I woke up with fatigue and headache, but fever was gone and I no longer vomited. I took another Tylenol and headache went away.

                                                Pain at the injection site shortly after the injection. Pain and tenderness in bicep began generally later the first day and lasted 2 weeks; I still have some bicep stiffness and tenderness today on Day 18. I had tenderness under the right armpit for about a week (assumed swollen lymph nodes).I had redness on the bicep below the injection site on Days 5-7. I also was tired on Day 2, 3, and 16 and took short naps. I experienced some muscle twitching in the bicep on Day 1, which still continues. On Day 6, I woke up with muscle twitching all over my body, randomly and intermittently. I was able to go about my day normally, but every few minutes something would twitch for a few seconds (my right arm, my left arm, my left knee, my right hip, my lower back, my left pointer finger, my left eyebrow, my diaphragm, etc). I drank a lot of fluids and took magnesium, zinc, D, B, C, omegas, turmeric, a multivitamin, and ate a banana for potassium on Day 6 and 7. Day 7 and 8, I only had muscle twitching in the right bicep again. Starting on Day 9 and continuing through the present, I continue to have intermittent twitches lasting a few seconds all over my body again. It is less frequent than on Day 6, but continues.

I went to the Urgent Care on March 16; I was sent to the ER where I stayed overnight. They ruled out heart related issues and blood clots. I had a follow up appointment on March 26; he said that he had seen patients who experienced the same, and it was due to the vaccine. Unlike them, my pain remained. He thinks that the vaccine triggered something else in me. After his appointment, I saw my orthopedist who prescribed meds to help with leg pain. If pain is not better in a month, then he will order a MRI. I saw my rheumatologist Monday, April 5. She is going to work with my orthopedists to treat me. Currently, I am doing the exercises that were prescribed for me to do at home, and I am on pain meds.

                                                I received my vaccine about 3pm Sat. April 3rd. About an hour or so later I started to feel ?run down? but nothing major. At 9pm I began getting chills but did not feel feverish. By 9:15 my body was aggressively trembling. Even my teeth were chattering. I could not control the shaking. I put many layers of blankets on me and turned my heat up to 80 in an effort to get warm. At some point I dozed off. I woke up at 12:30am and had a fever of a little over 101 degrees.  I fell asleep about 3am, still aggressively shaking.  I woke up at 9am (April 4th) and my head was throbbing. My fever was now 102.2. Also, every muscle in my back and shoulders ached. I sat up because I needed to get to the kitchen for some water. Once I stood up, my body felt like it was weighed down by heavy sandbags. I could barely walk to my kitchen and back. I went back to bed and covered up in massive blankets and tried to stay still. I did not take any pain reliever because I was too nervous to.  I never had any nausea but smells bothered me and I had no appetite. My fever stayed at 102.2 until I went to sleep (around 10pm).  Monday (April 5th) I still had chills but much milder. My temp was just over 101 all day. My head felt better but my muscles still hurt. By late evening (10pm) my fever was just over 99 degrees. I was feeling better and I no longer had chills.  Tuesday (April 6th) I woke up fever free. I felt mostly normal again except for my muscle aches.  Today is Friday (April 9th) and I continue to have muscle aches. The worst of it is in my lower back and it?s pretty severe. It feels like I lifted heavy weights with my lower back muscles. I have not been seen by a Doctor yet as I have no insurance. I?m not sure if I need to or not.   I wanted to contact you because I am a healthy person and what I experienced was BRUTAL. I have NO IDEA how a frail or vulnerable person could go through what I went through. Also, people need to know that they may have to take time off of work to deal with these side effects.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction which began immediately upon injection at 2:45Pm (roughly) into arm with wide spread hives covering the entire right arm and spread to left arm right leg. Head and neck, face became numb and I felt like I was going to pass out. Neck numbness/swelling moved to front of neck within five minutes. Itching of left leg. Was able to maintain consciousness but was very out of it. Possibly from lack of oxygen when neck and head swelled. Began to lose ability to recite address or remember address by the time was placed in paramedic van. Paramedic put IV in hand. Paramedics administered ephedrine, Benadryl, prednisone and reaction subsided. Was taken directly to hospital arrived there for monitoring by 3:15 Pm . Felt much better at hospital.  Had one wave/head rush where it felt like the reaction was starting again and may pass out but that subsided and they continued to monitor. Had a few waves of nausea which did not last long. The IV placed in hand by paramedic was infiltrated so attempts at giving fluids failed and it was never corrected at hospital. After 2 hours of monitoring I was told to go home and given a prescription for steroids. I was asked to monitor for the remainder of the night for any trouble breathing. Night sleep was not good waking often with one occasion of wheezing which subsided after taking Benadryl. Continue to monitor.

My stomach became upset and my temperature continued to climb to 102.8. My head ached for about 6 hours. I had chills &amp; my stomach was cramping. I had the shakes and I attempted to reach out to my doctor. As I waited to hear from my doctor, most of my symptoms subsided the next day.

I got this sensation about 4 times that day. Twice at vaccine facility and 2 more times at home that same day. Then in the past couple of weeks I?ve had numbness in the right side of my face, arm/hand and leg/foot. Sharp pains in my head, PVC, eye pressure, vision issues, shortness of breath, electric shock sensations through my body, head tingling. Not sure the cause of these symptoms but the only different/new thing was the vaccine.

                                                I had terrible pain in the calves of both legs but the left side more.  It began within two hours of getting the vaccine and worsened over the night.  I woke up at about 4:00 a.m. with a severe cramp in the left calf and I had to jump around until it loosened up.  It was extremely sore afterwards.  I was exhausted all day on Wednesday and my legs hurt the entire day.  By Thursday my legs were a little better and by Friday it was significantly better.  I am still feeling some pain in my left calf but it?s not all the time.

So very cold... had to put on sweat pants to sleep in  took an Aleve at 2 am and again the next day  at 8 am and 2pm and more more at 6 pm.  ran a low 100 degree fever all day the next day.  6 am day two:  Seems to be back to normal.  Don&#39;t know about anything internally. I did feel the shot injected into my arm and it stung and I could feel it &#34;run down&#34; in the arm.   Outside the arm, the injection site seems to just be a tiny sore... nothing that is detracting for me.

                                                Maybe 2 or 2 1/2 weeks after getting the vaccine, the injection site became itchy, red, a little bit raised, and hot to the touch I would say the area of redness was probably about 2 inches in diameter. I had the usual arm soreness/tenderness right after the injection, which went away within a few days, so this was a later reaction that started with itching. Even 4 1/2 weeks later, it still itches from time to time, though the redness, swelling and heat are gone.

Around 6:00pm the same day I received vaccine, I started getting chills and strong aches in my back and legs. I felt very dizzy, lightheaded and sleepy. Chills were gone by the next morning, but aches and sleepiness continued for 4 days. Dizziness and lightheadedness continues til now. A little over a week after vaccination, I had random bruising on my legs on the same side I received vaccine. My lymph nodes were visibly swollen and my breasts felt extremely tender. Bruises are still healing, but lymph nodes and breasts seem relatively normal now, exactly 3 weeks after initial vaccination

It felt much like an injection would if you were getting a filling at the dentist.  I couldn&#39;t see any swelling or puffiness but definitely numb.  This passed within the first few hours. - first two days - I was very sore and achy in my muscles all over my body, but on the third day it was centralized to just the muscles on my upper arm and under the arm kinda into the &#34;peck&#34; area I believe it would be called. - day 6 - today I have mild diarrhea and a slight upset stomach.

She experienced severe chest pain, pain that radiates through her arm to her hands, numb tingly hands, dizziness, nausea, and SOB.  This event lasted about 5 to 10 minutes. The remainder of the week she continued to experience mild discomfort, SOB, dizziness, heart palpitations, and lethargy.

As the week continued my normal nausea intensified as well as having a headache and began to have episodes of becoming extremely warm with sweat and then was cold. I did not eat this week except very minimal crackers or toast.  Thursday I vomited, Friday I stayed home from work and vomited again. Saturday- Sunday I did not work but slept all day. Monday, I had a work appointment that I went to.  It lasted about 2 hours when I vomited some more. Tuesday-Wednesday while I wanted to go to work, did not feel at all confident in my ability to not vomit as well as hot and cold spells. My abdomen has been distended throughout this with several days of not being comfortable touching this area  I have not seen a physician, however health department said I should report this and I did email   my gastroenterologist at the university  about what I have been experiencing

Onset of right eye not blinking/closing. * MAR 21st = Emergency Room.  Diagnosed w/ BELLS PALSY.  [Ruled out stroke]  The following week after my vaccination (approximately MAR 15th), I experienced a strange feeling at the back of my throat.  It can best described as a &#34;sore throat&#34;.  I noticed it upon waking up.   I could feel it at the back of my throat when swallowing;  the act of swallowing would enable me to &#34;feel&#34; the sensation at the back of my throat.  This was unusual and not normal for me.  I thought I was coming down with a cold virus.  I had not been sick for over a year and thought it was a strange feeling.  I was concerned.  With the recent schools, restaurants, and gyms opening up with less restrictions, I learned from coworkers that there was an increase of illnesses  because our immune systems are not as strong and germs are easily transferable during the usual interactions.  Therefore, I expected my sore throat to be the start of a harmless cold virus.   Then, later in the week (MAR 19th), I noticed my eyes were abnormally dripping tears.  It is my experience that I get this effect in the office setting or during winter when my eyes are &#34;dry&#34;.  However, I was neither in the workplace (office), nor was it winter.  I was not sure why my eyes had excessive tears coming out.  Finally, on SUN (MAR 21st), an obvious physical symptom finally became apparent to me and my family members.  My speech was impaired.  I could not chew properly.  I could not drink from a cup.  I struggled during breakfast.  I was not sure if I was having a STROKE.  I recited the alphabet to hear for a slurred speech.  I looked in the mirror, and my smile was not perfect.   I got dressed and went to the Emergency Room.   The doctors performed physical PUSH-PULL tests, eye tests, etc.   DIAGNOSIS = Bells Palsy.     OTHER SYMPTOMS = &#43; shortness of breath.  &#43; leg swelling.  &#43; headaches.  &#43; excruciating pain in the neck, especially during sleep (laying down).

                                                Right after the dose I got an immediate headache, dizzy and light headed. About an hour later I became nauseous and my face became very flush red and hot. I went to bed and woke up feeling like I got hit by a truck and was very tired with a sore arm. By the next day I was better. The following week I began with a red hot circle on my arm where the shot was given, it had a ring around it. That lasted for about a week. I then started to get stinging sensations in that part of my arm like I was being stung by a bee. These lasted for about 2 days. I then started getting muscle rolls/spasms in the same spot on that arm. They lasted about 3 days. I then started having pain in that arm like I had just gotten the shot and as I was rubbing it, I noticed a large indent in my arm. I went to the doctor, and they said they had no idea why it happened but if I get more symptoms to come back. The doc appt was on 4/12/21. It has been over a month of these side effects. Doctor not sure if it will be a permanent disfigure.

They feel like a muscle spasm, lasting only seconds, but repeat within minutes for hours.

I ate a banana, drank lots of water and took a magnesium capsule to help with the leg cramp. and by 1pm I started to develop a headache.  I did not report because I have frequent headaches.  It intensified as the day progressed.  after Sunday, this became a daily occurrence. Early afternoon I would start to get intense headaches and i would go home take benadryl and sinus medicine to help  ease the pain.  Continued on daily until Saturday April 17th when my headache became so bad I could not stand it anymore.  I was nauseous and shaking.  No fever but profuse sweating and weakness.  Went to the ER around 930pm and was released around 12am after they gave me an IV with anti nausea meds and benadryl.  Sunday I was weak with headache all day.  Woke up today (Monday 4/19) with a headache and felt fatigued and severe headache.  It does not feel like a sinus headache nor tension, nor hormonal.

My lower legs, feet, hands, left arm and chest begin to tingle. After sitting a few minutes it did not get worse. The tingling is not constant now, but I am still having it. Seems like I have it in the left arm more often than anywhere else.  Within 20 minutes of the shot I began having gastrointestinal issues., that progressed.  It built into strong chest pressure, acid reflux and indigestion. I got into the Dr on March 25. He prescribed Nexium. I am now having significant hair loss and have started having heart palpitations. I am waiting on his response as to what tests are needed to proceed.

                                                By 6pm I noticed something wasn?t right. I could t get warm, even when sitting in the sunshine. By 9pm the chills had turned to fever. My temperature at 9pm was 101.2F.  I also had a headache and started to feel a bit shaky.  By 10pm I had body aches and was in bed with 3 blankets on me and still could not get warm. My temp was 102.7 at 10pm. I tried to sleep. At midnight I awoke to a fever of 104.8 and could only cry. The worst body aches, headache, racing heart and dizziness, nausea and vomiting (after additional aspirin were taken to relieve the fever). I was very weak in an alarmingly rapid period. I stayed in this condition until approximately 6:30am on 4/26. At 7am my temp was 102.5 and I found it hard to make it back and forth to the bathroom, due to dizziness and weakness. By noon, the temp was back up to 103.1 and I could barely cry, as I suspected I was then  close to dehydration. I focused on hydration and slept as much as possible. The fever slowly came down to its current 100.4 at 11pm on 4/27.  This has been an alarming reaction to a vaccine. I have had serum sickness previously, so maybe that is a factor that should also be considered. I hope this is helpful.

                                                Pt called call center regarding symptoms after getting J&amp;J vaccine  on 4/10. Pt was upset that she had to repeat her symptoms when she was transferred to advice nurse. Pt stated multiple times that her symptoms were only on both arms. She denied any emergency symptoms and declined to answer the rest of call center staff questions. I advised the patient that I need to ask screening questions prior to making a telephone MD appt. Pt stated again, that her symptoms were localized only to both arms and had some pain. Staff explained to the interpreter, at this time there are no urgent care appts available, pt would need to go to Urgent Care or ED to be evaluated. Translator repeated once more, and no response from pt. Pt disconnected from the call. called patient back, no answer.

The next day the sore throat was gone, and body aches got worse. All my joints ache. I felt chilled in spite of outdoor temperature of 79, and a hot bath, blankets and sitting in front of a fire. It was 74 inside the house. I started to get a bit of a headache but it never developed into a full headache. At about 6pm (day 2) I started to get  hot. Anything touching my skin bothered me.   At about 7pm (day 2) I took two Tylenol and the symptoms improved by about  8:30pm.

Next morning fever, fatigue, deep muscle pain across back of shoulders concentrated at base of neck, headache, ringing in ears.  Later that night, severe sudden muscle spasms on left side of lower back....spun me around and doubled me over...left me feeling a little breathless.  Next morning (day 3), still some deep muscle pain now dispersed across back,. Less burning at injection site, fever but less, coughing up some clear glen from lungs....breathing ok though, still fatigued.

                                                On Friday 03-12-2021, went to wash my face and my whole face was red, flushed and very itchy. I then went to sleep and on Saturday morning when I woke up my right wrist was itching a lot as well as  my legs, buttocks and hands. All over my body was red and very itchy. I did not sleep due to the itchiness on Saturday night. I developed little red bumps on my entire body. I ate lentils for food but I do not think it was the food. I went to urgent care and saw a doctor who gave me Benadryl, took one dose and then it slowly started to go away.

                                                Vaccination was 10:30 am.  Around 6:30 pm, my right knee started to throb.  I took an epsom salt bath, where my upper back started to hurt.  I went to sleep around 8:00.  I woke up around 10 pm unable to open my eyes all the way.  I believe they were swollen nearly shut.  I could see a slit of light coming in from outside.  I couldn&#39;t move my left hand at all (left arm is where I received vaccination).  I held it up to the outside light, and it was swollen.  The light coming in from outside hurt my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t see enough to call for help.  Around 1:30 a.m., the swelling went down enough for me to open my eyes.  I have never seen them look so bloodshot.  It was scary.  I could move my hand again as well.  I spent next day in bed resting.   Monday, I noticed a small rash on my right shoulder.  I went to work and was there about 20 minutes before I started feeling hot and dizzy.  I went home and spent the day in bed.   I was able to go to work the next day, Tuesday, without problem.  One week after vaccination, the rash on my shoulder went away, but a small rash broke out on my right shin.  This one was deeper.  One week later, there are just a couple of small scabs left in the spot on my shin.  I feel my energy level is close to normal.

Around 4pm the same day I had bad neck pain. And pounding heading, about 1 hour later starting getting chills and fatigued. By 10pm had body aches and muscles pains. I took some Motrin and went to bed. I couldn?t sleep as my mind kept racing. In the morning (day after vaccine) I was feeling worse. All symptoms continued in full force and I couldn?t get out of bed. 10am I was able to drink some Alka seltzer cold medicine and lay back down. I continued to have chills pounding headache bodyaches muscle aches and sweating, but no fever. I felt like I had a bad case of the flu. I?ve continued taking 600 mg Motrin every eight hours and this has helped with the pains and bodyaches. Day 3 woke up feeling much better, noticed a funny smell in my nose, I haven?t been blowing my nose or had any mucus, but I can?t explain the smell. I still have body aches and muscles pains.

                                                There is some pain at the injection site.  The day after I got the shot I was very tired.  Later that night I started to get a headache and realized I had a low temp fever.  My daughter had the same symptoms as I did.  She received the shot right before me so the lot number is the same as mine.  This is 3 days later and I am ok except my arm is still a little sore.

She drank some water and then we took her blood pressure. she started to feel better and then felt a tighness in her neck. I retook her blood pressure and it was elevated. She then began having the chills, upon the last reading of blood pressure we call emergency services because it was elevated again. The last time we took her bp before emergency services came the reading was better. Ems checked her vitals and after a while let her decide whether or not she needed to go the hospital. She chose to leave and her son drove her home.

The chills broke in the morning at some point, then I just had a severe migraine and body aches. My migraine finally broke at 11pm. The following day 1/2/2021 I was back to normal and felt no more symptoms. The first day after the shot 1/1/2021 however was very bad.

I will not be able to get to speak to my Dr. until Friday 4/9 due to his vacation.  The nurse was not helpful today and suggested I go to a walk-in clinic.

Started with some chills and then at 2:00 a.m. (4/2/21) I had a fever of 103.9, chills, shakes and heavy breathing.   I felt froze to the bone.  Took 2 Tylenol for the fever and it went down to 102.4 for approximately 12 hours.  My feet were very sore for the first 48 hours and hurt to walk on them.    For the next two days, had a fever of 101-102 along with periods of heavy sweating that got worse during the nights.  This lasted for three days/nights.   Since I had the shot one week ago, I have been experiencing the same sore feet and have different aches and pains that appear in my body.   They kind of feel like a muscle ache after a Charlie horse and it happens in my calves, back of the legs and back area throughout the day.   I am experiencing fatigue during the day .  I did not have any nausea  with the vaccine.

I headed home around 4 pm and started to feel warm, but thought it was the sun. Around 5:15 I got the chills, very bad. So bad my jaws were shaking. I tried to use a heating blanket to get warm, but was very miserable. About an hour later I started running a fever that kept going up. My ears started to hurt and the ringing was really bad. By 8:30 my fever had spiked to 102 and I was so nauseous I had a hard time moving around, I almost used the bathroom on myself twice. Started burning up but still unable to move, I went outside to cool down and had a family member take me to the urgent care. They said my arm was swollen from the injection site and that everything was normal and that it was a good thing I was having these experiences because it means the vaccine was working.  Gave me nausea medicine and aspirin and sent me home. I was unable to sleep from all the pain in my body and just laid here in pain starting to get really hot. Woke up around 4 soaking wet where I broke the fever and then continued to have a mild fever all day Sunday, April 11, with mild sweats on and off when my body would get too hot. Today just been trying to move around but very tired and exhausted. Had hard time sitting up to do some work at the table, so been laying down most of the day.

It is now the second day after vaccination, body aches have lessened, mild grade fever, no chills.

Within an hour the right side of my face and ear started to hurt, almost like it felt burnt, The nerve endings was super sensitive and has still not gone away. That night I didn&#39;t feel good, tired and out of it. On the third day I woke up with a rash on various parts of my body and moved to my eye lids as well. I called for a telehealth, and asked for a low dose steroid and he said not because I would &#34;disrupt my immune response&#34;.  I&#39;m still having issues.

Chills continued through the night and were better but not gone by morning. Saturday: Awakened with headache. Headache and fatigue improved throughout the day. Sunday: headache was mostly gone, but still feeling low-energy and light headed after a period of activity. Monday: Felt much better in the morning, but tried standing at my desk after lunch and felt moments of light-headedness, and felt low-energy. Tried to weight train at 6pm and broke out in sweat with minimal exertion. Tuesday - I still don&#39;t feel quite right - energy level is still less than normal, with occasional moments of light headedness.

I woke about 11-12pm with my surgical sight burning and hot pain. I took my pain medication but it didn&#39;t touch it. After about 3-4 hours in which I took another pain pill, a muscle relaxant and a sleep pill, the pain and burning subsided. The site was then sore along with my left arm where I received the site. Today 4/13/2021 is the first day I feel good.

                                                on 3/24 I had a TIA with an intense heat pressure behind the right temple which resulted in complete numbness, heaviness, and tingling on my entire right side of the my body.  I was transported by ambulance to the hospital. A CT and MRI was done, no signs of blood clots or stroke.  I am still experiencing numbness and tingling in the right arm. Follow up appointments with the eye doctor indicate additional vision loss in the right eye with pressure behind the eye. I have a follow up appointment today with the neurologist for a brain scan and tomorrow for an eeg. My PCP, eye doctor, and neurologist believe it may be a blood flow issue. I have not had this type of event before.

These symptoms lasted without break for approximately 4 days/nights at which it tapered off.  Also, on the morning of Sunday 4/11/21 I  noticed a vein that seemed to &#39;inflate&#39; on my Left upper forehead and pulsed for a few minutes and then subsided with the feeling of a slight headache mostly on the Left side.

By Day 2 post-vaccine, all symptoms were gone.  Approximately 1 week later, I developed pain in my legs where the knee and calf connect.  It was not overwhelming and only lasted approximately one day.

                                                Day of vaccine:  within a few hours of receiving the vaccine (around 12:00pm or 1:00pm), I developed a headache, body aches, pain at the injection site, and brain fog.  The brain fog was such that I could no longer work, so I laid down.  Late in the afternoon (around 4:00pm), I developed numbness and tingling in my finder tips.  This continued to get worse, particularly when walking around, so I continued to rest.  Around 9:00pm, I was also getting dizzy when walking.  I went to bed, and awoke symptom-free in the morning.  Treatment included bed rest, ibuprofen, applied heat, and increased fluid intake.  Day after vaccine: I had the first HSV-2 outbreak I&#39;ve had in 5 years.

She got the vaccine, the night of the vaccine around 5:30 she got a raging headache (she does get reactions to most vaccines).  She took Tylenol and her arm did hurt.  The next day she was still really hurting, her headache was really, really bad, and it stayed until Sunday.  Then on Sunday she was ok.  On Monday when she went to work and her right arm went limp, and while she was walking her right leg gave way and almost fell, grabbed hold and steadied herself.  The raging headache/migraine came back and she started getting nauseous, her lower back hurt, her upper neck area hurt like somebody was pounding her neck.  Then she got diarrhea and really really tired on Monday and Tuesday and also had loss of appetite.  Then yesterday 4/13/201 she just had the headache and a sound in her ear, went to UC and got drops for it.  Her temperature was 96.5, and her normal is 98.7, and was told that she was really cold.  Her PB was really high and the doctor took it again but it was not as high, attributed it to anxiety.  Last night the lower abdomen pain started, feeling like she was getting her period which she has not had in over a year.  She saw a little blood on her panty liner, and was thinking she was going to have a period, but the pain is excruciating in her lower abdomen.   She has also taken Tylenol off and on for her symptoms, and feels like she is cramping.     She is having hot/cold flashes as well, and has not had these issues from menopause.

                                                On March 25th I got my Johnson and Johnson vaccine.  Since I got the vaccine, I&#39;ve been getting headaches, dizziness, nausea and hot flashes on my face.   On April 8th, I saw my primary. He believes it&#39;s related to my perimenopause changes. I also went to the ER had blood work and an MRI. No explanation of the results just that everything was ok.  My concern are the headaches. It feels  like pressure in my head. I never had these types of headaches prior to taking the vaccine.

                                                The day after I received the vaccin I experienced an extreme tension in my two eyes that I still have now but not as intense. My left eye is the most affected - The blood flows really fast in the eye and it is pulsing. I don&#39;t have the sensation every day now but still on and off. Both of my eyes feel tension not as much as it was at the beginning but still experiencing symptoms of pressure and pulsions. It feels like I am going to have an ophthalmic migraine. My eyes doesn&#39;t feel right either. Overall, I felt weak, highlighted and it felt like if I was experiencing  feeling of &#34;dissociation&#34; - caused I think by my sight being affected.  I couldn&#39;t do a lot as my energy was very low and it felt that my oxygen wasn&#39;t at its maximum. Every small activity required a lot of energy and I could barely walk around my block. It affected my work and I couldn&#39;t teach at the end of that first week. I wasn&#39;t feeling good. I went to my doctor on Monday, April 12th as I was concerned about blood clot or other neurological and pulmonary issues. My Doctor examined me and listened to me and concluded that the sides effects were taking longer than the average to go away. The following day I woke up reading about the blood clots due to J&amp;J vaccin. I called back my doctor and we did a blood test. It came back negative and I got my eyes checked by my ophthalmologist too, and he didn&#39;t see anything.

By 11 hours post, I was shivering uncontrollably and had migraine-like headache.  By 13 hours post I had to shed blankets for the fever and sweating. Even taking ibuprofen the fever was high.  The next day I kept taking pain medication for severe body aches. This morning, second morning post injection, I let the pain meds wear off.  I discovered I still had body aches, occasional stabbing head pain, and tingling down my left arm and into my 3rd and 4th fingers.  Currently, third evening post injection, I?m still aching but everything is noticeably improved. I don?t need pain meds anymore.

Did not sleep well much Friday night due to these symptoms.  Sudden pain in left side of my head about 40 min after the vaccine after I walked to the car and sat down after the 30 min wait. Pain starts as a slow dull ache, increases rather sharply, then goes away quickly. Have this pain several times or so yesterday and today even after taking ibuprofen.   Also pain in my neck with what feels like stress headaches with ibuprofen relieving it.

                                                While lying in bed, I started to experience severe chills that made my entire body convulse violently, My right arm, for instance, was shaking back and forth about 3 inches. M legs were involved, tensing up and shaking as well. The symptoms resolved in about 15 min. as I focused on relaxed breathing and held a heating pad against my body. The following day, my legs felt very weak (as I would have expected.) I did not seek medical treatment, since the episode had ended.

She went to sleep at 1130pm on the day she received her vaccine. At 4am the following morning, she woke up and her whole body was convulsing--the muscles in her arms and legs were shaking, her hands were balled into fists, and her jaw was clenched. She reported that her husband woke up and asked her if she was ok to which we was able to respond, but cannot remember what she said. She reports that her husband said the episode lasted 3-4 minutes, but that she felt like it lasted an hour. When the episode was over, she was spacey and confused. She did not get out of bed. 10 minutes later, a second episode occurred. This time her left arm and right leg began convulsing, but the rest of her body was unaffected. This episode lasted 2-3 minutes and then ended.

                                                Had initial onset of arm pain (generalized) and injection site soreness within 12 hours. Over 3-5 days, the acute symptoms gradually cleared. However, a localized, subcutaneous swelling (a &#34;knot&#34;) remains at the time of this report which is day 12. The &#34;knot&#34; is slightly painful when rubbed; has not seemed to decrease in size.  It is questioned if the injection needle placement might be a factor, since the same size needle is used for my tiny, skinny arm (I am Asian, 100 lbs) as is used for my caucasian husband whose arm is 3 times the size as mine.

On the second day following the injection, I still had the headache but it diminished with each passing hour. In addition, on that second day following the injection I was incredibly weak which lasted into the third day following the injection. In fact, on the fourth day I still had some weakness and dizziness but was able to function.

Three days after the injections, I came down with flu-like symptoms (achy, brain fog, headache, fatique, chills) This lasted for three days. I started to feel better for a day and then came down with upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat, fatique , stuffy nose, slight cough, brain fog, no energy, loss of appetite)  As of today over two weeks from injection, I&#39;m STILL feeling off.  Symptoms are like having a mild cold with no energy.

I still feel like more core is on fire, but it has subsided and is less concerning as it was on Friday, 3/26/2021, and Saturday, 3/27/2021  My eyes became sensitive to light on Friday, 3/26/2021 night and my eyes are still sensitive especially to artificial lighting. Natural light hurts as well but is more tolerable.  My heart rate definitely increased Friday, 3/26/2021 through Saturday, 3/27/2021 however I did not experience the other symptoms on the critical list (such as inability to breathe) therefore did not go to the hospital.  I suffered from muscle weakness on Friday, 3/262021, and Saturday, 3/27/2021. The muscle weakness was only in my legs.

                                                3/29/2021- received vaccine around 12:15pm  Within 3 hours, I was extremely &#34;hyper&#34;  My husband noticed that my entire left arm (which received the shot) was a different color than my entire right arm.  I did not sleep at all Monday night. 3/30/2021- felt fine until about 1:00pm when I noticed body aches.  It worsened from then until bedtime.  My hands, feet, and back hurt the worst.  I asked my husband to rub my back, and he gasped when I lifted my shirt.  My entire midback area was covered in a bright red, raised rash with blisters. I took Benadryl and applied betamethasone prescription cream (which I use for poison ivy or bug bites).  My hands also itched, so I used the cream on my hands as well. I was sweating profusely but freezing.  Took my temperature several times but it was never over 98.  I could not sleep well, awake for an hour, asleep for 5 minutes off and on all night. 3/31/2021- I notified my primary care physician of the allergic reaction via the patient portal.  His reply was to take Benadryl, which I was already doing every couple hours.  The itchy back rash remained and more blisters formed.  By the time I finished working, the redness was gone but the blisters remained.  Itching stopped.  Body aches were lessening. 4/1/2021- Rash completely gone, itching completely gone.  Feeling lethargic (possibly due to lack of sleep, but maybe from the vaccine).  One large blister (size of a quarter) and several smaller blisters remain. 4/2/2021- as of now, my left arm is still a bit sore when I raise it over my head.  Main concern is the huge blister that is still on my back.

                                                4/6/21 I awoke with symptoms of numbness/paralysis on left side of face limited to  upper lip and cheek area and both eyes would not stop watering. Movements to drink or make facial expressions were limited due to the numbness.  Because I have sensitive skin  I thought I may have had some type of reaction to something. So I waited to see if it would clear up through the day. I was not experiencing any other symptoms. By that evening it was apparent that I was not getting better and possibly getting worse because I began to experience some noticeable drooping in my cheek area. I decided to call my doctor in the morning. Because I am currently out of town, my home doctor suggested I see a local ER to rule out a stroke and determine if I was experiencing Bell&#39;s Palsy. I went to an ER clinic on 4/7/21

Continued to experience palpitations, dizziness and nausea throughout the afternoon. Within 2 hours, headache and extreme fatigue started and are still present 5 days later. Also experienced shortness of breath, worsening of asthma symptoms and lightheadedness. Woke up on the 5th morning with delayed reaction at injection site. No visible rash or bruise at this time, but hard lump at site and entire upper arm feels very bruised and sore to the point that it hurts to lift the arm. Ibuprofen is all I have taken for it. Will see a doctor if not improved in the next two days.

                                                After about 7 minutes of getting the Janssen Covid-19 vaccines, patient husband said patient is not feeling well.  I attended to patient immediately.  She said she is not feeling well, and her eye was rolling (as if when she tried to look up and couldn&#39;t get their eye to remain open) a for about few seconds and then she her eye was open back to normal.  She was sweating on both hands and face were cold to the touch.  I got the manager from the store to help me lie patient flat on the floor&#39;s surface gently to prevent her from falling off the chair.    Based on this our adverse event protocol, patient exhibited similar symptoms to Syncope (paleness, sweating, coldness of extremities), so I patient is lying flat on the floor, feet elevated, and cold compression was apply on her arms and face.  Unfortunately, patient conditions was not improving as it seem but she was alert and able to breath (fast pace) the whole entire time the incident occurred where she answer all questions when we myself, then the paramedics asked her questions.  Paramedic arrived at scene within 10 minutes after individual got off the phone with 911.  They took her away around 9 am and said patient probably experience anxiety attack.

In the morning of 4/1 - I realized I had numbness in both feet and genitals. The numbness is severe in my right foot and toes. Left foot has numbness in my heels. on 4/5 - I saw my doctor. his diagnosis is Paresthesias and prescribed physical therapy. But because I indicated I am a long term smoker, he ordered a CT angiogram and bloodwork to check my kidneys prior to the angiogram. I did let him know I had my Janssen shot earlier in the month. on 4/7 - my bloodwork that I reviewed showed everything is normal except high glucose levels. on 4/12 - the numbness has not decreased but is now felt more up the back of my legs on the right side.  on 4/13 - heard about the &#34;pause&#34; on Johnson vaccine and the symptoms I have may be related to the vaccine. 4/14 - scheduled for CT angiogram at 7pm 4/21 - scheduled for first PT appointment

A few minutes later I felt difficulty breathing and realized that my throat was swelling.  My heart began to race, but I cannot say if that was a result of the other symptoms I was experiencing.   The dizziness and weakness lasted for about 2 hours. The difficulty breathing and swollen throat eased after about 7 hours.  Just as I thought that I was feeling better, a fever set in around 11pm along with the chills, joint aches and pains, and general malaise. These flu-like symptoms lasted for roughly 36 hours.

                                                Started having excruciating, painful headaches.  On about 4/6/21, headache awoke me from sleep.  Pain was through my left eye towards the back of my head down to my neck. Lasted for awhile.  Took Tylenol and was able to get rest about an hour later.  Woke up that morning pain was still there but it was bearable.  Two days later it happened again.  Awaken with excruciating pain.  Didn&#39;t think it was related to shot because it had been almost 3 weeks since I had shot.  On 04/15/21, it happened again.  Never had any issues with headaches.  Not only have I been having headaches, I&#39;ve been having pain in my legs, feeling lethargic, etc.

                                                after receiving shot, I waited 30 min, because I had bells palsy in the past  (about 16 years ago) it was an extra pre caution, approximately an hour later I felt slight dizziness which was not a concern for me  and passed quickly.  approx 2 or so hours later i got a bad stomach cramp similar to a bad menstral cramp however I am menopausal so this was unusual.  I believe it happened 2 or 3 times, that afternoon and maybe once the following day but never again.  The next day after my vaccine 04/04 I experienced a very low fever, came and went most bothersome was the chill and tiredness i felt by evening,  by 04/05 every symptom was gone just a bit of sore arm.  I was away on vacation when I heard the news about the pause and was concerned because I had stomach cramps .  These cramps were just after the shot and came and went quickly so maybe not much of an issue.  Upon return from my vacation last night, I blew my nose and there was blood in my right nostril.  it was not a flowing blood and I think it may have just been caused by the dry air in the airplane?  it was approximately 5.5 hr flight.  Maybe not related but thought I would mention it.

The next day and for the past 5 days she has experienced pain in the left arm and leg, tingling in all extremities and pain at the back of the neck that radiates to the head. The symptoms interfere with her daily activities and they are very annoying according to patient.

She also thought it might be a staff infection?   I?ve been put on:  valacyclovir 1gram 2x/day for 5 days Gabapentin 100mg 3x/day Mupirocin ointment 2% 3x/day

                                                Muscle aches started about 12 hours after the injection.  First my legs and back but after another 12 hours it was mostly my legs.  Legs felt like the muscles were being pulled.  (It felt like the beginnings of the extreme reaction I had to ampicillin 2 decades earlier, though not nearly as severe.)  My arm swelled slightly, was warm at the injection site and ached about 12 hrs after the injection.  The leg aches lasted about 2 days, the arm ache lasted about 1 day and the slight arm swelling lasted about 6 days... Reason for my reporting:  I had an annual eye exam 4/14/21 where a retinal scan was done.  The optometrist saw some blood spots in my left eye and referred me to an ophthalmologist.  Ophthalmologist performed additional scans and tests including a Fluroescein angiography and determined I have BRVO (Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion) which is a series of blot clots in small vessels of the eye&#39;s main vein.  He did not say it could be a result of the vaccine but I have no risk factors associated with getting BRVO.  Since it is not affecting my vision yet, the doctor wants to monitor it in 3 months to make sure it has not worsened.  Since the Janssen vaccine was put on hold for causing other types of blot clots in women in my age group, I am wondering if the vaccine caused the blood clots in my eye.

By the end of that week, I was feeling like a truck hit me. As of Monday April 5, I couldn&#39;t work. Dizziness and light headedness began. I want getting any better. Better vaccine I felt amazing, but I started to feel like death. I called my primary Dr first who ran bloodwork, then Dr took over from there.  The vaccine dumped my TSH levels fast, I had hit 30 and with having a total Thyroidectomy my levels need to be about 167 for me to feel my best. I&#39;ve been stable for quite some time. I have had a drop before in the past but never felt so lathargic and sick as I have this time. I&#39;m returning to work finally Monday May 3. It&#39;s been a long haul , getting better, and honestly I was scared to get the vaccine not knowing how my system would react due to having autoimmune diseases. I guess I found out the hard way.

                                                Blood clot in right wrist area:   On the evening of 3/17/21, I felt sudden pain in the palm of my right hand, just above the wrist. Then the vein just below my wrist swelled up and turned blue. The next morning when I woke, the vein was no longer swollen, but the area below my wrist had a large bruise, which lasted several days.   I contacted my physician that day (3/18) who said just to monitor/observe and come in if continuing issues (which there were not).

                                                The first night I got the vaccine, and I had a fever of 103 degrees for about six hours and 101 degrees at the 24 hours. I had all over body aches for two days but my hands still ache after tree weeks. I woke up in the morning an noticed a big bulging blue vein in my right eyelid right above the outer part of my eye. One week later my thumb started to throb and then a big bulging blue vein in my left thumb. It felt like it had been injured but it looked better within hours. I called my doctor and he advised that I go to the ER. I also had trouble with my head throbbing for a week after the shot.  My eye was painful and lasted a little over a week and my eyes were a little blurry. Both problems have resolved but I still have an ache in my hands after three and a half weeks. It is a deep bone ache which makes it difficult to work with my hands.

I used the wall to lean on to get down on the floor. Lasted  about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes with nausea. I never had vertigo.  When I went to bed I had an ache under my left breast. It eventually subsided.

                                                I woke up the day after my vaccine feeling slightly nauseous and with chills, which I expected. However, by 8:00 am I had a headache equal to the worst migraine I&#39;ve ever had. I laid in bed all day trying not to move as any movement caused intense nausea. At times, I felt that my heart was fluttering or irregular.  I vomited 3 times, but despite having eaten dinner the night before, I seemed to have nothing to throw up. I vomited clear liquid, if anything at all, which had a strong metallic taste. The vomiting was very intense, leaving me sweating and exhausted.  I fell asleep around 8:00 pm, and when my husband woke me at 9:15 to check on me, I could tell that the sharpness and intensity of the headache was gone. I still had a headache, but it was a normal headache. Today, the 10th, I woke up feeling mostly normal, just weak.

Around 11:00pm, I began to feel nauseous. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep, my heart was racing. By 3:30 am I had vomited at least 5 times. Throughout the day on Monday, I was still very cold, nauseous (without vomiting) and somewhat lightheaded. It is now Tuesday and my stomach is still upset. I have not contacted my physician at this time. I have been treating myself with ginger ale, Pepto Bismol, saltines and rest. I&#39;m not 100%, but feeling much better.

                                                Vaccine at 6:30pm on Thursday. Arm was very sore.  Woke up at 7am, tired, arm still very sore.  Took 2 tylenol, went to work, started to get a headache, on top of head, above my eyes. Took 2 more tylenol at about 1pm.  Starting to feel worse, finally left work at 3;30pm.  Went home, had fever about 100 or so.  As the evening went on, I had 102 fever, extreme pains, more so on my legs (especially my bad knee felt even worse), the worse headache I think that I ever had.  Even my breasts were sore.  it hurt just to lay down.  Took 2 more tylenol, felt the same.  Woke up the next morning, less pains, but my bad knee still hurted more than usual, 100 fever, tired, headache much less. Basically, had to lay down all day.  I had no energy.  Arm still very sore.  Sunday, felt much better, slightly more energy, arm still very sore.  Monday, feeling much better, but my arm is still very sore.

                                                I was vaccinated last Wednesday, March 24, at 8 pm with the Janssen vaccine.  As soon as I was vaccinated (on my left arm), I put on my coat and I felt a brief  and sharp pain in my left arm. And nothing else. On Friday night, I felt a very slight tingling in my left hand. And pain in the upper arm, in the region between the place where the vaccine was applied and my elbow. This pain seemed to spread to the forearm. Since then, I have tingling / numbness in my left hand and forearm and pain throughout my left arm, left shoulder, upper left center of the back and neck. And these pains and numbness have been increasing every day. Ten days have passed since the vaccine was applied and the condition only worsens. I took Voltaren in the last 3 days and the pain has not subsided. I am worried and scared. Was it a case of thrombosis or pulmonary embolism? In addition, I saw in the CDC information that, during the JNJ vaccine tests, there was a case of a severe reaction called brachial neuritis; as I didn?t know what it was, I did a Google search and, apparently, the symptoms I have coincide with those of this disease. Anyway, what do you advise me to do? I have waited until now imagining that the pain and numbness would lessen. But the opposite happened and everything just makes it worse. I look forward to feedback and guidance. I haven&#39;t been to a doctor yet, but it looks like it will be necessary. Thanks.

Had severe headache from the left ear to the right ear and going up around my forehead, as if my head was in a vise - all day. Heart was racing all day and night, couldn&#39;t sleep on my side because of it. around 24 hours after the shot I felt chest heaviness, which went away after a few minutes. Face was flushed, and I felt clammy. Went to the bathroom more than normal.  Aches  and joint pain, which weren&#39;t too bad. When I woke up the next day, symptoms were gone, except my arm was still sore and had slight fatigue.

                                                Symptoms came on suddenly and have lasted through the night and still going the following day. I would like to add that the side effects seem to have targeted areas that were hurting/ailments prior to the vaccine. 1. Headache 2. Fever 101.4 throughout the night 3. Flu like symptoms (felt like I was hit by a truck) 4. Shot was in left arm, however, no real pain. I have trigger finger in my left thumb that was going away, however, the pain intensified through the night. 5. I have Tennis Elbow and Trigger finger in my right thumb that was also starting to go away, but during the night, the pain was intense. 6. I have cuts on the bottom of my feet. During the night, my feet were on fire! I was having to cool them periodically. 7. Massive strange dream.

This went on until the  second day I woke up without the pain but still feeling weak in my legs and entire body.

Took 400 mg ibuprofen, drank juices &amp; stayed in bed.  Woke up 4/7/2021 had a bad headache, took more ibuprofen(600 mg).  By around 13:30pm on 4/7/2021, my left quad muscle-upper thigh began severely aching - burning like I had climbed stairs on one leg.  It was hard to walk without severe pain.  Rolled it out with rolling pin, took meloxacam but the pain continued.  By Thursday 4/8/2021 the pain was a little bit less but still ached to move leg at all.  Had no swelling or heat to leg.  Have continued to ice, apply heat, massage leg &amp; take ibuprofen for painful leg.  On a pain scale today-pain is 8

I kept getting more uncomfortable , colder and getting body shakes.  By 10:00 I could hardly walk to bed because of uncontrollable muscle shaking, jaw chattering, and was unable to get warm.  I took Advil then.  It took about an hour to stop shaking and warm up in bed with my husband.  I felt terrible for the next 2 1/2 days, just horrible, unable to function.  I slept a lot.

The pharmacist gave the shot extremely high-almost in the shoulder and the reaction was intensely painful.   Starting about 6 days later, the soreness of the shot developed into not being able to raise that arm at all without pain.  Now, a month later, the pain is worse and is waking me up at night. The injection site is not sore, but the arm itself is not functional without pain. About 2 weeks after the shot, I started having a fuzzy feeling in my head (not painful) and ears.  I am extremely sensitive to sound and feel almost dizzy at times. My speech has been slurred and words are not coming to me easily. I am extremely tired and feel foggy.

Woke at 12:20 am with high temperature, severe shakes, extreme weakness and inability to walk without assistance due to shaking and weakness. Had extreme body aches and full blown migraine. Was too weak to call for help. Had Advil in nightstand and took several to help. Called doctor in the morning and was advised to rotate Advil and Tylenol. Was too weak to get out of bed all next day (Friday) and half of Saturday. Also experienced tightness in chest to where I had to start taking Albuterol (haven&#39;t taken that in years). Bad side effects and extreme weakness and total loss of energy lasted 3 days.  Persistent headache and tightness in chest lasted up to 7 days.. Horrible experience. I felt like I was poisoned.

                                                The day after the vaccine (Sunday, 3/21/21), I had severe leg pain--throbbing in both legs.  My legs felt warm to the touch.   I also had a severe headache all day and a feeling of disorientation like I couldn&#39;t focus or concentrate.  I felt light-headed and very tired.  There was swelling, redness, and pain at the injection site (my left arm) all the way down the left side of my body (under my arm and around my ribs).  I took Acetaminophen, but the pain persisted all day.  The pain in my legs was the worst symptom and it was so painful and uncomfortable that it was impossible to sleep that night.  I&#39;ve never felt anything like it. I was planning to go to an emergency clinic the next day if the pain continued.  I finally got to sleep in the morning  (Monday, 3/22/21) and slept for several hours.  When I woke up later that day (3/22/21), the pain was gone and I felt normal again.   I was still tired for the rest of the week and I continued to have swelling in my arm at the injection site, but otherwise, no other symptoms.  It took approximately 6 days for the pain and swelling in my arm to feel better.  I did not seek medical attention because the leg pain was gone within 24 hours, but I am concerned now and am wondering if there has been any permanent damage to my circulatory system or heart.  I have noticed that my pulse has been elevated for the last 3 weeks (as compared to normal).

                                                I began having a burning and tingling sensation around my ribcage on my right side. I attributed it to possible swollen lymph nodes as the result of the vaccine. I had tenderness there for about a week. It started getting better and on my right side in my waist area, I had a sensation on my skin with no visible rash or anything, but it felt like my skin was burning and tingling. I thought maybe I was getting shingles, but never broke out. The same pain then went to my inside upper arms, both of them and then it spread into my armpits. and down both my sides. At times, the sensation was across the top of my chest. There is no rash, there is no visible inflammation and my skin doesn&#39;t feel warm to the touch although it is burning and tingling to me. It has been going on now for weeks. I have taken naproxen to see if it was some kind of inflammation as an immune response and it has helped on some days but not on others. I feel stupid to make a Dr appointment because there is nothing to see, but the painful sensation is real. It feels like a really bad sunburn.

Even the inside of my mouth was freezing.  I then experienced nausea and extreme tiredness.  Then about 8 hours later I was drenched in sweat thru the night and woke today with only a sore arm and slight body aches.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The morning after the vaccine was administered, I awoke with a scratchy throat,  itchy eyes and feeling very tired.   Throughout the morning,  the fatigue increased and I felt flushed in my face, but chilled in my arms and body.  I went home at noon and  found I had developed a fever of 100.9, which eventually increased to 101.3 later that afternoon.  I felt joint pain and general malaise.   Two days after the vaccine, the fever had broken and the joint pain was better. I still have fatigue, but it is improving throughout the day.

                                                6 hours after receiving vaccine, I started to get the chills, then body aches, then very intense shaking to go along with the chills and body aches. I felt terrible and the shivering was uncontrollable. I took one 200 mg of ibuprofen at 9 or 10pm, and another one at 11pm. That seemed to help and I fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning, I had a pounding headache. The headache was debilitating and lasted all day. The headache subsided around 6 pm 10/11/21 after taking a 200 mg ibuprofen. All of the above is unlike anything I have ever experienced, even with a fever or flu. It was misery, and I am a good sport, I didn&#39;t expect to have any side effects. These events came on vicious and strong.

By around 8:45 had a temp of 99.2 aching, chills, and very hot feverish, and then began experiencing fast heart rate and feeling like I was going to pass out or vomit, wave of nausea and broke out in a cold sweat, chest tightness.  I had taken two 500 mg acetaminophen tablets from 8:45 to 9:30 p.m.  My heart rate would not slow down so 911 was called and I was taken the ER.  I was given IV fluids and Toradol.  Blood work was done and EKG showing sinus tachycardia.  After receiving the IV fluids and Toradol, felt better and was released.

Then that went away and on day 3, my arm swelled, was red and hot and had a hard lump.  That has continued and is still there, 10 days later. The swelling and redness is a bit better, but the soreness and heat are still present.

                                                I had awful nausea, loud ringing in the ears, I fainted.  The medics provided help, gave me oxygen.  I started having convulsions.   After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

                                                I got the vaccine around 3:45 PM.  I felt completely fine all day until around 10PM that night. I started feeling really cold, then suddenly my whole body started shaking uncontrollably.     I also got a fever (close to 102). I paged my dr to let  her know what was going on.    She told me to take tylenol (and advil a few hours later IF needed).  After taking  2Tylenol, the shaking stopped after a few minutes and the fever went down.   During the night i felt slightly nauseous, but i did not throw up.   I also had some stomach pain.    By the next morning, my temperature was around 99-100 throughout the day, but no more shaking.   I still had some intermittent stomach pain but it wasn&#39;t severe enough to keep me down. I was able to shower, get my kids ready for school and go about my day for the most part.   By later that day, the temperate was normal .  I am getting some headaches now, but it&#39;s been a week since the vaccine and I do periodically get headaches, so i would not say for certain it&#39;s from the vaccine.  I am also still very intermittently getting some stomach pain. I can go for hours with no pain and then some random pains that come and go.

I reported it to two pharmacists at the table where I received the shot and they said they haven?t ever heard of that being a side effect, so just sit for a while and rub it out and stretch it. I felt lightheaded and the sharp pain (take my breath away) pain kept happening every few minutes. I stayed for observation for an hour, and started to feel a little better so I walked to my car. I drove to my pharmacist close to my house to ask her what she would recommend, and she said to try Tylenol . The stabbing pain kept happening on and off all day yesterday, causing weakness in my leg. Today I woke up and it has been achy, tingling, burning And somewhat numb.

                                                She got the vaccine, she went home, had no reaction.  The next day she woke up and her arms was sore, and swollen (huge).  Later on she started to have fever, cough, and then headache.  She then went to bed and slept 7-8 hours, all day long.  The swelling stayed for almost a week in her arm.  Then approximately 4-5 days later on 3/21/21 the right side of her face, the lower part of her ear to the lower part of her face started swelling, and her lip was numb.  Fearing she had Bell&#39;s palsy which she had about 10 years ago she went to see her doctor and the doctor said that it was a reaction from the vaccine.  The right side of her face and the swelling is almost gone, but her face is still feeling numb.   Her doctor did not give her anything, and since her swelling was almost gone and was improving he didn&#39;t want to give her anything for it.  He told her to watch it and if it worsens to get back to him, and to report to VAERS.

By 11pm when I went to bed, I felt like I had the coronavirus again. I slept with my night gown, heavy bathrobe, my sheets, comforter and another blanket and I was still freezing and achy. When I woke up the next morning, I was sweating so profusely the it was dripping off of me and getting my gown wet like I had been working out and then got in the sauna. All I did was drink hot tea. I had no appetite or energy.

                                                It wasnt until around 11pm that I started feeling bad. I was getting hot, confused a little uncomfortable or agitated, then I went to bed. I woke in the middle of the night in a crying fit because I thought I was going to die I felt soooo bad ! It was worse than any flu Id ever had! My joints hurt, my head wanted to explode , fever of 101.3 , breathing issues , exhaustion, thirsty...this lasted 2 to 3 days. Ive had a couple of days here in beginning of april til now of waking up feeling sick again. It doesnt last all day. Sometimes it just before bedtime. I guess I just feel a bit sick, but that could also be the cancer that ive had since july 2020 that hasnt been treated by a health care system I have?

                                                1. I woke up with a severe migraine, which isn?t unusual for me, but what is unheard of for me is that my medications aren?t making any difference no matter what I take. So I have an uncontrollable migraine almost to the point of going to the ER. What?s stopping me going is that I do t know what else they can do that I?m not already doing.   2. Low grade fever and chills: not a big deal  3. Severe fatigue to the point that it feels like my brain is ?shutting down?; I feel like I?m passing out. Eventually fave up midday, went back to bed and been sleeping for 8 hours so far   4. Dizziness  5. Extreme nausea - keep thinking I?m going to throw up

Now at 2 1/2 weeks, it is still very sore when I lift my arm up over my head.  Everything I read sounded as if the soreness should have gone away after a few days.    It is sometimes sore to the touch and sometimes I wake up at night after lying on that side and it is really sore.  The worse pain though is definitely when I try to use my arms to lift a shirt off up over my head.  I have been taking Tylenol to help the pain.

                                                Extreme unilateral migraine (have never had migraines previously), nausea, weakness, faintness, diaphoresis, loss of equilibrium, fatigue. These symptoms came on suddenly and lasted until I fell asleep after two hours. Symptoms remained when awoke next day, but were much less intense. Had a period of one hour the next day where right arm and hand went numb. This resolved after one hour. Had BP checked and was equal in both arms and normal. No neurological symptoms. Nausea removed for two more days. Otherwise, all other symptoms resolved after one day.

First wave within 60 seconds of shot (ended up on floor - embarrassing!).  Second, and most severe, wave about 10 minutes later while sitting in chair.  Apparently, I passed out with my eyes open.  Hubby got nurse.  They said I was unresponsive.  Nurse checked blood pressure and heart rate after second wave - both normal.  Third wave, much less severe, hit after 10 more minutes.  Ice water/weakness feeling in arms and legs and not so much in chest area.  Nurse speculated it could be low blood sugar (based on medications).  Have never had low blood sugar event previously AND had eaten about an hour prior to vaccination.  However, drank 4 ounces of orange juice, just in case.  Went home about 20 minutes later... no other significant side effects.  No swelling/redness at injection site.  No other illnesses, etc.

I felt red and puffy in my face on that side. I ended up getting flu like symptoms, and my arm hurt for about two weeks. I went to urgent care March 29th and was diagnosed with bronchitis , I did get a Covid test and it was negative. They put me on a antibiotics and inhaler. I followed up with my PCP, she changed the inhaler I was prescribed and told me If I don&#39;t get better to give them a call.  My arm is better but bronchitis is still there. The coughing is really bad at night and sometimes during the day.

                                                Patient passed out immediately following injection of vaccine.  Her eyes rolled back and she was not able to speak.  The vaccinator got help immediately, and patient&#39;s husband was in the room.  She remained in a seated position with her husband holding her head up while standing behind her.  Her blood pressure dropped to 78/80, heart rate was 45 bpm.  She was unconscious for approximately one minute and 30 seconds.  911 was called immediately and she was transported to medical center. When I called the patient today, she did say that she was feeling better.  She mostly felt nauseous and dizzy following her vaccination.  She reports that her arm still feel itchy and that she has been taking Benedry

On Wednesday, I developed a cough, chills and fatigue that lasted all day. On Thursday, I was better. On Friday, I noticed swelling under my arm but closer to my breast.  I went to see my MD and was given something for the cough. My MD wants to watch the swelling under my arm for the next two weeks.

Around 4:45 I began to have chills, and when I arrived home about 5:15 I was shivering and freezing and full of body aches.  During the night I developed a fever of 103.7, 103.5.  My husband woke me to help cool me down with cool cloths and water.  My fever went down to 102 by morning and I still had body aches but not as bad.  I was lethargic and mentally fuzzy for a few days.  I did not feel well until Wednesday, March 24, 2021.

                                                Had migraines (frontal lobe with flashing lights-distorted vision and difficult to hold my eyes open) from 3/20-3/24. (one week after vaccine) I do not get headaches, so this was very strange. On 3/23, I woke up with a bright red Left thumb- it looked and felt like a sunburn.  The next day (3/24), it was still bright red (fire engine red), swollen, hot to the touch and had a blister in my webspace.   I went to the dr 3/23 pm who was not sure what was going on, but prescribed an antibiotic (Keflex). This reduced my pain and swelling. Today it is still red and is now flaky, but not swollen or hot to the touch.   The main thing was the migraines as I do not get headaches.   I&#39;m not sure if that or the skin thing is related, but thought I should throw this information your way in case there have been others with similar symptoms.

I visited Dr. and he has ordered tests to check on my heart. I told him I was concerned about the &#34;pause&#34; and the reason for pause because I feel pretty miserable, and he added a CT test that will be done in two to three weeks. I do not know if he will report my symptoms as possibly vaccine related.

                                                During observation while at the vaccination site I felt like in the middle of my forehead I was starting to have hives. But nothing could be seen. In the middle of the week it started getting red and I used hydrocortisone and it was that. On Friday 04/09 I woke up and my neck was itchy and burning, stingy, like pins or stuck in it, when I looked in the mirror there was a rash, different from hives. Some type of rash, just on the front, right below the crease of the neck and all the way across. I called the advice nurse line and I had a telehealth (video) appointment with the Urgent Care . I was prescribed some topical cream and some oral antihistamine and I just used the topical cream, not the pills. I used the cream as prescribed and I left the message to my doctor and send pics of the site and she sent me a message for an appt but since I kept using the topical cream it has been helping so I have not seen her yet.

                                                I developed a rash on my face (both checks and under my eyes) from the vaccine as well as fever of 102, nausea, vomiting, chills, sore arm, etc.  I went to the doctor because I was concerned that I had a rash on my face.  I did not have a rash on my arm which is where most people get the rash.  The doctor told me that the rash would fade in a few days and it did.  It is gone now.

But around 6pm,  I was sitting outside on a cool night with a jacket and scarf on and I suddenly very very hot and  had to take off my layers. I felt nauseous. I got up to go inside because I thought I would throw up and then fainted.  I came to a second later (some friends where with me) and felt extremely nauseous. My friends brought me a bucket and I got sick. I felt immediately better. But later that night I had a headache, and chills. I didn&#39;t get sick again, but I left as if I had the flu.  I felt better in the morning.

                                                next day extreme fatigue, fever lethargy.  Got better but never got energy back and had some body aches and trouble sleeping.  On Wed. March 25th an EXTREME headache began and I could find no relief with High doses of Tylenol or Ibuprophin or a mixture of both. It was my whole head. Stayed on the couch all day Saturday and Sunday  27th and 28th unable to move because of the pain and extreme fatigue.  Monday the 29th made myself go to work but was not able to function or get much relief.  On Tuesday the 30th went to see physician who said he thought it was Occipital Neuralgia and gave me prednisone and said use hot compresses. Told him I thought it was more due to other symptoms like hallucinations (shadows I would see) Mind not clear and made me worry about driving. Asked if the shot could be a possibility. He just said he couldn&#39;t rule it out.  The doctor also mentioned I felt very hot but never took my temperature. I Took the prednisone. Headache did start to clear on Wed the 31st in the evening but my neck seized up where I could no longer turn it to the left and was very painful. Also felt like my lymphnodes were swollen.  I called on call doctor and they prescribed a muscle relaxer.  I did not start to get better until Sunday April 11th. Experience a couple occular migranes as well during this,  Still experiencing some fatigue and almost to a fainting point in the mornings

Pain was so severe I could not walk, I dragged myself into the medicine pantry and believing it could possibly be a thrombosis, I instantly took 2 baby aspirins. Although I wanted to call for help, I was too far from my phone therefore I began to massage the area and remained in place until the pain subsided enough to regain movement.

After 4 days of that I got a really super heavy period with cramping and blood clots in my menustral flow.  It was a horrible period, while the one after the surgery in Feb was very light.  Dizzy and fatique  10 days after shot on the April 8 I took a fall from a chair outside, and from Thrusday to the Saturday  10th I ended up in the Emergency room with a concussion and head symptoms including dizziness and nose bleeds.  This was from a simple fall, and i suspect the covid shot might have caused complications after the fall with additional swelling and brusing.

About an hour later, my heart started &#34;racing&#34; really bad. I felt like I was running a marathon, and I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace. I could hardly catch up my breath.  4. Then, my right arm started tingling and feel heavy. I couldn&#39;t feel any of my &#34;fingers&#34; on my right hand.  5. My body kept going from extremely hot to extremely cold. I felt like my blood pressure was up and down. I had more nausea. I could barely move. 6. I threw up again and, eventualy, I slept.

                                                I received the vaccine 3/12 around 3:00 p.m.  On 3/13 around 4:00 a.m., I woke up with a sharp, localized pain in my right, lateral thigh area.  Within a 15 minute period of time the localized pain moved down my thigh, past my outer knee area, and to my calf.  After approximately 15 minutes the sharpness of the pain subsided.  As far as I know I have had no lasting side effects from this.  I have CRPS/RSD in that leg, specifically in that region, so at the time and with the fever I had, I didn&#39;t think too much of this.  REACTION AFTER VACCINE INJECTION:  As an aside, I had some unusual reactions to the vaccine immediately after the injections.  Within 5 minutes of getting the vaccine, I developed numbness in my lips, tongue, and palate and a &#39;lump&#39; in my throat that made it hard to swallow.  It took approximately 2 hours fpr these reactions to resolve.  I have had these reactions before when I accidentally ingested sugar substitutes.  Also, at approximately 15 minutes post injection, both my ears felt internal pressure (as if I had submerged in deep water) and I could not hear well.  I have never had this reaction before.  This took about 1 hour to resolve leaving me with a moderate headache for 3 days.

                                                Started with a dull pain in my right side.  After Dinner on that Friday (3-25-21) I  threw up.    Thought I had food poison(ate fish). running a low grade fever fell asleep an woke up feeling better however a sore stomach (like if stillsick).  Saturday evening the pain started to get worse/running high fever and a tenderness in my stomach. Went to Emergency. After being admitted and doing testing turns out I had appendixsitis.  Surgery was Sunday afternoon and turns out was a preforated appendix.  I am not sure if this is related at all to my getting the vaccine however too coincidental that I received the shot on the 15th and this happened so suddenly within 2 weeks.

                                                I would like to amend my first report to add that 2 days after I received the vaccine I noticed bruises in my hands and one in my leg. 2 bruises on my knuckles and also 2 on the side of my hands. They are symmetric, I did not hit my hands anywhere. My husband also noticed a small bruise on my right leg. They were very prevalent the first week I received the vaccine and they are slowly fading away. The ones in my hands are almost gone, the one in my leg is very small now. You can still see it though. After seeing about the Janssen vaccine being associated with blood clots I had a virtual visit with my doctor, and he does not seem very concerned about blood clots but asked me to come in for some blood work. I did not go yet because I would like to wait for at least 28 days after the vaccine to go in and have the blood work done. I also remember I had a very bad headache one day soon after I got the vaccine but I was battling some sinuses issues before the vaccine, so I am not sure if that was related to sinuses or not. I took an Advil and it went away. And my arm still hurts a little, not as often as before. The pain comes and goes. Before it would happen several times during the day now it is more like once a day and once it goes away it just comes back the next day.

This was followed by dysarthria and facial droop. The symptoms persisted until the following day at which point she went to urgent care and then here to our ER. We did a head CT which showed she has and acute/subacute stroke in the right posterior MCA territory. I am the Hospitalist physician that admitted her yesterday. I have and MRI of the brain as well as an MRA and MRV ordered though not performed yet. Her symptoms are improving.

                                                I had an unique reaction to the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine. 7 hours after getting the shot, my whole body went into painful spasms. My arms, legs, and torso were all twisting out of control. I was afraid I was going to fall out of my power chair, so I tilted it to prevent that from happening. Transfers were extremely difficult. My husband had to help me on and off of the toilet. This went on for about 3-4 hours. After 2 hours, I took some Tylenol to take the edge off of the spasms.

                                                4/5/2021--Received Janssen vaccine.  Felt very hot during the day.   4/6/2021--Woke up with very bad headache and rash on the injected arm plus on my stomach.  Went for a walk and felt pain in my left calf and achilles tendon.  Went to work.  4/7/2021--Started my work day as a Personal Trainer/Fitness Instructor at 6am as usual.  Taught cycling classes and trained a few clients.  Went for walk.  Still had a headache.  When I got in my car to head home, my vision was super blurry and I felt very dizzy.  I ate an orange and peanuts and hydrated more.  I was not even sure I could drive home.  I got home told my family how I was feeling.  My husband noticed my eyes were very red and swollen.  I took a shower, drank a smoothie and ate a salad.  Used my aunt&#39;s BP cuff to check my BP and it was 148/99.  I have NEVER had HBP.    4/8/21--Woke up feeling disoriented as if the left side of my face, body were off--neurological stuff.  I went to reach for grapes in the refrigerator and could not grab them.  I felt like I have never felt before and ask my husband to drive me to the ER.  While at the waiting room at the ER, I felt chest tightness and pain and nauseous.  My BP was 153/111.  Again, I have never been diagnosed or been treated for hypertension.  They did EKG, lab tests, chest X-ray.  Once my BP came down, they sent me home.   This is before all the JJ Janssen vaccine &#34;news&#34; came out and the reasons it was paused.  I developed a very bad cough about two hours after I got home from the ER.  4/9/11--Made appointment with a brand new primary care doctor.  Saw her on Monday 4/12/2021 as recommended by ER.  I had never met her before.  She prescribed a very low dose of BP medication, which I did not take because the number one side-effect is dry-cough.  I was already coughing a lot, later on with blood.  4/11/2021--Still feeling pretty bad, I woke up to the news of the Janssen vaccine being paused.  Frankly, I felt relieved that I was not going crazy.  This truly has been one of the hardest things I have ever gone (and still am) going through.  I became concerned about the pain in the left calf and heel could be a clot.   Called primary care doctor.  Had ultrasound of legs and chest x-ray the following day   4/12/2021--Had persistent cough with blood.  Went to ER at 9pm.  Had EKG, blood work, CT without contrast of chest, covid test--negative.  Got home around 2am.  4/19/21--Followed up with primary care doctor who after explaining to her I am extremely fatigued, still blurry vision, dizzy, cough better but not gone, chest discomfort on the left side, she referred me to an ophtamologist and cardiologist.  My insurance and this poorly established referral system is very difficult to navigate.  Up to now I am still waiting for the referral and pre-aurhtorization to the opthtamologist.  (4/23/2021).  I want to say, I am pretty healthy. I have worked in fitness and wellness for over 30 years. I have never drank alcohol, smoked or done any drugs.  Prior to this no physician has told me I have HBP or any issues for which I have to be medicated.  I take zero medications.  Even when I had the bad headache from the vaccine I took nothing.  I have not worked in two weeks and had not driven until last saturday.  If I don&#39;t work, I don&#39;t get paid.   I pay for almost $600/month for my insurance in the marketplace.  This has been another stressor of this storm.  Getting providers to really listen and insurance companies to take situations like this seriously.   I could not drive at night.  This has been rough and I look forward to being myself soon.  This reaction felt like a heart attack/stroke with extreme fatigue, acid reflux, cough with some blood, muscular pain.  The rash and headaches were the least of my concerns.  I am not yet recovered from all of this.  I sure hope there is no permanent damage and that this too shall pass.  It is important to note that I have tried reporting this event several times to the VAERS website online.  I completed the 4-5 pages multiple times and it would not let me submit.  I also called the VAERS 1-800 number to report and they told me to go back to the online form.  I left several messages when I could not get it done online and to this date no one has called me back.  I called to report my adverse reaction and they told me they do not take that info.  I also called the health dept.  After several phone calls to them a nurse called me back but did not take a formal report.  When someone is feeling pretty sick, this is a lot to ask of.  I persisted because I feel this is important to be reported.

                                                Received Vaccine on the 4/8 that night I was very cold had 5 blankets, teeth shattering, severe headache, &amp; knees like if they were breaking them. The following day slight headache, weakness, not feeling good.  On the evening of 4/15, it hurt to breathe and I had a burning sensation on my rib cage going to my back. I thought I could handle it until Monday to see my Dr.  but by the time I went to the ER it hurt to walk, talk, breathe and the burning sensation would not go away.  I went to the ER on 4/17 he said I had a collapsed lung, gave me something for pain via IV.  Did an EKG, Chest X-Ray, CT Scan, and Lab work. He let me go and said to take deep breaths every hour on the hour and to drink lots of water.  I got in to see my regular Dr. on 4/22 and he said I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  He gave me Gabapentin 100 mg 3 times a day and Tramadol q 6 hours for pain.  I called him back because I still have the pain and now I am taking 300 mg Gabapentin in the am and 300 in the pm.  It is still not working.  I am constantly hurting the burning sensation on my rib cage and goes back to my back, it hurts to breathe, walk, talk, drive, I have blurred vision , dizziness and weakness.  I have an appointment with Dr.   again tomorrow.

The event I was told lasted approximately 5 minutes in duration in the clinic before I regained consciousness.    The clinic called an ambulance and I was transferred to a larger hospital.  In route to the hospital my heartrate dropped and I was given atropine to stabilize my heart rate and was taken to the Emergency Room at Hospital.

                                                The day I received the shot, my arm got warm and sore.  The soreness traveled to my shoulder and neck.  I got headachey, alternating between hot and cold chills, a little bit of nausea and extreme tiredness.   This continued for the next 5 days which seemed like they were considered mild reactions according to the CDC website.  Most concerning though, is on day 5, (3/14/21) in the evening as I was getting into bed, I started getting a red, extremely itchy rash on both my arms, my lower back and my upper legs, to the point that I could not sleep because it was so itchy and had to take Benedryl.  I have not changed anything in my diet or in the products I use on my body, so I can only attribute this reaction to this vaccine.  I am still a little itchy on my arms today 3/15/21.   I am also still getting the hot and cold chills and still have a little bit of nausea, not bad, but enough to be &#34;off&#34; certain foods.

I developed a very red rash, mostly on my lower legs up to the knees, some slight rash on forearms. I used topical benadryl and it went away, but came back later that day. That lasted 36 - 48 hours and was completely gone.

On 03-16-2021 I woke up and the left side of my shoulder, both knees, both legs and both feet are inflamed.  I also have cramps to both of my shoulders. On Saturday 03-20-2021 when I woke up my right eye was also inflamed but only lasted one day. I have spasms to my calves with leg cramps. I can not sleep at night due to the inflammation.  I went to see my PCP this morning who prescribed a leg cream for the cramps, but I do not know the name. My blood pressure today in the morning was 154/96.  My doctor said it was a reaction to the vaccine.

I woke up at 1:30am freezing cold and hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. 45 minutes later I managed to get to the bathroom and took my temp which was 103.2. I took more ibuprofen, the fever subsided to 101. I continued having a fever for 2 days along with body aches and feeling very tired. Felt fully recovered after 4 days.

                                                I am submitting this because I know there has been limited data on the effect of the vaccine on people with autoimmune issues.  I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis March 2020.  Dietary changes have kept my rheumatoid arthritis in check -- not requiring any medication, even ibuprofen -- since May or June 2020.  Within 24 hours of receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, my knees, ankles, hands, wrists, and feet began to hurt.  (I also had a 100 degree fever for 24 hours.)  Unfortunately, 2.5 weeks later, the joint pain persists.  The vaccine clearly triggered a flare up, but I hope that within another 2 weeks, the vaccine will have finishing tweaking my immune system for COVID response and the pain will abate.  I do not know yet if that will be the case.

Eyes with itching and mild wheezing began 2 hours after injection. Symptoms came and went for next 6 hours. Day after injection had light rash and itching over arms and legs that lasted for 24 hours.  On second day after injection only itching of skin.  Did not take any medications to stop symptoms. I am a physician and felt comfortable self monitoring.

Day three - Tired after walking the dog, napped and then tightness/ache in chest/lung area which continued throughout the night. I could not lie on my side or it would trigger the ache in my chest. I could breathe deeply but that also triggered the tightness. Day four (Monday) - Chest ache continued. Contacted doctor&#39;s office. Took a Tylenol that seemed to help a little and watching my blood pressure.

                                                Patient reported to her doctor&#39;s office today with symptoms consistent with Bell&#39;s Palsy.  She stated that the facial symptoms started mid morning today on 4/5/21.  Last week ( week of 3/28 to 4/3) she reports that she felt &#34;weird&#34;.  She felt as if there were cool water running under her skin at all times.  She also states that when anything touches her skin, it feels very cold.  For example, when running her hands under warm water, it feels like ice water on her hands.  When setting her bare arms on her desk, it feels as if they are being set on ice and when her pants rub against her legs it feels as if they are wet and cold.  She also stated that the top 1/3 of her back was tingly and felt as if she had applied Biofreeze to it, but she had put nothing on her back.  Her tip of her tongue feels as if it is &#34;burnt&#34; and she can not tasted anything on the front part of her tongue.  She needs to get things way in the back of her mouth before she can taste them. On 4/3/21 she states that her lips began tingling as if they were having numbing medication wearing off from a dental visit, but she had done nothing different.  On 3/31 her lower back also felt as if it had a pinched nerve.  Today on 4/5/21 she has the Bell&#39;s Palsy on her face that started mid morning and she complains of her nose feeling tingly also.  She also feels as if she is retaining fluid.

Then I started running a fever. I was hot with chills and when I wasn?t under a blanket I was shaking uncontrollably. I took ibuprofen which helped a little. Ended up taking an Ativan to sleep. The next morning I felt like I had the flu. Still feverish with a deep cough. Groggy, lethargic and tired. Took a two hour nap around 4. Starting to feel better but I?m exhausted and very irritable.

Then came the horrible headache causing nausea and dizziness which ultimately resulted in causing me to pass out while attempting to get to the couch. Once I came to the body trembles  started accompanied by being freezing cold. The headache and diarrhea lasted into the next day with symptoms not lessening until day 3. Still have to take Tylenol every 4 hours to keep headache manageable.  I did not seek medical treatment but would strongly warn those getting this shot of the possible  loss of consciousness. It came on very fast, 8 hours after the injection,  and could be deadly if someone was driving or not near soft surroundings.

                                                In the middle of the night of the 10th of April I started having what seemed like normal side effects---muscle aches, headache, fatigue.. and then all day on the 10th the same side effects.   Then last night I slept 9 straight hours but woke up  sweating a couple times in night and in morning woke up sweating but my aches and headache seemed better than the day before so I went downstairs to make tea.  After pouring a glass of orange juice and having a couple sips I started to feel strange --dizzy and oversome with a strange feeling that was not quite like the feeling before fainting -- my back had a weird pain and i was a little nauseous as well. ..it was more overwhelming -- more loss of control like a huge wave of dizziness and ringing.  I made my way to a couch to try to regain balance -- but was still very dizzy-- something happened to make me try to get up and go upstairs so I remember walking 12 feet or so then told myself to sit down.  Before that happened I must have blacked out.  I faintly remember moving myself across the floor but then must have blacked out again.  I woke up at the base of the stairwell and then was able to walk upstairs.    I had collapsed the first time onto a hard floor as my orange juice glass had spilled all over and when I got upstairs my sweatshirt was covered in juice.  I don&#39;t remember any of that.  Once upstairs I drank water and have been fine since then.  I had eaten dinner the night before but maybe it was the sweating in the night that dehydrated me and i cramped up and had a strange pain in my back---i don&#39;t know.  I am a very healthy 56 yr old woman 5&#39;3&#34; 105 lbs so maybe the Johnson and JOhnson one dose was a lot for my body or maybe my body was just doing what it&#39;s supposed to do to react to vaccine.... i also may have had asymptomatic covid in the last year so my body was overreacting.   This happened 7 hours ago and I seem fine aside from slight headache and continued weakness from vaccine but I thought I should report the incident in case there might be something more or in case others had similiar responses.

                                                Became Lightheaded within 5 min of injection, progressed to severe dizziness, black spots in my eyes, could hardly lift my arms,  progressed further to nausea, was given zofran on tongue by EMS, progressed to severe vomiting.  EMS took blood pressure it was 93/50 hear rate was very low. Called ambulance and advised I go to hospital immediately.  Blood pressured jumped to 150 then dropped again.  Once in ambulance they put IV in and gave Zofran through IV, I don&#39;t know if they put anything else in there.  Blood pressure stabilized around 110 which is normal for me, I normally have low blood pressure and heart rate.  Nausea and dizziness dissipated by the time I got to hospital.  They put EKG on also while I was in ambulance and said I was having PVC&#39;s advised dr to do another EKG once I got to hospital.  Felt better by about 5:00 PM.  Overnight I had slight fever and body aches, took Advil and symptoms subsided.  Slight soreness in arm and armpit, but not major.  Have been feeling fine now other than being traumatized by the whole event.

Terrible headache that eventually turned into serious migraine.  Asked pharmacist, next morning if it was allowed to take an Imitrex injection for migraine after having vaccine.  Pharmacist said it was ok to take injection. Helped reduce migraine enough to be in bed resting the rest of that following day. Recovered and back to normal by next day the 25th. With Janssen vaccine concern now with cerebral clotting with severe headache as a sign, decided to report bad side effects and make sure I shouldn?t be having anything else checked for precaution.

                                                FOR 3 WEEKS FOLLOWING THE VACCINATION:   I had aches in all of my joints (elbows, wrists, and knees).  I thought maybe i am developing arthritis.  This lasted for approx 3 weeks and then suddenly stopped. Was it joint inflammation?   I had no other symptoms.   I did not visit the doctor. Within 5 hours of the vaccination, symptoms started with pain in both of forearms.  Overnight I developed fever, lethargy , aches and pains.  Took Tylenol.  Slept for approx 36 hrs.  I felt much better after 40 hrs.   I was not concerned.  I would say my symptoms were moderate or worse. In March of 2020, I had shortness of breath in my left lung .  It lasted for days.  I was concerned but I did not visit the doctor.  It eventually went away.  Could I have had Covid then?  A sure possibility but I will never know!

I then had a blood test which came back elevated and followed up with a ultra sound. It was determine then that I had something and was sent directly to the ER for a pulmonary CT scan. Which came back negative. I was also place on blood thinners then.

                                                On April  10, 2021 I began to get &#34;charlie horse&#34; type cramps.  The pain began in my toes then quickly moved into both calves and became excruciating.  The calf muscle turned rock hard and felt as if it were pulling all my muscles upward.  The pain continued up both legs, simultaneous and individually, into my growing.  This pain felt like sharp knives and lasted for 2 hours before subsiding.  Today  my calf muscles are extremely sore and sensitive to touch.  The muscles are still so tense they feel like rocks.

                                                The evening following the shot - chills, sweating, muscle achiness, headache, fatigue   approximately  the week prior to March 27 I was very very very fatigued.   the following week still fatigued.  I felt a weird sensation near my heart that was only momentarily - like a bubble or something about 1/4 inch in length move through a vein near my heart - I think I felt it again near my stomach a few days later - weird.  and then my face felt like I was losing sensation - like it was tingling .  that lasted a little longer, like a sagging.  I thought maybe I put on weight.  i was concerned and went to pharmacy to get my blood pressure taken - which I have never done in my life.  I am 56!  They no longer do that bc of COVID - so I asked a nurse friend to take it. She measured 124 over 60 something.  that is high for me.  I am typically 106/62.  I checked my records.  I started running then - in case I have put on weight.  I am 155 (high).  But now I started getting a constant headache about a week ago.  I am in a new job - so have thought it was due to stress or I reactivated a concussion  headache.   i started taking  Ecotrim 2 everyday now.  I am NOT an aspirin taker and I do not get headaches.  I try not to take ibuprofen for the headache.  I am not sleeping.  I have slept well ALL my life up to now.  I go to bed late now like 11;30 and I don&#39;t sleep.  I have a lot on my mind.  so it could be that.  Under a lot of stress.  this just started the last week.  A very new pattern.  I started a new job 3/15/21.  I was drinking coffee for the first 2 -3 weeks and now am not drinking it.  I don&#39;t drink much alcohol but I have had 1 glass of wine on the weekend or beer.   I run about 3 miles 2-3 times a week.

As more days passed; I was feeling tired, could not raise my arms, legs were weak and hurting.  If I did anything (shower or carry a simple laundry basket) my arms would hurt so bad, I was out of breath and my heart was pounding so hard.  By the week of March 29th - I was laying down in the middle of the day, no energy at all.  Called the doctor and because of the shortness of breath &amp; Body aches, they would only schedule a video visit for Monday, April 5th.  After talking to me, they schedule to see me that day at 11:45 AM.  I had weak muscle response in my arms, pale, and out of breath.  They did blood work.  Two hours after getting home; they called and said I needed to get to the emergency room.  My red blood cell count was dangerously low, and they ordered a blood transfusion.  I sent 6 days in the hospital.

                                                Not so much adverse than great. I had a migraine that morning and knew not to take my medication before the shot.  I muddled through the day and was going to take prescription meds that evening. Within 10-15 mins after receiving my shot, my migraine went away. I don&#39;t get them often, but it has never gone away on its own.  I also noticed a small pea size cyst on my forearm has diminished greatly in size since my vaccine. I don&#39;t know if all this is coincidence, just thought I would report it.

                                                General swelling in the armpit under the shoulder that received the injection. It&#39;s sore, and making my arm lightly achy and my hand tingle off and on. I assume it is due to the lymp nodes being super-activated under there. I have had Covid-19 twice (May 2020 and Jan 2021) and guess it may be related to a super-ready immune system. Also, it has re-activated some of the covid symptoms--chills, exhaustion, headache, and a dimming of my taste and smell, which had not even fully returned since the January 20021 bout of Covid. Now I can only discern sweet/sour/salty, with a momentary hint of what I&#39;m eating during the first bite or sip, before it&#39;s gone again. Complex mixes of foods, like a taco, for instance, would taste like nothing at all. Zero. Single note flavors, such as orange juice, are weakly flavored at first, then gone after a taste or two, like the tastebuds are used up. Most of the ability to smell is weak again, as well. I do wonder if the losses are due to inflammation response and not the virus activity itself, in light of this?none

                                                At approximately 2AM on Thursday, a severe headache (I would term a migraine based on prior experience) woke me. I had no apparent fever, but my body was stiff and I felt my heart rate was elevated. I drank some water, in case it was dehydration-related, but was unable to fall back asleep. I also experienced some nausea at breakfast but ate toast and had some (caffeinated) tea about 6 AM. Around 7 AM I took two (2) ibuprofen, which dulled the headache slightly. However it persisted into early/late afternoon hours on Thursday. (My customary activities were curtailed somewhat.) Since I have had migraines in the past, I treated this as I treated those: hydrating, taking pain medication as required, remaining quiet, reducing exposure to light and sound, etc. I continued taking two (2) ibuprofen periodically as I felt the need through bedtime Thursday night.  Friday I had periodic headaches (again, attributed them to rebound migraines or just headaches), felt tired, and been a bit &#39;out of it&#39;. But my systems did not prevent me from functioning. I did repeat the two (2) ibuprofen on Friday night at bedtime.

For days later, I began to feel, ill all over and could not get out of bed.  I had severe abdominal pain, aches and pains all over my body.  Particularly in places where I had pre existing conditions.  As the day progressed, I continued to have severe GI issues, could not eat (pain like food was stuck) heart burn, constipation (clamy like flu).  Shortness of breath, I could not walk far.  I took 3 trips to the ER where they treated for the abdominal spasms, UTI, and pain.  By the end of the week I had a slight fever.  I tested negative for COVID during that time.  For two weeks I was unable to eat, get out of bed.  I had several petite mal seizures.  If felt like my body was fighting the vaccine and the vaccine was attaching all of me weak or any preexisting conditions.  Eventually, after 3.5 weeks I was able to sit up, and walk. I still have shortness of breath, some fogginess,  Muscle strain, walking with a cane and a lump at the injection site.

                                                Slight tingling sensation after injection felt on right side of face  near mouth.  that evening sinus pressure / mild headache and slight sore arm.  Took one dose of Ibuprofen 600mg.   During the several days that followed had slight pressure sensation on right side  (mostly near right eye, to right ear to right side of nose)  feeling more pronounced on  April 16, 17, 18th.  Checked my blood pressure on Sunday 4/18  as i wasn&#39;t feeling great and found it was 145/70s.  my normal blood pressure  systolic range is normally 100 - 118 at most.   monitored blood pressure and found other readings of 138, 135.  Called dr on call  that weekend to advise.  Suggested I take Ibuprofen and monitor bp.   No real change observed.  On Monday 4/19, blood pressure early in the am after waking was 148/68 but improvement of pressure sensation on right side of face.  Blood pressure readings later in the day were back to normal range.    Dr. office closed due to holiday on 4/19.   Had a telehealth appt with dr. on 4/20. Bloodpressure (self check) seems to e back to normal range.  Pressure on right side of face feels better as well.  Dr. asked me to monitor symptoms.  Will monitor headache/pressue and blood pressure for next several days and report any issues to dr.

On 4/17 a burning redness and swelling of her legs bilaterally which worsened and she became unable to walk secondary to pain and swelling. Also reported shortness of breath. The rash was initially wheals spreading up legs with pain, burning and allodyina to light touch. It then spread to arms bilaterally.  She admitted to Medical Center and discharged with dx of urticarial rash with petechiae.

                                                Ten hours after I got the shot I got violent chills and fever(100.4), muscle aches all over. My quad muscles are still a little achy and weak. It lasted 36 hours and then I felt my Vestibular Migraines. I was dizzier than usual. Under my left armpit was very painful reaching toward my left breast. The area of the shot was not painful. I also had dizziness chest pains under my right clavicle immediately after I got the shot. The chest pain went away for three days and then it came back.  It was like an extreme muscle ache. It was a dull and intermittent pain. I was referred to a Respiratory clinic and I still had a low grade fever.  My left arm was stiff two weeks before the shot and  three days after the shot my  left shoulder was frozen. I had an appointment with my Orthopedist and she confirmed an encapsulated shoulder problem.  At present after three weeks my shoulder is still frozen and my armpit is still a little painful. The chest pains are less frequent.

The unexpected effect is tingling and coldness in both hands/fingertips.   I could logically assume it is from the swelling in the neck pressing on the nerves, as I have experienced a similar feeling occasionally in the past due to compressed discs in my spine and neck.  At this point I am not particularly alarmed but I wanted to make you aware of this side effect.

Symptoms remind me of shingles-caused neuralgia which I sometimes experience on left side. Facial tingling, feeling of tightness in muscles, including inner ear are less familiar to me. Symptoms appear to change in degree--slight to more noticeable--as this first day wears on. (Now nearly five hours since vaccine.) I have gone about day as normal, eating and exercising, drinking plenty of water.

Progressed to coughing and feeling a lump in my throat and then tightness in my chest. My blood pressure elevated to 152/100. At that point I self administered epi pen and paramedics called 911. This provided relief but after about 5 to 10 minutes the tightness in my chest and the feeling I couldn?t get a deep breath began to return and the paramedics administered two puffs of an albuteral inhaler and transported me to the hospital. At the ER, they did an EKG, started an IV and administered fluids, prednisone and Benadryl. I was discharged about 90 -120 minutes later with a prescription for 3 days of prednisone (50mg) and instructions to continue to take 25 mg oral Benadryl every 4 hours.  The next morning my face and chest were red and looked like I was sunburned. My face was also swollen.

                                                I got the shot in my left arm and shortly after right above my right eye I could feel a reaction going on. Almost like something effected the muscle, I didn&#39;t say anything and went to the wait room I mentioned it before I left and they said it sounded like a migraine and I went home.  When I raise my face on the right side of my eyebrow area feels like I have spasms. When I got home it moved to my cheek area as well and felt strange.  I got a rash on my right cheek that evening and a super bad headache. I took a Benadryl and went to sleep. I didn&#39;t have a fever.  By the morning the rash was gone, the only thing that bothered me was my eyebrow area ( muscle area) I went to the Dr the following day and she said it sounded like it was my sinuses. Prior to this I was having allergy / sinus issues.

                                                After my vaccine I had tenderness in my right arm at injection site and a sharp pain in my right clavicle bone. The clavicle bone pain slowly went to an ache. But then I noticed my arm was ballooning up a d the injection site was hard. Then, About a week after my COVID vaccine, I experienced leg pain (left) behind my knee and my arm was getting larger and warm to the touch. My first appointment with my doctor was 3/24/2021 at 1215pm. He checked out the areas and ordered a ultrasound Doppler of my left knee. I called the vaccine center as it says on the paper given with the vaccine. I spoke to someone and explained my symptoms. She suggested a ultrasound of my arm as well. I called my primary care doctor who added my arm to the order.

Crushing pain all over body, joints and muscles. Stabbing headache similar to a migraine. Dizziness. Diarrhea for 1 day; abdominal pain for nearly two weeks. Intermittent nausea for nearly two weeks. Felt like I had a fever, although the thermometer said 99.7. The feverish feeling lasted for 3 days. The crushing pain lasted for nearly two weeks. The dizziness was intermittent for two weeks. Got a full-blown migraine headache 4 days after vaccine. Please note: I did NOT take my nightly aspirin dose for 2 days prior to vaccine so as to not affect the immune response. I restarted my nightly dose at 11 PM,  6 hours following the vaccine. Still had all the above-mentioned symptoms.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, my right arm felt hot and was red and I also ended up with an upset stomach, had diarrhea and felt sick to my stomach. I also experienced chills, low grade fever of 99.8 and had swelling to my joints in my fingers and toes. My right arm pain radiated upwards to my neck. These symptoms lasted 12 hours and as of today I still have pain in my neck. Since 03-15-2021, I have been seeing a chiropractor for my neck pain. I see him on a weekly basis. At the chiropractor&#39;s office they apply ice, heat and do a muscle rub help with my neck pain that still is present.

                                                I started shaking uncontrollably and shivering that lasted about 3 hours. I could not stop shivering, even though the house with much warmer than usual. I had shooting pain all over, especially in my shoulders.  I could not move, or even reach for my water glass,  without extreme pain. It felt like nerve pain, muscle and joint pain. I am very active, strong and healthy.  When I walked to go to bed I was in so much pain that I could not stop moaning and saying Oh my god, oh my god, (that?s not like me ? I have a high tolerance for pain and consider myself stoic) and I was shaking so hard I thought I was going to have a seizure or something. I was very tired and slept through the night. This morning I feel like I have the flu ? headache, body aches, fatigue. Thank you.

                                                They did not have me stay at there store and wait a few mintues. I got in my car to drive home. I live 2.9 miles from the store. After about 5-6 minutes in the car, I started to feel bad, and I felt I should pull over.  I was on the road and traffic was super busy. I did pass out in front of a store on the road while driving my car. I came too and saw a restaurant. I pulled into their parking lot and texted my husband to come and get me. When he got there, I could barely stand. I layed down in the back of his truck because I could not sit up. My arm went number but I could wiggle my fingers.  We did drive to the hospital because I was so weak. but after the 15 minute drive to get to the hospital, I was able to sit up and walk again. I did not want to pay the $500 deductible so I my husband drove me home where I am sitting on the couch resting now.  My husband is a Chiropractor, so he has a lot of medical background.

Patients breathing was fine, but she was extremely lethargic/limp. Was coherent but slow to answer questions, excessively sweating and pale, small amount of vomit. At one point, patient said that she did not know where she was. Said that her fingers felt numb and tingly (could not pick up water or orange juice...we had to put water and juice to her lips to drink). She said that she needed to lay down. Per patient she had oatmeal with very little sugar for breakfast and coffee. Believe the reaction was a vasovagal response.

I began the expected side effects at about 10 hours after with fever, muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue, terrible headache. I thought I had to suffer through it so my body could react properly but at 22 hours post shot, I finally took 2 Aleve which helped tremendously. I felt great when I woke on Monday then Monday night began with the left side of face very mildly numb again. I&#39;m not doing anything for it.

I walked around a bit to cool off and started feeling itchy.  So I took one of my Pills for Itching the Hydroxyzone at 25 mg.  after a while the itching lessoned.   I did wake up with a fever but did not realize it because I take the Celebrex on a regular schedule for pain in my spine.  I only realized I had a fever When the cold feeling started to subside after taking my morning dose of the Celebrex.

Then on 4/9 around 1400, she had what she described as &#34;the beginning of a migraine&#34; in which she had blurry/wavy vision.  She has had migraines in the past, however they are very infrequent.  She is not treated for migraines due to their infrequency.  In the past, she would take a Tylenol at the first sign of blurry/wavy vision and this would prevent a full blown migraine.  On 4/10 at 0530, patient woke from &#34;charlie horse&#34; in left calf.  She got up, walked around again and took a Tylenol, this resolved.  Later that same day, patient developed the blurry/wavy vision again, took a Tylenol again and this resolved.  On 4/11, patient reported soreness in left calf from previous day&#39;s cramp and used heating pad.  Patient has had 2 more episodes of blurry/wavy vision yesterday 4/12 and today, 4/13, which both resolved with Tylenol.  Patient has not yet spoked with PCP.  Due to the nature of the events, and the recent update of J&amp;J vaccines,

This subsided by the morning of the 11th. On the 11th, patient experienced extreme fatigue, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea. Monday the 12th, at 3am, patient was woken up to severe migraines (patient has no prior history of migraines or headaches). She described her pain as radiating-- like a bright, light house was being shined directly into her eyes in her sleep. This was combined with a pounding, pulsating feeling in the frontal lobe. Patient reported hypertension, nausea, and tingles in the tips of her fingers. These symptoms persisted throughout the day. On Tuesday the 13th, the same symptoms persisted. Patient heard the new CDC warnings about the Janssen vaccine, and concerned for her well-being, called her physician. Her physician directed her to go to the emergency room as soon as possible.

                                                Started having a headache on Tuesday afternoon, took migraine pill (excedrin) with minimal improvement.  Went out to dinner later that night and couldn&#39;t finish dinner d/t HA.  Describes head pressure, pain, and pounding sensation.  On Wednesday worked from home, felt like she was in a fog and continued to have pain/pressure in the back of her head.  Pt took a nasal decongestant which pt is unsure if made any better.  Thursday continued to have headache but improved compared to Tuesday and Wednesday.    Had taken benadryl at school which was somewhat helpful.  Saw PCP today via telemedicine visit. PCP prescribed steroid; had not started taking this because started feeling worse and came into the ED for this.     Earlier today, had worsened HA and felt like she was going to pass out (did not pass out).  She felt like her left hand was numb/pins/needles as her son was taking her BP; lasted for a few minutes.  Later, her right hand started feeling numb/pins/needles and had difficulty picking up objects.   57-year-old female  presented with a headache and found to have a subdural hematoma of unknown etiology.   Neurosurgery was consulted.   Patient was initiated on Keppra 500 mg b.i.d. for seizure prophylaxis. Serial CT scans were done  Which showed stable subdural hemorrhage.  Blood pressure was monitored during her stay but did not require any as needed medication.  Further imaging including MRI and MRV were performed to assess for aneurysm or venous malformation however nothing was seen.  Bleeding disorder workup was not performed. Neurology was consulted.  EEG was ordered to assess for seizure activity however this was negative.

Reported the continued arm pain the next day to the doctor and she ordered an ultrasound. Report negative on blood arm clot. Got a fever, body aches, headache, tired, triggered a migraine per doctor, localized reaction of 2 3/4&#34; at injection site with redness, swelling, pain. Almost passed out at a store - Became dizzy, tingling hands and sweating and taken to ER by ambulance. ER ruled out blood clot but found I had a UTI without any symptoms-prescribed an antibiotic. Contiue to have minor headache and minor discomfort at injection site. Awful experience and adverse reactions!

Severe facial/sinus pain on left side of face March 20 (approximately 48 hrs after vaccine) lasting about 24 hours. And then Mild facial/sinus pain on left side of face lasting another 24 hours. Used ibuprofin, meloxocam 7.5 mg, and extra strength tylenol to help relieve side effects. The first 7 hours after the vaccine none of the anti-inflammatory medications helped to relieve any side effects. The facial pain I experienced a day later was relieved somewhat with the anti-inflammatories.

                                                I had a rash from the shot and an immediate headache in my temple right above my eye. I started to get Migraines which became very painful four days after the vaccine. I had to go to the ER because the pain was so bad one day that I almost passed out. It is a much different pain than my normal Migraines my left arm and leg were numb. I have been getting Migraines daily for five weeks now. I have been trying to control my diet and switched medication in an effort to control the Migraines. The medication helps a little if I take it early. I also still get a little of the numbness in the left side of my body. All services provided by insurance company.

                                                3/11/21, 5:00 pm started to feel very cold, fingers started to feel numb, by 6:00 pm had severe chills and shivering, fingers were white and fingernails were blue. I became extremely dizzy, so much so that just moving my head or moving from under my blankets or even talking would create a sensation like zaps or electrical jolts inside my head. By this time, I had about four thick blankets on me. This calmed the chills. If I moved even just my hand outside of the blankets, I would immediately start shivering again. I felt my worst at about 9:00 pm. Slowly got better. Drank a lot of water. Dizziness and chills subsided by about 12 midnight and left me with a headache. Tylenol helped reduce that. Slept the rest of the night. Today from about 9:00 am until currently 5:40 pm, I have had slight muscle aches, fatigue, slept on and off all day. Still a bit dizzy but not too bad.

Around 2am the next morning I experienced mild nausea for about 10 minutes, had a bad headache for 6 hours and temperature for @ 4hours.  All symptoms resolved @ 5 a.m. of the next morning.

I had a fever, chills so violent that I made the bed shake - lasted for hours; severe headache that triggered a migraine, exhaustion, and nausea.  It&#39;s 2 days later and I still feel terrible.  My husband gave me a tylenol PM that night and the next day as the headache was a full blown migraine, I took naratriptain.   I still have a slight headache but want to avoid taking additional medicine if possible.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I had stinging pain spreading like a wasp sting (to which I am allergic) traveling down my left arm. Within a half hour, sharp muscle cramps took place simultaneously on top of the &#34;wave&#34; of sting like pain. These waves of cramping pain changed in location, but were strongest in my arms and legs. Between these waves, sharp pinching nerve pain happens in specific spots which could be anywhere including scalp and between toes. I had one good day with little pain. Other days are not so bad if I keep ibuprofen consistently in my system. It has been 12 days, and these pains have lessened but not stopped.  The remaining pains are more of the sharp isolated nerve pains.  I have not had any flu like symptoms, and I&#39;ve had very little pain at the injection site.  I have not been able to work much of the 12 days since the shot. I worry that the nerve pain may not go away.

It lasted a minute or so. At 2am on Fri. 3/26 woke up to nausea, SEVERE body aches, Severe headache, weakness. I could barely lift my legs or get up from the commode ,chills, and fever of 100.00. I had started taking Tylenol 500 to 1000 mg  around 6pm on 3/25 and continued every 4 hours. The pain from the body aches was so bad that Tylenol wasn&#39;t helping. My fever stayed in the 100&#39;s with 1000mg of Tylenol. I started seeing symptoms ease up on Saturday 3/27. I no longer had chills and fever but just mild body aches and fatigue.  Had diarrhea on 3/27.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection - just a little pain in the arm where I got the injection and when raising my arm. By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

                                                My left arm started to sting immediately after getting the shot, then the stinging subsided.  My left arm started to hurt later in the day and I had pain all the way down my left arm and left side of my chest. This pain throughout my left side was not helped by Ibuprofen and  made sleep very hard.  I had intermittent sharp pain in my neck, shoulder, and left arm for days.  The injection site turned red, hot, and a raised area the size of a silver dollar appeared  and was med-red in color for about 8 days.  The color is better/ almost normal as of today, but still a hard lump under the skin and a bit itchy.  This has caused pain throughout my back and shoulders since I got the shot....but it has not been activity limiting.  I had a slight bit of nausea for a couple of days as well.  My husband had his shot just after mine and experienced  Chills , headache, and nausea at about 9:00 P.M.  His chills subsided at about 3:00 A.M.  He continued with the headache for another day/ fatigue for 2 days/ and nausea for about 5 days.  He has also had tingling in his left arm (about 7 days)  and a funny tingling on his tongue for about a week.

                                                Prior to receiving her COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was already having symptoms from anxiety/nervousness about the vaccine. Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient&#39;s face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;. EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient&#39;s friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient&#39;s vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient&#39;s husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.

Couldn&#39;t get warm for hours. Fever, but not super high. By noon the next day (24 hours) I was almost completely better. It felt similar to a mild case of the flu. Also want to note that I went straight to lunch from the vaccine and had a margarita with my lunch.

Within 13 hours of vaccination, I experienced chills, joint pain, weakness, muscle aches, fever.  36-40 hours fever decreased as did most body aches,  but I then started experiencing intermittent Vertigo.  It has  decreased in frequency, but still as late as 16 days later it has occurred.  In between I have daily had light headedness/dizziness  (still having dizziness) and sometimes a low grade fever, i.e. around 99.5 as well as headache.  Not sure if all this is related to vaccine, but I have never had Vertigo before.

                                                On 23 March 2021 I received the Janssen Covid-19 Vaccine LOT #1805025. I contacted Johnson &amp; Johnson via phone to report that I was experiencing an intense, deep pain in my upper left thigh and a headache about two hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine. Case #ICSR Information : 20210346108 JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE SECURE! The pain in my thigh worsened whenever I stood or sat still. I inquired if thrombosis is a side effect or something that I need to be concerned about. The woman on the phone said she looked up thrombosis, but did not see it listed. I asked if I should start taking aspirin. The woman on the phone said that she could not give me medical advice. I was so concerned that I took a full aspirin about every four hours for twelve hours on that day and a full aspirin for about three days thereafter and two baby aspirin ever since. The pain in my thigh diminished by 26 March 2021, but ended a few days later. The headache occurred intermittently. I have had some chest discomfort since then, but it hasn&#39;t risen to the level of angina. I am still concerned about thrombosis because of the intensity of the pain.

She was responsive but very pale. She c/o nausea, laid back in care seat and looked to have seizure activity, pulling her left arm up her chest and biting her lip. This lasted several seconds then pt was A&amp;O and in NAD. I yelled to nurse to call 911 and get other provider. HE arrived in 2 minutes. He checked pt&#39;s pulse and reported it to be weak and thready. He reported her O2 sat was 83%, but her hands were ice cold. Pt was still answering out questions at this point with no breathing difficulties. PA reported O2 sat back up to 93%. Pt&#39;s BP 122/62, HR 100 and RR 20.  EMS paramedics arrived in 5 mins. Pt A&amp;O x3 with paramedics and refused transport to local hospital ER for further evaluation and treatment. Paramedics confirmed pt was AMA. Our nurse dialed pt&#39;s husband on her cell phone. Pt talked to husband and told him to come get her.  Pt was able to move from driver&#39;s seat to passenger seat. Her husband picked her up 30 mins later. I continued to check on pt until her husband arrived. Pt remained A&amp;O x3 with NAD.

                                                Was stressed and run down in weeks prior to shot (taking care of mother dying of cancer who passed 04//01/21) so was not able to determine if experiencing side effects of just continued fatigue. Sore arm, bruised. Monday evening 04/12/21 felt sick, nauseous. Unusual for me. Continuing to feel sick each day since then and called in sick to work today. When I move around I feel worse. My chest feels like I am on the verge of getting really sick. I can breathe but just do not feel good. Feel worse when having a conversation with people. Feel better resting. I have no fever. My blood pressure and heart rate are normal. This is the sickest I have felt since before the pandemic. I called a nurses hotline yesterday and was told to call 911 is I had chest discomfort. I do not feel sick enough to call 911 and could drive myself if I need to go to the hospital. Best way to describe my symptoms is feel like I am on the verge of getting a bad chest cold. Had a headache last night and did not take anything. Woke up in the middle of the night with a very painful headache and took 2 Tylenol which made the headache subside. I have been feeling worse each day since Monday. Today is Thursday. Am wondering if I have COVID-19 and have called a clinic to schedule a COVID test that will be paid for by my work. Am waiting for a return call. All I know is that I feel sick and was not feeling this way before having the vaccine.

To this day I am still dealing with the headache, the pain not just in the arm but allover, gastro intestinal problems. It has impacted my sleep tremendously because the level of pain is very high. The one thing that went away that very first night was the low fever.  But this vaccine is like a Wish (cheap store) Vaccine. They SHOULD NOT give this to immunocompromised people and the &#34;few days&#34; rhetoric does not apply to us and that should be specified! Initially I thought this was to be expected when I heard a Doctor on the news say: &#34;if you fell like you got ran over by a truck, that is normal.&#34; So,  that is how I felt, so I thought it was normal.

                                                pt says she started getting a sore arm a couple of hours after taking the vax.  She has headache and fatigue.  Within in a couple of hours after getting into her shift at work after going back to work on 4/19/21 she started having throbbing left arm pain.   she said the pain was shooting down from her shoulder to her fingertips.  She went to her doctor on 4/20/2021 and she was told she had developed tendonitis from getting the vax.  She was prescribed naproxen and was told to apply heat.  The heat seems to help but once removed the pain comes back.  naproxen has not helped much for the pain and she has to be careful taking ibuprofen and other pain meds due to her fatty liver.  She is going to request FMLA papers to fill out to try to be able to take off from work to give her arm time to heal and recover from taking the vax.

                                                After vaccination, at 10pm I started feeling flu like symptoms, fever chills shakes feeling miserable and this lasted 3 days straight, I also had diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. I woke up with a swollen juggler vein that ended up being a blood clot, 10 days later my arm was swollen up twice the size of my leg, the juggler was still swollen. I call the urgent care nurse they said to go to ER. I went to hospital got a CAT scan and ultrasound, I was given a shot of warfarin that was supposed to last for 12 hours. I went home and the next morning instead of going to the hospital, I went to hospital and they found 2 blood clots in brain, arm and leg and neck. I have had no history of blood clots and this all happened after the J&amp;J vaccine. They did a procedure where they tried to put a balloon to relieve the pressure. The blood clots in the brain cannot be removed because of their location and it would be dangerous to remove and I am on blood thinners for the rest of my life. Multiple blood clots in body brain, arm and shoulder.

I woke up three times during the night with pain in my left calf. A couple of nights previously I woke up with those same pains in my left calf, as well. It was worse pain the second time. I went to the dr and he did bloodwork. I did not have any other pains after that.

That stopped after 5 hours at which time I felt like I was on fire from the inside.  Several hours that later and I developed a headache, nausea and diarrhea.  I took my temperature upon arising and it was 100.3.  I was fatigued.  The headache then diminished by 24 hours post vaccination.  I continued with abdominal upset, bloating, loose bowels, fatigue and fluctuating fever for 9 more days.  On day 17 post vaccination, I had a medical appointment at which time my BP was taken.  Because I always had good BP, I do not monitor it between medical visits.  It was 178/96.  I had never had high BP.  I always ran 120/80 or below.  I bought a BP cuff and checked it again later that day after resting.  The BP increased that evening to 188/101.  I made an appointment with my PCP the next day.  At that time, my BP was 188/110.

As a result, she was admitted and treated for: ? blood pressure readings as low as 82/43, 76/50 while standing ? blood clots on her heart that traveled to her brain that were causing multiple mini strokes ? 95% blockage in her right heart vessel which required a stent  ? 50% and 60% blockage in other chambers that will require attention She was given heparin and then switched to a different blood thinner to dissolve the clots.  she was discharged on April 23rd with instructions to followup with her cardiologist and neurologist.

                                                Immediately Saturday: spacey and throat feels strange; afternoon: body is cold/tired. Sunday: felt great! lots of energy until during a walk at 3pm started to feel spacey (hands feel weird) and spiked a short term fever. Tired and cold. Monday: tired, bottom of lungs burning like I inhaled campfire smoke for a week straight, stumbling over words. Tues: tired, more burning lungs but sensation moving to mid chest (NOT heartburn), feeling like I needed to cough but nothing in lungs, still tired, still struggling with full sentences, irritable. Weds: felt hot but temp was below normal, lungs burning. Took Covid test (negative), incredibly tired, got the spacey feeling and hands felt weird-lasted 30 mins. Thurs: tired, irritable, left side hurt, started having to clear my throat every 20-30 minutes, cold. Fri: still tired, felt like I needed to cough but didn&#39;t reduce the pressure in chest/burnin/aching. Slept 14 hours. Sat: woke up feeling awful. Short of breath, clearing throat all day. Went to urgent clinic. Lab/chest x-ray and EKG all negative. Dr:&#34;Nothing we can do for you. This vaccine is too  new and you are likely having a reaction. Come see us if it gets worse.&#34; I almost cried. When he had me take 4-6 deep breaths to check my lungs with his stethoscope I almost passed out. Now I&#39;m home stuck on the couch under an electric blanket feeling like crap with no relief in sight. Hoping no one else has this ever.

I took 1 Extra strength Tylenol at 4:00pm but it didn?t seem to help. At 7:00 pm I took 2 ibuprofen, again didn?t seem to help.  Finally fell asleep around  10:30 pm.

Fell asleep and slept through until 7:00am, felt better with a  mild headache , fatigue, and upset stomach through the day(March 14).  Low energy and slight headache remain on March 15th.

                                                After the injection the patient grabbed her arm and when she was asked if she was ok she didn&#39;t respond and seemed slouched down. It didn&#39;t seem like she passed out but she was slouching and not responding. She seemed like she was having convulsion that lasted less than 5 seconds. Then she calmed down and her breathing was fine. I got her to respond to me that she was awake and ok. She responded with head nods. She seemed to come to a little more after a minute and she said she was fine but I wanted to call 911. I called the paramedics. During the wait she seemed to get better, we gave her water and she was slowing starting to move around more. We asked her about any under lying issues or any problems with any vaccine before. She said no to everything. The paramedics came and took all of her vitals and she was cleared that everything was ok. She called her boyfriend and we asked him to come by to help her and give her a ride home and assist. He got here and she still didn&#39;t feel totally better. After a few more minutes I took her blood pressure and it was 87/55 and her pulse was around 60. We called 911 again because she stated she wasn&#39;t feeling well again. The paramedics came back and she had a 89/41 blood pressure with a pulse of 40. They indicated that she may be having a cardiac issue so they took her to the ER.

I got up and walked back over to my waiting chair and my Husband got up and received his vaccine.    Besides the pain in my left arm,  I started feeling weird tingling sensations and spaced out.  When my Husband sat back down next to me,  my stomach had a burning sensation and I felt slightly nauseated.  Then I felt like I was about to faint.  My Husband and the Staff kept me from falling, The Staff brought ice packs to put on my neck.  They said I turned white and profusely sweat.   I don&#39;t remember all of it, my Husband filled in the blanks.  I started feeling better and we left @4:30.

I got the vaccine at 9am.  around 4pm that afternoon i started feeling sick.  by 7:30pm I was in bed thinking I was going die!   By midnight, I got up and tried to walk to the stairs but i was to weak to walk.  I could not sleep.  I was up for 36 hours!  I was nauseous, dizzy, weak, exhausted.  Every inch of my body had pain!!!  I was tingling all over.  I  had the chills until midnight.  My heart would race and then stop... then race again... I was having difficulty breathing!  I tried standing up but I couldn&#39;t.  I would have driven myself to the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t walk.  by noon the next day, my heart regulated, I was able to breath easier.  I was still exhausted and full of pain and tingling.  Today, I still have some pain, but no tingling.

My finger tips on my left arm went numb, same arm where I received the shot.  By the time I got home  I had a headache, so I took some tylenol.   My mouth is dry on and off. They told me to drink water and Gatorade  I slept for about 5 hours. I feel better but I still have a dry mouth.  The next morning my arm was swollen and itchy around the injection. I used an ice pack for the swelling.  About 24 hours later I was sweating on and off and my headache continued. I took another tylenol. And my body muscles were hurting.  I did not see a physician during any of the episodes.  It&#39;s the morning of March 23rd and I feel okay today.

The body aches &amp; low grade fever only lasted for the one day post vaccination.

That evening she was taken to the Cath Lab and had an IVC filter placed. The next day patient began to have paresthesias and discoloration of the right lower extremity.  Ultrasound showed high-grade occlusion of the right proximal superficial femoral artery.  Patient was pre-treated with platelets and  taken back to Cath Lab emergently.  In addition to the right SFA there is also thrombotic occlusion of bilateral iliacs.  Patient had bilateral thrombectomy and bilateral common iliac stent placement. The following day developed gross hematuria.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the vaccine I started getting a headache and felt chills. I was on my way to a hotel before leaving for a flight the next morning and was driving. When I stopped driving and attempted to exit my car, I experienced dizziness and stroke like symptoms. My legs would not hold me up and I felt as if I would pass out in the road. I held on to the car for several minutes until the feeling abated somewhat. Then I made my way unsteadily into the  hotel building and had to sit down for several minutes. My heart was beating rapidly and I felt strange so I took one of my nitroglycerin and also took an extra 12.5 mg Coreg.  After being taken to my room, I laid on the bed and continued to feel  weak, lightheaded and became very nauseous. I got out my pulse oximeter and my pulse was 95.  I took another Coreg and it seemed to slow it down for a little while but again it started racing and I continued to be nauseous and broke out in sweats and my pulse got back up to 100. I took another nitroglycerin and a baby aspirin in case I was having a heart attack. Then I took another Coreg. My pulse rate finally slowed down. I slept intermittently until going to the airport at 5 a.m.  I still felt weak and nauseous and very tired.

                                                Vaccine administered @ Noon, slight headache right after. Chills began at 10:30 p.m. and non-stop shaking. Able to dose. Awoke at 2:00 a.m. 4/6 with a very rapid heartbeat, feverish and terrible headache. Removed covers and tried to find my thermometer. Almost called 911, but decided to wait to see if it got better. Once covers removed, I cooled down enough to try and find my thermometer again - heart rate still very elevated. Found it and temperature showed to be 101 (not sure of accuracy though).  Took (2) extra-strength Tylenol and drank 16oz of water. At 3:00 a.m. still had very bad headache, but heart slowed down. My arm was a little sore for only 24-hrs, but not any more than when I receive a flu shot.

                                                FYI, Approx. 1:00 AM woke up with high fever and could hardly move. Whole body hurt very bad. Shaking from chills . Bad headache. Very thirsty. Definitely flu like symptoms, but worse. Turned electric blanket on, very cold, and just tried to sleep. Only getting out of bed to use restroom and more water. Straight back to bed. I did not vomit, nor did I have diarrhea.  Could not stand it any longer Saturday PM approx. 10:00 took two Advil. Woke up Sunday 8:00 AM felt much better. Still had slight symptoms, but I could do chores. My brother kept checking on me. Came to let my dog out. My brother wanted me to call 911 but I can not afford that.  It was holiday weekend,  I wanted to die, didn?t care.  I get the flu shot every year. I have a high pain tolerance, very rare for me to be sick.  If I needed a second dose. I would NOT get it. If I would have known it was that bad, I would not have signed up to get it. Thank you.

                                                I had been drinking the night before. I woke up at 8:00 am with a blazing headache. (I&#39;ve been having a lot of headaches lately.) My coffee didn&#39;t take right. By 4:00 pm, I wasn&#39;t feeling right.  Became flushed, an elevated temperature of 99 degrees,  with flu-like symptoms.  I was terribly dehydrated.  When I arrived home, I made a sandwich and 12 oz of seltzer water.

                                                Ended up putting the injection in the back of the left shoulder - she missed my arm muscle. I went to the doctor (I saw the dr on the 8th) and had her look at it. Immediately my mouth, nose and sinuses went numb. I had chills, fever, aches and pains - I was pretty sick for a few days but this original numbness has not gone away. The dr said to leave it alone and she thought by the weekend I would be fine but I&#39;m still feeling the numbness.  (I had a Tetanus shot in February after I cut myself.)

About 6 hours later, body pain, chills, body temperature dis-regulation (hot/cold/sweaty) throughout the night. At approximately 10:30 a.m. (approx. 20 hours post injection) I was standing at the kitchen counter getting some water, still experiencing extreme fatigue and body pain, about 4 hours after a dose of Extra Strength Tylenol, and had some kind of weird event where I began to feel faint and before I knew it, my body began convulsing (large shakes) and the next thing I knew I was seated on the kitchen floor and my husband was asking me &#34;what happened&#34;. It never happened again and we decided an ambulance was not necessary. But I thought to report it because this kind of thing is not on the &#34;the list&#34; of expected side effects.

She described it as like &#34;lightening&#34;, both electrical and heat that radiated from the injection site to her fingertips.  Pain started with administration of vaccine.  She felt &#34;crumby&#34; on Saturday.  Today she no longer feels the burning sensation, but has a 1/2&#34; ring around injection site that is swollen and bruised. She also reported feeling a knot under her skin.  She did not seek medical attention and was quite embarrassed that she cried after her injection.

                                                Immediately after administration patient felt extremely dizzy and about to faint. We placed her on the floor with her feet elevated. Placed an icepack behind her neck. Patient never lost consciousness. But, since patient was reporting a &#34;body buzz&#34; we called 911 to be on the safe side since patient has severe allergies. Paramedics came, checked the patient and decided she did not need further treatment.

I also started to develop a fast heartrate which felt like palpitations. The same evening, I had severe migraines which lasted for the next three days. It is 4/15/21, and I feel exhausted and have flu-like symptoms.

Within an hour I had severe chills, body aches, headache and shivering.  This lasted for about 6 - 8 hours and then began to subside.  I never registered a fever.  The following day I just felt kinda blah, without a lot of energy but all symptoms were gone.

The headache progressed throughout the day and was accompanied by nausea to the point where I was not able to eat anything.  At times I did feel cold but there was no fever.  It felt like a bad sinus headache and continued throughout the evening. I did take Advil and sinus medication for relief. I was fine the next day when I awoke.

Then whole body muscle soreness/heaviness began on April 5th for 3 days.  I had swelling in both legs for only one day, on April 12th.

                                                At 23 hours post Johnson and Johnson vaccination, I began to have a 10/10 headache (which was the worst headache of my life), nausea and severe aura. I then became extremely confused and was taken to the emergency department by my husband. The following was reported to me the next day when I awoke in the ICU at Hospital: within an hour of arriving at the ED, I exhibited a progressive hyperactive delirium, agitation, slurred speech (word salad), combativeness, confabulation, word finding difficulties and an inability to follow commands. The neurologist in the ED said that she was seeing this adverse vaccination side effect in other patients at the 24-hour period. I received Haldol, Zyprexa, and Ativan to control the delirium and received a head CT angiogram in the ED, which was normal. I was transferred by ambulance to the main hospital due to acute metabolic encephalopathy/altered mental status. I was admitted to the neurological unit whereby I became critically hypotensive (60s over 30s) and was transferred to the ICU due to persistent hypotension unresponsive to IV normal saline. I was then transferred and admitted to the ICU and was given continued IV fluid resuscitation and Levophed vasopressor. I was eventually weaned from vasopressors and was discharged back home in three days exhausted, bruised, fatigued and with continuous clouded mentation. I have been told by all of the doctors that this was a vaccination side-effect, which caused cerebritis. I was subsequently treated as an outpatient at Hospital for intractable aura with IV Valporic Acid, Magnesium, and Lasix infusion on April 1, 2021.

                                                I got the JNJ vaccine on Wed 4/7/21 (a wk before FDA paused that covid vaccine).  Initial response was Extreme Fatigue, but starting 11:45 pm on 4/18/21, I suffered headache, chest pain, short of breath. I could not sleep at all till 4/19/21 PM after asking my kids to pray for me. In case it&#39;s just heartburn, I took TUMS at 8:15 pm  on 4/19/21 . Headache, short of breath comes and goes, but the chest pain persists, and I develop a hot flash.  I never took birth control pills, but my OB/GYN prescribed daily Estrogen (to prevent osteoporosis) and every 3 month, Progesterone for 10 days (to prevent breast cancer). Estrogen &amp; Progesterone happen to be the birth control pills&#39; composition.  On 4/17/21, I finished my 10 days Progesterone regime. I discontinued the Estrogen supplement on 4/19/21 or 4/20/21, now (4/23/21 1:20 am) no more chest pain, but still feel fatigue, feverish with a hazy/foggy head (not really a headache).   I have a suggestion for JNJ, FDA, CDC on JNJ vaccine warning label.   If indeed those 6 women are all on birth control pills which are composed of synthetic estrogen and progesterone, then the warning label should also warn people who take these hormone supplements, instead of just an age range.

                                                Immediately that evening, I started to get headachy and nauseous. My arm in the injection site was very sore. The next morning, the other arm was sore. It was difficult for me to raise my arms above my head without feeling extremely weak. I couldn&#39;t lift anything above my head for the fear I would drop them. Knee replacement surgery on both knees about 4 years ago - I felt pain in my knees; all my joints; all of my teeth; my vision was blurry. My head hurt so badly. Tylenol dulled the headache and joint pain but it didn&#39;t help it to go away. My chest also hurt quite a bit. I felt extremely lethargic.  I didn&#39;t feel like getting out of bed. I could only get the  meals  made (I&#39;m a caregiver for my mom and mother-in-law) and then get back into bed. I usually walk five miles a day. I&#39;m still not there yet ( to walk that much) but I&#39;m getting better. The nausea lasted until the 17th. The headache just left finally on April 23. The body aches, teeth ache and joints subsided around the 17th also. The blurry vision - I still have a a little bit of that but it&#39;s starting to improve. The weakness in the arm - that is starting to improve - I do still feel kind of weak when I raise my arms above my head. The fatigue I still have but I&#39;m feeling a bit of improvement.  I have to keep checking my bed to see if I accidentally put the massage setting on (and I hadn&#39;t) because my body was shaking  in entire  body- That started on the second day after the vaccine and stopped about the 19th. I called to the advice nurse to register my health complaint and she had me come in for a full workup. And she asked me to go to ER. They kept me in the ER overnight.

                                                When I received the injection, I experienced a sharp intense burning pain which shot up my shoulder, neck and behind my ear. This has never happened before. My shoulder/arm were sore for approximately one week which seemed typical to how I respond to a vaccine. After a week I began experiencing a sharp pain in my neck and shoulder area which has gradually worsened to where I am now icing it multiple times per day. There is also numbness and tingling down my forearm and into my thumb and index finger.  The pain is unmanageable at times and I am unable to get a full nights rest and have near constant pain when keyboarding.
