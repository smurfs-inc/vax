I then experienced body aches and extreme body weakness, thoughts were difficult to articulate and process, and I began to feel nauseated. This continued until 03/17/2021 in which I felt only nauseated, bloated. My headache was kept at bay with acetaminophen.

My hands and feet went numb and I started sweating all over. I felt sick to my stomach and I felt like I was above the whole situation-- I could hear the people talking but I felt like I was somewhere else. After resting my head on the table for about 10 minutes I felt better and was able to move to a cot where I rested for another 20 minutes or so until I felt pretty much back to normal. I was treated by the medical team at the site who cleared me to go home.

Woke up @12:30am with chills, a headache, soreness in the injection site, and body aches in the neck, back and legs.  Got up and tried stretching and drinking water. Stoped drinking water when I felt nauseas. Did not throw up. Took Ibuprofen and melatonin before falling asleep about 30 minutes after taking the medication. Woke up @3:00am and chills were gone, only left with pain in the knees and injection site. Wasn?t able to sleep until around 4:45am. When I woke up @7:45 am, I still had slight pain in the knees, I took Tylenol @10:45 am. Pain was on and off throughout the day. I took a hot bath, that helped the pain tremendously. Fatigue throughout the day. After sleeping the day after the shot, all symptoms are gone, only soreness in the injection site.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection, I woke up after sleeping for an hour with excruciating pain in all of my limbs, especially the injection site. I could not move any of my limbs. Not because of pain, I simply could not move them. I had a fever (temp not recorded, I could only tell because I was burning up.) I was very nauseous, but never vomited. I was shaking very hard and had the chills despite being covered by a blanket and simultaneously burning up. Both of my ankles that I had suffered a running injury to several weeks ago (I have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appointment to get them checked out) were pulsing with pain. I developed a minor headache. Eventually I either drifted back to sleep or stayed awake, because I don&#39;t remember anything up until around 5am when I was able to get up and take Tylenol and water. All symptoms were gone except for the minor headache.

                                                I felt completely normal after getting the vaccine. Then at 8 pm (5 hours after getting it) I felt heat rushing to my head and face. I became very weak in my legs and I had to lay down. I took ibuprofen at 9 pm because my body aching was very intense. I woke up at 11:30 pm with such terrible body aches I could not sleep and I was crying from the pain. I had freezing chills and a throbbing headache. When I tried to stand up, I almost fell over because I felt so light-headed. I thought I was going to faint. I was so concerned about the amount of pain I was in that I called my doctor and public safety came and checked on me. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed for 3 hours. I drank Gatorade and took more ibuprofen. I was able to check my temperature. I had a 101-103 degree fever.  The entire next day (Tuesday) I took ibuprofen every six hours. My body was still very weak and aching everywhere as well as a headache. I stayed in bed the entire day. Today (Wednesday) I feel much better??both of my arms still ache a lot and my body feels exhausted.

                                                After about 4 hours of having the shot, I got extremely light headed and nauseous. About the same time I got really bad chills and was shaking aggressively from the cold and got very bad pain in my joints, back, neck and injection site. My skin felt very sensitive and hurt to touch.  I took medication and felt a little better but was unable to eat due to the nausea. A few hours later I still had very sensitive skin and nausea but I was very hot and couldn?t cool off. The following morning at about 8am on April 9 I woke up with hives on my ears, back of my neck up to the top of my head and the center of my chest. I still had severe body pains and my hives spread throughout the day to my face, inflating my forehead, nose and lips. I was still unable to eat because of the nausea and I was still taking ibuprofen which usually eliminates my hives. My body pain, nausea and hives stayed consistent the entire day despite taking the proper medication precautions. At about 12:30am on April 10 I checked my temperature at 100.3 degrees. At 2:30am it dropped to 98.9 degrees. The first meal I was able to eat was at about 7:30am on April 10 while take over the counter anti-nausea medication. It?s currently about 5:15pm on April 10 and most of my hives have reduced to redness, my body pain and injection site pain is still consistent and my nausea has barely reduced.

I experienced these cold like symptoms throughout the night.  At around 6:00 am, I woke up with a very mild headache and muscle aches.   I took my temperature, and had a 101 degree Fahrenheit fever. I rested, and took my temperature multiple times that morning-- which had been gradually decreasing. At around 11:30/12:00 I experienced a sudden onset of extreme fatigue followed closely by a greatly reduced ability to hear and see, along with extreme lightheadedness and the feeling like I was going to pass out. I suddenly became cold, and my body was drenched in sweat in a matter of seconds.  I think the whole experience lasted around 10 minutes, before it eventually began to pass. I could see clearly again  and began to regain my hearing, however I still experienced some lingering auditory complications for an additional three- five minutes ( it sounded like a throbbing white noise). After that, I felt a little disoriented and tired. My aunt had taken me to Urgent Care, but they turned me away, saying I needed to go to the ER. However, by that time my symptoms had passed and I was feeling ok. So I went home and rested. By the next morning, I felt I had completely recovered

                                                I got the vaccine at 3:45 arm was sore but I wasn?t worried Later that night around 6 I started feeling disgusting from vaccine so I took an Advil.  Around 8-10pm my body started getting chills, I started shaking, I had a headache my muscles were sore, and I started getting a fever. Around 12am all of the previous symptoms got worse my fever was at about 101 and rising and I was extremely tired. At 1am I felt the worst I have ever felt in my entire life. I could barely walk because my muscles and joints hurt and my fever was over 102.5 and I felt like my veins were on fire. At 2 am I moved to my bathroom because the floor was cold and I didn?t want my roommate seeing me cry from how much pain I was in. I have a high pain tolerance but this was the worst pain I?ve ever been in. In the bathroom I was at the peak of the pain of the vaccine. My fever was over 103 all of my previous side effects were worse than ever I felt weak and a little dizzy. I also was having a hard time breathing, my breathing was weak and I felt like I wasn?t getting enough air. I tried looking up on my phone if I should go to the hospital but I could barely pick up my phone to type or look. I dropped my phone and fell asleep in the floor for 20 minutes before I woke up. I walked slowly over to my bed and took a Tylenol and then had a sip of water and felt like I was going to puke. I tried to use my inhaler and I couldn?t hold my breath to use it. I crawled into bed and slept until 11 the next day and was too sore to walk to class all of my joints still hurt and I had a fever of 101 and a headache . I took a Tylenol and around 6pm my fever broke and I was feeling better. The next day I was still too sore to walk to class and had a headache. Today I am still sore but better my lungs still feel a little tight, I feel unfocused , and I still feel dizzy occasionally. I have no appetite and I feel nauseous when I eat so I?ve been eating in smaller portions . Every single day since the shot I?ve felt very tired. I hope these symptoms get better and Looking back on the night of vaccine I should have gone to the hospital.

Felt these symptoms from about 4:00 PM until about 11:00 PM when I went to sleep. The next morning, 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, my head still ached/throbbed, and my back still felt incredibly awful. My left shoulder was also still very sore. As of now, almost 60 hours after the vaccine, the only symptom still remaining is the very sore shoulder. I cannot extend it fully without immense pain, but it still hurts otherwise.

Shortly after the headache appeared I started to get the chills, I was wrapped up in multiple blankets and started shaking uncontrollably. I then checked my temperature and at this time it was 100.3. I then ate dinner and decided to try and fall asleep. When I lied down my heart began to beat very fast. I tracked my heart rate via a watch and my resting heart rate was around 140 bpm. My fever had also increased to 102. My head ache continued to get worse and I began to have bad neck and lower back pains. I was also having muscle spasm in my calfs. The entire night I could barely sleep because of my high heart rate, body aches, shakes, and the constant change from freezing cold to hot and sweating.

Within a minute, her skin color became pinkish, and breathing was detected.  She became aware of her environment.  While we waited for the paramedics, her breathing and skin came back to normal.  She reported of no breakfast or lunch before getting the vaccine.  We gave her some chocolate and water.  Her family later reported that she passed out after a flu shot a few years back.  Her family refused to take her to hospital after the paramedic&#39;s advice.

                                                She felt totally fine after the shot and many hours after.  She felt fine to go to a horseback ride lesson at 4.  Half way through the lesson she acutely felt like she was going to faint/nauseous (she had a ton to eat that day, had a bottle of water just before lesson, etc. so she knew it wasnt those kinds of things) and then had a crushing headache with a lot of &#34;pressure behind her eyes&#34;, dizziness, and a really &#34;strange&#34; feeling like out of body, bawling crying, and started FREEZING.  I got there 15 minutes later and she was under lots of blankets, white as a sheet, freezing, said her spine was sore from the top to bottom... just tons of symptoms.  When I got her, she moved to my car and had seat heater on high and I had to put all the clothes from a suitcase I had in my car on top of her bc she was so cold and her skin was burning up.  I gave her 3 200 advil and a bottle of water.  ½ hour later i had a thermometer and even after that she still had 102.3 fever.  She was rambling some nonsense and seemed very disoriented for a while. She went straight to shower and laid on the floor of the shower for ½ hour, took cold medicine, and evnetually went to sleep.  In the night she was freezing again and the fever had spiked and she took more advil.  The next day she felt much better in the morning and fine by lunchtime.  She was VERY sick/uncomfortable with basically every symptom under the sun.

The shivering is so intense it essentially renders the patient in a state of involuntary writhing; muscles across the body, even if not in movement, may be tensed to the point of pain. Muscles affected lie in the legs, arms, and torso. An observer might mistake the event for a seizure, though the patient is fully conscious for the duration. The episode lasts only a few minutes; such an episode has only occurred once.

She was feeling fine up until around 10:00 that night when she began to have some of the regular side effects in addition to some unusual ones that were more concerning.  She had chills was feverish and nauseous with flu like symptoms of her body aching.  However, at around 10:30 that night she reported having difficulty breathing and having chest pains with pain when she would take breaths. She noticeably was taking very small but frequent breaths due to the pain. She described a pressure on her chest as if there was a bowling ball sitting on top of her chest. She was crying from the pain and her difficulty breathing. She also reported that her throat felt like it was smaller/ constricted.    At that time, she was given Acetaminophen and later around 12:00 she was given Benadryl.  When she went to bed that night, she was in pain but she also reported that her heart was racing and her resting pulse at the time was 110 bpm. She had the flu like symptoms into Thursday evening but by Friday she looked a lot better except for her difficulty breathing with complaints of chest pain when she breaths with continued pressure on her chest.  She rested in bed for most of Friday and on Saturday she got dressed in the afternoon and took a walk around half a mile at which time she was exhausted and felt out of breath.  When she walked back from her destination about a half mile, she needed to rest in bed to recuperate.  The pain while breathing lasted into Sunday. Monday morning, she attempted to run and became winded from running a short distance of ¼ of the block and could not catch her breath having difficulty breathing and throwing up with a lot of subsequent chest pain that day. She was taken to the doctor by 10:00 that morning to run lab tests and get an examination.  She is slowly getting better and taking it easy but Tuesday she still had some pain and by Thursday she is reporting that while the chest pain is still there it is more of a discomfort that she feels when breathing as compared to pain.  She continues to report the discomfort when breathing till today 4/16/21 and is still limiting her physical activity but going about her daily routine.

                                                Around 7 hours after receiving the vaccine I started to get a fever. It was 99.6 at 11:30pm, 102.2 at 2:15am, 102.7 at 3:25am. It started going down at 4:00am after taking 1000 mg naproxen and Tylenol. Fever came back around 1:15pm today at 100.7 and has been up to 101.7 as of 5:30pm. The fever has come along with relentless shaking due to the chills. A migraine has also persisted despite taking NSAIDs to help with that as well.

                                                I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EAU at 1:45 PM. I was very tired around 8:30 PM, so I went to bed. I never fell fully asleep and began feeling worse at 11:00 PM. I had a fever of 101.5 F, chills, muscle spasms, anxiety, shortness of breath, and could not stop crying. This lasted until approx. 4 AM when I finally fell asleep. The next morning I woke up feeling much better. But, for the next 5 days, I have had on-and-off low-grade fevers between 99F and 100F.

Roughly an hour to an hour and a half later, the chills/shaking stopped, only to be replaced by a fever. My temperature shot up, my ears began to ring, and my head began to pound. When I tried to eat, I felt sick to my stomach.   My fever lasted for the entire evening, and I spent most of the night alternating between chills and heat flashes. My head continued to pound, and whenever I tried to sit up, I felt dizzy. At around 4am, I awoke with an upset stomach, diarrhea, and further dizziness.   By around 8-9am, my fever had subsided, and I was beginning to feel a bit better. However, I have been feeling physically drained and a little achy today (03/26).

Her eyes rolled back, stiff arm, and she urinated herself. Her mom was holding her hand and after a few seconds, she was able to talk and said that she thought that she fell asleep for a few seconds. We called an ambulance and they are taking her to the hospital for a CT scan.

                                                Within 10-15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient complained of nausea and was very white and clammy. When observing her, she appeared like she was going to fall over so I had her mom help me put her on her back. 911 was called and I took her blood pressure and it was 80/49 mmHg. She remained conscious and EMS took her to ED for observation. She was given liquids, discharged and told to come back if she had any other symptoms. Per her mother, she had not ate or drank anything prior to receiving the shot.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, my left arm was shooting pain and cramped up. That faded after a couple minutes and I felt fine afterwards. Starting at 7:00PM (April 6/same day), I suddenly felt extremely dizzy, nauseous, and my entire body is aching to the point of tears. My lower abdomen and spine/hips are also in terrible pain. I?m in too much pain to sleep even though I?m exhausted and for a little while, I was struggling to catch my breath. I also have chills and feel that a fever is not far off.

My body aches focused on my spine and I started to become dizzy and nauseous. Around 4:00 am, the worst migraine, I have ever had that encased my whole head, lasted for about 12 hours with hot flashes. After the migraine, my body and head is sensitive to rapid motion and loud noises.

                                                Within the hour after receiving shot, migraine formed along with fatigue. Both progressively got worse through out that day(4/7/21). On 4/8/21 I woke up many times through out the night with a migraine that felt as though my brain was burning and sinus pressure, causing immense eye sensitivity. Throughout the night I became increasingly more sweaty, but didn?t have the proper thermometer to take my temperature.  I took ibuprofen (at 6:45 AM on 4/8/21) which helped those two side effects subside (around 8 AM). Fatigue has been constant throughout both days. Around 5:00 PM on 4/8/21 I ate broccoli and rice for dinner, small amounts, and encountered bad diarrhea. It lasted for about half an hour. Migraine is reduced significantly (at 6:41 PM), but there is slight nausea, weakness, and fatigue.

I ran over, and as soon as I got there she started to convulse, therefore appeared to be having a seizure. I help her fiance get her onto the ground safely and placed her on her side, then called for my tech to call 911. The seizure/convulsions only seemed to last 10-15 seconds. She then came to, and was disoriented. Then she felt nausous, and threw up a small amount. The paramedics arrived, checked her out. She said she was felt fine, and refused to go with them to the hospital.

I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Immediately after getting the vaccine, I experienced severe nausea for 10-20 minutes. I experienced no symptoms for 3-4 hours afterward, but then began to develop a low-grade fever,  muscle aches, a headache, and became nauseous again.  Around 12 hours after getting the vaccine, I developed a fever of 102 F, I began to experience severe muscle aches and cramps in my calves and abdomen. I also began to develop a much worse headache and lost partial vision in my right eye for a few hours. This is when I became violently nauseous, but I was unable to throw up, or defecate.  I was unable to sleep during this time, and at 2 am, my nausea peaked, and I threw up incredibly violently and incredibly suddenly. It was so violent, it caused me to pop a blood vessel in my eye, and gave me a sore throat. However, after throwing up, most of nausea subsided.  At this point, the vision began to return to my eye. 20-40 minutes after throwing up, I began to experience chills that lasted for up to an hour. Eventually, I slept at 4 am, but slept fitfully, and woke every 40 minutes to 2 hours.  At 7 am on the 9th, the nausea was completely gone the day after my vaccination, but the muscle aches and headaches were back. My fever was down to 101, and I took some Tylenol and slept fitfully until 2 pm when I woke up feeling significantly better.

                                                My school, hosted a clinic and pressured students to receive the vaccine, threatening them with an email saying we may not be able to return to school the next semester if we did not receive the vaccine in the next day and a half. I felt extremely dizzy after recieving the vaccine, and I&#39;ve never felt like that after any shot before, sho I was concerned. Within five hours, I started feeling really weak, and I developed a fever. In an hour, my fever rose to 104, my hands and feet were blue, and I felt so cold my fingers and feet were numb. I couldn&#39;t breathe, and I started coughing every time I took a deep breath. My entire body ached and I had stabbing pains in my abdomen. This was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.

Patient was unresponsive for approximately 30 seconds. She came to and was very disoriented and her pupils were extremely dilated. The paramedics came and did blood pressure checks and several other evaluations. They advised her to go with them by ambulance to the ER to be evaluated due to falling directly on her face/head. Patient went outside and was evaluated further in the ambulance but was not willing to go to the ER.

She states she developed numbness in the left cheek starting on 4/9/21.  For reference she says the vaccine was given in the left arm.  The numbness comes and goes.  I encouraged her to register for VSAFE and report her symptoms and to notify us if anything else develops.

By 9pm patient had high fever, body aches, nausea, head spinning, bad headaches, and very fatigued. Mother gave her some pain and fever medicine.  By 10pm she began complaining her chest felt like being squeezed. Mother applied some camphor essential oil on her chest. Seemed to bring a bit of comfort. Mother prepared her few bottles to drink throughout the night. Next morning 6am, patient still had a high fever throughout the day and evening, nausea, headaches, body pains but no more chest squeezing! Friday morning: patient&#39;s fever is gone. Yet she still has head aches and tired.New symptoms are sore throat and a blue toenail! Saturday morning: still some headache, sore throat, a bit of pain in the chest between the breasts, her arm where the injection took place is swollen as big as a grapefruit and painful to the touch as well as warm. You can clearly see the spot where the neddle was inserted.

I tried to watch TV but it was too painful. I was really scared and I did not think the night would end.

                                                That night, around 9 pm - from the time I got the shot until then I was fine. At 9 pm, I came to my dorm and I got hot and woozy. My friend told me that my forehead was puffy (swollen). I laid down and I realized I was really really cold but skin was hot to touch. I think I had a fever.  I was shaky and shivery and trembling. I tried to take a nap. Fell asleep for an hour - don&#39;t remember that time at all - but my friend told me I went to sleep. My smart watch was telling me my heart rate was 120s and 130s while I was sleeping. I debated whether I should go to the Dr. and I called the school police and they took me to the ER   - at 03:00 am on the 8th - and they told me to rest for  day and wait it out. I still feel like I have a lot of adrenaline - my watch says that my heart rate is way to high for what I&#39;m doing. It&#39;s usually in 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s but it&#39;s in the 120&#39;s and 130&#39;s every day and I am really shaky with adrenaline. I have had a headache since Wednesday night and it hasn&#39;t gone away. If it goes past Wednesday, I will go to my primary care doctor but otherwise no treatment at this time.

Head pain progressed and got worse and worse. A fever was present by 3am (99.0) and went up every hour reaching the highest of 102.7. I experienced violent chills and shaking, extreme nausea, extreme muscle aches and pains, extreme light sensitivity, dizziness, lethargy, and extreme weakness. I took extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours to control fever and other symptoms. All symptoms subsided within 24 hours, except for headache, tiredness and aches and pains. All symptoms went away by 8pm on 4/13/2021.

                                                A few hours after I got home from getting the shot, my lower body started to ache super bad. My skin started to hurt like I had rug burn, but I wasn&#39;t surprised because that happens to me when I get the flu. My legs and groin region started to hurt more and more and I got the chills. It was extremely bad and I was sort of writhing but I told myself I was overreacting. At around 8 or 9, I decided I would sleep it off and went to bed. At 1:00 am, I got up to use the bathroom and I began feeling lightheaded. I thought I had just stood up to fast so I continued. As I walked, i got more and more dizzy and I couldn&#39;t hear well. When I sat on the toilet, I realized I wasn&#39;t going to be able to get back up, so I sat and waited. I started to get super hot so I took my shirt off. I finally was able to get up and walked towards the sink but I collapsed before I got there. I started drinking the sink water and ran my shirt under the water and put it on my head to cool off.  This really helped so I went back to my room to call my mom. I have never fainted before or come this close to fainting. For the rest of the night I had the worst migrane of my life that gave me aura in my left eye and made my left arm and left side of my face go numb, as well as pulsing in my head. The pain on my skin, and in my legs and head was still there for two days after but it was manageable enough for me to go about my day. I tried to exercize to ease the muscle pain but this did not work.

I took ibuprofen at 8:00pm. That night at about 9:00 my fever was 100.8 and I felt extreme fatigue.  I woke up at 3:30am feeling both extremely hot and cold with a bad headache and my temperature was 101.5. I took ibuprofen again at 3:30am. I then woke up at 5:15 am with a horrible headache and was very hot and sweating. I put cold compresses on my forehead and back of my neck which helped. The entire night, my arm with the injection site was very painful and stiff to move.

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine, a cold, tingling, transient sensation was experienced radiating from the site of the injection up into the neck. Roughly 6 hours after injection (1 a.m., 3/9/2021) severe chills were experienced for approximately two and a half hours, preventing sleep. Patient experienced dizziness. spO2 was within normal limits. Temperature was measured w/ oral thermometer to be 101.3 degrees farenheit at 4:55 a.m. in the morning on 3/9/2021.  Treatment was a single dose of ibuprofen at roughly 8 a.m. (3/9/21). Pt. continued to experience fatigue and sporadic chills, with gradual abatement of symptoms over the course of the day. Pt. had no symptoms the following Wednesday (3/10/21). Pt. experienced symptoms the following Thursday (3/11/21), with a sudden onset of intense stomach pain (8/10 on NRS) starting at approximately noon. Stomach pain was more similar to muscle cramps (with aching quality) than nausea. Other symptoms included fatigue and some feverish experiences (such as chills). Treatment was conservative (ginger tea, peppermint candies, rest). Temperature taken that evening via oral thermometer (roughly 7pm, 3/11/21) was 101.4 degrees farenheit.  Symptoms were significantly reduced the following morning, Friday 3/12/21. Temperature taken approximately 10 a.m. was within normal limits.

It was so bad that it caused me to stay in bed all day the day following the vaccine and I had to stay home from school and work. Today I am still extremely fatigued and have a bad headache and dizziness. This was not relieved by the maximum dose of Tylenol.

                                                It started with my teeth chattering and chills, but no fever yet. All of the muscles in my body had a severe tremor, and I had trouble with simple tasks like filling my nasal rinse bottle, because the tremor was so bad. My jaw was smacking the entire time, so hard that the headboard smacked against the blinds. Then I checked my temperature and it had gone from 97.5 to about 99.5. The symptoms got worse, and added in excessive thirst, pain at the base of my head where it meets my neck, pressure under and behind the eyes, severe lower back pain, muscle pain escalating on the right side of my body only, nausea, pain across the top of my forehead, and a weird heat sensation under my fingernails? Maybe and hour or so passed, and my fever rose to above 101, and I tried to go back to sleep. By this point the tremors were over, but slight chills and every other symptoms remained. I took my temp later and it was 102.7, and I again had all symptoms except the initial tremors. I also had tachycardia (super rapid heartbeat) and got dizzy for a second and have a little trouble focusing my vision when I sat up in bed.

We called 9-1-1 to check vitals and they recommended going to her doctor or the hospital in case of additional swelling.  We called the doctor and they told us to try Benadryl.  This worked a little bit, but she is still in a lot of discomfort today (Saturday after Thursday shot).

                                                Patient was given the injection and then she started feeling dizzy right after administration.  She sat with her head against the wall and dropped her phone and passed out for just a moment.  She had a slight tremor/shake for a few seconds. (I did not witness, unsure exactly what happened or how long)   She came too fairly quickly after being yelled at, are you ok?  When she regained consciousness she complained of being hot all over for a bit.  We gave her ice packs to cool down.  She felt hot for maybe 10-15 minutes, but felt relief with the ice packs.  She also drank some sips of cool water which seemed to help her cool down.

                                                When I got the vaccine, I had almost passed out and felt like I needed to vomit. Later, I started getting really cold and shivering, and there was nothing I could do to make it stop. I started getting a headache, nausea, and weakness around that time too, maybe a bit sooner, like 3:00pm. The chills  started at around 5:00pm.

                                                Hives on my arms and stomach developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine at 2:16. I left the facility after 30 minutes because the hives did not get any worse and I did not experience any other symptoms. At home about 8 hours later, I started feeling exhausted, weak, and my body was literally shaking whenever I stood. Overnight, I felt feverish, I had the worst nightmares, and woke up every few hours. On Friday (next day) I felt dizzy whenever I moved, nauseous whenever I stood, and once when I was standing too long I started vomiting.  On Friday evening I went to a local ER (all the urgent cares were closed) at my primary care Dr?s suggestion to ensure that I wasn?t having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The ER determined that the hives were likely an allergic reaction but all other symptoms were reactions due to the vaccine.

                                                I began feeling a migraine at 3pm. I took a nap and woke up at 6pm feeling extremely ill. My temperature was 101.5F and my entire body was in pain. I took two Tylenol as suggested. Over the course of the entire evening, I was vomiting profusely; I vomited approximately 10 times. By around 10pm my extremities became numb and I could not walk without assistance. I could not think or speak straight. I nearly fainted every time I tried to sit up. I tried to take ondansetron for vomiting but proceeded to vomit the medication as well. I wanted to go in to the ER because I felt like I was dying, but I do not feel financially comfortable doing so. All symptoms remained consistent until about 3am when I was able to sleep until 7am. I woke up with several bouts of diarrhea, intense nausea, and head to toe muscle and joint pains, as well as numbness and tingling in my arms and legs still. It is now 5pm the next day and I still can&#39;t eat or stand for too long without feeling faint. I still have diarrhea and strong migraine.

At 11:00pm I became extremely ill with a fever of 103 F and vomited 4 times consecutively.  I went back to bed, still with a fever and chills. At 12:30 am (April 9th) I again started vomiting again (around 3 times).  I then went back to bed and fell asleep. I woke up around 8am (April 9th) still feeling feverish, with chills and a severe headache. I have no appetite and no energy to get out of bed as of right now (11:00am).

                                                About 3 hours after vaccination, intense headache began. My head felt like it was being pounded with a hammer, and the pain was so intense it traveled down from my forehead to my jaw bone. At around 3:00 pm on April 8, I began to develop a fever which first started at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. By around 5:00 pm, the fever had progressed to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, and the 700mg of Tylenol I had taken was not breaking the fever. I started to get body chills, muscle pain, joint soreness, and cold sweats. Again, Tylenol was not helping. I had no appetite and was having trouble keeping fluids down. Around 11:00 pm on April 8, I took more Tylenol and the fever began to break but did not fully break until 36 hours after the vaccination. It is now April 10 and I am starting to feel like myself again, but for a full 36 hours the pain was so intense that even a light sheet covering my body was painful.

Later that night I had a fever, body aches and I woke up nauseous in the middle of the night. Other than being very tired and sleeping very late the next day all side effects subsided by Sunday March 14th.

                                                My arm swelled up about 30 minutes after the injection near my shoulder. I started feeling pain in my forearm and the facility nurse gave me an ice pack. I stayed an hour after the shot and the nurse said I should be fine, so I went home. Around 10 pm I started having a really bad reaction, worse than normal flu symptoms. A fever of 102 and body chills that lasted for about an hour. Heart rate also consistently stayed above 130 bpm. I drank a lot of water and took an Advil. I then was advised to take a warm shower, and this helped bring my fever to a 99. After the shower, I became really nauseous and started throwing up. I was debating going to the ER. I also drank chicken broth and a lot of water and did not go to sleep until 4 am.  The next two days I had a low fever and bad muscle aches throughout my body, the flu symptoms ended in 4 days.

Patient was breathing but was unresponsive. Pharmacist instructed store manager (also on scene) to call 911, and gently laid the patient on the floor. Within one minute the patient became responsive, and remained on the floor per instructions received from 911 over the phone. Shortly thereafter EMS arrived and assessed the patient. Patient refused to go with EMS for further medical assistance. She agreed to stay in a chair in front of the pharmacy for further observation for 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes lapsed, patient left the store under her own volition.

The following morning, today, I am still experiencing pain in my hips, thighs, and knees, as well as a faint headache every so often.

I started to get very bad body aches and the chills, later on  I developed a headache and I couldn?t move out of bed because I felt so sick. My temp reached 102 at 8:15 even after taking a 500mg tylenol earlier. I had to stay sitting up because I got nauseous when I tried to lay down completely.  I also kept getting very hot then very cold. It?s 4/13 and I?m feeling a bit better but still feel kinda weak and get exhausted easily.

Precautions were taken, masks were worn, safe social distance was maintained and I have no reason to believe any of the symptoms I experienced upon returning home were related to anything other than the vaccine, particularly since first that is how vaccines work and second one of my friends who was vaccinated at the same time as me at the clinic was going through similar pains.  It started as a discomfort in my intestines or possibly just below my stomach in general. I thought my pants were too tight but just in case I let my mom take over driving the rest of the way home. When I got to the house, I had about an hour of usable time left before I went into a complete state of delirium. We&#39;re not sure how high my fever actually got before my mom woke up and checked in on me at 9:00 PM, but after having pulled the covers away I registered at 102.5° F. I was screaming in a half-awake and half-asleep nightmare, trying to get someone to come help me and unable to get anyone&#39;s attention. I would, as a result, like to insist that it be added to recommendations to not be alone after getting the vaccine! For the whole first night! I believe that I genuinely could have died. My brain was melting for lack of more proper medical terminology, and I stopped being able to understand and speak my own first language in an incredibly confused state. This was entirely a result of two simultaneous factors: Fever and Chills. First, the fever made my skin ache. Wearing any clothing hurt. But once I took off my pants in exchange for some breezy shorts, I was covered in goosebumps and feeling frozen even though it was solidly in the 70s. I claimed under blankets and still couldn&#39;t get warm enough. The backs of my thighs were insanely hot in comparison to the fronts of them, so I just warmed my body under 3 layers of blankets trying to get the chills to go away. I did that for about four hours during which time I was basically constantly screaming incoherently.

                                                Started out with a headache and dizziness within a few minutes of the vaccine, along with nausea. I stayed put laying down with a lollipop and water bottle along with ice packs on me for about an hour until I was well enough they thought for me to drive back to my dorm. Once I started driving the headache was back but I was driving so I couldn?t do much. Almost pulled over because I was getting over whelmed but ended up making it back to my dorm. Once I got back I changed and laid down in bed hoping to fell better. Things started getting worse from there. Throughout the rest of the day my head ache and dizziness got worse to the point where I was pretty unsteady on my feet. Chills and body aches also started and progressed rapidly despite no fever.  My nausea was present in waves but eventually dissipated around 8 PM.  I tried to go to bed around 11 hoping to sleep off the symptoms. I began tossing and turning. My chills were really bad and it got to the point where my skin was so sensitive that the clothes I was wearing touching and rubbing against my skin were hurting me. I was so dizzy and light headed to the point where it didn?t matter if I was laying down or sitting up, I felt the same, extremely dizzy and lightheaded as if cotton were in my brain or as if it were working too slow. It was like trying to process thoughts through molasses. Then around 1:30 I couldn?t take it anymore and thought maybe a quick shower would help me to at least feel better so I could sleep. When I got in the shower I immediately knew things were worse.  My vision started going black at the edges and black spots in the middle to the point where at certain moments I couldn?t see. I was fighting to stay on my feet and conscious and it was hurting to breathe. I knew I needed to get help so I stumbled to my dorm and collapsed when I got in the doorway to my room. My vision was spotty, my chest was hurting and I could barely breathe.  My hands and feet went numb as well, I was shivering, and my body temperature was a little down to about 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit.   I was transported to a hospital via ambulance my vitals were normal except elevated heart rate and O2 and  was admitted at 2:40 in the morning. I received a chest x ray and  my heart rate was better.  The dizziness was under control by then. I was discharged at 4:50 in the morning.

                                                Johnson and johnson covid-19 vaccine eau  March 20th - allergic reaction to covid vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson. Allergic reaction started approximately 2 minutes after receiving shot. It started with itching and redness on my arms and upper chest. After approximately 10 minutes, I knew something was wrong and I signaled an attendant. They immediately brought me over to the EMTs on site, where they looks me over and started drawing up IV Benadryl. In the time it took for them to draw up IV Benadryl and insert the IV, the hives on my chest started to turn into burning and ice sensations intermittently. As soon as they administered the IV Benadryl, the itching redness and hives on my arms went away within a couple minutes, and I was left with only redness on my upper chest. They felt comfortable with me getting a ride to the ER from my dad and not getting emergency transport. At the ER, they gave me pepcid and prednisone. About an hour and a half later, I started developing chest tightness and hives and redness on the side of my face. They decided to administer more Benadryl and start epinephrine. I was discharged a couple hours later.  March 22nd - I went back to the hospital, with complaints of severe stomach pain. The stomach pain lasted approximately 24 hours.  March 20th to march 26th - I experienced extreme fatigue. I was exhausted to the point where on Wednesday I took a ten minute shower and by the end of it I had to lay down again because I was shaking from exhaustion.  Symptoms improved slightly until April 5th where it started taking a turn for the worse.  April 5th - I started noticing black spots in my vision that wouldn&#39;t go away. They didn&#39;t move and they stayed in one spot for hours until I fell asleep and then they&#39;d be gone the next morning. They usually started around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. Sometimes a couple hours earlier. They came every day until Friday April 9th when they did not come.   April 5th to present - I also started noticing light-headedness, motion sickness when I stood still or sat in a chair, nausea, neck pain, and periods of muscle weakness in the neck. These symptoms have not stopped.  Friday April 9th around 6:45 p.m. I started having a bad migraine, I noticed in the bathroom at work my eyes were dilating over and over and over again rapidly. The pain was very high. I ended up leaving work early and going to the emergency room. While at the emergency room they treated my migraine with a cocktail of Benadryl, toradol, and compazine. It reduced the pain at the time, however it did not take away the migraine.  Friday April 9th to present - My migraine has continued from April 9th and is still happening. I have been having severe light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, and trouble reading. The rapid dilation of my eyes stopped April 10th, however my eyes stayed dilated until April 12th.  In addition to all of my other symptoms, there are others that I am not as positive are relevant. I have asthma and it has been worse over the past couple of weeks, it it is not usually worse this time of year. I&#39;ve been also been having quite a bit more light bruising than normal over the past two weeks and over the past one and a half weeks I have noticed red spots all over my skin. I was not sure if these red spots were normal or not because I do have them on occasion however these are darker than normal.

                                                Around 10PM I was on the phone and felt the body aches start. About an hour or so later it started to get pretty painful, my joints. I was trying to go to sleep and I started with chills. I had a heating pad and 2 blankets and was still shivering, I took my temp and it was 102.4F. I took some Tylenol and was able to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night sweating. Next morning I was again with 102.7F fever. I slept most o the day, and when awake I noticed the body aches were still present. Kept taking Tylenol. Next day my left ear started feeling to hurt and it felt like fluid. I decided to go get checked and that is when they told me I had an inner and outer ear infection. After meds were prescribed (oral antibiotics and ear drops) the swelling has been going down a lot and it is not as near as painful.

I was warmer than normal but did not have a full fever. I was extremely fatigued. Most of these symptoms subsided in about 24 hours with acetaminophen. I am still having occasional (every other day) mild headaches and shortness of breath, heaviness in the chest, and a couch that have persisted 5 days so far.

The chills lasted for around 4 hours, and eventually my fever went away with it. I shook so hard my back, and my joints started to ache. I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was having hallucinations from the fever and the pain would wake me up every hour, I also had a headache. The next day my back still hurts, my head still hurts despite medication, the shaking has subsided. Yet I&#39;m sweating, I&#39;m still very weak, I can&#39;t stand up without getting super dizzy or experiencing extreme fatigue. If I think of food I feel as if I&#39;m going to vomit just drinking too much water can make me ill.

                                                Patient briefly slumped over and appeared to pass out shortly after receiving the vaccine.  This only lasted about 30 sec to a minute before she became responsive again.  Patient reported that this has happened multiple times before when she has received vaccines and was anxious (crying) prior to receiving the vaccine.  An initial blood pressure reading was 100/64 at 12:50.   She was then able to sit up in the chair and began feeling a little better, asking for water.  A second reading five minutes later was 94/54.  The patient then chose to drink some water and eat some candy she had brought and this seemed to make her feel better.  Lightheadness/weakness was the only symptom she complained of.  By 1:03, 15 minutes after the vaccine, she reported &#34;feeing much better.&#34;  I continued to observe her, seated, for 15 more minutes and a final blood pressure reading at that time was 115/74.  Patient reported feeling normal again and went home.

At 8:00 chills started, along with a feeling of all my muscles contracting , lost the ability for fine motor control and  fell asleep at 9.pm. Woke up at 12:45am covered in sweat feeling as if I was burning with a splitting heavy headache, had fever, don?t know temperature new house so no thermometer but it sucked. dunked head in sink. Legs could barely support me so I couldn?t go down the stairs for pain medication, went back to bed. Got cold washcloth at 1:00am pain felt pretty unbearable, couldn?t make it downstairs or move at this point so I spent night in and out of sleep unable to move. Muscles still feel like rocks and my head feels like it?s stuffed with a mixture of Vaseline and nitroglycerin, every time I move it feels like my brains smashing into my skull with little explosions. Recent development within the last 5-6 hours maybe?(3:00-4:00pm) centralized over my breast bone feels incredibly painful, hurts to breath and feels like something heavy is pressing it through my chest into my spine. Not sure what to do or if this is normal but it hurts really really bad. Accurate hours because I was lucidly texting my friends to make sure I wouldn?t pass out, so I have nearly exact hours when each symptom appeared till I could no longer use my fingers.

                                                At 6:30PM, I developed a headache and took acetaminophen. It didn?t subside after taking that, and progressively got worse as the night went on. I began feeling chills and feverish before I went to bed. I woke up sweating in the middle of the night multiple times with my headache getting even worse. At 5:30am, I woke up and it was as its worst, with a 101.2° fever, sweating, chills, and an even worse headache that felt like a migraine.  The  headache lasted until the next morning and lingered throughout the entire next day, although not as intense as it was at 5:30pm. I?m still struggling with some on and off fatigue from the vaccine, and my arm is still sore.

Fever, headache and nausea: I woke up an hour later with fever, mild headache and nausea. It lasted about 4 hours. I took 2 pills of tylenol and had a shower. Started feeling better afterwards but I was too tired because I wasn´t able to sleep. I was okay the whole day but too tired. Then, I got a fever and headache again around 6 pm. Fell asleep for around 3 hrs and woke up feeling better.

                                                Several hours after getting the vaccine, my back spasmed out and the pain was continuous and I still have the upper back pain today. That same evening I developed the chills, stomach pain. The next day I began experiencing a fever, headache, nausea, light headedness, dizziness, chills, back pain, lock jaw, some numbness on left side of face, zoning out or spacing out. My period also came two weeks early. I had some throat irritation as well as the feeling of being weak and some neck stiffness. All these symptoms seem to have gone away by Sunday evening, if not Monday morning. Except for the back pain, the nausea, and the throat irritation and some head pain and some numbness in face seem to have persisted.

I started getting goosebumps. That lasted for about 9 hours throughout the night. I also experienced nausea for about 30 minutes at 8:45 pm. I felt like I was going to pass out within that time period too. My head was also hurting throughout the night. My body was aching through the night as well. The only reason I am not sure if I had a fever is because I did not have a thermometer. My arm was sore for 3 days and I was also sweating throughout the first night.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The morning after getting the vaccine I woke up feeling very tired and sore/achey all over. I got to work (I lifeguard at the pool on campus) at around 6:15am and helped get the pool set up. When I sat down to try to do homework I started feeling very dizzy and nauseous. The pool deck is very hot, so I decided to try to go into the pool office where it would be cooler. I remember walking through the door and into the office, and then laying down next to the trash can because I thought I might be sick. One of my coworkers brought me some water and Goldfish, and I layed on the office floor for the rest of my 45 minute shift. Afterwards, when I was looking for my laptop, my other coworker said that when I had tried to go through the door into the pool office I had run into the door (I later got a small lump on my head from this) and that I had dropped my latptop. I do not remember either of these happening, so I believe that I blacked out for a moment, and it was likely hitting my head on the door that woke me up. A small scratch and some mild pain in my foot leads me to believe I dropped the laptop partially, but not completely, on my foot. I felt very tired for the rest of the day, and a little dizzy up until about mid-afternoon. I spent most of the day in bed sleeping. Waking up the next morning I felt completely fine, and was able to go about all of my normal activities with no side effects at all.

I wait a another hour and I still had the chills and started to have terrible body aches. I took my temperature again and it was at 101.3. This stayed the same until the follow day (03/07/2021) My fever finally went down around 2pm. And the body aches stopped around 4pm.

                                                I first noticed that I was extremely cold and could not get warm at about 11 pm on the evening of my vaccine. I then realized it was getting worse, and I was shivering uncontrollably despite sitting in front of a space heater in warm clothing and wrapped in a blanket. I checked for a fever, but my temp was only 99. I fell asleep around 1 am, and woke up at 5 am (3/8/21) to a splitting headache, extreme thirst, slight nasal congestion, muscle soreness, fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms feel almost identical to the symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID-19 in September 2020 at my university.

                                                The night of my vaccine date (6 hours after) I was fatigued and started a fever with chills and acheyness which kept me in bed all night. I got up to shower and get some food as I was going upstairs I grew very faint,  my vision grew black and my hearing faded. I was able to make it to my bed then ask for some help. After taking Tylenol, my fever began to be very hot instead of chills. I was able to fall asleep until I woke back up to chills again and taking more medicine.  The next morning, I was still dizzy when I walked around but the fever was gone. I was still very fatigued which made me unable to go to class or work. Day 3 I was back to my normal self.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA on 03/09/21 at 6:20AM. My arm started to ache maybe 15 minutes after and lasted throughout the whole day. Around 4:30:PM I started to feel more aches and chills. Then, by 7:00PM I had a  fever. My temperature was 100  degrees. By the next day, 03/10/21 my fever and chills were gone, however, I felt very achy all over the body. It was not until the next day, 03/11/21 that I didn&#39;t feel achy anymore.

                                                Originally, I started with random muscle aches in my left shoulder then it went down my back (a few hours after receiving vaccine). Then slightly fogginess and at night the muscle pain became worse making it difficult to sleep and started getting cold flashes. Once asleep around 12:30 I started getting muscle aches that felt like they were burning and in random spots on body along with a headache and would get random cold and heat flashes. Kept yelling out in pain all night and increased tremors in hands. Boyfriend noticed I had a fever as well and gave me ibuprofen around 3am since pain was unbearable and was difficult to sleep. Almost took me to the hospital due to the intense pain.. In morning slightly better but still frontal lobe pain and aches throughout body with raised heart rate. Cannot do much or else aches get worse including headache.

It progressed to the point where I needed assistance walking.  I had extreme chills with uncontrollable shivering and muscle spasms.  I felt very cold though I was burning up and sweating profusely.  I went to sleep and woke up a few hours later with no fever but very sore muscles.  When I woke up in the morning, I felt like nothing had happened, I was just a bit groggy.

Also I got inflammation in the injection area which is red, inflamed and causes a lot of pain as much as the movement of the arm as the touch of the area. It&#39;s like a &#34;bump&#34;. This effect originated since the same day that vaccine was applied to me and even 6 days later I still have this symptom or adverse event in my left arm which is where I received the &#34;shot.&#34;

We applied cold clothes to the neck and head and patient felt like she was going to vomit so we also gave her a bag just in case she got sick. She started looking very pale so we layed patient on floor. She started to panic that she wasn&#39;t going to go to work and eyes were rolling in the back of head. Called 911 for patient and I stayed with patient, I took her blood pressure which was normal. Patient became fully alert again and stated she was feeling a little better. The ems checked her blood pressure and blood sugar and released the patient.

                                                My daughter got the shot at 1 pm on the 8th of April, 2021. (My daughter &amp; I both got the shot at the same shot at the same time). By 11:00 pm my daughter started complaining with feeling dizzy. She kept saying she felt like she was going to throw up, meaning she was nauseated. She was complaining with her bones hurting. We both got these symptoms at the same time. We both stayed in and out of the shower letting the shower water just run on us. I had to give her ibuprofen because she complained of a mild headache &amp; the pain all over her body. She couldn?t sleep at all. She cried. It had her scared. I fully believe she?s having an allergic reaction to the Janssen shot. I have fully read the Janssen ?fact sheet?. My daughter was having hot flashes &amp; cold sweats. She has ongoing symptoms &amp; it?s been 2 days since receiving shot including fever. She was having what I thought heart palpitations. We both swelled up causing our bodies to feel tight. We both were healthy before receiving the shot. We?ve never had covid nor tested positive. We are currently going to receive a check up by a doctor. The side effects of this medication is dangerous &amp; doesn?t compare to flu like symptoms.

                                                The night I got my shot, my entire body was freezing and I couldn?t sleep at all because my entire body was in so much discomfort and pain, especially near my rib cage area in the front and back. The following day was the exact same, except my front rib cage didn?t hurt anymore (only the back). I was extremely fatigued and I couldn?t sit down because my body hurt so much. The worst symptoms were the sharp ear and neck pain (by the ears). It was a sharp, sporadic pain, but it still hurts a lot.  It?s now been 2 days since the shot and the neck and ear pain is now more frequent, though my fever and some of my muscle sores are now getting better. I also feel extremely nauseous, like I?m going to puke anytime soon.

When I stand up my vision goes black, and I develop joint pain, muscle aches, and very bad nausea.  9:00pm - I take 500mg of aspirin and all of my syptoms persist for ~30 minutes when suddenly my fever breaks and I&#39;m sweating underneath my 3 blankets and I can think again as long as I don&#39;t move my head. Everything still sounds weird and my stomach and joints still hurt but I go to sleep. 4:00am- wake up crying from the headache and with a fever again so I take 500 more mg of aspirin and set an alarm to take more at 10am.  10:00am- I feel exhausted and really weird, I take only 250mg of aspirin and sleep the whole day.  4:00pm - I wake up feeling so much better. Kind of achy and still very nauseous, my ears still ring when I stand up.   4:00pm yesterday - now: I kept movement at a minimum and was still nauseous throughout the day but was able to eat at around 9pm. I think I may have had a low grade fever on and off last night but the headache has thankfully stayed away and other than a little bit of arm soreness and weakness I feel back to normal today.

                                                Around 6pm I started having normal mild reactions to the covid vaccine. Around 10pm I lost feeling in both arms and my lower legs, but otherwise was still able to move without pain. At about 10:30, the loss of feeling turned into partial paralysis and extreme pain where feeling had been previously lost. My hands refused to stay in any position except for a clenched fist or fingers completely extended. Moving my arms and lower legs was only able to be done with great difficulty. I was worried that it would spread to my chest, so I got up from where I&#39;d been sitting at a desk and began forcing myself to walk up and down my apartment hallway. I was able to do this though my gait was stuttery and uneven, and my pain was about an 8 out of 10. I was alone in my apartment at the time and my hands weren&#39;t working well enough to handle my phone. After about 10 or 15 minutes the nerve pain and paralysis subsided and hasn&#39;t come back since, but my leg muscles felt incredibly weak the rest of the night and my partner had to help me to make sure I didn&#39;t fall over a couple of times. I didn&#39;t end up going to the doctor or seeking treatment because it didn&#39;t come back.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine on April 9th, I started feeling ill. I had a fever of 102, difficulty walking/moving on my own, intense nausea, numbness in my left arm for about 2 minutes, and I spontaneously got my period (which was very regular up until then). I took Tylenol, went to bed, woke up with a 100 degree fever but feeling much better, and it soon dropped back to 98 degrees.  Today, on April 13th, I started having pain in my left arm and leg. Specifically, in my left bicep (not the injection site) and my left thigh. This pain does not feel like muscle soreness, but almost like a knot? I&#39;m not sure how to describe it, but I find it odd the pain in my arm increases a bit when I walk/move.

                                                I woke up at 1am feeling fatigued. At 3am it hit my like a truck. My body was so weak I could barley move. I had an unbearable headache. I felt very nauseous.  I had extreme chills and sweats.  This lasted non-stop  until 6am.  I woke up around 10am  with a bad headache and like my body had been through something traumatic.  I felt even more nauseous and had very bad diarrhea . Anything I would consume would make my stomach go into a knot and come straight out. After 10am I felt dizzy and weak. I still had a bad beach ache; and medicine wasn?t doing anything.  This lasted until I went to bed around 11pm that next night.  When I woke up around 9am on Friday I still felt a little drained and a small headache. My stomach was the worst part after my episode on Wednesday night. Around 5pm medicine started to help with my headache so I would say my symptoms stopped about that time , not including my abdominal pain. My stomach pain lasted until Saturday evening.

She was getting her COVID-19 shot today (Johnson Johnson).  After her shot she was texting on the phone with her mom, felt slightly dizzy and the next thing she remembers was lying on the ground.  Witnesses reported that she syncopized and had some convulsive like behavior afterwards.  She was not postictal or incontinent however.  She reportedly hit the front of her forehead on the left side.  She denies any chest pain, abdominal pain, hemoptysis, recent surgeries, immobilization or recent travel.  She reports that when she woke up her hands felt a little bit tingly.  When the fire department arrived they found her to be bradycardic however by the time the medics arrived her heart rate had resolved.  Her blood sugar was 110 on the scene.  Medics noted that she was orthostatic on the scene as well.   She currently is feeling well, has no complaints.  States that she has gotten dizzy before in the past with COVID vaccines.

                                                About 7 hours after receiving the vaccine I developed a painful migraine. The pain was very intense behind my left eye like there was a needle being poked in from behind.  Some nights the pain is so bad it hurts to lay my head on a pillow or I wake up all through the night because of it. I took tylenol the first 4 days then stopped. I tried to see an urgent care about it but they told me they couldn?t help me due to the vaccine type.

The daughter has no history of anxiety, no breathing issues.   They did labs and everything was okay, her counts were somewhat off but nothing felt to be abnormal.      She then went to another Hospital as she was still not feeling well, and checked the other reports from the other hospital and they conferred with that information, gave her Valium and sent her home.

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

Trouble sleeping the rest of the night with hot flashes. Migraine at about 7am, took migraine medicine, went away around 10am. Since then, major body aches and feeling out of it. Feeling better April 5th with only arm soreness.

Client asked to take deep breaths and slow breathing, which client was able to do. Client said she was still feeling hot so client was given another ice pack. Client felt cold after some time so both ice packs removed. PHN asked another PHN to come assess client and Dr. called in to assess client also. Client was throwing up for the third time, and Dr. suggested we call 911 to get her checked out. EMS called at 1808 by other PHN.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. About 1am I woke up short of breath. I sat up in bed to catch my breath and immediately felt nauseous. I went to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up but only ended up dry heaving. After sitting for a minute to catch my breath again I started shaking really bad and couldn&#39;t stand up without having blacked out vision. Luckily I grabbed my phone when I went to the bathroom so my mom could come home to help me. Until about 5 am I was shaking going between being extremely hot and extremely cold. After that my body SEVERE:Y ached all day with off and on sweats and headaches. I took Tylenol all day. I started feeling better with just some fatigue around 6pm.

                                                At about 5 hours after receiving the vaccine at around 5 p.m., I developed a pounding headache. As the night continued, if I moved my head at all it would cause severe pain and a pounding headache. Additionally, I experienced shooting pains through my neck and back, I became extremely hot to the touch, yet I felt freezing cold and could not stop shivering. Then I developed severe aching and tingling from the top of my head to the tips of my toes, with excruciating lower back pain and I could feel my heart beating very fast. My entire body was tense and sore. These symptoms did not alleviate for 12 hours and I could not fall asleep due to the discomfort I was in. I finally was able to fall asleep at 6 a.m. after the aching/tingling/pain/hotness subsided (about 12 hours after side effects started).

                                                I got the vaccine Tuesday evening and felt fine until Wednesday morning when I got a migraine and a fever. Thursday I felt mostly fine just some tiredness and a little weakness. Friday evening I started to feel light headed and then by Friday night I felt a lump in my throat and my neck felt like it was burning. The burning continued into Saturday. I went to the pharmacist and he told me to take some Tylenol and an antihistamine. That helped a lot with the burning feeling. Sunday I felt very weak all day and felt more of a slight tightness in my throat. Monday the weakness and tightness in the throat continued just not as extreme.

                                                Woke up 12 hours after vaccine shivering uncontrollably. Got several blankets and dozed back off to wake up a couple hours later dripping in sweat. My body ached the day after the shot and then the evening after is when my symptoms became more severe. I was extremely tired and my entire body hurt. It hurt to even touch my hair, lay in bed, stand, and be covered up by blankets. The following day I just felt tired and my arm was sore. Three days after my vaccine I woke up with a sore throat and neck, but just on the left side. I slept the majority of the day and my body felt achy all day. Four days after my vaccine I woke up again shivering uncontrollably and my body felt sore all over.

                                                7 hours after the vaccine at 8pm, I had extreme chills, a fever started at 99 degrees, and my body started to hurt. At 11pm, my chills were so bad I was wearing a coat and stocking cap in my house under blankets, I was physically shaking, and my teeth were chattering. My fever was 100 degrees and my body aches were bad. From midnight until around 6 am, I was not able to sleep at all because I was so uncomfortable. My body went from having the chills to being extremely hot and couldn&#39;t cool down, my fever fluctuated between 101-102 degrees, and the muscle aches and headaches were the worst. My lower back and hip specifically hurt extremely bad to the point where I had to get up and try to walk around in hopes of making it feel better. My headache was horrible and it felt like my brain was filled with fluid and pressure. I cried on and off all night. At 2 am and again at 4 am my brain started to hallucinate and I was seeing things and having delusional thoughts. If I could have driven myself, I would have taken myself to the ER at this point but I knew in my condition I could not drive.  At 6 am, my symptoms started getting a little bit better. I was not completely back to normal until about 36 hours after receiving the vaccine, but the first 12 hours were the worst.

At this point I took 400 mg of over the counter ibuprofen which helped drop my temperature slightly to approximately 102.2 F.  This fever continued into the night. I took another dose of ibuprofen before sleeping, about 6 hours after the first dose. Along with fever I experienced strong shaking/chills, muscle and joint soreness, headache, dizziness, confusion, and chest pain/feeling of pressure on the chest. The day after vaccination I continued to have a low-grade fever of approximately 100 F which subsided by evening. All other symptoms subsided as well except for the chest pain. On the second day post-vaccination my only remaining symptom is the chest pain.

                                                Around 2:30pm on 4/9/21 (one day after vaccination) I got a Charlie horse in my right calf. I didn?t think much of it. About 20 minutes later when trying to get out of bed I got another Charlie horse in my left calf this time. This one was much more painful and intense. After it let up I laid there for a little longer and tried to get up when my leg calf, again, got another Charlie horse in the same place. This happened a total of 4 times, back to back to back to back. Each Charlie horse I had in my left calf was especially intense and painful, worse than any Charlie horse I?d ever had before. I don?t get Charlie horses often, but I have been a lifetime athlete so I?m familiar with the feeling. I had not previously worked out in the days leading up to my vaccine. I?m not even sure this is an adverse effect of the vaccine, I just didn?t know if anyone had had a similar reaction and have been made aware that blood clots have also been a concern with the J&amp;J vaccine.  I?m also unsure if my Zoloft, which has a warning that it may cause dizziness, may have reacted with the vaccine to make me incredibly dizzy. But around 04:00am on 4/9/21 (I work night shift) I became increasingly dizzy making it difficult to perform the tasks at hand. Enough so that I had to sit down and even reading words off a computer screen made me dizzy. I couldn?t drive home from work at 07:30am that morning because I was concerned with my dizziness. It had subsided by the time I woke up at 02:00pm later that day.

                                                I received the shot at 14:30, in which medical staff in the jail&#39;s medical center watched me for 20 minutes to ensure there were no immediate reactions. I went about my day afterward with no symptoms. At 21:30 when I went to sleep, I got some aches in my joints and took 1 dose of liquid capsule NyQuil to help with the pain and went to sleep. At 00:30, the 7th, I woke up groaning in my sleep to the extreme pain in my joints and feeling hot internally. I decided to get up and take a warm bath to ease the aches. I went and ran the bath and all of a sudden while it was running, I had a severe need to throw up, but could not naturally. Since this was concerning, I got up and walked out of the bathroom and all of a sudden in the hall I got a feeling of impending doom and that something was not right and I fainted. I laid on the floor for what I would approximate to be 5 minutes going in and out of consciousness waiting for the blood to fully return to the brain. After this, I instantly felt like I needed to survive and that I felt like I could be dying so I slowly crawled down the stairs to get to my military ID so I could call the military&#39;s nurse advice line. I had to take a break and lay on the concrete in my garage because I felt so dizzy and so hot and began to feel my vision disappear like I was going to faint again. I waited a few minutes before getting back up the stairs crawling to my phone to call. When I called them 00:58, they told me to call 911 because they believed I would be having a severe reaction, though I noted to them I did not have a rash or hives. I then called 911 at 01:08. They sent EMT&#39;s to my home which took my vitals. I had normal blood pressure, SPo2, and temp, but an elevated heart rate of just under 100 and a high respiration rate. EMT&#39;s made the decision for me to stay home since the hospital did not seem immediate in their opinion. After this I stayed on the couch for a few minutes and then felt very tired so I walked slowly to my room and fell asleep. I woke up at 06:00 for work, and arrived at 07:00. In the hour after waking up I was achy, sweating, and felt light headed. I got to work and my Sergeant told me to go home and sleep. I slept another 5 hours at 08:00 and when I woke up most of my symptoms went away other than aches and getting flush very easily for 5 days.  At this current time all I notice is some random light headedness that quickly resolves and comes a few times a day at random and without cause.

I have had no headache, vision issues, shortness of breath or swelling within my limbs.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation for 15 minutes after her vaccine.  Within a minute or so  patient felt light headed and like she might pass out. She notified the technician who was right there and he notified me.  I assisted her to a sitting position on the floor from her chair and I was able to ease her back to a lying down position from there with her head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient was able to talk the whole time.  She told us at that point when she was younger she was scared of shots and had fainted when having them, but thought she was past that and did not mention it during screening. She said she was surprised to feel this way because she was so excited about getting her COVID vaccine.  She had not eaten much today (a small snack) and had rushed here for her appointment without getting food. I checked her blood pressure while she was lying down and it was 94/63 and pulse of 75.  She said she normally had lower end of normal blood pressure.   She was pale when I started checking her, but her color began to return to normal within minutes. After 5 minutes she felt well enough to sit up and we got her a granola bar and water.  She remained this way for 5 minutes and felt good, so we moved her to sitting in a chair and got her a pepperoni and cheese snack tray from the cafe.  She ate this and waited for 10minutes and felt good. We walked her to her car and she felt fine.  I called to verify she got home fine and she did.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. I had the vaccine at around 4:00 pm and felt fine until I woke up around 12:30 am. I had severe chills and shakes, body aches, and a headache. It eventually turned into sweating. Around 8:30am, it&#39;s not as severe. I took tylenol around 8:30 am and do not feel like I have the chills anymore, just body aches and some fatigue.

                                                Started experiencing mild fatigue and body aches ~5 hours after getting the shot. Over the course of the day these symptoms started increasing and I developed chills and a fever around 100F at about 7 hours. Took an ibuprofen when symptoms persisted and fever kept rising.  Fever rose to over 101F while sleeping and woke me up once the ibuprofen ran its course. Did some wet towel compresses but did not help. Took another ibuprofen.   Muscle aches and chills persisted into the next day. Developed another mild fever in the second day. Symptoms resolved on day 3. Soreness in arm where the vaccine was administered persists.

                                                After about 6 hours of receiving the shot, I woke up with uncontrollable chills, and hot flashes in between, where my chest, back and face felt hot but hands and feet were ice cold. I had a fever of 99.9 and had a headache across the front of the face and nauesa. All of this lasted together for about 6 to 7 hours. During this time I took Tyenol, used cold compress, wrapped up in blankets and sipped on water. After the chills and hot flashes subsided I continued to feel fatigue,and had  head and body aches for the next 18-24 hours. During this time I continued with Tyenol and fluids. In all it last about 36 hours before I felt like myself again.

Shortly felt a burning feeling in my chest and  collar bones, that spread to my head. My head started to burn, it felt like it was on fire, along with my neck and chest. I felt dizzy, like i was going to faint, the burning and dizziness lasted for about 5 minutes. Shortly after i felt like my throat closed up and I was having very labored breaths. The burning feeling in my body and dizziness came back, along with not feeling like i could breathe well. I went to an ER, they gave me an IV with Benadryl, and I started to feel well enough 2 hours later to go home.

Continued to vomit all day probably because of the fever.  Gave liquids only. By 9:00 pm fever fluctuating 99 to normal.  Hopefully by 4/2 all symptoms will have passed.  I did not take her to the doctor for this although when the symptoms started I was very concerned because she does not speak and I didn?t know if she was having chest pains.

The patient was told to put ice pack on the arm.  The arm seemed to be experiencing localized injection site reaction.  She was informed to take acetominophen when arriving at home and ibuprofen later to help with pain and inflammation

                                                I passed out in my bathroom the morning after the vaccine shot around 5:30am. I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                At approximately 0945 this nurse witnessed patient sitting in the observation area with her head tilted to the left side and her body leaning to the left. The medical assistant was with her holding her body up. Her eyes were closed and she had no color to her face and lips. She was not able to respond to questions being asked. As her head was shaking she was making grunting noises. She was diaphoretic and tremulous. This episode lasted for approximately 60 seconds. Pt then opened her eyes and was able to respond to questions asked but with a delayed response. Pt was moved to the stretcher to lay down. Her color came back to her lips and her blood pressure improved. She was responding to questions appropriately. Pt was diaphoretic for approximately 10 minutes. Ice packs and water were provided. Pt was observed by the medical assistant for 30 minutes. Her HOB was elevated gradually until she was able to dangle her feet and sit on the side of the stretcher.  Pt stated that she was feeling better and was ready to go be with her roommate.    Vital signs were taken and BP 91/54, HR 70, O2 97%.  At 0952 HR was 62. 1005 BP 102/67, HR 57 O2 99%.

                                                At around 9:15 PM I started to feel nauseous and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I felt a very strong chill come over my whole body and started shivering and got directly back into bed and wrapped myself up in a thick blanket. For 45 minutes I laid wrapped up and was shivering constantly. At 10 pm I was brought extra blankets and a heating pad but moving to get situated caused dizziness. It was about 10:30 when the shivering stopped. I was able to sleep but got up to go got the bathroom around midnight and my entire body was drained of energy and I felt that I could barely stand and walk on my own. I was dizzy and my head hurt as well. I could barely hold my arms up to look at my phone briefly. Between 11 PM and 2 AM I had 5 or 6 high heart rate alerts (over 120) according to my Apple Watch but I did not wake up to them. In the morning (Sunday 4/4/21) around 9-10 am my head still hurt and my body was very achy and I felt very hungover. All day I continued to feel achy almost with a bad cold or a minor flu. Today has been better but I have still felt pretty drained. I?ve had continuous arm soreness in the arm I got the injection - but nothing too severe.   15 minutes after my vaccine on Saturday 4/3/21 I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and around midnight of that night I took 2 of pain relief PM acetaminophen (1000 mg of acetaminophen total snd 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCI total)

Then I started feeling cold chills, and had to lie down in bed for the rest of the day.  Slight fever also occured and intense body aches.

Took some ibuprofen, at 7:11am I still have a severe headache being treated by otc pain reliever. About 2:30am I woke up from my headache and realized I was freezing cold, dispute it being 74 degrees in my house. I did not have a fever but I had extreme chills, my entire body shivering and shaking at some points. This made it hard to stand or even get some water. These lasted about 2 hours or so. Once I was able to get warm again, under several blankets and a heated blanket they did go away and  I did not experience them again.

                                                I started experiencing side effects about 6 hours after receiving the vaccine. I experienced chills, sweating, 99.5 fever, headache, head pounding, dizziness, nausea,  tiredness, sore body, sore left arm, and had trouble sleeping. I took two Motrin pills and felt a little better and was able to sleep. In the morning, I woke up tired, sweating, had a sore left arm and sore body so I took two more Motrin pills and am feeling mostly better. Fever, headache, head pounding, dizziness, and nausea are gone.

I went to bed around 9 pm, and at around 3 am the next morning (04/06/2021), I woke up with severe chills, body aches, a pressure headache, and some mild nausea (I believe caused by the headache) that lasted through until early afternoon. Taking ibuprofen seemed to help the body and headaches, but it seemed like it was difficult to regulate my body temperature. I couldn&#39;t tell if I was too hot or too cold, and trying to remedy one or the other made me either too cold or too hot, respectively. All effects completely cleared up by 04/07/2021.

                                                At around 10:30 AM on 3/29/2021, I began to notice some irritation and phlegm build up in my throat, as well as some tingling and numbness in my face. This lasted for approximately 30 minutes before subsiding. At around 8:00 PM on 3/29/2021, I began developing a fever and somewhat severe body aches that lasted until the morning of 3/31/2021. I also developed a somewhat severe headache on the morning of 3/31/2021 that lasted through 4/1/2021. The injection site was tender to the touch from the evening of 3/29/2021 until 4/2/2021, and my arm was also very sore during this same time frame. I also noticed unusual exhaustion from the evening of 3/29/2021 until 4/5/2021. During 3/29/2021-4/1/2021, I was taking Tylenol Extra Strength (1 pill every 6 hours or so) to help alleviate symptoms, but it only helped for about 3 hours in the 6 hour interval.

                                                Got the shot at 9:20am on Saturday (April 10th). By the time I sat down to do the 15min waiting period before I could leave. My arm from the back of my shoulder all the way down to around my thumb joint in my hand ached so bad. By around 3pm on the same day, I started to feel really tired and had a pounding migraine. By 4:30p I started to get really cold and everything started to ache. By 6p I was feeling hot but at the same time cold and shivering. My head was pounding. Every muscle ached all over my body, and by every muscle I mean even my eye muscles and pelvic floor muscles. My face had so much sinus pressure that it felt like it could explode. My skin, all over my body, was so sensitive that it hurt to the touch. On top of my skin being sensitive to the touch, off and on my skin would tingle, including the inside of my mouth and tongue. My lymph nodes were swollen enough in my neck that my throat ached.  I was mentally confused and shaking. Everything got bad enough I started crying and hyperventilating. I felt sick to my stomach and felt digestive pain. My entire body felt so heavy. By the time it got to around 8p, my mom finally took my temperature, which at that point I had already been taking Tylenol all day and was no longer shivering, and I had a temperature of 101 degrees F. I finally went to bed around 9p. I was thirsty but my stomach felt sick. I still ached and woke up around 10 times throughout the night either feeling too hot or cold or hurting so bad. At 4am I took a Tylenol because it everything hurt bad enough to able to fall asleep. The next day. I mostly better. I was still tired and a little achy and my lymph nodes under my arm pits were swollen. At this point my lungs felt strange. Harder to breathe than normal.  I was starting to cough. The day after that (today) I have felt fairly normal except I?m coughing and my lungs still feel a little strained. No more aches or fever or anything like that though.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I had no side effects. The following morning, my arm hurt and I felt a bit tired, but other than that normal. About 27 hours after I received the vaccine, I had severe stomach pain. I ended up vomiting and having diarrhea at the same time, for an hour. Immediately following this, I was very feverish, and I got the chills horribly for about an hour. I was very tired for the next 48 hours, but Tylenol alleviated the fever and headache.

During the night, fever spiked to 103 degrees, had uncontrollable shakes, chills, cold sweats, dizziness, and mild nausea. This lasted roughly 48 hours. After 48 hours, fever was reduced, body aches remained, but other symptoms subsided. I continue to feel generally unwell with body aches and a slight fever. In retrospect, I should have gone to the hospital.

Sometimes in knees, mostly in calves... continued until midway through the night) - fatigue (felt just a little more tired than normal, really tired by bed time: 9pm) - heightened heart rate (excitement from vaccine / apprehension for potential illness?) Second day - Thursday:  - fatigue (tired all day, almost fell asleep through a couple meetings) - leg pain (reappeared in the morning, ached and throbbed. Made it difficult to relax. Was gone around 3/4pm) - headache (probably from dehydration, I was warm, but not completely a fever. Attempted to drink a lot of water, but too much made me nauseous)  - chills (sporadic, barely noticeable except it agitated the headache) - nausea (I barely ate more than a granola bar and attempted to drink water and tea, but too much made me sick, especially if it had sugar - mainly drank water. Had some soup later in the day (6pm) and most of the nausea went away)

                                                I was running on the treadmill and all of the sudden my feet started tingling. I got off the treadmill to try to massage my feet. Then, I felt nauseous and vomited. After vomiting I could not move and I had very hard time walking. I noticed that my face had swollen, my throat was closing, and my vision was blurry. I also broke out in hives. Once I could get mobile (about two hours after the adverse reaction started) I took a Benadryl and that helped ease the swelling.

                                                Prior to administration of Janssen Covid-19 vaccine the patient was anxious but was completely fine once the procedure commenced and concluded. After finishing explaining the possible side effects of the vaccine and handing the patient the V-Safe handout, she got up slowly and proceeded to our designated post vaccination monitoring seating arrangement. Upon concluding the vaccination process with the patient?s partner, she alerted the pharmacist that she does not feel well. To which he asked her to further elaborate on what she is experiencing. She began to say she thinks she?s going to faint as she is attempting to drink water. As she was having a drink of water she fainted. To which he responded by running over and catching her before she hit the ground, cradling her upper torso, specifically the head and laid her down on the floor with the assistance of pharmacist and her partner. In the midst of everything he instructed another pharmacy technician to call 911 for the paramedics. As she was in the process of drinking water I saw her other hand go to the region of the neck, thinking it was also an allergic reaction and administered a dose of Epi-Pen. He administered the Epi-Pen on the upper side of her thigh, directly to the skin not through clothing. There was a very brief moment where the patient began to convulse but gradually regain consciousness. The patient became lucid and was conversing with him, apologizing for the incident. He assured her there was nothing to apologize for and to which she told me she had similar incidents from vaccinations as a child. She did not mention this prior to administration of the vaccine and through conversation we believe the incident may be caused from high anxiety of needles / vaccinations. When the paramedics arrived, they assisted the patient from the floor and gave a warning that she believed she was going to faint again, and fainted in the arms of the paramedics.

                                                The day following the vaccine (Wednesday 4/7/21), I woke up with body aches, a strong headache, feeling quite warm (no fever throughout the day, but I felt quite warm), and felt a lot of fatigue. There were no respiratory symptoms, but many of the body symptoms that I typically associate with a regular cold. I slept for much of the day Wednesday as the course of treatment - no medications were taken.  The symptoms persisted all day, and were essentially gone when I woke up the next day (Thursday 4/8/21).  I had varying levels of pain in my arm, where I received the shot. There was more pain than expected when the needle went into my arm, then all pain subsided by the time I went to sleep on the day the shot was received. The day of the cold-like symptoms there was significant pain at the injection site that persisted through Thursday. All pain resolved by Friday.

I was to week to move for hours and when I finaly could get up and move around I was unable to even open my contact case to take them out because I was to week. The pain continued until noon when it lessened some with tons of advil I was able to move around slowly but pain persisted throughout the day and into the next 2 days. I finaly woke up pain free 4 days after getting the vaccine.

Passed out, unconscious within 5 minutes of receiving the shot. Could not sit up/dizzy for 30 minutes. Nausea, weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity/memory. Later that night, and through the night for 10 hours, severe back pain. Nausea, severe weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity and memory, sweats and chills.  The next day (day immediately after receiving vaccine) symptoms continued but lessened by 5 pm. Each day since then, the symptoms have ALL remained in a more mild form. Today is day 6 and I still have moderate back pain and occasional sweats, weakness and fatigue.

                                                Night of vaccine: sore arm, severe headache, dizziness, low grade fever (99), chills. Recovered the following afternoon. One week after vaccine developed tingling in left leg, two weeks after vaccine developed mild numbness/loss of sensation on left side. Went to urgent care and then to ER, they suspected complex migraine as I have a history of migraine (though had never had one lasting that long). Numbness has been intermittent since but seems to have mostly gone away.

                                                The night I got the vaccine 3/10 my arm was sore just like any other vaccine I?ve received. Two days later, I woke up and noticed a welt on my arm that was about two inches in diameter. It was itchy and painful. I could not lift my arms up. By noon it had doubled, and the slightest touch was unbearable. The ?Covid arm? was also hot in temperature. That night, it was at its worst at 5 inches in diameter and it was even more swollen. It stayed that way for three more days before it started to go down. A week after my vaccine a bruise developed where the welt was. Two weeks after my vaccination it was still bruised and swollen. It felt like a tide pod when I touched it. My mom encouraged me to go to urgent care. So on 3/26/21, I went to urgent care and was told it was a cyst. My arm is currently still squishy at the welt and bruised. I have an appointment on 4/19 at my dermatologist for further care.

Over about a half hour, they escalated to severe chills and a 101.9 degree fever that lasted through the night. Chills subsided about 3am, but fever remained until following morning and slowly lowered until about noon the  day after vaccination. That day, arm soreness increased, with sharp pain when arms raised or pressure applied, and soreness continued until  five days after vaccination.

She had her last regular seizure in January so she stated she was not due to have a seizure anytime soon based on her previous medical history. Her father was present and able to keep her safe during seizure so no medical treatment was received.

Today, April 21st, I am still a little fatigued, little soar throat, but runny/stuff nose still, and body soreness/aches.

                                                Mild headache and mild leg pain started on 4/12/2021 at around 23:00. Leg pain can best be described as cramping, shooting pain in the back of the calf and thigh, at times radiating through the rest of the leg. Headache was a dull throbbing on right side of the head. Pain increased to moderate in both areas in the following days. Headache and Leg pain persisted through 4/23/2021. The leg pain continued to be sharp/shooting/cramping, but the headache transformed from a dull throbbing on the side of the head to a moderate sharp, burning feeling in the temples. This was also accompanied by a burning feeling in the nasal cavity and a &#34;pins and needles&#34;/heaviness feeling around the ears. Pain was not severe enough to be debilitating but required frequent pain medication to manage. The headache and leg pain appear to have ceased as of 4/24/2021.

Pharmacy staff responded with cold compress, water, and advised to lower head if feeling faint. Patient appeared sweating and pale but shortly after drinking water and removing clothing she quickly improved. It is my opinion the patient was anxious and over heated.

                                                Since 6 hours after the j&amp;j vaccine, I have had a low grade headache every day that turns into a full blown headache/migraine every couple days. It feels like a constant pressure/squeezing in my head and I can feel my heart beat in my head at all times. It feels worse sitting/sitting up and better lying down on my side. When I get up in the morning it is a bit better and gradually gets worse as the day goes on. I have tried taking allergy/sinus medicine in case it was related to allergies (which i have never had) or a sinus infection but that doesn?t seem to work. I have also tried Maxalt when the headache turns bad but that doesn?t seem to work much, if at all. The only thing that seems to work is advil however I can?t take that forever since it could lead to stomach issues, etc. I am good at hydrating so that is not the issue and I eat and exercise regularly. Nothing has changed in my health/health routine since receiving the vaccine.

                                                I woke up noticing a slight headache, but I figured it was from poor sleep the night prior. I noticed after breakfast that I felt really cold and felt an internal shiver, especially in my chest. My fingers and toes were ice cold even with a sweater, blanket, and a warm tea. I noticed my skin starting to feel tender and I felt very fatigued. I wanted knew I needed to eat so that I could take ibuprofen, but I experienced a loss of appetite. I had a mild cough, but I felt too tired to even cough. I rocked in a chair in the sunlight outside for about 15 minutes and still felt cold. When I took my oral temperature after coming inside, I was reading 99.9. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen by 1130 and layed down to rest. Bundled in 3 layers, I felt the shivering couldn&#39;t stop. My headache got worse and my skin was tender to the touch. I was able to sleep for approximately 3 hours and I woke up drenched in sweat. I took my oral temperature again and was at 101.1. I drank some more water and tried to sleep some more. When I woke up around 4:30 pm, I felt a lot better. My temperature went down to 97.8 and I had a boost in energy and appetite. I no longer had a headache and I had only mild muscle aches. By the next morning, I felt completely normal again.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  About 8.5-9hrs after receiving the vaccine, I started getting body aches in my legs and hips. I started getting really cold, took my temperature and it was at 100.1. Got a headache, slightly nauseous, body aches got a lot worse (particularly my lower back). I was also feeling a little dizzy and having a hard time comprehending information; this was probably the fever. Around 8pm,  I took my temperature again and it had risen to 102. I took some extra strength Tylenol which started helping about 30 minutes later. I woke up 3/12/2021 still with some body aches, slight headache, and slight stomachache.

She began to feel faint and an employee of our facility caught her as she experienced a near syncopal episode. She was promptly placed in Trendelenburg position and vitals obtained. BP was 90/58 with mild tachycardia to max of 130-140 bpm. Patient was given supportive treatment and monitored. BP improved to 110/70 after 5 minutes and 120/72 after 15 minutes. Patient continued to feel very dizzy and weak, however, and became tachycardic and diaphoretic each time she attempted to move to a seated position. After 1 hour of monitoring and vitals showing continued tachycardia, decision was made to transport the patient to ER for further testing. Patient expressed agreement and understanding of plan to transport to ER via ambulance.

                                                Slight nausea, body aches, and headache about 6 hours after shot. Nausea subsided after about half an hour. Headache and body aches lasted for about 24 hours, acetaminophen was taken every 4 hours to help  reduce headache and body aches, which temporarily gave relief (less relief than a typical headache). Sore arm lasting multiple days.

The day after the shot I had a constant headache, full body soreness, a fever, nausea, loss of appetite, and chills. 2 days after the shot I have developed a cough, have full body soreness, a headache, and nausea. I am colder but have not experienced the chills anymore. I have also experienced strained vision due to the severe headaches.

Acetaminophen was taken after first symptoms appeared and approximately every 6-8 hours until symptoms passed.  Arm soreness lasted several days after vaccination.  On 03/20/2021: felt 2 large swollen (probably) lymph nodes above collarbone on left side. Lymph nodes are visibly raised under the skin. The one closer to the left arm is larger than the one next to it which is closer to the neck. They are barely sore, if at all. Lymph nodes are still swollen at the time of this writing.

                                                The injection itself was quite painful (and I&#39;ve had many vaccine shots in my life). Felt completely fine until around 4pm when I felt a dull headache. Around 5pm, my head was throbbing so much that I couldn&#39;t leave my bed. Around 6pm, I felt muscle pains starting around my neck, slowly moving to my shoulders, chest, and upper back. Without taking any medication, I slept and woke up around 8pm. I was sweating, felt so cold but hot at the same time. The muscle pains were intense, and my head hurt so much that I took a single capsule of 200mg Advil. The pain became more manageable around 30 minutes later. Was still sweating, and muscle aches continued. I slept again at around 2am (May 26, 2021) and woke up at 10am. Head was no longer hurting, but muscle aches were still lingering. Currently, 1:04pm on March 26, 2021, I feel weak and tired with muscles pains around my upper body, but overall feeling much better than yesterday.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

She received  the J&amp;J vaccine at 3:41pm. Reported immediate arm soreness. While in the 15-min observation area at 3:45pm, patient fell out of chair onto the floor 2/2 LOC. I attended immediately to the patient (EMS was called at 3:47 due to LOC) When I arrived, patient was laying on her stomach and was awaking up. We turned her onto back and placed her feet in the air. Patient was immediately able to tell me her name and date of birth. She was given cold towels and she was cooled down. Initial vitals taken at 3:47p were 146/98, HR 66. EMS arrived at 4:02 and took vitals (BP=146/94, SPO2=99%). EMS stood the patient up and patient refused to go with EMS. Patient instructed to wait an additional 15 mins after EMS left.

Approximately 5 hours after recieving the vaccine I started feeling extremely tired and cold despite the climate being warmer than usual. I went to sleep and woke up shivering, i was cold but my body was burning to the touch. My body ached and I had a headache and nausea. My eyes hurt whenever I moved them. These symptoms persisted until 9:18, I took 2 tylenol pills and started feeling better. Today is my third day, my eye pain has not gone and I still feel tired but what is bothering the most is the eye pain whenever I look anywhere or move my head.

The entire night was spent tossing and turning, drenched in sweat while simultaneously feeling like I was on fire. On top of this I had a massive headache. Today is the day after and my fever has gone down throughout the day, but it is pretty bad. I still have a headache and also vomited a few times today. I have been taking acetaminophen and took some pepto bismol. I was able to start eating later in the day.

                                                I am a 25 year old female with no underlying/otherwise known health conditions. I received the vaccine Saturday, March 27th at ~1:30pm. No initial side effects, barely any arm pain, and I felt completely normal and fine for about 8 hours post vaccination. After ~8 hours, I began to develop body aches and tiredness, and within an hour of this onset I got severe chills. A few hours later (this is the middle of the night going into Sunday March 28th) I developed a fever that lasted into the next day. I was not able to take my temperature in the middle of the night but the next morning it had come down to 99.6F (still a slight fever). I had fatigue and tiredness the entire next day. I did not take any medication/fever reducer.  To sum up, I had no side effects upon initially receiving the vaccine, side effects set in ~8 hours post-vaccination and overall lasted about 24 hours. I have had no additional side effects other than those reported and have felt well since those subsided.

                                                I walked up the stairs to go to bed at 10:45pm and started feeling very dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.

                                                About 8 hours after administration, I got severe muscle aches and chills, such that I was shivering uncontrollably for a few hours, not sure how long. Hurt like nothing I?ve ever experienced before. Considered going to a hospital but couldn?t think of how bc I wasn?t thinking straight. It got a little better around midnight and I could get up enough to take some Advil (I had before when I first felt it coming on), had an intense migraine for the rest of the night but migraines I can deal with. Now I?m just a little dizzy and sore. But that was the worst.

Patient did express she has experienced this before while receiving shots or giving blood.

Fever lasted approximately 12 hours, and included heavy chills and sweating. Extreme fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. Metallic taste in mouth. Body aches, and especially soreness in the left arm (injection site). Loss of appetite. By 24 hours after the vaccine injection, almost all symptoms were gone, but soreness in left arm persisted. About 26 hours after the vaccine, I had extreme acid reflux which lasted a few hours. In the two days since the vaccine I&#39;ve experienced a ringing in my left ear.

At 1030 pm, I started getting all over muscle spasms, headache returned, onset of dizziness, nausea and uncontrollable shaking. At 1145pm, I started vomiting, the muscle spasms got increasing  worse, the shaking only decreased while in the bath tub in very hot water. No fever was noted with thermometer, but after a second dose of 1000mg of Tylenol at 1am, I broke out profusely sweating 30 minutes later.  The uncontrollable shaking stoped at about 4am, along with the nausea and vomiting.  Upon waking up the next day, muscle spasms were still there as well as the headache and dizziness. By end of day 4-10-21 (today) all symptoms have resolved but the headache.

Slight pain on the injection site, but not horrible. The day after the shot, I feel weak and nauseous.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started getting full body chills which quickly turned into full body shakes. The shaking felt like tremors and made it hard to breathe.  The uncontrollable shaking and chills lasted approx. 3 hours and then I fell asleep. The next morning (approx. 12 hours after the vaccine) I no longer had body shakes but experienced flu-like symptoms (headache, tired, week) for the rest of the day. I also experienced severe pain in my lower back. By the next day (approx. 36 hours after the vaccine) I was back to normal and have felt fine since.

Sustained fever while feeling incredibly cold for night. Maintained low grade fever following day even while taking fever-reducing medication. Did not begin to feel normal until 48 hours after the vaccine, and even then felt worn and sluggish for a day or two more.

Had trouble sleeping through the night, profusely sweating, headache. 24 hours after the shot, I no longer had a chill/fever but continued to have a headache, be extremely hot/sweating, experience brain fog for 1-2 more days. Symptoms lessened over time, but I was still weak and had brain fog 72 hours after my injection. Soreness in my arm lasted about 5 days.

About an hour later my entire body was aching and I couldn&#39;t stop shaking with chills. I couldn&#39;t move or turn in my bed without my entire body just hurting. Even the blankets and clothes I had on were hurting my body. I tossed and turned throughout the night. At midnight I woke up to use the bathroom and my face and eyes were hurting. Once I got into my bathroom and looked in the mirror, my face was a little swollen and my eyes were a little puffy. My forehead and cheeks were a little red so I took my temperature and I was running a fever of 102.

Previously cramps were there but minimal and occasional.

                                                About 9 hours after my vaccine, I developed severe chills for 2 hours and a fever of around 100.1, I also had shortness of breath. After 2 hours, I started experiencing severe body aches (primarily in my knees and back) and a headache, my body temperature felt as thought it was changing from cold to hot frequently, and my temperature rose to 103.6 for about 1.5-2 hours. It finally decreased to about 102 and remained there for about 6 more hours. I had trouble getting up to use the restroom and would feel very dizzy, my temperature dropped midday to about 100. My fever finally broke about 24 hours after my vaccine, but I still lost my appetite and was experiencing body aches and a headache. I couldn&#39;t eat anything for about 48 hours after my vaccine, I was able to take small sips of water to help stay hydrated. It took until Saturday (5 days after my vaccine) to feel back to normal. I felt very puffy and swollen the entire week following my vaccine and was very fatigued.

                                                I received the shot at 3:00 pm and by 8:30 I was achy and nauseous. I decided trying to take Tylenol to help alleviate my pain would just come back up as vomit. Within the next hour I had became increasingly nauseous and my hand started to cramp up and go numb. I couldn&#39;t move my hands. My husband then decided to call the E.R. and ask if this was a common reaction and they recommended we come in. We got to the hospital and my left hand had started getting feeling back and moving but my right hand had not. They preformed a neurological test and ruled out a stroke and that it was happening on both sides of my body. The ended up giving me a dose of tordol and a shot of antihistamines and sent me home with a prescription for ibuprofen.

Most of the symptoms lasted 3-4 days but the extreme fatigue and sore arm lasted for a week. Symptoms were similar to when I had covid, but was surprised that some symptoms lasted a full week. Had to take off work for a few days.

Lotion did not relieve the itch I eventually put ice on them so I was able to sleep.   I woke up 4-19-2021 and felt itchy all over but no noticeable rash. I took my last antibiotic pill around 9 am. By 2:00pm I started getting small ?hives? on my arms. By 4pm my arms were covered and my chest and neck had began to break out.   By the time I reach the urgent care (4:45pm) my back and stomach, and upper legs had become affected also. I received a steroid shot in the muscle of my buttocks.   I got home around 6pm and put cool towels on my legs and eventually the rash was almost completely gone.    I woke up 4/20 around 6am with the chills and goosebumps all over feeling cold, but sweating like crazy. The rash/hives had came back and even worse/covering more of my body than before.  I am now taking  Prednisone 2x per day for the next 7days  starting 4/20 11am

                                                About 7 minutes of receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I started to feel nauseous while sitting down and waiting for my fifteen minutes of monitoring. I experienced pain in my left arm and my heart was beating fast. My vision was in and out, started seeing black and white spots. I then got up from my chair and I went to the counter and as I was talking to the clerk telling her I did not feel good, I just went down and fainted. I had fainted and when I came back, woke up a nurse was trying t put an epi-pen on me but I told her I did not need it. They called the ambulance and they monitored me there. The EMT said to me that my blood pressure had dropped and I had had a &#34;vasovagal syncope&#34; and that my body probably went into shock. I did not go to the hospital and went home. For the rest of the day I felt ill, and out of it. I also felt pain, an aching pain to the right buttocks region. The next day I still felt not good. Also I have noticed since the J&amp;J vaccine, I had my menstrual cycle but normally my menstrual cycle lasts 5 days now this month it only lasted about 4 hours and I this concerns me.  Before this vaccine, I did not have experience these symptoms.
