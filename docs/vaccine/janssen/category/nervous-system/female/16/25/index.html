                                                Minutes after I got the vaccine I started to lose hearing in my left ear (it sounded like I was under water) which slowly spread to my right ear as well. My hands and feet went numb and I started sweating all over. I felt sick to my stomach and I felt like I was above the whole situation-- I could hear the people talking but I felt like I was somewhere else. After resting my head on the table for about 10 minutes I felt better and was able to move to a cot where I rested for another 20 minutes or so until I felt pretty much back to normal. I was treated by the medical team at the site who cleared me to go home.

Patient got my attention a few minutes later saying she felt dizzy. As i was guiding her back to the chair she passed out and i guided her to the floor. In a few minutes she was able to sit upright in the chair. EMS was called and she later went to hospital for further evaluation.

Woke up @12:30am with chills, a headache, soreness in the injection site, and body aches in the neck, back and legs.  Got up and tried stretching and drinking water. Stoped drinking water when I felt nauseas. Did not throw up. Took Ibuprofen and melatonin before falling asleep about 30 minutes after taking the medication. Woke up @3:00am and chills were gone, only left with pain in the knees and injection site. Wasn?t able to sleep until around 4:45am. When I woke up @7:45 am, I still had slight pain in the knees, I took Tylenol @10:45 am. Pain was on and off throughout the day. I took a hot bath, that helped the pain tremendously. Fatigue throughout the day. After sleeping the day after the shot, all symptoms are gone, only soreness in the injection site.

                                                Within 5-10 minutes after receiving vaccine, patient began to become very pale.  Her symptoms included dizziness, syncope, stomach ache, foaming at the mouth, vision disturbances.  911 was called and paramedics arrived..  Her vital signs were all normal.  Patient did not wish to go to hospital, and her mother took her home.  Other pertinent information is that patient has a history of seizures and had been off of her seizure medication for 4 weeks.  I believe that I understood her mother to say that her neurologist knew she was getting the vaccine today.  Patient reported no allergies to any other vaccine, medication, or other.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection, I woke up after sleeping for an hour with excruciating pain in all of my limbs, especially the injection site. I could not move any of my limbs. Not because of pain, I simply could not move them. I had a fever (temp not recorded, I could only tell because I was burning up.) I was very nauseous, but never vomited. I was shaking very hard and had the chills despite being covered by a blanket and simultaneously burning up. Both of my ankles that I had suffered a running injury to several weeks ago (I have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appointment to get them checked out) were pulsing with pain. I developed a minor headache. Eventually I either drifted back to sleep or stayed awake, because I don&#39;t remember anything up until around 5am when I was able to get up and take Tylenol and water. All symptoms were gone except for the minor headache.

                                                I felt completely normal after getting the vaccine. Then at 8 pm (5 hours after getting it) I felt heat rushing to my head and face. I became very weak in my legs and I had to lay down. I took ibuprofen at 9 pm because my body aching was very intense. I woke up at 11:30 pm with such terrible body aches I could not sleep and I was crying from the pain. I had freezing chills and a throbbing headache. When I tried to stand up, I almost fell over because I felt so light-headed. I thought I was going to faint. I was so concerned about the amount of pain I was in that I called my doctor and public safety came and checked on me. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed for 3 hours. I drank Gatorade and took more ibuprofen. I was able to check my temperature. I had a 101-103 degree fever.  The entire next day (Tuesday) I took ibuprofen every six hours. My body was still very weak and aching everywhere as well as a headache. I stayed in bed the entire day. Today (Wednesday) I feel much better??both of my arms still ache a lot and my body feels exhausted.

This lasted until approx. 4 AM when I finally fell asleep. The next morning I woke up feeling much better. But, for the next 5 days, I have had on-and-off low-grade fevers between 99F and 100F.

Roughly an hour to an hour and a half later, the chills/shaking stopped, only to be replaced by a fever. My temperature shot up, my ears began to ring, and my head began to pound. When I tried to eat, I felt sick to my stomach.   My fever lasted for the entire evening, and I spent most of the night alternating between chills and heat flashes. My head continued to pound, and whenever I tried to sit up, I felt dizzy. At around 4am, I awoke with an upset stomach, diarrhea, and further dizziness.   By around 8-9am, my fever had subsided, and I was beginning to feel a bit better. However, I have been feeling physically drained and a little achy today (03/26).

Her eyes rolled back, stiff arm, and she urinated herself. Her mom was holding her hand and after a few seconds, she was able to talk and said that she thought that she fell asleep for a few seconds. We called an ambulance and they are taking her to the hospital for a CT scan.

                                                Within a few hours of getting the vaccine started with Flu symptoms of severe body aches, chills, headache, fever. Day 2 a bit better but still low grade fever of 101 degrees, nausea, weak, body aches but not as bad. In the evening around 5pm noticed ears starting to enlarge but didn&#39;t think much of it, by morning today at 7:30am I felt my face was swollen and numb on the right side. Now both ears were swollen and the area in my face was red. When I took my temperature on my forehead I was normal however the swollen cheek was 102 degrees. At that point I went to urgent care to get it looked out.  Currently at 6:30pm on 4/3/2021 the redness in my cheek has turn back to normal however the face is still swollen but not as bad.

When I was called to help her, she had fainted.  She was able to slowly respond to us and was breathing.   We placed her on the floor laying on her side.  A cold compress was placed on the back of her neck and a pillow was placed under her head.  9-1-1 was called.  When EMS responded, she had normal blood pressure and blood sugar, but was still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;.  She was place on a stretcher and taken to the ambulance, but did not get transported.  She had a family member pick her up from the clinic.  She was able to walk from the ambulance to the car on her own.

                                                She had no history of anaphylaxis from any cause, she had no history of reactions to vaccines or components.  After about 5 minutes I checked on her and she said she was feeling very dizzy.  I called management for assistance and got her ice packs for neck and forehead. I took her blood pressure and it was 150/90, HR 73. We laid her down and elevated her legs.  She said that she felt some pressure in her chest but she had pulled a muscle there the day before and wasn&#39;t sure if it was related.  She said the room was spinning as she continued to lay on the ground and it was not improving.  Her blood pressure was taken about 5 minutes later and it was 143/85 HR 73.  She said it is usually low.   She had no signs of local reaction, hives, or swelling.  She complained of nausea.  After a few more minutes she said she was not feeling any better and was having pain in her throat and difficulty breathing.  I asked her to try to take a deep breath and she was gasping for air, unable to breathe deeply.  I administered epinephrine (one dose) and called 911.  I rechecked blood pressure while waiting for paramedics and it was 125/80.  She was taken to hospital when they arrived.  Her mom arrived shortly before the ambulance and went with her.  Pt never lost consciousness.  Management followed up with patient this evening and patient is home and well, but the ER did classify the event as an allergic reaction.

Around 4:00 am, the worst migraine, I have ever had that encased my whole head, lasted for about 12 hours with hot flashes. After the migraine, my body and head is sensitive to rapid motion and loud noises.

                                                Within the hour after receiving shot, migraine formed along with fatigue. Both progressively got worse through out that day(4/7/21). On 4/8/21 I woke up many times through out the night with a migraine that felt as though my brain was burning and sinus pressure, causing immense eye sensitivity. Throughout the night I became increasingly more sweaty, but didn?t have the proper thermometer to take my temperature.  I took ibuprofen (at 6:45 AM on 4/8/21) which helped those two side effects subside (around 8 AM). Fatigue has been constant throughout both days. Around 5:00 PM on 4/8/21 I ate broccoli and rice for dinner, small amounts, and encountered bad diarrhea. It lasted for about half an hour. Migraine is reduced significantly (at 6:41 PM), but there is slight nausea, weakness, and fatigue.

I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

I took ibuprofen at 8:00pm. That night at about 9:00 my fever was 100.8 and I felt extreme fatigue.  I woke up at 3:30am feeling both extremely hot and cold with a bad headache and my temperature was 101.5. I took ibuprofen again at 3:30am. I then woke up at 5:15 am with a horrible headache and was very hot and sweating. I put cold compresses on my forehead and back of my neck which helped. The entire night, my arm with the injection site was very painful and stiff to move.

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine, a cold, tingling, transient sensation was experienced radiating from the site of the injection up into the neck. Roughly 6 hours after injection (1 a.m., 3/9/2021) severe chills were experienced for approximately two and a half hours, preventing sleep. Patient experienced dizziness. spO2 was within normal limits. Temperature was measured w/ oral thermometer to be 101.3 degrees farenheit at 4:55 a.m. in the morning on 3/9/2021.  Treatment was a single dose of ibuprofen at roughly 8 a.m. (3/9/21). Pt. continued to experience fatigue and sporadic chills, with gradual abatement of symptoms over the course of the day. Pt. had no symptoms the following Wednesday (3/10/21). Pt. experienced symptoms the following Thursday (3/11/21), with a sudden onset of intense stomach pain (8/10 on NRS) starting at approximately noon. Stomach pain was more similar to muscle cramps (with aching quality) than nausea. Other symptoms included fatigue and some feverish experiences (such as chills). Treatment was conservative (ginger tea, peppermint candies, rest). Temperature taken that evening via oral thermometer (roughly 7pm, 3/11/21) was 101.4 degrees farenheit.  Symptoms were significantly reduced the following morning, Friday 3/12/21. Temperature taken approximately 10 a.m. was within normal limits.

It was so bad that it caused me to stay in bed all day the day following the vaccine and I had to stay home from school and work. Today I am still extremely fatigued and have a bad headache and dizziness. This was not relieved by the maximum dose of Tylenol.

The lightheadedness was such that my heart was pounding, vision was lost for a second (similar to the effect when you stand up too fast), and the sound went out for a second. Around 7:00 I got chills, a 101 degree F fever, and headache. The chills, fever, and headache lasted throughout the night, but they were gone in the morning. The entire day after getting the vaccine, 4/1/2021, I had a metallic taste in my mouth. By the morning of 4/2/2021 the metallic taste was gone.

All of the muscles in my body had a severe tremor, and I had trouble with simple tasks like filling my nasal rinse bottle, because the tremor was so bad. My jaw was smacking the entire time, so hard that the headboard smacked against the blinds. Then I checked my temperature and it had gone from 97.5 to about 99.5. The symptoms got worse, and added in excessive thirst, pain at the base of my head where it meets my neck, pressure under and behind the eyes, severe lower back pain, muscle pain escalating on the right side of my body only, nausea, pain across the top of my forehead, and a weird heat sensation under my fingernails? Maybe and hour or so passed, and my fever rose to above 101, and I tried to go back to sleep. By this point the tremors were over, but slight chills and every other symptoms remained. I took my temp later and it was 102.7, and I again had all symptoms except the initial tremors. I also had tachycardia (super rapid heartbeat) and got dizzy for a second and have a little trouble focusing my vision when I sat up in bed.

She sat with her head against the wall and dropped her phone and passed out for just a moment.  She had a slight tremor/shake for a few seconds. (I did not witness, unsure exactly what happened or how long)   She came too fairly quickly after being yelled at, are you ok?  When she regained consciousness she complained of being hot all over for a bit.  We gave her ice packs to cool down.  She felt hot for maybe 10-15 minutes, but felt relief with the ice packs.  She also drank some sips of cool water which seemed to help her cool down.

Around 4:15 I had to lay down because I believe the shivering was exacerbating my aching.

                                                I have chronic tension headaches and yesterday my headache wouldn&#39;t go away even with over the counter medication. I felt overall achy but still able to get up and do what I needed to do. Once I went to bed though, I woke up around 2:00a sweating, achy, and with a fever. I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep very easily and once I woke up around 7:00a I confirmed I had a fever. I am currently still bedridden with a fever, complete body aches, and slight feelings of nausea. As of right now it is 8:56a 04/06/21 and the symptoms haven&#39;t gotten any better. I haven&#39;t taken any medication since 04/05/21 at 6:15p ish, which was to treat my headache from yesterday.

She said she felt fully back to normal by the time she left with the person she came with (her mom).

                                                Hives on my arms and stomach developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine at 2:16. I left the facility after 30 minutes because the hives did not get any worse and I did not experience any other symptoms. At home about 8 hours later, I started feeling exhausted, weak, and my body was literally shaking whenever I stood. Overnight, I felt feverish, I had the worst nightmares, and woke up every few hours. On Friday (next day) I felt dizzy whenever I moved, nauseous whenever I stood, and once when I was standing too long I started vomiting.  On Friday evening I went to a local ER (all the urgent cares were closed) at my primary care Dr?s suggestion to ensure that I wasn?t having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The ER determined that the hives were likely an allergic reaction but all other symptoms were reactions due to the vaccine.

On Wednesday at 01:07 AM woke up to a terrible migraine, nausea, and cold sweats. Could not go back to sleep. On a scale of (least)1-10(most) was a pain level of 6 or 7.  I also could not stop shaking.  At 2:03 AM  developed a fever of 101.3 F. Sat in a cold lukewarm shower until the fever broke.  Was able to go back to bed.   Spent all of Wednesday inside. Migraine and nausea still present. Intensified with bright lights.

                                                Around 10PM I was on the phone and felt the body aches start. About an hour or so later it started to get pretty painful, my joints. I was trying to go to sleep and I started with chills. I had a heating pad and 2 blankets and was still shivering, I took my temp and it was 102.4F. I took some Tylenol and was able to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night sweating. Next morning I was again with 102.7F fever. I slept most o the day, and when awake I noticed the body aches were still present. Kept taking Tylenol. Next day my left ear started feeling to hurt and it felt like fluid. I decided to go get checked and that is when they told me I had an inner and outer ear infection. After meds were prescribed (oral antibiotics and ear drops) the swelling has been going down a lot and it is not as near as painful.

I was warmer than normal but did not have a full fever. I was extremely fatigued. Most of these symptoms subsided in about 24 hours with acetaminophen. I am still having occasional (every other day) mild headaches and shortness of breath, heaviness in the chest, and a couch that have persisted 5 days so far.

The chills lasted for around 4 hours, and eventually my fever went away with it. I shook so hard my back, and my joints started to ache. I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was having hallucinations from the fever and the pain would wake me up every hour, I also had a headache. The next day my back still hurts, my head still hurts despite medication, the shaking has subsided. Yet I&#39;m sweating, I&#39;m still very weak, I can&#39;t stand up without getting super dizzy or experiencing extreme fatigue. If I think of food I feel as if I&#39;m going to vomit just drinking too much water can make me ill.

                                                About 6 hours after I recieved the vaccine, I started to feel relatively sick. I had a bad headache and was achy, which I know were listed as possible side effects. A few hours later, I started to have a severe burning sensation all over my body. It felt similar to the sensation when your skin gets extremely sensitive to any touch, but was magnified 10x over, and was over every inch of my body. There was no rash, and I did not have a chill as though I had a fever, although my skin was warm to the touch. I took 2 500 mg tablets of extra-strength Tylenol, and the symptoms did not improve at all.

I wait a another hour and I still had the chills and started to have terrible body aches. I took my temperature again and it was at 101.3.

I then realized it was getting worse, and I was shivering uncontrollably despite sitting in front of a space heater in warm clothing and wrapped in a blanket. I checked for a fever, but my temp was only 99. I fell asleep around 1 am, and woke up at 5 am (3/8/21) to a splitting headache, extreme thirst, slight nasal congestion, muscle soreness, fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms feel almost identical to the symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID-19 in September 2020 at my university.

                                                Began with chills and muscle aches. Got worse over the course of an hour until I was unable to get out of bed. Pain in my muscles all over from hours of full body chills. The chills stopped after two hours at which point an uncontrolled fever set in. Highest temp recorded was 103. Severe full body muscle pain prevented me from getting up or drinking water on my own. Small movements like sitting up or rolling over to relieve muscle pain resulted in sudden and severe nausea. Considered going to a hospital to bring down the fever and hydrate. After two more hours of applying cold compresses, the fever decreased to 100 at which point I slept it off for six hours.  Prolonged bouts of dizziness, dehydration and nausea over the following two days.

I got up to shower and get some food as I was going upstairs I grew very faint,  my vision grew black and my hearing faded. I was able to make it to my bed then ask for some help. After taking Tylenol, my fever began to be very hot instead of chills. I was able to fall asleep until I woke back up to chills again and taking more medicine.  The next morning, I was still dizzy when I walked around but the fever was gone. I was still very fatigued which made me unable to go to class or work. Day 3 I was back to my normal self.

                                                Originally, I started with random muscle aches in my left shoulder then it went down my back (a few hours after receiving vaccine). Then slightly fogginess and at night the muscle pain became worse making it difficult to sleep and started getting cold flashes. Once asleep around 12:30 I started getting muscle aches that felt like they were burning and in random spots on body along with a headache and would get random cold and heat flashes. Kept yelling out in pain all night and increased tremors in hands. Boyfriend noticed I had a fever as well and gave me ibuprofen around 3am since pain was unbearable and was difficult to sleep. Almost took me to the hospital due to the intense pain.. In morning slightly better but still frontal lobe pain and aches throughout body with raised heart rate. Cannot do much or else aches get worse including headache.

It progressed to the point where I needed assistance walking.  I had extreme chills with uncontrollable shivering and muscle spasms.  I felt very cold though I was burning up and sweating profusely.  I went to sleep and woke up a few hours later with no fever but very sore muscles.  When I woke up in the morning, I felt like nothing had happened, I was just a bit groggy.

Also I got inflammation in the injection area which is red, inflamed and causes a lot of pain as much as the movement of the arm as the touch of the area. It&#39;s like a &#34;bump&#34;. This effect originated since the same day that vaccine was applied to me and even 6 days later I still have this symptom or adverse event in my left arm which is where I received the &#34;shot.&#34;

We applied cold clothes to the neck and head and patient felt like she was going to vomit so we also gave her a bag just in case she got sick. She started looking very pale so we layed patient on floor. She started to panic that she wasn&#39;t going to go to work and eyes were rolling in the back of head. Called 911 for patient and I stayed with patient, I took her blood pressure which was normal. Patient became fully alert again and stated she was feeling a little better. The ems checked her blood pressure and blood sugar and released the patient.

Today I am feeling better but I?m still extremely tired even after restarting my adderall.

I received the vaccine Friday afternoon 3/12, and around midnight that night (so 3/13 technically) I developed flu like symptoms. I had a mild fever, severe body aches, severe headache, nausea, fatigue, etc. For the entire day of 3/13 I was pretty much bed ridden. Around 5pm on the 13th I took Tylenol and felt a little better and was able to eat something and fall asleep that night. I woke up on the 14th with just a sore arm where I received the shot.

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

It was spreading and I am going back to the Doctor today. I am on antibiotics for 10 days, taking this doxycycline pill two times daily.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation for 15 minutes after her vaccine.  Within a minute or so  patient felt light headed and like she might pass out. She notified the technician who was right there and he notified me.  I assisted her to a sitting position on the floor from her chair and I was able to ease her back to a lying down position from there with her head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient was able to talk the whole time.  She told us at that point when she was younger she was scared of shots and had fainted when having them, but thought she was past that and did not mention it during screening. She said she was surprised to feel this way because she was so excited about getting her COVID vaccine.  She had not eaten much today (a small snack) and had rushed here for her appointment without getting food. I checked her blood pressure while she was lying down and it was 94/63 and pulse of 75.  She said she normally had lower end of normal blood pressure.   She was pale when I started checking her, but her color began to return to normal within minutes. After 5 minutes she felt well enough to sit up and we got her a granola bar and water.  She remained this way for 5 minutes and felt good, so we moved her to sitting in a chair and got her a pepperoni and cheese snack tray from the cafe.  She ate this and waited for 10minutes and felt good. We walked her to her car and she felt fine.  I called to verify she got home fine and she did.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. I had the vaccine at around 4:00 pm and felt fine until I woke up around 12:30 am. I had severe chills and shakes, body aches, and a headache. It eventually turned into sweating. Around 8:30am, it&#39;s not as severe. I took tylenol around 8:30 am and do not feel like I have the chills anymore, just body aches and some fatigue.

Fever rose to over 101F while sleeping and woke me up once the ibuprofen ran its course. Did some wet towel compresses but did not help. Took another ibuprofen.   Muscle aches and chills persisted into the next day. Developed another mild fever in the second day. Symptoms resolved on day 3. Soreness in arm where the vaccine was administered persists.

                                                Felt cramps in my lower abdomen, then in my mid back. Put heat on my back. Then I started to feel very nauseous and light headed, dizzy. Shortly felt a burning feeling in my chest and  collar bones, that spread to my head. My head started to burn, it felt like it was on fire, along with my neck and chest. I felt dizzy, like i was going to faint, the burning and dizziness lasted for about 5 minutes. Shortly after i felt like my throat closed up and I was having very labored breaths. The burning feeling in my body and dizziness came back, along with not feeling like i could breathe well. I went to an ER, they gave me an IV with Benadryl, and I started to feel well enough 2 hours later to go home.

                                                About 5 hours after my vaccine I had already been asleep for around 30 minutes when I was startled awake by my own rapid heartbeat, it was beating so fast and hard that I could hear it and it woke me up. I reviewed my literature about the vaccine I received at the pharmacy and saw this reaction could be due to an allergic reaction but as an uninsured person I had to just wait it out to see if it would go away. I drank a lot of water and started developing a headache but my heart rate finally slowed down enough that I was no longer alarmed, but it was still faster than usual. I went back to sleep around 2am only to awake once again around 5am because I had begun to experience the worst body aches I?ve ever felt as well as nausea and a pounding headache. I live on a semi truck with no bathroom so my fiancé had to take me to my parents house so I would have access to a bathroom. I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for my pain and took 6 showers in 24 hours just to soothe my body aches. It felt worse than any flu I?ve ever had (I received the flu vaccine back in January if that matters). I was extremely ill and had no appetite and pretty much just slept and cried for about 36 hours total, but yesterday afternoon I finally felt a little better although still experiencing a terrible headache. Today I woke up feeling completely fine. I just wanted to report my side effects.

                                                10 hours after shot developed fever 102.  Shaking and holding chest.  Was able to calm her down.  Fever started to break in the afternoon on 04/01.  Continued to vomit all day probably because of the fever.  Gave liquids only. By 9:00 pm fever fluctuating 99 to normal.  Hopefully by 4/2 all symptoms will have passed.  I did not take her to the doctor for this although when the symptoms started I was very concerned because she does not speak and I didn?t know if she was having chest pains.

I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                At approximately 0945 this nurse witnessed patient sitting in the observation area with her head tilted to the left side and her body leaning to the left. The medical assistant was with her holding her body up. Her eyes were closed and she had no color to her face and lips. She was not able to respond to questions being asked. As her head was shaking she was making grunting noises. She was diaphoretic and tremulous. This episode lasted for approximately 60 seconds. Pt then opened her eyes and was able to respond to questions asked but with a delayed response. Pt was moved to the stretcher to lay down.

                                                At around 9:15 PM I started to feel nauseous and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I felt a very strong chill come over my whole body and started shivering and got directly back into bed and wrapped myself up in a thick blanket. For 45 minutes I laid wrapped up and was shivering constantly. At 10 pm I was brought extra blankets and a heating pad but moving to get situated caused dizziness. It was about 10:30 when the shivering stopped. I was able to sleep but got up to go got the bathroom around midnight and my entire body was drained of energy and I felt that I could barely stand and walk on my own. I was dizzy and my head hurt as well. I could barely hold my arms up to look at my phone briefly. Between 11 PM and 2 AM I had 5 or 6 high heart rate alerts (over 120) according to my Apple Watch but I did not wake up to them. In the morning (Sunday 4/4/21) around 9-10 am my head still hurt and my body was very achy and I felt very hungover. All day I continued to feel achy almost with a bad cold or a minor flu. Today has been better but I have still felt pretty drained. I?ve had continuous arm soreness in the arm I got the injection - but nothing too severe.   15 minutes after my vaccine on Saturday 4/3/21 I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and around midnight of that night I took 2 of pain relief PM acetaminophen (1000 mg of acetaminophen total snd 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCI total)

Then I started feeling cold chills, and had to lie down in bed for the rest of the day.  Slight fever also occured and intense body aches. However, these slowly subsided after taking tylenol at about 6PM. I slept through the night and outside of feeling a little lethargic the next day, I was back to normal.

                                                Patient received her Janssen COVID vaccine and was sitting in a chair in the conference room when she slumped over in her chair and became unresponsive. Patient had just received her one dose Janssen vaccine and was sitting in a chair approximately 3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She began to slump over in her chair and was unresponsive. Two RNs responded to assess the patient. Patients feet were elevated and ice packs applied to her neck and axillary areas. Patient was breathing and had a pulse. Patient responded to her name once and then passed out again. Patient was unable to respond after this.  Her eyes were open.  Patient was lifted into a wheelchair by three nurses and brought to a private area.  Patient was warm and sweat was running down her face.  Her sweater was removed and ice packs again were applied to her neck and axillary area.  Patient continued to have a pulse and was breathing.  EMS was called.  Patient slowly began to come around and could answer questions after about 5 minutes of being unresponsive. She was confused and had no memory of what had occurred. She reported feeling light headed and seeing spots in her vision.  She continued to feel light headed. EMS assessed patient.  Vitals were stable and blood sugar was WDL.  Patient reported feeling much better. She denied feeling light headed or dizzy any longer.  She was able to answer all questions asked.  Patient did not want to go to the hospital and refused transport to the hospital via ambulance. She was observed for an additional 20-30 minutes at which time her boss arrived to pick her up. She was educated on calling 911 if she began to feel light headed or dizzy again. Patient verbalized understanding. She was walked to the car by an RN.

                                                Started developing a headache about 2/3 hours after the vaccine. Took some ibuprofen, at 7:11am I still have a severe headache being treated by otc pain reliever. About 2:30am I woke up from my headache and realized I was freezing cold, dispute it being 74 degrees in my house. I did not have a fever but I had extreme chills, my entire body shivering and shaking at some points. This made it hard to stand or even get some water. These lasted about 2 hours or so. Once I was able to get warm again, under several blankets and a heated blanket they did go away and  I did not experience them again.

Woke up around 1AM with severe chills and body aches, tried to keep cool and took temperature around 2:30AM - it was at 100.4. Took Motrin at this time and took temperature again at 3:15AM, it was 101.2. It finally started to go down around 3:45AM and was 100.8. I was able to fall back asleep and didn&#39;t wake up until 10AM. I have had a bad headahce all day on 04/08 and have to keep alternating Tylenol and Motrin to keep fever down. Also very lethargic all day and slept most of the day.

I went to bed around 9 pm, and at around 3 am the next morning (04/06/2021), I woke up with severe chills, body aches, a pressure headache, and some mild nausea (I believe caused by the headache) that lasted through until early afternoon. Taking ibuprofen seemed to help the body and headaches, but it seemed like it was difficult to regulate my body temperature. I couldn&#39;t tell if I was too hot or too cold, and trying to remedy one or the other made me either too cold or too hot, respectively. All effects completely cleared up by 04/07/2021.

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine I began to feel slightly dizzy. By the time I walked across the room to the observation table I was feeling lightheaded. They sat me down, gave me water and a cookie, but about 2min after the injection the dizziness was so intense that I began to black out. I was unconscious for about 1-2min, then came to but my vision was still unclear. I was taken via wheelchair to the paramedics on the opposite end of the gymnasium, and at this point I was heavily perspiring and very pale but still coherent. I felt my vision and dizziness significantly improve after being able to lay down. I was transported to the hospital for observation but had much improved by the time I arrived. An EKG, bloodwork, and cardiac tests were recommended to discern possible underlying heart related conditions, but I declined because I already had a PAT for thyroid surgery scheduled the next day that would be running those same tests. This reaction was likely due to not having eaten  for several hours prior to the vaccine. After about an hour I felt well enough to drive myself back home and dealt with mild aches and pains that evening, chills, and a low grade fever all of which resolved themselves by the next morning.

                                                I woke up noticing a slight headache, but I figured it was from poor sleep the night prior. I noticed after breakfast that I felt really cold and felt an internal shiver, especially in my chest. My fingers and toes were ice cold even with a sweater, blanket, and a warm tea. I noticed my skin starting to feel tender and I felt very fatigued. I wanted knew I needed to eat so that I could take ibuprofen, but I experienced a loss of appetite. I had a mild cough, but I felt too tired to even cough. I rocked in a chair in the sunlight outside for about 15 minutes and still felt cold. When I took my oral temperature after coming inside, I was reading 99.9. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen by 1130 and layed down to rest. Bundled in 3 layers, I felt the shivering couldn&#39;t stop. My headache got worse and my skin was tender to the touch. I was able to sleep for approximately 3 hours and I woke up drenched in sweat. I took my oral temperature again and was at 101.1. I drank some more water and tried to sleep some more. When I woke up around 4:30 pm, I felt a lot better. My temperature went down to 97.8 and I had a boost in energy and appetite. I no longer had a headache and I had only mild muscle aches. By the next morning, I felt completely normal again.

I started getting really cold, took my temperature and it was at 100.1. Got a headache, slightly nauseous, body aches got a lot worse (particularly my lower back). I was also feeling a little dizzy and having a hard time comprehending information; this was probably the fever. Around 8pm,  I took my temperature again and it had risen to 102. I took some extra strength Tylenol which started helping about 30 minutes later. I woke up 3/12/2021 still with some body aches, slight headache, and slight stomachache.

                                                Patient received Janssen vaccine by registered nurse and was completing her 15 minute waiting period. She began to feel faint and an employee of our facility caught her as she experienced a near syncopal episode. She was promptly placed in Trendelenburg position and vitals obtained. BP was 90/58 with mild tachycardia to max of 130-140 bpm. Patient was given supportive treatment and monitored. BP improved to 110/70 after 5 minutes and 120/72 after 15 minutes. Patient continued to feel very dizzy and weak, however, and became tachycardic and diaphoretic each time she attempted to move to a seated position. After 1 hour of monitoring and vitals showing continued tachycardia, decision was made to transport the patient to ER for further testing. Patient expressed agreement and understanding of plan to transport to ER via ambulance.

Every-time I stand up it jumps to 116. My resting heart rate was 113 for 8hours straight Monday night. So the j&amp;j website lists that as an allergic reaction. The urgent care basically said wait it out and be careful cuz if I move like too fast I could pass out again cuz of the blood pressure

The day after that, I felt fine.

                                                The injection itself was quite painful (and I&#39;ve had many vaccine shots in my life). Felt completely fine until around 4pm when I felt a dull headache. Around 5pm, my head was throbbing so much that I couldn&#39;t leave my bed. Around 6pm, I felt muscle pains starting around my neck, slowly moving to my shoulders, chest, and upper back. Without taking any medication, I slept and woke up around 8pm. I was sweating, felt so cold but hot at the same time. The muscle pains were intense, and my head hurt so much that I took a single capsule of 200mg Advil. The pain became more manageable around 30 minutes later. Was still sweating, and muscle aches continued. I slept again at around 2am (May 26, 2021) and woke up at 10am. Head was no longer hurting, but muscle aches were still lingering. Currently, 1:04pm on March 26, 2021, I feel weak and tired with muscles pains around my upper body, but overall feeling much better than yesterday.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

                                                ?Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine?  Approximately 5 hours after recieving the vaccine I started feeling extremely tired and cold despite the climate being warmer than usual. I went to sleep and woke up shivering, i was cold but my body was burning to the touch. My body ached and I had a headache and nausea. My eyes hurt whenever I moved them. These symptoms persisted until 9:18, I took 2 tylenol pills and started feeling better. Today is my third day, my eye pain has not gone and I still feel tired but what is bothering the most is the eye pain whenever I look anywhere or move my head.

She became unconscious and began to stumble unto the floor but was caught and held by her mother. After 1 minutes, the patient regained consciousness. She was given cold water and rubbing alcohol to forehead to help her. Her mother reported that the patient has a fear of needles and was anxious. The ambulance arrived but was refused by patient. The fire department arrived and monitored patient&#39;s blood pressure.

The entire night was spent tossing and turning, drenched in sweat while simultaneously feeling like I was on fire. On top of this I had a massive headache. Today is the day after and my fever has gone down throughout the day, but it is pretty bad. I still have a headache and also vomited a few times today. I have been taking acetaminophen and took some pepto bismol. I was able to start eating later in the day.

When I attempted to take a shower, I fainted for a few seconds and it was a struggle to move. Only felt comfortable when I was laying down. My muscles all felt painful and sore, had a painful headache, felt very disoriented and woozy. It was a struggle to walk or move, and couldn&#39;t talk loud or for a long time at once. Had to go home from work and spent the rest of the day sleeping. Around 4pm, 24 hours after the injection, my muscles felt less sore and was feeling better. The next morning, I was back to being completely normal.

No initial side effects, barely any arm pain, and I felt completely normal and fine for about 8 hours post vaccination. After ~8 hours, I began to develop body aches and tiredness, and within an hour of this onset I got severe chills. A few hours later (this is the middle of the night going into Sunday March 28th) I developed a fever that lasted into the next day. I was not able to take my temperature in the middle of the night but the next morning it had come down to 99.6F (still a slight fever). I had fatigue and tiredness the entire next day. I did not take any medication/fever reducer.  To sum up, I had no side effects upon initially receiving the vaccine, side effects set in ~8 hours post-vaccination and overall lasted about 24 hours. I have had no additional side effects other than those reported and have felt well since those subsided.

                                                I walked up the stairs to go to bed at 10:45pm and started feeling very dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.

Starting immediately and over the next 10 minutes I felt dizzy and lightheaded, as if I were about to pass out. I also felt nauseous. I recovered fully about 15 minutes later, and I didn?t think to notify the staff.
