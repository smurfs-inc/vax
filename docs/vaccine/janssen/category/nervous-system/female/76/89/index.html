It&#39;s excruciating, so I&#39;ve been lying on the couch for 7 days so far, with no end in sight.  It kills me to move my arm, so I only get up to use the bathroom.  I&#39;m taking 1000 mgs of Tylenol and 200 mgs of Motrin every 8 hours with very little effect (if any).  I&#39;ve called my doctor twice, but they said they can&#39;t do anything unless I go in, which is impossible because of the pain.  The nurse said they probably couldn&#39;t do anything, anyway,

She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.

The next morning when she woke up she could not walk, had to hold onto something to walk, and has a lot of pain, and has not improved even with taking pain medications.  There has been no improvement from the pain.  There are times that she feels just a little better, but then returns back to where it was.  She went to the ER on 3/17/21, they said that she had arthritis which she had but she has not had this type of pain until the vaccination.  They gave her some pain medicine which did not help at all.  She again is taking some pain medication now but the pain is still there.  She can stand on her leg and it doesn&#39;t hurt, but when she moves her leg is when it hurts.  She is now using a walker which she did not have to use before the vaccine.
