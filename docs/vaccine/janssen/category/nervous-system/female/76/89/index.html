She has pain radiating up her LLE, into her buttocks, and up her back &#34;all the way to my neck.&#34; Patient has not taken any pain medications symptomatically. Patient reports feeling chills last night.

Got up at 8:00 AM feeling exhausted.  Came home from afternoon dentist appointment (cleaning) exhausted with aching joints, bones and a slight temperature.  Went to bed at 6:00 PM and slept til 8:00 AM.  It felt like the same reaction from the flu shots which is why I didn&#39;t want to get vaccinated.  I started taking 1000 mags at 6 :00PM about every hour 7-9000 mg total and felt fine the next morning instead of in bed for 3 days with the flu shot and no Vit. C.  Also,  shortly after the shot, I got a tingling at the indent  in the back of my neck near the hairline which doesn&#39;t quite hurt but I feel the need to press on it.  I can&#39;t tell when it&#39;s going to come or what I&#39;ve done to make it happen.  It&#39;s still happening several times a day.

                                                Thumb on right hand becomes numb, turns white with apparent loss of blood circulation, and becomes cold. Since April 10, 2021, this has occurred 3 or 4 times without any identifiable cause evident. On April 10, however, the numbness occurred a few hours after a capillary broke and discolored the thumb.  Though a capillary break in the fingers is not uncommon, the numbness is a new occurrence. It is not debilitating, though it is disturbing in that it appears my thumb is dying.The numbness dissipates in about an hour.  I am not diabetic. In 2002, I did have a mild transient ischemic attack.   During the week following the vaccination, cognitive processing was slowed remarkably but has returned to normal.

She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.

                                                I got Bells Palsy within 15 minutes of getting the vaccine. I noticed that my cheek was going numb, and my eye was drooping. I stayed at the facility for 30 minutes. On the way home I couldn?t close my eye. I have had Bell?s Palsy in 2015 and I had mostly recovered with some residual effects to my eye and my mouth was a little droopy. It effects my eyelid, my mouth and the side of my face. Today my cheek was more numb even though my eye seemed to be getting better. The new effects are on the right side of my face in the same area as they were before. It has been eight days since my vaccination.

I had a headache and the muscle pains went into my left side and into my left lung and every time I breathed I would get a sharp pain. It went into both of my breasts but worse on left side of breast. This lasted about three or four days. I went to the doctor on Thursday, the 15th. But now everything is cleared up and I feel good. Yesterday, the 22nd I started feeling myself again. Except, I have a tremor that won&#39;t go away - I had a slight tremor before the vaccine but now after the tremor  it is much worse.

Went to ER, as my Mom died of stroke, where my BP registered 216/126.  After CT scan, MRI, leg dopplers, echocardiogram, and bubble test, all which were uneventful. I was kept for observation until Tuesday afternoon.  I was put on Plavix and Lipitor and released.  I don&#39;t know if this was just a coincidence, but figured I should report it just in case.  At the time of my vaccination, i had NO pain at the injection site, but a week later and since have had a slight pain at the site.

I told the nurse and she had doctor look at it and he said not to worry about it.  However, as the day went on my entire left arm turned red.  I went to my primary care doctor the next day and he told me to ice it and put lotion on it.  The redness is going away 3 days later however I can still feel the dots under the skin . They are not painful.

When the result was positive yesterday, office reportedly told radiology to call my office after I had already left the office.  The patient reports the pain in her RLE is improved.  The patient denies any trauma to the leg or recent prolonged immobilization including car/plane trip. Of note she does say she received the J&amp;J covid vaccine a month ago.  Discussed risks of DVT and treatment options. Discussed association with breast cancer and Arimidex as well as covid vaccines.  Will try to treat with Eliquis 10mg bid for a week then 5mg bid. Will discuss with oncology whether she may stop Arimidex. If she can, will likely treat with Eliquis for 3 months; otherwise will treat with Eliquis until she completes her course of Arimidex.  Will report possible adverse event to VAERS.    5/7/21 ADDENDUM Discussed case with oncology, who corrected me that Arimidex does not increase risk of VTE. Will continue Arimidex with long term anticoagulation. Patient will be notified.

                                                I received Botox on 2/19/21 In the right arm for post stroke treatment of muscle spasticity. Then I received the COVID-19 shot in the right arm on 3/12/21. Coincidentally within the following week, I developed extreme weakness in the right leg. It is severe enough that I&#39;m still having trouble walking at all even with help. So I&#39;m wondering if there was an interaction between the vaccine and the Botox that caused this. I&#39;ve had adverse interactions between medications before.
