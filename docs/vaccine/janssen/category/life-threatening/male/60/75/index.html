                                                Roughly a week following vaccination he cut his hand and was unable to stop the bleeding. 2 days later he developed mucosal lesions inside his mouth which began to bleed without resolution. He also cut himself shaving with prolonged bleeding. Following this event his rehabilitation center performed a CBC and he was found to be profoundly thrombocytopenic with platelets of 7. He presented to hospital where he was transfused with platelets which did not resolve his thrombocytopenia. He was transfused 2 more units with immediate CBC followup which did not improve his platelets; this was very suggestive of a consumptive process. Hematology was consulted and per their recommendations steroids were started. After initiation of systemic IV medrol platelet count began to rise. Per our hematology team, most likely culprit is the COVID vaccine. Patient had no medication changes, had been stable in his chronic conditions, and had never had any autoimmune or thrombocytopenic event before this time.

                                                Patient began experiencing back pain on March 14 and on or around March 18 he started coughing up blood clots according to a coworker.  Patient lived alone and was unable to be reached on Sunday March 21.  I went over to his house and found him deceased in his bed.  Patient had a trashcan beside his bed and it appeared to have some blood in it. Patient had thick mucus coming out of his mouth and blood coming out of his nose.  According to paramedics he had passed a few hours before finding him.  Unfortunately Patient has been cremated so there is no way to say that this was related to the Covid 19 shot from Johnson and Johnson, however there are new reports that blood clots have been a side effect. I would like to speak with someone from the Department of Health to discuss this further.  I feel this could be related to the vaccination and I would to know how long the Health Department knew about this possible side effect.  If patient would have known sooner that the blood clots were a side effect I feel he would have gone to the Emergency Room.  Patient had no health insurance and he was trying to prevent getting Covid.   This has caused our family so much heartache and we are all very apprehensive about getting the Covid Vaccine ourselves.  Please contact me as soon as possible, I am also patient&#39;s  executor so I am able to speak to you on behalf of patient and our family. Thank you.

At approximately 6:55 pm that same day (Saturday, April 10, 2021) my husband collapsed in our living room.  I called 911 and the operator talked me through how to do chest compression CPR on my husband until the paramedics arrived.  My husband was then taken by ambulance to hospital where doctor performed an emergency procedure wherein he removed the blood clot in one of my husband&#39;s stints (he has three) that he had put in in 2017. Doctor was able to eventually stabilize my husband&#39;s heart.  My husband spent 5 days in the hospital as a result of this.

He then on the 9th day had extreme intercostal pain in the ribs on the right side and his right shoulder extremely painful, low grade fever, chills, fatigue and inability to draw a full breath.  He called the doctor and they were on the way to the clinic they told him to go to the ER based on his symptoms.  He went to the ER and they admitted him and did blood work, and then did a chest x-ray, then a chest CT scan and it was positive for pulmonary embolism.  He was treated with an anti-inflammatory through the IV and a blood thinner to the stomach.  He was hospitalized for 1 full day, and discharged home with Eliquis double dose for 14 days and then a single dose until further notice.    He is still having fatigue and aches on the right side of his brain and aches in his feet, but is to see a pulmonologist for his lungs, as it will take up to 6 months for it to resolve.  He also has damage to the right side of the heart and lung.  Is waiting to get a CT of the brain.

                                                I started to get a weird feeling in my chest a week after the vaccine. It was a burning sensation and I thought it was vaping at first. It started to get worse and worse. A week later I went to the ER and they ran some tests. After testing it was confirmed that I was having a heart attack. I had blot clot in my OM1discovered on 04/07/2021. I had had an angiogram in 2019 and there were no problems then. I was hospitalized for four days and I was given a Stent which ended up getting a blood clot. The original Stent was removed and a larger one was put in. I am now taking some blood thinners, Aspirin, Atorvastatin, Carvedilol 6mg, Prasugrel 10mg, and I am scheduled to see a cardiologist because I still a have a little chest pain.

                                                On Jan. 26, 2021, I had an accident at home an suffered  broken ankle, tibia and fibula broken from tarsus.  I was rushed to hospital and had ORIF surgery.  I later found out the surgeons failed to order blood thinners and about a month later, I was rushed to the hospital with 5 blood clots, one in each lobe or each lung and one forming in the calf muscle on the left leg.  I have been taking Eliquis since late February and will be on it through May.  I have had an echocardiogram which was normal but the doppler I had on my legs may have indicated the problem is still on-going.  I don&#39;t know yet.  I did contract JCCT to ask if I should get checked out due to recent clotting incidents and was told I did not.  I decided I should report it anyway and my clotting situation probably has nothing to do with vaccine but I just want to make sure.

                                                Patient received vaccine on 3/13, initially had fatigue and myalgia the day after, which resolved, but also on 3/14 began having mild intermittent coughing, nonproductive, occurring every two hours or less. Patient began having some blood in his sputum since this morning at 4AM, and that occurred twice more with intervals of a few hours, both continuously improving and less blood. No other symptoms. No history of TB, no exposure to sick contacts, no recent travel. Unlikely a pulmonary embolus given normal vital signs and no risk factors. Patient was doing outdoor work in his yard for the past few days before the symptom onset and was working on mulch and compost. Although unlikely to have fungal infection currently, may be bacterial pneumonia

                                                Patient received his J&amp;J vaccine for COVID-19 on 03/10/2021.  On 3/17, he was at the grocery store when he felt a sting on his left lateral ankle. When he pulled up his pant leg, he saw the small little red spots that were exquisitely tender. He went immediately to his primary care physician&#39;s office, where he was prescribed Bactrim for suspected cellulitis. The rash steadily worsened with extension up his left leg and onto his right leg and blistering of some of the lesions most markedly in his groin. Pain associated with the rash increased and remained most severe on the lateral aspect of the left ankle. He presented back to his primary care physician&#39;s office on 3/19, where he was given methylprednisolone 80 milligrams IV, discharged with a prescription for prednisone 60 milligrams daily for the next few days. Pain worsened the morning of 3/20/21 to the point that he was unable to bear much weight on the left leg prompting his presentation to the emergency department.

                                                I spoke to patient by phone on Saturday morning around 9:20am. He was concerned about the fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, and muscle aches he had the night before. He felt better when I spoke to him. He wanted to know when those side effects would go away finally. Since I had the Moderna vaccine I said 24 to 36 hours. But I didn&#39;t know about the J&amp;J vaccine. We disconnect the call at 9:40am Saturday morning. After the call at some point he fixed lunch or dinner and stopped eating before finishing his meal. He had left the food on the table and in the pans he fixed it in. Very unusual for him.  The patient then went to his room where is was found Monday 3/22/21 around noon in his bed laying on his chest (he hated to lie on his chest) by the police and the HR officer from his work.   The HR officer had called my other brother around 11:15am on 3/22 /21 to ask if we had heard from the patient because he had not reported to work or phoned in. He has passed sometime between noon on Saturday till Sunday evening alone at his residence. He had towels and a trash can beside his bed when he was found.  The coroner call it death by natural causes and would not do an autopsy when even asked by his PCP.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and congestive heart failure, presents with shortness of breath that started on Friday and worsened significantly this morning.  He does have some chest discomfort with this.  No fevers, chills, or other complaints.  Discharge Diagnoses   1. Hypertensive emergency, 04/13/2021  2. Chest discomfort, 04/14/2021  3. Heart failure, systolic, 04/13/2021  Assessment and Plan 65M w/ HTN and HFrEF p/w hypoxic respiratory failure i/s/o a hypertensive emergency. BP and respiratory status much improved, admitted to CCU for acute BP management and medication titration.   #HTN Emergency Likely precipitated by lack of medication non-adherence since 04/11, when he ran out of his medications. SBP approx 220 at time of presentation, good response to enalapril and nitro gtt. Decreased work of breathing with Bi-pap. MAP 130-140 on presentation, will attempt to lower by 20-25% in first 2-6hrs w/ MAP goal of approx 100, while aiming towards normotensive in next 24-48 hrs while transitioning from IV to PO meds. -TTE ordered -cont incremental BP mgmt:  -goal MAP &lt; 110    -prn hydralazine  -gradual goal towards normotensive over next 24-48hrs thereafter -cardiac monitor -will ensure that patient has anti-hypertensives prior to DC -q4hr neuro checks  #Acute Hypoxic and Hypercapnic respiratory failure  Decreased work of breathing with Bi-pap. Likely related to HTN emergency as above in addition to moderate-severe volume overload as seen on CXR. VBG in am of 4/13 showed pH 7.17, pCO2 64, pO2 58, bicarb 24. -cont Bi-pap, will wean as tolerable  -repeat VBG this am for resp acidosis  #HFrEF w/ acute exacerbation Last echo 04/14/2017, LVEF 38%, cxr on admission shows moderate-severe volume overload. -TTE ordered on 4/13 -may consider additional diuresis, given furosemide in ED on presentation, mindful of BP -goal net negative 1-2L/24hrs as pressures permit -daily standing weights -fluid and sodium restriction when off Bi-Pap  #NSTEMI Likely type II given HTN emergency, did have chest pain on presentation which was relieved with BP control. -trend trops until flat, next at 08:00  #type II DM Hgb A1c 7.5% on 4/13, mild hyperglycemia on presentation -SSI  #polycythemia Could be indicative of undiagnosed OSA vs manifestation of heart failure. Additionally, hemoconcentration from CHF i/s/o HTN emergency is another possibility. -TTE as above -ctm w/ am labs  #lymphocytosis Afebrile, no urinary symptoms. Hypoxic on presentation, likely related to edema i/s/o HTN emergency as above. No suspicion for infectious etiology at this time, no white count. -ctm w/ am labs  #HLD -cont statin  #QTC prolongation 561 on 4/13/2021 -avoid QTc prolonging medications

                                                Suspected pneumonitis.  Patient presented on day following vaccination as shortness of breath, nausea, and diarrhea were not abating with home management. They had started later in the day after the vaccination.  At ER admission - SpO2 = 80% room air. Nasal cannula was applied and SpO2 recovered quickly.  BNP was elevated so acute exacerbation of heart failure was suspected and treated. However, patient did not improve with diuresis.  Viral workup and bacterial cause workup negative. No acute cardiac events discovered. Patient continued to decline. Transferred to ICU on 3-19-21 to use BiPAP with 65% FiO2 and able to take breaks to 15L nasal cannula. Borderline blood pressures at this time.  Infectious disease, pulmonology, cardiology, nephrology, and critical care anesthesia services evaluated and ruled out multiple possible diagnoses and patient continued to decline.  Diagnostic bronchoscopy on 3-22-21 with BAL lead to patient ventilator dependent with profound hypotension.  Aggressive ICU management ensued.  Bronchoscopy very clean with no real secretions - in line with CT evidence of pneumonitis.  Despite aggressive care and maximized pressor support, patient expired on 3-29-21 when family chose to withdraw care as blood pressure declined again.

He received the J&amp;J vaccination at noon by local public health nurse on Mon 4/12/21. The patient&#39;s wife, reported to hospice team that he had been sleepy during the day and had received a dose of Ativan  earlier that morning (PRN medication at 0750). The primary hospice nurse reported wife noted he became more lethargic throughout the day after vaccination with his condition worsening at 1720; at that time his blood sugar levels were noted to be low at &#34;47&#34; but patient was alert enough to drink orange juice, eat ice cream. The patient continued to deteriorate so MD was consulted and he was transported to the ED where he later expired at 1930.

                                                Brief HPI and Hospital Course: 67 year old male with unknown past medical history was brought in by EMS as post-cardiac arrest. Patient was found on unresponsive on sidewalk, possible collapse. ACLS started by EMS, approx 10-15 minutes. Initial rhythm was junctional PEA. Was given 2 epi and intubated by EMS and had ROSC, Initial ROSC rhythm was SVT which slowed to 90s on its own. On arrival to ED, left femoral central line placed. Tox screen was positive for cocaine and ETOH. Was placed on ACS protocol for possible NSTEMI. Tested positive for COVID19 on admission. Patient required pressor support on admission. Hypothermia protocol was initiated.  Patient was rewarmed per protocol, normothermic as of 5/5.    Brief Narrative of Events leading to Patient&#39;s Death: Patient remained normothermic with persistent septic shock, multi organ failure, ARDS secondary to COVID19. Multiple attempts to reach family members made by ICU team and palliative care team daily without answer. Patient made DNR by two-physician consent. Patient&#39;s BP low despite maximum levophed support.

                                                I didn&#39;t have pain in the arm, after an hour I had a slight headache. The headache lasted about a day. After the 3-4 day I had serve diarrhea and stopped taking my supplements. It stopped for a couple days then came back for a day. I had no headache or pain, just 3 bad episodes of diarrhea. On March 24th I went into the Hospital with severe pain in my lower left back side. I thought I was passing a kidney side, with the pain I was having. When I got there they did a CT scan and blood work and it wasn&#39;t kidney stone but I had a blood clot on the lower left side of lung and the right side as well. They immediate put me on blood thinners. I was there for a day and a night. They released and put me on medication.  I&#39;ve had minor pain but nothing like the pain I had before. I have since followed up with a Pomologist and PCP. Pulmonologist said I had blood clots but couldn&#39;t give me a cause. My PCP said she thought I had or have Covid. I asked to have my blood drawn and she said it was too late for that because I had taken the vaccine already.

The patient&#39;s weight was 250 pounds and was obese (body mass index 40) and sedentary. His height was not provided. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure, and 2 gout attacks in the last 8 months. The last gout attack was 2 weeks ago in the left foot. There was no history of clots or atrial fibrillation. He had a strong family history of thrombosis: his father had 2 episodes of deep vein thrombosis and his mother had a pulmonary embolism. No testing to identify any familial clotting issues have been performed. The patient developed a cough starting 29-MAR-2021 and, prior to vaccination, took a COVID-19 test on 31-MAR-2021 which was negative. On 02-APR-2021 a rapid COVID-19 test also came back negative.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 043A21A, and expiry: UNKNOWN) on 02-APR-2021 at approximately 19:00 in the left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and losartan for high blood pressure. On 03-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s cough persisted but had not worsened and he developed pain in the ribs on the right. His wife checked his pulse, which seemed fast and irregular. His respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute and his oxygen saturation with a home pulse oximeter was in the 70s. He was not in distress at the time. The patient called his physician and the doctor suggested to go to Emergency room. The patient went to Emergency room at approximately 10:00. An echocardiogram revealed a number of clots in the right ventricle which were &#34;bouncing all around&#34;. He was also found to be in atrial fibrillation which the doctors said was secondary to the ventricular clots. Unspecified tests revealed a saddle pulmonary embolus and a deep vein thrombosis on the left.  He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), blood clots in right ventricle and atrial fibrillation. Platelet count was not known by the reporter; it is unknown if  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were performed.  He underwent emergency surgery at 19:00, during which most of the ventricular clots and the pulmonary embolism were removed. He was placed on heparin after the surgery. He spent 5 days in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 2 additional days in the hospital. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 1 week and had recovered from the events of deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), atrial fibrillation, and blood clots in right ventricle.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The reporter did not believe that the covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s had caused deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), atrial fibrillation, and blood clot in right ventricle This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  a 68-year-old male experienced left deep vein thrombosis, saddle pulmonary embolism, right ventricular thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation, approximately 15 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 infection.  The patient has a history of hypertension, is obese (BMI 40) and has a strong family history of blood clots.  He tested negative for COVID 2 days before and the day of vaccine administration.  He developed a cough 4 days prior to vaccination. The morning after vaccination, he developed right rib pain; his heart rate was rapid and irregular, and oxygen saturation with home pulse oximeter was in the 70s.  Upon arrival in the emergency room, he was found to have clots in the right cardiac ventricle, a saddle pulmonary embolus, left deep vein thrombosis and new-onset atrial fibrillation.  He underwent surgery for removal of the ventricular clots and pulmonary embolism.  No laboratory details were provided.  Given the symptoms which pre-dated vaccine administration,  the short latency between the vaccine administration and the event, and multiple risk factors for embolism and thrombosis (family history, obesity, sedentary nature), the events are assessed as inconsistent with the causal association to immunization, per the WHO causality classification for adverse events following immunization. Therefore, company causality is considered not related to the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

By March 8th the swelling and pain in my left leg was so bad I made an appointment with Dr. for March 11th. He ordered another sonogram and found 2 DVTs in my left leg, and prescribed anti-coagulants whyich I am still on. At the time the Doctor said that this was most likly a result of having stood in line for 2&amp;1/2 hours.

                                                Came to ED on 4/15 with c/o anginal symptoms, found to be in rapid afib.  EKG showed ST elevation in later precordial leads, went for emergent left heart catheterization.  Went into V-fib arrest requiring defibrillation (x2) in addition to CPR in cath lab.  Angio showed acute thrombotic occlusions of LM, LAD and RI, underwent mechanical thrombectomy of LM and LAD with balloon angio of RI (recent cardiac cath in March 2020 showed clearly patent stents).  Placed on Impella bypass.   Currently in CVICU care, intubated with Impella.

                                                Pt received Covid-19 vaccine on 3/19 then presented to ED with fever and shortness of breath on 3/23 admitted to the hospital found to be COVID 19&#43; and requiring 2L oxygen via NC.   Treated with dexamethasone, remdesivir and empiric antibiotics.   Following admission, O2 requirement increased, received tocilizumab then required transfer to the ICU on 3/29.   On 3/31 developed right leg ischemia, underwent thrombectomy and heparin infusion then on 4/1 patient intubated due to increased need for respiratory support and had bilateral chest tubes placed, post-intubation course complicated by shock with AKI requiring pressor support, prolonged encephalolpathy.    On 4/24 with worsening shock, hypoxemic resp failure, AKI requiring pressors and CRRT with broad spectrum antibiotics and resumption of stress dose steroids, the family was transitioned to comfort measures and passed away on 4/29.

For about 5 minutes, I was unable to find words and properly communicate.  I went to the ER and was admitted and had a battery of tests, kept overnight, and discharged the following day  My statin dose was increased, and I was put on a baby aspirin, in addition to Pradaxa blood thinner.  i believe that I may have had a vascular thrombi related to the effect of the medicine/spike protein.

He presented to my office today acutely with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He has increased his prednisone at home recently and been increasing the frequency of his DuoNebs.  Despite this, he states that his oxygen saturations have been staying in the low 80s.  He has a hard time walking due to the shortness of breath.  He states previous to about a week ago he was doing very well.  He denies any fever.  He denies any known exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In the office today his oxygen saturations were 88% on 4 L. Because of his failure of outpatient therapy, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  This patient has a history of severe respiratory decompensation that happens very quickly.  Therefore, it is medically urgent we get him into the hospital.     3/25/21 Admission HPI71 y.o. male with a known history of severe COPD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He came to my office with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He had increased his oral steroids and breathing treatments at home and despite this was still having oxygen saturations in the low to mid 80s on 2-4 L of supplemental oxygen.  In my office he was extremely diminished and had basically failed outpatient therapy.  Therefore he was admitted to inpatient status for acute treatment of a severe COPD exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was admitted and treated with IV treatments.  He did recover nicely.  However, he was found to be extremely physically deconditioned.  Because of this he was thought to be an excellent candidate for swing bed and is being transitioned to swing bed.    4/5/21 ER Practitioner Note: Upon arrival to ED trauma room I found patient to be in cardiac arrest, CPR in progress. History is that EMS was called to the scene for a patient with chest pain.  Shortly after arrival at his home  patient developed a cardiac arrest.  They followed standard ACLS  protocol and the patient was intubated. Blood sugar normal. As CPR was given, medications were administered consisting of epinephrine and 1 mg in 2 different doses along with 1 amp of bicarb. IV access via an IO. Patient was then transported to the emergency department.  Upon arrival, CPR was continued and oxygen supplied via endotracheal tube with good tube placement verified by auscultation and good sat readings.  Monitor was placed and patient demonstrated initially a sinus rhythm but there was no pulse.  Therefore, diagnosis was PEA and no reversible causes were identified.  ACLS protocol was followed with epinephrine 1 mg IV every 5 min.  He received a total that including EMS, 5 mg of epinephrine and 1 amp of bicarb.  Monitor at this point revealed the rhythm changed to an agonal rhythm.  When CPR was given, there was good results from the CPR.  However, CPR discontinued and there is no pulse and patient had an agonal  rhythm for several minutes, pupils were fixed but not dilated year.  Lungs demonstrating clear bilateral breath sounds when he was bagged via the endotracheal tube.  No external signs of any trauma noted. The patient&#39;s sister is here and she is a registered nurse.  We had discussed management at this point with her and all were in agreement that the code be terminated.  At 1015, patient was pronounced deceased..    ACLS protocol was followed.  See nursing record for medication and vital sign details.   Code outcome: Deceased   CC time 20 minutes.

                                                Patient admitted 4/14/2021 to the ICU from ED.  Patient was experiencing hand weakness.  Patient given TPA as treatment for a potential stroke.  Patient with known stroke on CT imaging, unable to further verify with MRI imaging.  Upon further investigation/discussion with the patient, he reports receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine 10 days prior to admission.  Patient with known comorbidities which increase his risk of an embolitic stroke however with recent findings from the CDC, unsure if this needs to be further investigated.  Patient had 2 head CT scans, showing no intracranial abnormalities and MRI was unable to be completed due to patient&#39;s size. Neurology states high probability of stroke within their consult note. Patient&#39;s risk factors for stroke include: uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (LDL 132 on Crestor 40 mg daily PTA), hypertension (as high as 182/92 mmHg in ED), physical inactivity (BMI 76 kg/m^2), and male. Low suspicion of CVST based on patient&#39;s platelet count of 212 on admission and no abnormality on head CT. MRI would have been beneficial in potentially diagnosing CVST, as well.   Our recommendation is to submit this information to the VAERS database as a possible ADR from the vaccine. The patient fits the timing of an ADR, within 6-13 days of vaccine administration, and CDC recommends watching for neurological symptoms based on their most recent press release.

He asked to go the ER March 29th at 6:45am saying his chest hurt and was having a hard time breathing, this has happened before since having Covid in September.  I called 911 after he became dizzy and could not walk.  While at the ER suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed him from his nose down over a course of 3 days.  His brain stem was affected and he lost the ability to swallow.  After being on a ventilator for 72 hours he was removed from it and died less then 30 mins later from drowning in his own saliva on April 1, 2021.

                                                13th of April. I had a blood clot in my hand. My index finger on  my left hand was numb and black and blue all around the knuckle area and into my hand area. I went to my primary care - I went to the acute center there. She said the hand was cold and could see the black and blue. They put me on Plavix for 30 days and I haven&#39;t had any reoccurrence of that. I think it was the 21st, I couldn&#39;t sleep all night, I had a kidney stone - the pain was so bad I got nauseous - around my back and side and in my front. I didn&#39;t have a fever. I went to the doctor office and they checked urine - and said there was blood in the urine. I was prescribed - Tamsulosin HCL. They thought I had passed most of it by the time I got there.

                                                Deep Vein Thrombosis right leg.  Five days after being vaccinated I began to notice swelling in my right leg from my knee through my ankle-foot area.  There was an associated increase in pain in the knee.  I tried to shake it off hoping that the swelling and pain would go away, but I finally relented to the concerns of my family and sought care on the 6th of April at the emergency room because my doctor refused an in-person appointment.  The emergency room physician prescribed Eliquis which I have been taking.  The swelling seems to have leveled off, but my right leg still appears to be twice the size of my left leg
