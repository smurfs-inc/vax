                                                Roughly a week following vaccination he cut his hand and was unable to stop the bleeding. 2 days later he developed mucosal lesions inside his mouth which began to bleed without resolution. He also cut himself shaving with prolonged bleeding. Following this event his rehabilitation center performed a CBC and he was found to be profoundly thrombocytopenic with platelets of 7. He presented to hospital where he was transfused with platelets which did not resolve his thrombocytopenia. He was transfused 2 more units with immediate CBC followup which did not improve his platelets; this was very suggestive of a consumptive process. Hematology was consulted and per their recommendations steroids were started. After initiation of systemic IV medrol platelet count began to rise. Per our hematology team, most likely culprit is the COVID vaccine. Patient had no medication changes, had been stable in his chronic conditions, and had never had any autoimmune or thrombocytopenic event before this time.

Patient fainted and was moved to the floor in a lying position. EMS was called. Pharmacist took patient&#39;s blood pressure (148/94).  Patient was able to answer questions correctly when asked. EMS arrived and checked patient&#39;s vitals.  Patient declined EMS transport. Patient left to go home with wife and daughter. Pharmacist called daughter at 6pm to check on patient. Patient had a headache at that time. Will follow up with patient today.

                                                Patient began experiencing back pain on March 14 and on or around March 18 he started coughing up blood clots according to a coworker.  Patient lived alone and was unable to be reached on Sunday March 21.  I went over to his house and found him deceased in his bed.  Patient had a trashcan beside his bed and it appeared to have some blood in it. Patient had thick mucus coming out of his mouth and blood coming out of his nose.  According to paramedics he had passed a few hours before finding him.  Unfortunately Patient has been cremated so there is no way to say that this was related to the Covid 19 shot from Johnson and Johnson, however there are new reports that blood clots have been a side effect. I would like to speak with someone from the Department of Health to discuss this further.  I feel this could be related to the vaccination and I would to know how long the Health Department knew about this possible side effect.  If patient would have known sooner that the blood clots were a side effect I feel he would have gone to the Emergency Room.  Patient had no health insurance and he was trying to prevent getting Covid.   This has caused our family so much heartache and we are all very apprehensive about getting the Covid Vaccine ourselves.  Please contact me as soon as possible, I am also patient&#39;s  executor so I am able to speak to you on behalf of patient and our family. Thank you.

No difficulty breathing/swallow, thus gave water and gatorade. He was responsive to my questions. He has history of anxiety to needles and he did not eat lunch before vaccine. He stayed seated for 1 hour to monitor. Then, walked an aisle before driving home. Asked him to eat first before driving home. Called him twice and he is home and feeling okay. Counseled to call pharmacy if any symptoms of allergic reaction to vaccine.

As the evening wore on, weakness spread through the left side of body and speech began slurring. The next day, after no improvement, went to hospital to find from CT scan that he had suffered a stroke. He had no precursors that would lead to being prone to strokes.

                                                Patient passed out after receiving janssen covid-19 vaccine. There was no injection site reaction, no wheezing, or rash/hives. Patient had vision loss, dilated pupils, sweaty, unable focus or respond to use questions being asked, and  was having trouble hearing-said he had ringing in his ears. We were able to lay him on the floor without injuries-he did not fall. I was fanning him and we were talking to him. He got a little worse but then got better. When he was better, he said that he had passed out before when having blood taken. He did not mention this to me before the vaccine was administered. I do not feel that the Janssen COVID shot was the cause, I think he just passes out from injections or needles. We did call 911 when he was getting worse. By the time they got here, he was better but they did check him.

After speaking, his eyes then went closed, and he clenched his fists and he started coughing up liquid. He was not responsive. He was moved to the ground and turned on his side. He became alert about 3 minutes after becoming unresponsive. He claimed this happens to him when he is at doctor&#39;s offices or receiving vaccines/procedures. He claimed it was &#34;normal.&#34; He said he felt fine/normal, and this has happened in the past, though he did not mention this to the pharmacist prior to administration. 911 was called and examined him. He was allowed to go home on his own, did not go to the hospital.

                                                Patient received vaccine on 3/13, initially had fatigue and myalgia the day after, which resolved, but also on 3/14 began having mild intermittent coughing, nonproductive, occurring every two hours or less. Patient began having some blood in his sputum since this morning at 4AM, and that occurred twice more with intervals of a few hours, both continuously improving and less blood. No other symptoms. No history of TB, no exposure to sick contacts, no recent travel. Unlikely a pulmonary embolus given normal vital signs and no risk factors. Patient was doing outdoor work in his yard for the past few days before the symptom onset and was working on mulch and compost. Although unlikely to have fungal infection currently, may be bacterial pneumonia

                                                I spoke to patient by phone on Saturday morning around 9:20am. He was concerned about the fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, and muscle aches he had the night before. He felt better when I spoke to him. He wanted to know when those side effects would go away finally. Since I had the Moderna vaccine I said 24 to 36 hours. But I didn&#39;t know about the J&amp;J vaccine. We disconnect the call at 9:40am Saturday morning. After the call at some point he fixed lunch or dinner and stopped eating before finishing his meal. He had left the food on the table and in the pans he fixed it in. Very unusual for him.  The patient then went to his room where is was found Monday 3/22/21 around noon in his bed laying on his chest (he hated to lie on his chest) by the police and the HR officer from his work.   The HR officer had called my other brother around 11:15am on 3/22 /21 to ask if we had heard from the patient because he had not reported to work or phoned in. He has passed sometime between noon on Saturday till Sunday evening alone at his residence. He had towels and a trash can beside his bed when he was found.  The coroner call it death by natural causes and would not do an autopsy when even asked by his PCP.

During the night I woke up overheated and bathed in sweat. Got up to go to the bathroom for BM but was nauseous, feeling need to vomit at the same time. After BM I stood and still felt need to  do one or the other or both when I passed out. Wife came upstairs and found me sitting up against the corner wall. She was able to shake me awake while calling 911. I was groggy but aware I was still nauseous and  stayed down next to toilet until stomach settled. I came downstairs and EMTs arrived. Took blood pressure. Result was it was low. Took EKG and that was normal. Second  blood pressure test  showed that I rebounded.  When offered I felt it unnecessary to go to hospital.

                                                Suspected pneumonitis.  Patient presented on day following vaccination as shortness of breath, nausea, and diarrhea were not abating with home management. They had started later in the day after the vaccination.  At ER admission - SpO2 = 80% room air. Nasal cannula was applied and SpO2 recovered quickly.  BNP was elevated so acute exacerbation of heart failure was suspected and treated. However, patient did not improve with diuresis.  Viral workup and bacterial cause workup negative. No acute cardiac events discovered. Patient continued to decline. Transferred to ICU on 3-19-21 to use BiPAP with 65% FiO2 and able to take breaks to 15L nasal cannula. Borderline blood pressures at this time.  Infectious disease, pulmonology, cardiology, nephrology, and critical care anesthesia services evaluated and ruled out multiple possible diagnoses and patient continued to decline.  Diagnostic bronchoscopy on 3-22-21 with BAL lead to patient ventilator dependent with profound hypotension.  Aggressive ICU management ensued.  Bronchoscopy very clean with no real secretions - in line with CT evidence of pneumonitis.  Despite aggressive care and maximized pressor support, patient expired on 3-29-21 when family chose to withdraw care as blood pressure declined again.

He received the J&amp;J vaccination at noon by local public health nurse on Mon 4/12/21.

                                                I didn&#39;t have pain in the arm, after an hour I had a slight headache. The headache lasted about a day. After the 3-4 day I had serve diarrhea and stopped taking my supplements. It stopped for a couple days then came back for a day. I had no headache or pain, just 3 bad episodes of diarrhea. On March 24th I went into the Hospital with severe pain in my lower left back side. I thought I was passing a kidney side, with the pain I was having. When I got there they did a CT scan and blood work and it wasn&#39;t kidney stone but I had a blood clot on the lower left side of lung and the right side as well. They immediate put me on blood thinners. I was there for a day and a night. They released and put me on medication.  I&#39;ve had minor pain but nothing like the pain I had before. I have since followed up with a Pomologist and PCP. Pulmonologist said I had blood clots but couldn&#39;t give me a cause. My PCP said she thought I had or have Covid. I asked to have my blood drawn and she said it was too late for that because I had taken the vaccine already.

                                                DVT (LEFT CALF); PULMONARY EMBOLISM (BOTH LUNGS); ATRIAL FIBRILLATION; BLOOD CLOT IN RIGHT VENTRICLE; This spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient&#39;s wife) and concerned a 68 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 250 pounds and was obese (body mass index 40) and sedentary. His height was not provided. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure, and 2 gout attacks in the last 8 months. The last gout attack was 2 weeks ago in the left foot. There was no history of clots or atrial fibrillation. He had a strong family history of thrombosis: his father had 2 episodes of deep vein thrombosis and his mother had a pulmonary embolism. No testing to identify any familial clotting issues have been performed. The patient developed a cough starting 29-MAR-2021 and, prior to vaccination, took a COVID-19 test on 31-MAR-2021 which was negative. On 02-APR-2021 a rapid COVID-19 test also came back negative.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 043A21A, and expiry: UNKNOWN) on 02-APR-2021 at approximately 19:00 in the left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and losartan for high blood pressure. On 03-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s cough persisted but had not worsened and he developed pain in the ribs on the right. His wife checked his pulse, which seemed fast and irregular. His respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute and his oxygen saturation with a home pulse oximeter was in the 70s. He was not in distress at the time. The patient called his physician and the doctor suggested to go to Emergency room. The patient went to Emergency room at approximately 10:00. An echocardiogram revealed a number of clots in the right ventricle which were &#34;bouncing all around&#34;. He was also found to be in atrial fibrillation which the doctors said was secondary to the ventricular clots. Unspecified tests revealed a saddle pulmonary embolus and a deep vein thrombosis on the left.  He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), blood clots in right ventricle and atrial fibrillation. Platelet count was not known by the reporter; it is unknown if  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were performed.  He underwent emergency surgery at 19:00, during which most of the ventricular clots and the pulmonary embolism were removed. He was placed on heparin after the surgery. He spent 5 days in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 2 additional days in the hospital. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 1 week and had recovered from the events of deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), atrial fibrillation, and blood clots in right ventricle.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The reporter did not believe that the covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s had caused deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), atrial fibrillation, and blood clot in right ventricle This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  a 68-year-old male experienced left deep vein thrombosis, saddle pulmonary embolism, right ventricular thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation, approximately 15 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 infection.  The patient has a history of hypertension, is obese (BMI 40) and has a strong family history of blood clots.  He tested negative for COVID 2 days before and the day of vaccine administration.  He developed a cough 4 days prior to vaccination. The morning after vaccination, he developed right rib pain; his heart rate was rapid and irregular, and oxygen saturation with home pulse oximeter was in the 70s.  Upon arrival in the emergency room, he was found to have clots in the right cardiac ventricle, a saddle pulmonary embolus, left deep vein thrombosis and new-onset atrial fibrillation.  He underwent surgery for removal of the ventricular clots and pulmonary embolism.  No laboratory details were provided.  Given the symptoms which pre-dated vaccine administration,  the short latency between the vaccine administration and the event, and multiple risk factors for embolism and thrombosis (family history, obesity, sedentary nature), the events are assessed as inconsistent with the causal association to immunization, per the WHO causality classification for adverse events following immunization. Therefore, company causality is considered not related to the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                3/22/21 Admission HPI: 71 y.o. male with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and COPD.  He presented to my office today acutely with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He has increased his prednisone at home recently and been increasing the frequency of his DuoNebs.  Despite this, he states that his oxygen saturations have been staying in the low 80s.  He has a hard time walking due to the shortness of breath.  He states previous to about a week ago he was doing very well.  He denies any fever.  He denies any known exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In the office today his oxygen saturations were 88% on 4 L. Because of his failure of outpatient therapy, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  This patient has a history of severe respiratory decompensation that happens very quickly.  Therefore, it is medically urgent we get him into the hospital.     3/25/21 Admission HPI71 y.o. male with a known history of severe COPD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He came to my office with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He had increased his oral steroids and breathing treatments at home and despite this was still having oxygen saturations in the low to mid 80s on 2-4 L of supplemental oxygen.  In my office he was extremely diminished and had basically failed outpatient therapy.  Therefore he was admitted to inpatient status for acute treatment of a severe COPD exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was admitted and treated with IV treatments.  He did recover nicely.  However, he was found to be extremely physically deconditioned.  Because of this he was thought to be an excellent candidate for swing bed and is being transitioned to swing bed.    4/5/21 ER Practitioner Note: Upon arrival to ED trauma room I found patient to be in cardiac arrest, CPR in progress. History is that EMS was called to the scene for a patient with chest pain.  Shortly after arrival at his home  patient developed a cardiac arrest.  They followed standard ACLS  protocol and the patient was intubated. Blood sugar normal. As CPR was given, medications were administered consisting of epinephrine and 1 mg in 2 different doses along with 1 amp of bicarb. IV access via an IO. Patient was then transported to the emergency department.  Upon arrival, CPR was continued and oxygen supplied via endotracheal tube with good tube placement verified by auscultation and good sat readings.  Monitor was placed and patient demonstrated initially a sinus rhythm but there was no pulse.  Therefore, diagnosis was PEA and no reversible causes were identified.  ACLS protocol was followed with epinephrine 1 mg IV every 5 min.  He received a total that including EMS, 5 mg of epinephrine and 1 amp of bicarb.  Monitor at this point revealed the rhythm changed to an agonal rhythm.  When CPR was given, there was good results from the CPR.  However, CPR discontinued and there is no pulse and patient had an agonal  rhythm for several minutes, pupils were fixed but not dilated year.  Lungs demonstrating clear bilateral breath sounds when he was bagged via the endotracheal tube.  No external signs of any trauma noted. The patient&#39;s sister is here and she is a registered nurse.  We had discussed management at this point with her and all were in agreement that the code be terminated.  At 1015, patient was pronounced deceased..    ACLS protocol was followed.  See nursing record for medication and vital sign details.   Code outcome: Deceased   CC time 20 minutes.

                                                My father received his shot on March 13, 2021.  He drove to move home and on March 28th started having his right arm go numb but did not tell us.  He asked to go the ER March 29th at 6:45am saying his chest hurt and was having a hard time breathing, this has happened before since having Covid in September.  I called 911 after he became dizzy and could not walk.  While at the ER suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed him from his nose down over a course of 3 days.  His brain stem was affected and he lost the ability to swallow.  After being on a ventilator for 72 hours he was removed from it and died less then 30 mins later from drowning in his own saliva on April 1, 2021.
