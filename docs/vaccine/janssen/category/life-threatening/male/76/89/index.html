It got to the point within 2 weeks that he was not able to get up from the chair due to the shortness of breath.  By 4/1/21 he was not able to breath very well, but continued to stay home.  Then by 4/12/21 he was not able to breath well at all and his wife took him to the ER.  In the hospital they did x-rays and found out that his lungs are full of blood clots and both legs have blood clots in them.  He was admitted and gave him Heparin drip for the 2 days to get the blood clots dissolved and was also on oxygen for 2 days.  He was discharged home yesterday with Xarelto, and was told that he would be on that for the rest of his life, and is on oxygen for sleep and when he&#39;s up and around, but if he&#39;s resting and feels he&#39;s breathing okay he can remove it.   They informed him that it would take approximately 2 months for all the blood clots to dissipate, and that he was full of blood clots, and had both legs and both lungs which are quite full.

XR CHEST 2 VIEWS (PA AND LATERAL), TRANSTHORACIC ECHO (TTE) ADULT NON CONGENITAL, EKG 12-LEAD completed. given cefTRIAXone (ROCEPHIN-Equivalent) injection 1,000mg IM, and doxycycline monohydrate (MONODOX) 100 mg capsule  PO.  was evaluated in ED 4/5/21  CT Abdomen Pelvis with IV Contrast  Final Result  1. Positive for extensive acute bilateral pulmonary emboli at the lung bases as  detailed in the body of the report.  DX Chest Portable 1 View  Final Result  Mild left ventricular prominence is noted. Small right pleural  effusion is seen. Minimal discoid atelectatic changes in the left perihilar  region and left lung base. Elevated right hemidiaphragm suggests eventration.   Admitted to Hospital 4/5/21, per admission diagnosis: Acute pulmonary embolism (*) submassive likely secondary to covid 19  Per hospital course notes:Patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was show to have submassive PE with severe pulmonary hypertension seen on TTE. He should be on lifelong therapy given 2nd VTE and severity.  Iwould consider unprovoked (COVID in 11/20 wouldn&#39;t count I wouldn&#39;t think).  He was started on eliquis 10 mg BID x 7 days than 5 mg bid. Given his severe pulm htn on TTE, left atrial pressure normal.  We would have outpatient sleep study as well He will need VQ scan to assure no CTEPH. Will have outpatient follow up. We discontinued his aspirin on discharge as well.

                                                I received the Johnson and Johnson/Janssen Covid-19 vaccine at the vaccination pod on Thursday, April 8th, 2021 (04-08-2021) at around 12:45 pm.  The next morning, Friday, April 9th, 2021 (04-09-2021), I woke up around 9:30 am and felt fine at first.  But after taking a drink of water, I felt nauseous.  I also had a pressure sensation in the center of my chest below my collarbone.  After contacting my doctor&#39;s office, my family called 911 at around 11:40 am to have the emergency squad take me to the hospital to be evaluated for a heart attack.  At the hospital, I was diagnosed with an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction.  I was taken to the catheterization lab for a heart catheterization and a stent was placed in my left anterior descending artery (LAD).  I was admitted to the hospital on Friday, April 9th, 2021 (04-09-2021) and discharged from the hospital on Saturday, April 10th, 2021 (04-10-2021).

Pt with history of bladder cancer (s/p TURBT 11/04/2020), COPD (quit smoking 1 month ago) on 2 L nocturnal O2, HTN, CAD, MI s/p CABG x3v, apical cardiac aneurysm s/p repair, recent hematuria requiring cessation of chronic warfarin therapy who presented on 2/14 as a direct admission for evaluation of NSTEMI and new LLE DVT. He was initially placed on heparin and was stopped due to anemia and hematuria. DVT at outside hospital, repeat dopplers negative at our institution. Acute R femoral DVT likely due to patient being taken off chronic anticoagulation with warfarin. Discussed case with heme and not needed for IVC filter......and even though cardiology would like him on long-term AC given high risk for LV thrombus, bleed risk outweigh benefit at this point. He was diagnosed with new HFrEF and NSTEMI. He will stay on hydralazine, imdur, lasix every other day, baby asa, and statin.

                                                Patient caregiver reports that he woke up at 2 a.m. the morning after the vaccine unable to hold his urine which is unusual for him.  He also reported extreme acid reflux symptoms whenever he attempted to drink any fluids at that time as well as nausea.  This progressed to difficulty breathing at which time the caregiver was alerted and checked his blood pressure.  This reading was 88/55 according to the caregiver and the pulse was very high as well but the actual number could not be remembered.  The difficulty breathing prompted them to alert emergency medical services where he was picked up and transported to the emergency room via ambulance shortly after for evaluation.

IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF NEEDLE AFTER INJECTION, THE PATIENT APPEARED TO FAINT FALLING FORWARD IN HIS OWN LAP. AFTER ABOUT 15 TO 30 SECONDS, HE REGAINED CONSCIOUS. WE ASSESSED THE PATIENT TO ASK IF HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED FAINTING BEFORE  OR SPECIFICALLY DURING VACCINATION. HE HAD NO PREVIOUS EPISODES. WE QUICKLY OFFERED THE PATIENT SOME WATER AND CRACKERS WHILE HE REMAINED SEATED. THE PATIENT FELL FORWARD AGAIN AND APPEARED TO BE CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, MY PARTNER STEPPED AWAY TO RETRIEVE WATER, AND THE PATIENT ONCE AGAIN FELL FORWARD AND BEGAN CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, HE DRANK SOME WATER AND ATE SOME CRACKERS. HE MENTIONED THAT HE FELT EXTREMELY TIRED. WE INSISTED TO CALL THE PARAMEDICS FOR HELP,BUT HE DECLINED SAYING THAT HE WAS OK AND MAYBE THE NEEDLE TRIGGERED THE EVENT. AFTER WE OBSERVED THE PATIENT FOR 30 MINUTES AND HE ASSURED US HE WAS IN STABLE CONDITION, HE LEFT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. PATIENT WAS CALLED TWICE AFTER THE EVENT TO FOLLOW-UP BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD SUCCESS IN FOLLOW-UP.
