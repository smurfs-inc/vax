She heard a loud thud from the bathroom around 8 AM and the patient was found by his mother having generalized convulsions (bilateral upper and lower extremities) and he appeared to be foaming at the mouth.  He did not respond to her and she called 911. The seizure stopped by the time EMS arrived and his initial GCS was 12, and 15 by the time they started transport.  He had another seizure en route around 9:30 AM and was given 2.5 mg versed and required bagging. Patient was loaded with Keppra and now has been on maintenance Keppra. Patient has not suffered any additional seizures and is currently undergoing an extensive workup by inpatient neurology team. Vaccine adverse effect currently remains on the differential for inciting event leading to seizure however additional labs are pending to rule out other causes (eg. viruses causing PML).  Patient was also diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and started on antibiotics at time of admission.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.
