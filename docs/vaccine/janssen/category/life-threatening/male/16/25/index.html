                                                Patient received vaccine in the AM of 3/16/21.  Patient was in his usual state of health when he went to bed the evening of 3/16/21.  He ate dinner normally and his PD was started as usual.  There were no overnight complications with his PD and he got up shortly before 8 AM.  Mom reports the dialysate from his bag was clear and normal and none of his dwell was retained.  She heard a loud thud from the bathroom around 8 AM and the patient was found by his mother having generalized convulsions (bilateral upper and lower extremities) and he appeared to be foaming at the mouth.  He did not respond to her and she called 911. The seizure stopped by the time EMS arrived and his initial GCS was 12, and 15 by the time they started transport.  He had another seizure en route around 9:30 AM and was given 2.5 mg versed and required bagging. Patient was loaded with Keppra and now has been on maintenance Keppra. Patient has not suffered any additional seizures and is currently undergoing an extensive workup by inpatient neurology team. Vaccine adverse effect currently remains on the differential for inciting event leading to seizure however additional labs are pending to rule out other causes (eg. viruses causing PML).  Patient was also diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and started on antibiotics at time of admission.

It was further reported that he could not breath, his lips and face started to swell and then he passed out. The patient was taken to ER (emergency room) and his doctor gave him EpiPen (epinephrine) shot, Medrol (methylprednisolone), Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) and IV (intravenous) fluids. The patient&#39;s lips were drooping to the right side of his face even after taking the medications. The patient stayed at the ER for 6 or 7 hours then was sent back to home on the same day. On 15-APR-2021 (reported as Saturday), the patient had fever.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.

                                                Patient came to Pharmacy today for his J&amp;J vaccine along with his wife who also received her vaccine as well. After I administered the vaccine, the patient got light headed and I asked him if he would like to lay down. Before he could respond, the patient collapsed off his chair hitting the side of the plastic trash bin in our patient care room. I caught him before he hit the ground. I asked if he could hear me after saying his name a few times, no response. I assessed his subjective vitals and could tell he stopped breathing. Called for Pharmacy resident to grab and administer an epi pen. Patient responded within 30 seconds of epi pen administration and started breathing again. Proceeded to call emergency services, first responders arrived within 5 minutes and administered IV fluids and oral ondansetron. Patient left with the ambulance and will follow up tomorrow to make sure everything is ok.
