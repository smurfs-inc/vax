                                                Patient received vaccine in the AM of 3/16/21.  Patient was in his usual state of health when he went to bed the evening of 3/16/21.  He ate dinner normally and his PD was started as usual.  There were no overnight complications with his PD and he got up shortly before 8 AM.  Mom reports the dialysate from his bag was clear and normal and none of his dwell was retained.  She heard a loud thud from the bathroom around 8 AM and the patient was found by his mother having generalized convulsions (bilateral upper and lower extremities) and he appeared to be foaming at the mouth.  He did not respond to her and she called 911. The seizure stopped by the time EMS arrived and his initial GCS was 12, and 15 by the time they started transport.  He had another seizure en route around 9:30 AM and was given 2.5 mg versed and required bagging. Patient was loaded with Keppra and now has been on maintenance Keppra. Patient has not suffered any additional seizures and is currently undergoing an extensive workup by inpatient neurology team. Vaccine adverse effect currently remains on the differential for inciting event leading to seizure however additional labs are pending to rule out other causes (eg. viruses causing PML).  Patient was also diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and started on antibiotics at time of admission.

As I was running to him pt started slipping out of his chair, as a women, who I later found out was his mother and I helped keep pt in chair as he fainted and then seized for about 2 seconds and then gained consciousness. Upon awakening pt said , what  just happened?&#34; The mother answered &#34;oh you just had a little seizure, you&#39;re fine.&#34; To my surprise, I asked the mother is this has happened before and she said yes when he sees needles/get shots.  I told them the ambulance was on it&#39;s why and the mother asked &#34;why?!&#34; I told her because your son just fainted/had a seizure and we want to make sure he is ok.  The pt refused to go to the hospital.  I did go back out there and mentioned to them that it is very important to answer questions truthfully any time they are asked as they failed to honestly answer our questions about ever feeling faint after receiving a vaccine. His blood pressure normalized and once the paramedics left so did they.

                                                I got the injection then went and sat down in a chair at the back of the room and started getting light-headed about 3 minutes after I sat down, so I called a nurse over. Then the inside of my chest started getting really hot and my vision started going white in both of my eyes, it took about 10 seconds for me to completely lose vision. Then I passed out, I have no idea how long I was out for but when I came too I had a sort of epileptic-type seizure but I do not know how long it lasted. I woke up completely disoriented, had no idea where I was at and had a severe cognitive dysfunction. I still have moments where I just can&#39;t follow or complete a thought or just kind of go blank.

                                                Two minutes after the vaccination, PT walked up to the counter and said he feels dizzy.  I asked him to sit down and started walking around the counter to check on him and check his blood pressure. At that moment he fainted and lost consciousness. Another patient caught his head and he did not hit his head. He remained unconscious for 30 seconds and we were preparing to start CPR breaths as he had a pulse but was not breathing.  His eyelids were fluttering.  He regained consciousness at that time and we waited with him until EMS arrived. His blood sugar was very low when EMS arrived.

As I approach, patient was coming to as he was peeing himself. Patient reported that he felt lightheaded and then did not realize what happened. Gave patient some water and took his blood pressure. His DBP was a little low around 49. Had the patient sit there for another 15 minutes and took blood pressure again and it was 104/60.

He had his eyes open but was unconscious for about 1 minute. Then he released his bladder and peed on himself. The pharmacist noticed and came over then he responded and was consious again. Then he began to sweat excessively all over his body. His face turned pale and the pharmacist began taking his blood pressure which dropped very low. He then began to feel nauseated. Then he started to get body chills. We monitored my husband there for another 30min and he slowly was coming back to his normal self. He had a small headache but was fine enough to leave.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.
