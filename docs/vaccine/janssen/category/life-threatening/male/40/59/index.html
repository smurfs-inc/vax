                                                I started to feel really tired around 7:30pm and got a head ache so I went to bed early. I couldn&#39;t sleep well because I got the chills and a fever. I went to use the bathroom around 3am. All of a sudden I got really nauseous, the room spun, everything went black and I fainted in the middle of my bathroom. My wife woke up and helped me back to bed. The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

                                                Approximately seven minutes after the patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine, he had called out to his wife/pharmacy technician at the pharmacy stating he did not feel well.  His head had fallen back and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Patient had saliva starting to foam at the corner of his mouth and it appeared to be the onset of a mild seizure (per wife, patient has had seizure once before after a head injury) and he was turning very pale. Patient seemed to be unresponsive at that time - not answering to questions. At this point, one of the pharmacists ran to the clinic to get help and the other pharmacist administered an Epi-pen to patient&#39;s thigh.  Patient immediately came around after the injection, looked up and began talking. Staff called 911 and patient was monitored by pharmacy and clinic staff.  When the paramedics arrived, the patient was doing better and was able to ride home with his wife.

Roughly 5 minutes after administration of the vaccine, the lady who accompanied the patient got the attention of the pharmacist.  Pharmacist ran out to assess patient and saw that he seemed unresponsive. Pharmacist then called for an EPIPEN, but pt woke up before the EPIPEN was ready.  No EPIPEN was given.  We then monitored the patient&#39;s BP every 10 minutes or so. Pt stablized after roughly 45 minutes to an hour and then left the store.

                                                Around 8pm I became very cold and tired. I took a bath, which is out of character, and tried to sleep. By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

Within about 5-10 minutes his girlfriend comes to the pharmacy window and tells me he&#39;s feeling bad.  By the time I get to his chair he is very lethargic and slumped over.  I sit him up in the chair and his head rolls back and his eyes have rolled back in his head.   I place him on the floor and instructed my staff to call 911.   The patient presented with sweats and was unresponsive for about 10-20 seconds.   When he came to he asked how he got on the floor.   The patient never had any trouble breathing  heart rate was steady the entire time.   When EMS arrived they checked him out and was fine.  He refused transport to the hospital.  He walked out of the store after about 30 minutes from the point of his passing out.

                                                Heart attack after J&amp;J vaccine -   My husband, complained of on and off chest/lung discomfort after two days getting the vaccine. This continued for about 3-3.5 weeks. On the night of Apr 16, he went to bed early not feeling well. Next morning he complained of heaviness in the chest area. We immediately consulted Dr., and mentioned that he got the vaccine. Dr. advised us to immediately go to an Emergency Room. Patient was found to be having a heart attack. His right artery was 100% blocked. The 3 left arteries had no blockage at all. Angioplasty was done and he had a stent placed in right artery. The clot was removed as part of angioplasty. He now needs to be on blood thinners for life.

The EMTs arrived and were able to revive him in the ambulance. When they reached the hospital he was put on life support.  After he coded again in the Emergency room they told me he was without oxygen for too long and was taken off the respirator. He passed away at 4:10 PM.

                                                Patient was scheduled for an appointment for a Johnson &amp;Johnson  covid-19 vaccine through a drive thru Thursday April 8, 2021 @12:45pm. We arrived early and he received the vaccine at 12:15pm, waited 30 minutes for reaction and he was feeling fine. Later that same evening, the patient was driving to work on the freeway when he felt a dry throat so he coughed hard, at that cough he felt a massive pain in his head, like his &#34;head was going to explode.&#34; He immediately had tunnel vision closing in on him, so he pulled over and later woke up in our parked car with flashing emergency lights on, parked on the shoulder of the freeway. Disoriented and confused why he was there, he looked at his watch and saw he lost 15 minutes when he had passed out. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF HE HAD NOT PULLED HIMSELF OVER WHEN PASSING OUT. Today we reported this to our doctors office and to you!

This happened before 25 years ago and is likely unrelated to the vaccine. Expected cold/flu-like symptoms did occur on March 14 and part of March 15 but things have been fine since then. I&#39;ve followed up with my GCP and am scheduling a Neuro appointment for followup.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination I started to experience chronic exhaustion, leg cramping and pain in my lower back right side, upper right thigh, behind my right knee and down into my right calf. I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

                                                I suffered two heart attacks. First heart attack was on the 6th day after the vaccine, second heart attack was on the 9th day of vaccine. Both heart attacks woke me up from sleep. I went to the emergency room and was hospitalized each time. I suffered chest pain prior to each heart attack but have never suffered chest pain before. I am continuing to suffer from periods of chest pain at rest.

                                                Shortly after leaving the facility, after waiting the required 15 minutes post vaccine, I was driving back home on the freeway when I suddenly felt light-headed and as though all the energy had left my body (as though I was about to pass out). Then, without warning, I passed out, while driving on the freeway. Fortunately, I did not hit anyone, or was hit by anyone, and must have bounced off guardrails after crossing traffic twice and going off the freeway into the middle of an off ramp, where I finally came to. I did not suffer any injuries in the accident.
