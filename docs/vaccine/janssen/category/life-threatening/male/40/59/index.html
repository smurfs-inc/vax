                                                I started to feel really tired around 7:30pm and got a head ache so I went to bed early. I couldn&#39;t sleep well because I got the chills and a fever. I went to use the bathroom around 3am. All of a sudden I got really nauseous, the room spun, everything went black and I fainted in the middle of my bathroom. My wife woke up and helped me back to bed. The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

                                                Approximately seven minutes after the patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine, he had called out to his wife/pharmacy technician at the pharmacy stating he did not feel well.  His head had fallen back and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Patient had saliva starting to foam at the corner of his mouth and it appeared to be the onset of a mild seizure (per wife, patient has had seizure once before after a head injury) and he was turning very pale. Patient seemed to be unresponsive at that time - not answering to questions. At this point, one of the pharmacists ran to the clinic to get help and the other pharmacist administered an Epi-pen to patient&#39;s thigh.  Patient immediately came around after the injection, looked up and began talking. Staff called 911 and patient was monitored by pharmacy and clinic staff.  When the paramedics arrived, the patient was doing better and was able to ride home with his wife.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after the patient received his vaccination, he rested his head on the wall behind him in the chair he was being observed in and passed out and turned white. His wife began slapping his face and screaming his name and the observer called for me. I arrived within seconds and assisted his wife in moving him from the floor to the chair. Within seconds of getting his head to the ground safely, he came back to and was very sweaty, red in the face. He stayed on the ground laying down, and then sitting for approximately 25 minutes. During that time, he told us that he had previously passed out during 3 procedures done at doctors offices.  We got him an ice pack and a orange pop as he was complaining of being hot and having only eaten a granola bar all day. He was able to get up to a chair and sat there for an additional 5 minutes, before he was able to walk out on his own accord. I have spoken with the patient twice since, once last evening and once today and he reports he feels great now besides the expected body aches from the vaccination.

Once on the freeway I felt dizzy.  This came on me very fast.  I thought I better get off at the next exit.. but instantly blacked out.  While unconscious I struck another vehicle going approximatley 65mph, rolled my vehicle on its side, skidded, then rolled back upright.  I awoke to my car spun sideways on the freeway, paramedics, and fire dept working the wreck from my window, and no recollection of what happend.  It felt instantaneous to me.    I ate a breakfast of granola, yoguirt.  I hydrated before the shot.  I even took extra Vitamin C.

An hour later, he was driving on a highway, had a syncopal event and was involved in a single-vehicle MVC where his vehicle struck a guardrail and rolled twice.  Patient was brought to the ED at Hospital where he was evaluated by me in the ED.  Patient had a normal mental status (GCS 15) and was alert and oriented on exam.  He did have some bruising to his forehead from the airbag.  Patient denies feeling ill or lightheaded after receiving the vaccine and reports the syncopal event came on very suddenly.

                                                I got the vaccine at about 12:55pm. About ten minutes after getting the vaccine, while sitting in a chair, I began to get tunnel vision and felt extremely tired. I broke out in a cold sweat all over my body. I began to lose my vision like I was fainting and I momentarily blacked out or dozed off, then came back awake. I started to get tunnel vision again for a minute, then it faded away. Then I continued sweating for a minute and then it faded away. After a couple minutes I felt fine again. I sat for another several minutes then left at 1:15 feeling ok with just a sore shoulder.

He turned pale and fell sideways off chair onto floor lowering himself with his knee. He did not bump his head, he was sweating profusely, but did not lose consciousness. I yelled to the tech to call 911. Patient was sitting on floor.  He said he did not eat much all day. He was alert and talking. He said he fainted when his wife had their baby. We gave his some orange juice. The paramedics arrived 8 minutes later and checked his vitals. In the meantime we called his wife. Paramedics checked his BP, glucose and questioned patient. Patient refuse to go with paramedics. Wife came and paramedics released him to her.

About five minutes in, another patient who received the vaccine together with patient told us the patient had fainted. Patient was slumped over to the side when I came to check on patient. I called the patient a few times and patient started to come to. I asked the patient how he was feeling and if he had any difficulty breathing to assess for anaphylactic shock. Patient was breathing normal, but was sweating and a bit confused. Patient reported feeling dizzy. I explained to patient that he fainted for a few minutes and instructed to sit as I did not feel comfortable having patient lay down in the state he was in. Patient was given water and a fan to help cool him down and legs elevated (patient reported feeling much better with the fan blowing on him). Patient sat at the pharmacy for over 30 minutes before heading to the bathroom. At this point, patient were no longer dizzy and I instructed him to get up slowly and assessed that patient was no longer dizzy before letting him go to the bathroom.

At about the 17 minute mark patiently suddenly fainted in his chair for 15-30 seconds. He then began to vomit and woke up in the process. Once he fully came back to, he said he felt remarkedly better and no longer felt light-headed or clammy. Following this episode he reported feeling back to normal and that he had just ate a large breakfast before coming in for the shot, but did not feel bad in any way anymore. We observed for another 30 minutes and patient showed no further sign of issues. He was released with his wife.

After conferring with my primary care facility, it was recommended that I see an ophthalmologist. Confirmed that I had a Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) and recommended I meet with a retinal specialist.  Dr. confirmed the BRVO was caused by a blood clot and commenced treatment via eye injection.  I then met with my primary physician to discuss the situation.  He recommend further tests to determine whether I had other clotting.  In addition to blood work, he order MRIs of my brain, head and neck region and also recommended that I meet with a thrombosis specialist.  I met with a Dr. who ordered additional blood work for additional testing.  All tests performed to determine if I had additional clotting have come back negative.

I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

                                                By midnight after my vaccine: Shortness of breath.  Three days later around 6:25 am on April 15, 2020: I got out of bed, next moment I recall is of me on the floor. No memory of falling. I was shaking uncontrollably as if my body was getting many commands at the same time but I had no control over it. I could not call out for help. At one point I was biting my right  hand but could not make myself stop until my shaking stopped. Bite did not penetrate skin but I had visible bite mark on my hand.  I regained control suddenly and just got up slowly and shaken by the experience. Wife then drove me to the ER.  Been feeling pressure on my head.

The vaccine was admistered and the patient was asked to stay seated in the waiting area after the injection. After a few minutes the patient passed out while seated and was moved to being seated on the floor by staff. The patient was given water and his blood pressure was monitored periodically for the next hour before releasing the patient.

Within about 5-10 minutes his girlfriend comes to the pharmacy window and tells me he&#39;s feeling bad.  By the time I get to his chair he is very lethargic and slumped over.  I sit him up in the chair and his head rolls back and his eyes have rolled back in his head.   I place him on the floor and instructed my staff to call 911.   The patient presented with sweats and was unresponsive for about 10-20 seconds.   When he came to he asked how he got on the floor.   The patient never had any trouble breathing  heart rate was steady the entire time.   When EMS arrived they checked him out and was fine.  He refused transport to the hospital.  He walked out of the store after about 30 minutes from the point of his passing out.

Woke up April 7th at 7AM with sharp pains in my left shoulder (same side as shot) and slight shortness of breath, and slight chest pain in the left quadrant of my torso (same side as shot).  Proceeded to take Advil and seemed to help a bit.  Minor aches/pains and shortness of breath throughout the day until about 8PM.  At this time shoulder chest pain became more severe, and breathing became very strained, short, and painful.  Pain and breathing kept getting worse and at midnight on Wednesday night thought I was having a heart attack due to extreme chest pain, couldn&#39;t breath, lightheaded, dizzy, tingly extremities.  My wife drove me to ER at 12:30 AM Thursday.

He was then started on anticoagulation therapy after specialist phone consult and will be closely followed.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) frequency 1 total, dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 06-APR-2021 at 12 noon for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 6-APR-2021 at 12 noon, patient got vaccinated and was fine that day . Next morning on 07-APR-2021,  patient woke up with sever cramping in same shoulder which he got the shot in, most pain was in the upper left quarter of his torso to down half way to chest up to the shoulder till the neck . By the end of the day it  spread to his whole chest and upper body. Also he had shortness of breath ,could not breath .The cramping and shortness of breath came at same time. He took Advil and went along with his day . He took 3 tablet of Advil 200mg  every 4-5 hours all day ( total of 3 dose that day) . By night time the case was progressively worse as the whole chest had a lot of pain . He thought that he had heart attack . He thought that he was about to  pass out . He could not stand on his own . So his wife took him to emergency room at mid night at 12:30 am on 08-APR-2021. He stayed there for 5 hours and they did  bunch of tests , EKG which rolled out the heart attack .They did  Chest X-ray which found things then did D-dimer which its level was very high . They found  bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides. They did ultra sound on the legs  which had no evidence of blood clots . They discharged him  from the emergency room as  they felt that he was ok to be out . After couple of hours after discharge , patient&#39;s health care professional wrote for him Eliquis, antibiotic and pain reliver. He was given antibiotic because he had  beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed) . It was found air sacs in lung with signs of pneumonia in both lobes . He came home and started to  monitor his blood oxygen . He stayed in the  same position till recovery . He was better each day since last week but still had sinus and cramping in the chest ( very minor but was still there). The lung capacity was very limited to take some steps. Patient stated that he needed a specialist to understand his condition. He had no medical history before that incidence . He was wondering regarding which type of blood thinner was good for this type of blood clots because he read that the regular blood thinners are not good for that type of blood clot which his HCP gave (regular blood thinner). Laboratory data included: Total lung capacity decreased (NR: not provided) lung capacity is very limited. On 08-APR-2021, Laboratory data included: Chest X-ray (NR: not provided) found things, EKG (NR: not provided) rolled out heart attack, Fibrin D dimer (NR: not provided) level was very high, and Ultrasound scan (NR: not provided) no evidence of blood clots.  Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: apixaban, and ibuprofen. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the severe cramping in left shoulder and upper body, chest pain (whole chest had lot of pain)/thought that he had heart attack, shortness of breath/could not breath, thought that he was about to pass out, difficulty in standing, bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed), cramping in chest and sinus was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 44-year-old male patient reported blood clots of both lungs 2 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient denies any medical history/condition prior to vaccination.  The symptoms reported were severe cramping of arm that spread to his whole chest and upper body and shortness of breath; the patient thought he had a heart attack, about to pass out and could not stand because of the progression of pain.  EKG done at the emergency room ruled out heat attack, D-Dimer was reported to be very high, clots were found in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, x-ray showed beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed).  The patient was prescribed with Eliquis, an unspecified antibiotic and pain reliever.  Outcome of the events were not reported.   Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

EMS were called and he was seen in ER due to low heart rate and sweating to rule out any heart conditions. He had 2 EKGs - one in the ambulance and one in the ER. He also had to have a CT for falling and bumping his head to rule out that injury. The DX was listed as a vagal response, but we are not so sure we agree given that he is 45 years old, has no priory history or anxiety about shots.

TEE determined PFO. Heart monitor was placed to check for arrhythmia.  High cholesterol was noted and medication for that was given. I was also given blood thinners and aspirin.

                                                On March 13, I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at the  clinic  The pharmacist monitored me for symptoms but there were none right away. I did have a fever and some body aches in the two or three days that followed but those were short-lived.  While driving on March 16, I started experiencing some irregular breathing and periods of shortness of breath about three hours after leaving home. I stopped at the emergency room at the Health Center where Dr diagnosed me with an acute pulmonary embolism after discovering a small blood clot in one of my lungs. He prescribed me with Eliquis, which I am still taking today. Their phone number is provided if you have questions.  I haven&#39;t had too many shortness of breath episodes lately but do not know if the blood clot is still there. I am scheduled to see my hematologist on April 27 to get further updates on this. My hematologist Dr is located in clinic number provided While it has not yet been proven that the vaccine caused the blood clot in my lung, I feel the need to report this in the wake of recent news about the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. My hematologist and primary care physician are both aware that I have received the vaccine but I have not received any further communication from them.

Patient&#39;s partner reports that patient started feeling a tingling sensation on his left arm about 10 minutes after vaccination. Partner also reports that patient was hallucinating and sending her confusing text messages during his 15 minute observation period. The patient did not report feeling any adverse symptoms at the checkout station after his 15 minute observation period and before leaving the vaccination clinic.    After patient returned home, his partner reports considerable swelling on his left arm, continued hallucinations and trying to dismiss her concerns. Subsequently, that same day, partner reports the patient had a severe migrane and began to lose feeling on his left arm and leg, at which point the patient also lost consciousness.  Also at this point, the partner calls 911.   After arrival of emergency personnel, the patient regains consciousness, but does not remember name and complains of continued pain on his arm. He is transported to hospital where he spends 3 nights and receives treatment and care for stroke symptoms.    Patient reports that he does not remember much of anything 1.5 days after vaccination.   After returning home from hospital, patient complains of memory lapses and begins seeing neurologist for minor seizures during his sleep.   Wife reports that patient now lashes out and easily loses temper due to the fact that his memory is foggy.

Never happened before and I&#39;ve had other Lobster on the east coast before.  I also ate shrimp a few days prior to vaccination with no reaction.  I have eaten other Lobster all my life with no reaction.    My sinuses and throat closed up making it very difficult to breathe.   I didn&#39;t know what was happening so I took decongestants and antihistamines then went to the doctor and got injected with a steroid immune suppressor.  I now have epinephrine just in case it happens again.

                                                Before receiving the vaccination the patient mentioned he had a fear of needles.  Patient was asked if he ever fainted after getting a vaccination or injection and patient reported no.   The vaccine was administered to the patient and patient appeared to be fine for the next few minutes after getting vaccinated.  Patient was told he could take a seat in the waiting area and wait until his 15-minutes were up and he could go.  Patient was seated in the waiting area for about a minute but then got up to walk down one of the isles. When walking down the isle patient fainted and collapsed. This occurred approximately 10 minutes or so after he received the vaccine.  Patient was helped to a chair and once seated appeared to shake/convulse (almost like a seizure) for approximately 5-10 seconds before snapping out of it and regaining consciousness.  Afterwards he was alert and talking but didn&#39;t remember fainting.  911 was called and he was checked out by paramedics. After observing him for 15 minutes or so and determining his heartrate and blood pressure were normal and he appeared to be ok, the paramedics told him they can take him to the hospital to be evaluated further, or he was free to leave on his own without going to the hospital.  The patient said he felt fine and declined being taken to the hospital. After another 10-15 minutes the patient left under his own power. Patient mentioned he would possibly be calling his physician and alerting them to the episode.

This continued for about 3-3.5 weeks. On the night of Apr 16, he went to bed early not feeling well. Next morning he complained of heaviness in the chest area. We immediately consulted Dr., and mentioned that he got the vaccine. Dr. advised us to immediately go to an Emergency Room. Patient was found to be having a heart attack. His right artery was 100% blocked. The 3 left arteries had no blockage at all. Angioplasty was done and he had a stent placed in right artery. The clot was removed as part of angioplasty. He now needs to be on blood thinners for life.

                                                Pt. had (what we think) a small seizure on Thursday, March 18th and then again on Saturday, March 20th.  On Sunday, March 21st, 911 had to be called as his seizure did not end.  He had a grand male.  He was seizing for several hours.  At the time this was all occurring he has been on anti seizure meds for a few years Divalproex 1000 mg am and 1000 mgs pm daily).  He passed 1 week later, March 28 at approx 6:45pm at the Clinic.  I am unable to get any information  on his medical report for that week.  Statement from his Nurologists is on second page. Additional information for Item 18:   Statement:  47 year old gentleman who passed away on March 28 from aspiration pneumonia secondary to status epilepticus and on a history of multiple sclerosis / additional leukoencephalopathy of unknown etiology (both treated with rituximab), prior seizures (on valproic acid) and pulmonary embolism (on apixaban). The key reason for reaching out is in light of the announcement about the side effects of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. While he had a known history of seizures, he had no clear trigger for these seizures; including that his valproic acid level was therapeutic (83.0 mcg/mL) at time of presentation. He had, however, received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on March 12 before having what in hindsight appeared to be repeated seizures between March 18-21; he had a more significant one on March 21 that hospitalized him. This time frame appears consistent with the reported cases of central venous sinus thrombosis associated with the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. Equally, he was taking apixaban at that point in time and his PLT (173) / INR (1.1) / PTT (36.6) at time of presentation were all normal and stable. He did have an elevated ProBNP (552.0) at presentation; nasopharyngeal swab was negative for COVID / Influenza A/B / RSV and non-contrast head CT did not show any clear new abnormalities. His only D-dimer was obtained on March 23 and was 226. He did not have a CT angiogram or venogram.   Overall the link between the vaccine and pt. seizures is not definite. At the same time, the similarity with the reported cases has led to me wanting to report it in case of the possible link.

                                                On April 7th in the  morning, I woke with sharp pain in right calf.  It was not swollen, discolored, or hot.  I had not participated in any activity recently that I felt caused an injury.  I took Advil and Tylenol and rested for a few days, but the pain got worse.  On April 14th, after reading reports on some adverse affects from the J&amp;J vaccine, I made an appointment to see my primary physician.  After blood work and an ultrasound, I was diagnosed with a DVT in my right calf.  I have a started a 90-day cycle of Xarelto to treatment the DVT.

The patient was assisted to stand and get on a chair. At that point Orange Juice and Water were provided to the patient and the pharmacist sat next to him for ten minutes. Next, the patient was instructed to stay for five more minutes to make sure he was okay. The patient stated this happens to him every time he gets a vaccine and it isn&#39;t out of the ordinary at all. Patient also stated he did not eat or drink much all day besides a bag of chips and on top of that was doing strenuous work in the heat all day and this could have contributed to his collapse.

I began to have pain in my chest that was getting progressively worse, yesterday I had a very sharp pain when taking a shallow breath.  I went to the hospital they thought I had pneumonia, but then saw a blood clot in right upper side, I&#39;ve had a prior event but that was attached to an injury in 2012. I&#39;ve not had any other issues.

                                                DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 49 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 80.3 kilograms, and height was 182.9 centimeters. The patient&#39;s past medical history included post-operative deep vein thrombosis (more than 30 years ago), depression, heart murmur, and back surgery, and his concurrent conditions included non-smoker, no alcohol use, and marijuana abuse. The patient had no history of known allergies. The patient&#39;s mother had a history of aneurysm.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: unknown, and expiry date: unknown) dose was not reported, administered on 08-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (Allegra) for allergy, rivaroxaban (Xarelto) for venous thromboembolism, and omeprazole (Prilosec) for unknown indication. About one and half weeks after vaccination, on 21-APR-2021, the patient was taken to the emergency department and was admitted with the complaints of leg pain since 2 days with suspected blood clot in leg. Over the last days, patient&#39;s left leg looked swollen compared to the right leg. The patient also had pain, initially started in groin area and radiated down across the anterior portion of the leg, then to posterior leg, and into toes. The patient also had some intermittent tingling in toes. The patient denied of weakness, numbness or persistent paresthesia. The patient was concerned regarding the pain as it felt similar to the post-operative deep vein thrombosis he had in the past. The patient had been anxious since vaccination when hearing about the development of blood clots. The patient also denied of fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty walking. On 21-APR-2021 16:25, the patient&#39;s laboratory data included: Blood pressure (148/66 mmHg), Body mass index (24), Body temperature (98.8 F), Oxygen saturation (100 %) Pulse rate (88), and Respiratory rate (16). On 21-APR-2021 16:32, laboratory data included: Blood pressure (148/66 mmHg), Body temperature (97.8 F), Oxygen saturation (100 %), Pulse rate (91), and Respiratory rate (15). Other general physical examinations included: General: Well-developed well-nourished in no acute distress. HEENT (Head, Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat) examination:  normocephalic atraumatic extra ocular motions are intact. Neck examination: Supple without jugular vein distention or meningismus. Lung examination: Clear auscultation bilaterally without wheezes rales or rhonchi. Heart examination: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs rubs or gallops. Abdomen examination: Soft no tender non-distended without rebound or guarding. Extremities: Without clubbing cyanosis edema, no lacerations or abrasions or ecchymosis noted, no appreciable size difference in the left leg compared to the right, the patient had some tenderness throughout palpation of the medial thigh on the left with radiation up into the left inguinal region, no calf tenderness or swelling, no erythema, palpable posterior tibialis pulse. Skin examination: Warm and dry and well perfused. Psych examination: Appropriate mood and affect. Neuro examination: Cranial nerves 2-12 are grossly intact, strength is 5/5 in upper and lower extremities, full distal sensation in the left lower extremity, full plantar and dorsiflexion of the left foot including the left great toe, sensation is grossly intact, awake, alert and oriented x3.  On ultrasound Doppler venous lower extremity test, identified sub occlusive thrombus in the left superficial femoral veins, likely related to organizing/chronic thrombus, however no prior imaging was available at the institution for comparison, no evidence of occlusive deep vein thrombosis. The final diagnosis was made as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  At no time the patient had ever endorsed any chest pain/pleuritic pain, shortness of breath or exertional dyspnea. Due to the nature of this clot, a course of anticoagulation was planned. Patient was prescribed with Xarelto at twice daily starting doses, with transition to 20 mg doses. During the initiation of treatment, the patient should be followed up by his primary care physician for further evaluation. The patient stated that he would call the primary care physician in the following morning for follow-up appointment. The patient was discharged from the hospital on APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of deep vein thrombosis was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: 20210457179-Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s-deep vein thrombosis. This event is considered not related. The event has a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, is unlabeled, and has unknown scientific plausibility. There are other factors more likely to be associated with the event than the drug. Specifically: MEDICAL HISTORY

After going to the chiropractor two times the knot and pain ended up in my right leg. I then went to Urgent Care where they diagnosed me with a large blood clot. They sent me to imaging and after scanning the area confirmed that there was a blood clot in my right leg. Urgent Care then set me up with a specialist.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure and diabetes.  The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number 1802070, expiry date unknown), dose not reported, 1 total administered on 19-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination on left arm. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate for drug used for unknown indication, empagliflozin for drug used for unknown indication, fenofibrate for drug used for unknown indication, insulin aspart for drug used for unknown indication, insulin glargine for drug used for unknown indication, losartan for drug used for unknown indication, and pioglitazone hydrochloride for drug used for unknown indication. On an unspecified date (reported as 22-MAR-2021; 28 days prior to vaccination), the patient experienced shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, chills and was hospitalized (date unspecified). He reported that on this past Saturday, 17-APR-2021 (2 days prior to vaccination), he went to the emergency room. He reported that his toenails were coming off, the skin on his toes was coming off, and he had swelling in his right foot and up his leg. He says there was no circulation going to his toe and he was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg. He says he had surgery to open up the arteries in his leg, and also reported gangrene in his toe. The subject was discharged on 21-APR-2021. On 23-APR-2021, the patient experienced feeling hot. He also reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene. He reported that he is going to go back to the hospital, to which he would seek medical attention if he was having issues. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included paracetamol. When called back due to his vaccination dates being after event start dates, the patient said that his memory is not too good, so he &#39;had to take his time to remember the correct dates&#39;. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient was recovering from blood clot in leg, and had not recovered from runny nose, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, chills, feeling hot, gangrene in toe, right leg swollen, and right foot swollen. This report was serious (caused hospitalization).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old  hypertensive and diabetic male patient reported that he was feeling hot and may need to have his fifth toe amputated because it has gangrene 4 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 2 days after discharge form the hospital.  The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, and chills 28 days prior to vaccination.  The patient went to the emergency room 2 days prior to vaccination because his toenails/skin on his toes were coming off, swelling in his right foot and up his leg, gangrene in his toe; he reported that there was no circulation going to his toe and was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg; the patient reported he had surgery to &#34;open up&#34; the arteries in his leg. Four days after vaccination, the patient felt hot and reported reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene.  The patient is taking paracetamol as treatment.  No other details was reported.  Based on the lack of temporal association, the causality is considered not related for the events blood clot in leg, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, right leg swelling, right foot swelling, chills, and runny nose.  The information available regarding event gangrent of fifth toe and feeling hot precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

He was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a flesh eating bacteria in the right leg where the pain was at and Sepsis.  He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

                                                Approximately three weeks after receiving Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, I began to get pains in legs. Calves were aching and throbbing. Didn&#39;t think anything of it at first....just thought achy muscles and such. The day before Easter (April 3rd 2021) decided since the pain was continuing and the internet will scare you to death - I went to a local Emergency Room in advance,  I had an ultrasound on my left leg and it was noted I had DVT. (blood clot in left calf)  To briefly explain: I had an achilles issue back in Nov. 2020 (slight micro tear - achilles tendonitis) I thought maybe this was related to that, as I had not been to the doctor to get it checked until early March 2021. and it bothered me off and on for a few months. I thought the calf pain may have been related to that?  I explained to the emergency room doctor about my achilles and thought it was an issue related to that. They decided to perform an ultrasound on my left leg. Which noted the DVT/Blood Clot. They put me on a starter pack of Xarelto and I am to follow up with my normal doctor on April 22, 2021.

We thought it was related to the weather getting warm and we work the night shift, so he rested and increased his water intake. He was able to go to work on Monday night and return home and continued to rest on Tuesday. On Tuesday, there was no numbness, but there was weakness in both his legs. On Wednesday, he felt weakness throughout his body, especially in his legs. On Thursday, he collapsed. He did not lose consciences but his legs gave out under him and he was not able to get up up. He was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a stroke, increased sugars (diabetes he has never had before), acute kidney injury, and uncontrolled increased blood pressure. He was hospitalized and discharged April 19, 2021. He was readmitted 04/24/2021 for another stroke.

Just want to know if he died from Covid or an adverse reaction from Johnson and Johnson vaccine he received in jail. No one wants to test his blood. He&#39;s at the mortuary awaiting cremation, and I thought it best if some government entity drew some blood to determine if he&#39;s a Covid or vaccine reaction fatality.  Before they cremate his body.

                                                Patient was scheduled for an appointment for a Johnson &amp;Johnson  covid-19 vaccine through a drive thru Thursday April 8, 2021 @12:45pm. We arrived early and he received the vaccine at 12:15pm, waited 30 minutes for reaction and he was feeling fine. Later that same evening, the patient was driving to work on the freeway when he felt a dry throat so he coughed hard, at that cough he felt a massive pain in his head, like his &#34;head was going to explode.&#34; He immediately had tunnel vision closing in on him, so he pulled over and later woke up in our parked car with flashing emergency lights on, parked on the shoulder of the freeway. Disoriented and confused why he was there, he looked at his watch and saw he lost 15 minutes when he had passed out. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF HE HAD NOT PULLED HIMSELF OVER WHEN PASSING OUT. Today we reported this to our doctors office and to you!

He had reported to my aunt that he was having shortness of breath, headaches, and in general not feeling well.  She found him sitting up with a clear liquid pouring out of his nose and then he fell over dead.

I went to the emergency room where they performed on ultra sound examination of my left leg.  Confirmed that I have a deep vain thrombosis (DVT) behind my left knee.  Prescribed Eliquis.  Saw Dr. today.  He could not confirm that DVT was caused by vaccine, but I thought I should report it.  I am to stay on Eliquis for six months at which time I will be evaluated for a blood clot disorder.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 15-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. On 15-MAR-2021, the patient received the vaccine, waited at facility for 15 minutes, and everything was okay.  On 17-APR-2021, the patient experienced neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness, which he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium). He also noticed his feet had a rash from his knee to feet, and according to his sister (who is a healthcare professional) it looked like small micro-embolisms (thrombocytopenia). The patient went to his physician who said the spotty red dots could be petechiae caused by thrombocytopenia.  As recommended by his primary care physician, the patient has an appointment for lab work, including platelet counts, on 20-APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from headache, tiredness, neck ache, rash from knee to feet (red dots), muscle ache, and possible thrombocytopenia, and the outcome of sleepiness was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old male patient was found to have petechiae-like rash on his knees to feet, that according to attending physician could be caused by thrombocytopenia, 2 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient underwent laboratory procedure including platelet count (results not reported).  The patient complained of neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness that he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium) on the day the petechiae-like rash appeared.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information as requested.

Patient was loss consciousness within 3 minutes of vaccine. I called the paramedics but he regained consciousness after 1 minute so we cancelled the call. He continued to complain of feeling dizzy so I had him stay for an additional 15 minutes. He has history of fainting with IVs/blood draws.

                                                On Friday, March 19 around 9:10am I had seizures - loss of awareness, very pale, shaking (but not quite convulsions). This happened before 25 years ago and is likely unrelated to the vaccine. Expected cold/flu-like symptoms did occur on March 14 and part of March 15 but things have been fine since then. I&#39;ve followed up with my GCP and am scheduling a Neuro appointment for followup.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination I started to experience chronic exhaustion, leg cramping and pain in my lower back right side, upper right thigh, behind my right knee and down into my right calf. I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

Started to feel better in the evening and started to drink a bit of gatorade.  However Saturday morning April 3rd woke up between 6-7am and went to the bathroom and turned around to walk back out and blacked out - most likely dehydrated.   Fortunately did not fall down as my wife caught me slumped up against the wall and got me down to the floor.  After 5-10 minutes was able to get back to bed and after another hour or so was able to start drinking fluids and keep them down through the day.   By late afternoon/early evening had a small meal and was starting to feel better - never did have a fever (checked frequently on Friday and Saturday)

                                                DIAGNOSIS: 1. Superficial thrombophlebitis MEDICAL DECISION MAKING/DIFFERENTIAL DX: Differential diagnosis includes DVT, superficial thrombophlebitis, muscle strain, tendinitis. The patient presented to the emergency department with atraumatic left leg pain. An ultrasound reveals a fairly large blood clot in the greater saphenous vein. Although this is a superficial clot, given its extent, I think it warrants anticoagulation. Per the trial, the patient would benefit from 45 days of 10 mg Xarelto treatment. The patient was given good precautions regarding bleeding risk while on a blood thinner. He will schedule follow-up appoint with his primary care doctor. He will also use Tylenol and warm packs to help with the discomfort from the superficial thrombophlebitis. He was discharged in satisfactory condition.

Home meds discontinued: all BP meds, Ibuprofen, Tylenol, and Torodol. Follow up appointments with Dr. oncologist. Also had to cancel upcoming ventral hernia repair after having to wait 3 years due to complications with bowel obstructions and had to lose weight before surgery due to high risk. Now will have to wait longer until cleared medically, primary physician instructed me that it would be 6months or more before being cleared.

Duration of blackout unknown. Woke up on floor not knowing how I got there. Sat up, nausea and lightheadedness returned, then dissipated with no further blackout. Felt rush of blood from head to toe and felt okay after that. Pharmacy staff took blood pressure, readings were close to normal (slightly elevated). Paramedics were called by pharmacy, and their BP readings were also close to normal. After all that, aside from some fatigue, no other appreciable side effects over the next 48 hours. No nausea, flu-like symptoms or fever, and very little soreness at injection site.

Slurring words, stumbling around and general unwell feeling with a fluttery feeling in chest. No previous heart issues of any kind. After it continued for an hour or so, I took him to the ER and it was discovered that he was in AFIB. 2 rounds of meds and tests, but stayed in that rhythm. They ended up doing a cardio version and it went back into normal sinus rhythm. Follow up with dr, placed on Eliquis, EKG, stress test and sleep study have found no other contributing factors atthis point.

                                                I received the vaccine on 3-12-21 and woke up 3-15-21 with pain in the bottom of my left foot. I scheduled an apt with my PCP on 3-16-21. My PCP scheduled an ultrasound on 3-24-21 where the nurse discovered blood clots in my lower left leg. I started taking Eloquis later that afternoon. I then had an apt with a blood dr. on 4-9-21 where she drew blood for tests. I was experiencing my heart racing and she scheduled me an apt with a cardiologist on 4-13-21 where the cardiologist suspected that the clots had moved into my lungs. The cardiologist did an EKG on the same day. I have a heart echo scheduled for 5-7-21. I am experiencing side effects from Eloquis so 4-19-21 I switched to Xeralto.

                                                Shortly after leaving the facility, after waiting the required 15 minutes post vaccine, I was driving back home on the freeway when I suddenly felt light-headed and as though all the energy had left my body (as though I was about to pass out). Then, without warning, I passed out, while driving on the freeway. Fortunately, I did not hit anyone, or was hit by anyone, and must have bounced off guardrails after crossing traffic twice and going off the freeway into the middle of an off ramp, where I finally came to. I did not suffer any injuries in the accident.

As soon as the event took place my sore throat and swollen glands stopped immediately. My wife took me to the hospital where I was entered into stroke protocol. I was subjected to a series of tests including: EKG, ECHO, Platelet Cnt, Lipid Panel w direst LDL reflex, Hemoglobin, MRI Brain w/o contrast, CTA Stroke Alert (head/neck), CT Stroke Alert Brain, ECG, Basic Metabolic Panel, CBC, Protime - INR, APTT, Troponin I, Covid19, Influenz Influenza A/B, RSV PCR, and POCT GLUCOSE. I was kept for observation and determined I had suffered a small stroke. Released from the hospital 4/7/2021.

You would have to contact her directly for more information. He was found dead in his room  by the manager around 5 pm on April 22nd. Manager told me his body was cold to the touch so she thought he may have passed the previus day on April 21st.  Daughter todl me earlier today that a doctor is running some tests to try to determine the cause of death. You would need to contact her for the doctors name.  My own inpression is that the emphysema was not severe enough to have d=caused his death as he could walk up to half a mile.

BP was checked twice; 124/76 then 115/85. 911 was called but patient said he felt better and did not want to be evaluated. He rested and left pharmacy. I called him hours later and he stated he felt fine.
