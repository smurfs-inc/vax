                                                Patient looked normal and relaxed before and during vaccination. About 5-10 minutes after vaccination, patient passed out (fainted) while sitting down in a chair.  Moved patient on to floor lying down flat and observed him for a few seconds. Patient was un responsive and appeared to struggle to breath. Asked my staff to call 911 for emergency services, and to bring an Epipen  just in case, and started to perform CPR on the patient. The patient gained consciousness in about 15 chest compassions and became responsive. He answered the questions like  his name, where he lives etc. As the patient became conscious,  responsive and appeared to breath normally, I did NOT administer Epipen.  Kept patient in observation and kept him engaged in talking until EMS personnel have arrived. They checked his vitals and blood glucose. In the conversation with   EMS personnel, they said he is hypertensive and hyperglycemic.  Ems took him to the ambulance by walking him (stretcher wasn&#39;t necessary)

After conferring with my primary care facility, it was recommended that I see an ophthalmologist. Confirmed that I had a Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) and recommended I meet with a retinal specialist.  Dr. confirmed the BRVO was caused by a blood clot and commenced treatment via eye injection.  I then met with my primary physician to discuss the situation.  He recommend further tests to determine whether I had other clotting.  In addition to blood work, he order MRIs of my brain, head and neck region and also recommended that I meet with a thrombosis specialist.  I met with a Dr. who ordered additional blood work for additional testing.  All tests performed to determine if I had additional clotting have come back negative.

                                                11 days following the single shot I developed severe pain in my right calf muscle that felt like a charlie horse and on my leg from knee to my ankle felt a squeezing sensation like I was wearing a very tight sock that I couldn&#39;t take off.  After a few days the pain subsided and the similar pain began in my left leg however not as severe.  The pain would seemingly move around and come and go.  Some days it was so bad I couldn&#39;t walk or balance.  I believed I had a muscular issue.  I then began having swelling on the top of my left foot and around the ankle of my left foot.  After about a week, my right leg began to swell from the knee to ankle fairly significantly.  New veins appeared on the front of my right leg and other veins on the back of my right leg began to bulge.   Pain on both legs started to subside on the evening of 5/23, however swelling continued.   On the evening of 5/25 I was experiencing severe squeezing sensation and bulging veins in my right leg.

                                                Got COVID (Janssen) vaccine shot on April 6th at noon.  Felt fine Tuesday and went to bed as normal.  Woke up April 7th at 7AM with sharp pains in my left shoulder (same side as shot) and slight shortness of breath, and slight chest pain in the left quadrant of my torso (same side as shot).  Proceeded to take Advil and seemed to help a bit.  Minor aches/pains and shortness of breath throughout the day until about 8PM.  At this time shoulder chest pain became more severe, and breathing became very strained, short, and painful.  Pain and breathing kept getting worse and at midnight on Wednesday night thought I was having a heart attack due to extreme chest pain, couldn&#39;t breath, lightheaded, dizzy, tingly extremities.  My wife drove me to ER at 12:30 AM Thursday.

                                                Patient reported to medical clinic  24 hours after COVID 19 injection (03/19/2021) with symptoms of visual hallucinations, myalgia, rigors, headache, nausea, vomiting and dehydration.  At the time of arrival to the medical clinic, he had refractory nausea and vomiting after receiving Zofran earlier in the day at another clinical site. Medical treatment consisted of IV Fluid bolus with maintenance fluids, IV Phenergan for the nausea and vomiting, and IV Ketorolac for headache pain. His  symptoms resolved and he started to feel better so a clinical decision was made to discharge him home in the care of a close friend.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) frequency 1 total, dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 06-APR-2021 at 12 noon for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 6-APR-2021 at 12 noon, patient got vaccinated and was fine that day . Next morning on 07-APR-2021,  patient woke up with sever cramping in same shoulder which he got the shot in, most pain was in the upper left quarter of his torso to down half way to chest up to the shoulder till the neck . By the end of the day it  spread to his whole chest and upper body. Also he had shortness of breath ,could not breath .The cramping and shortness of breath came at same time. He took Advil and went along with his day . He took 3 tablet of Advil 200mg  every 4-5 hours all day ( total of 3 dose that day) . By night time the case was progressively worse as the whole chest had a lot of pain . He thought that he had heart attack . He thought that he was about to  pass out . He could not stand on his own . So his wife took him to emergency room at mid night at 12:30 am on 08-APR-2021. He stayed there for 5 hours and they did  bunch of tests , EKG which rolled out the heart attack .They did  Chest X-ray which found things then did D-dimer which its level was very high . They found  bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides. They did ultra sound on the legs  which had no evidence of blood clots . They discharged him  from the emergency room as  they felt that he was ok to be out . After couple of hours after discharge , patient&#39;s health care professional wrote for him Eliquis, antibiotic and pain reliver. He was given antibiotic because he had  beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed) . It was found air sacs in lung with signs of pneumonia in both lobes . He came home and started to  monitor his blood oxygen . He stayed in the  same position till recovery . He was better each day since last week but still had sinus and cramping in the chest ( very minor but was still there). The lung capacity was very limited to take some steps. Patient stated that he needed a specialist to understand his condition. He had no medical history before that incidence . He was wondering regarding which type of blood thinner was good for this type of blood clots because he read that the regular blood thinners are not good for that type of blood clot which his HCP gave (regular blood thinner). Laboratory data included: Total lung capacity decreased (NR: not provided) lung capacity is very limited. On 08-APR-2021, Laboratory data included: Chest X-ray (NR: not provided) found things, EKG (NR: not provided) rolled out heart attack, Fibrin D dimer (NR: not provided) level was very high, and Ultrasound scan (NR: not provided) no evidence of blood clots.  Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: apixaban, and ibuprofen. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the severe cramping in left shoulder and upper body, chest pain (whole chest had lot of pain)/thought that he had heart attack, shortness of breath/could not breath, thought that he was about to pass out, difficulty in standing, bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed), cramping in chest and sinus was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 44-year-old male patient reported blood clots of both lungs 2 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient denies any medical history/condition prior to vaccination.  The symptoms reported were severe cramping of arm that spread to his whole chest and upper body and shortness of breath; the patient thought he had a heart attack, about to pass out and could not stand because of the progression of pain.  EKG done at the emergency room ruled out heat attack, D-Dimer was reported to be very high, clots were found in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, x-ray showed beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed).  The patient was prescribed with Eliquis, an unspecified antibiotic and pain reliever.  Outcome of the events were not reported.   Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

TEE determined PFO. Heart monitor was placed to check for arrhythmia.  High cholesterol was noted and medication for that was given. I was also given blood thinners and aspirin.

                                                On March 13, I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at the  clinic  The pharmacist monitored me for symptoms but there were none right away. I did have a fever and some body aches in the two or three days that followed but those were short-lived.  While driving on March 16, I started experiencing some irregular breathing and periods of shortness of breath about three hours after leaving home. I stopped at the emergency room at the Health Center where Dr diagnosed me with an acute pulmonary embolism after discovering a small blood clot in one of my lungs. He prescribed me with Eliquis, which I am still taking today. Their phone number is provided if you have questions.  I haven&#39;t had too many shortness of breath episodes lately but do not know if the blood clot is still there. I am scheduled to see my hematologist on April 27 to get further updates on this. My hematologist Dr is located in clinic number provided While it has not yet been proven that the vaccine caused the blood clot in my lung, I feel the need to report this in the wake of recent news about the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. My hematologist and primary care physician are both aware that I have received the vaccine but I have not received any further communication from them.

                                                Ten days after vaccination I had an allergic shellfish reaction to a frozen lobster product.  Never happened before and I&#39;ve had other Lobster on the east coast before.  I also ate shrimp a few days prior to vaccination with no reaction.  I have eaten other Lobster all my life with no reaction.    My sinuses and throat closed up making it very difficult to breathe.   I didn&#39;t know what was happening so I took decongestants and antihistamines then went to the doctor and got injected with a steroid immune suppressor.  I now have epinephrine just in case it happens again.

I checked the pt and he regained conciousness. I asked if he is ok. He ask what happened because he does not remember. He speaks another language and an associate was there to translate. We asked if he wants us to call 911, he refused. The firefighter/paramedics suggested they will come over anyway to make sure he is ok, he does not have to go with them to go to the hospital. Pt did not want to go to hospital because he does not have insurance. He was checked by a medic who also speaks his language. He checked pt&#39;s vital signs, asked questions like allergies, medical conditions, asked what day is today and what is his name (which were the same questions I asked before medic arrived).

This continued for about 3-3.5 weeks. On the night of Apr 16, he went to bed early not feeling well. Next morning he complained of heaviness in the chest area. We immediately consulted Dr., and mentioned that he got the vaccine. Dr. advised us to immediately go to an Emergency Room. Patient was found to be having a heart attack. His right artery was 100% blocked. The 3 left arteries had no blockage at all. Angioplasty was done and he had a stent placed in right artery. The clot was removed as part of angioplasty. He now needs to be on blood thinners for life.

                                                Pt. had (what we think) a small seizure on Thursday, March 18th and then again on Saturday, March 20th.  On Sunday, March 21st, 911 had to be called as his seizure did not end.  He had a grand male.  He was seizing for several hours.  At the time this was all occurring he has been on anti seizure meds for a few years Divalproex 1000 mg am and 1000 mgs pm daily).  He passed 1 week later, March 28 at approx 6:45pm at the Clinic.  I am unable to get any information  on his medical report for that week.  Statement from his Nurologists is on second page. Additional information for Item 18:   Statement:  47 year old gentleman who passed away on March 28 from aspiration pneumonia secondary to status epilepticus and on a history of multiple sclerosis / additional leukoencephalopathy of unknown etiology (both treated with rituximab), prior seizures (on valproic acid) and pulmonary embolism (on apixaban). The key reason for reaching out is in light of the announcement about the side effects of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. While he had a known history of seizures, he had no clear trigger for these seizures; including that his valproic acid level was therapeutic (83.0 mcg/mL) at time of presentation. He had, however, received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on March 12 before having what in hindsight appeared to be repeated seizures between March 18-21; he had a more significant one on March 21 that hospitalized him. This time frame appears consistent with the reported cases of central venous sinus thrombosis associated with the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. Equally, he was taking apixaban at that point in time and his PLT (173) / INR (1.1) / PTT (36.6) at time of presentation were all normal and stable. He did have an elevated ProBNP (552.0) at presentation; nasopharyngeal swab was negative for COVID / Influenza A/B / RSV and non-contrast head CT did not show any clear new abnormalities. His only D-dimer was obtained on March 23 and was 226. He did not have a CT angiogram or venogram.   Overall the link between the vaccine and pt. seizures is not definite. At the same time, the similarity with the reported cases has led to me wanting to report it in case of the possible link.

Patient reported his friend informed him that he might potentially have a blood clot and that he should come to the emergency department.  Imaging consistent with acute DVT and patient taken to IR for tPA direct catheter infusion.

                                                On April 7th in the  morning, I woke with sharp pain in right calf.  It was not swollen, discolored, or hot.  I had not participated in any activity recently that I felt caused an injury.  I took Advil and Tylenol and rested for a few days, but the pain got worse.  On April 14th, after reading reports on some adverse affects from the J&amp;J vaccine, I made an appointment to see my primary physician.  After blood work and an ultrasound, I was diagnosed with a DVT in my right calf.  I have a started a 90-day cycle of Xarelto to treatment the DVT.

Later had DDIMER 560 on 4/15/21 due to h/o J&amp;J vaccine and CTA lung 4/29/2021 shows Right lower lobe pulmonary emboli.  Patient is clinically much better. No more SOB. Dizziness a little residual but significantly better. Never had hypoxia/tachycardia and BP always reassuring. Pt read about some blood thinner making clot worse and doesn&#39;t want to to start a blood thinner without checking with hematology first. I&#39;ve prescribed rivaroxaban so that pharmacy can start authorization and ensure coverage, but patient strongly states that he will not take it yet until hearing from hematology.

                                                DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 49 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 80.3 kilograms, and height was 182.9 centimeters. The patient&#39;s past medical history included post-operative deep vein thrombosis (more than 30 years ago), depression, heart murmur, and back surgery, and his concurrent conditions included non-smoker, no alcohol use, and marijuana abuse. The patient had no history of known allergies. The patient&#39;s mother had a history of aneurysm.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: unknown, and expiry date: unknown) dose was not reported, administered on 08-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (Allegra) for allergy, rivaroxaban (Xarelto) for venous thromboembolism, and omeprazole (Prilosec) for unknown indication. About one and half weeks after vaccination, on 21-APR-2021, the patient was taken to the emergency department and was admitted with the complaints of leg pain since 2 days with suspected blood clot in leg. Over the last days, patient&#39;s left leg looked swollen compared to the right leg. The patient also had pain, initially started in groin area and radiated down across the anterior portion of the leg, then to posterior leg, and into toes. The patient also had some intermittent tingling in toes. The patient denied of weakness, numbness or persistent paresthesia. The patient was concerned regarding the pain as it felt similar to the post-operative deep vein thrombosis he had in the past. The patient had been anxious since vaccination when hearing about the development of blood clots. The patient also denied of fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty walking. On 21-APR-2021 16:25, the patient&#39;s laboratory data included: Blood pressure (148/66 mmHg), Body mass index (24), Body temperature (98.8 F), Oxygen saturation (100 %) Pulse rate (88), and Respiratory rate (16). On 21-APR-2021 16:32, laboratory data included: Blood pressure (148/66 mmHg), Body temperature (97.8 F), Oxygen saturation (100 %), Pulse rate (91), and Respiratory rate (15). Other general physical examinations included: General: Well-developed well-nourished in no acute distress. HEENT (Head, Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat) examination:  normocephalic atraumatic extra ocular motions are intact. Neck examination: Supple without jugular vein distention or meningismus. Lung examination: Clear auscultation bilaterally without wheezes rales or rhonchi. Heart examination: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs rubs or gallops. Abdomen examination: Soft no tender non-distended without rebound or guarding. Extremities: Without clubbing cyanosis edema, no lacerations or abrasions or ecchymosis noted, no appreciable size difference in the left leg compared to the right, the patient had some tenderness throughout palpation of the medial thigh on the left with radiation up into the left inguinal region, no calf tenderness or swelling, no erythema, palpable posterior tibialis pulse. Skin examination: Warm and dry and well perfused. Psych examination: Appropriate mood and affect. Neuro examination: Cranial nerves 2-12 are grossly intact, strength is 5/5 in upper and lower extremities, full distal sensation in the left lower extremity, full plantar and dorsiflexion of the left foot including the left great toe, sensation is grossly intact, awake, alert and oriented x3.  On ultrasound Doppler venous lower extremity test, identified sub occlusive thrombus in the left superficial femoral veins, likely related to organizing/chronic thrombus, however no prior imaging was available at the institution for comparison, no evidence of occlusive deep vein thrombosis. The final diagnosis was made as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  At no time the patient had ever endorsed any chest pain/pleuritic pain, shortness of breath or exertional dyspnea. Due to the nature of this clot, a course of anticoagulation was planned. Patient was prescribed with Xarelto at twice daily starting doses, with transition to 20 mg doses. During the initiation of treatment, the patient should be followed up by his primary care physician for further evaluation. The patient stated that he would call the primary care physician in the following morning for follow-up appointment. The patient was discharged from the hospital on APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of deep vein thrombosis was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: 20210457179-Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s-deep vein thrombosis. This event is considered not related. The event has a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, is unlabeled, and has unknown scientific plausibility. There are other factors more likely to be associated with the event than the drug. Specifically: MEDICAL HISTORY

                                                A week and a half after taking the Janssen COVID shot I had a knot and pain come up in my lower back. After going to the chiropractor two times the knot and pain ended up in my right leg. I then went to Urgent Care where they diagnosed me with a large blood clot. They sent me to imaging and after scanning the area confirmed that there was a blood clot in my right leg. Urgent Care then set me up with a specialist.

Saturday April 23rd Went to er was treated for kidney stones but they could only find one small one,  Was sent home with pain medication.  Shortness of breath persisted as did bloody cough and pain in chest and all over. Went back to the er on 4/28 as pain was unbearable (chest pain)  once given a cat scan and diagnosed with blood clots in my lungs and then an ultra sound and found a blood clot in my leg (just above knee).  It is thought that I was mis-diagnosed on the original trip to the er with kidney stones.  I have been put on blood thinners and pain medication and will be following up with my doctor.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure and diabetes.  The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number 1802070, expiry date unknown), dose not reported, 1 total administered on 19-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination on left arm. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate for drug used for unknown indication, empagliflozin for drug used for unknown indication, fenofibrate for drug used for unknown indication, insulin aspart for drug used for unknown indication, insulin glargine for drug used for unknown indication, losartan for drug used for unknown indication, and pioglitazone hydrochloride for drug used for unknown indication. On an unspecified date (reported as 22-MAR-2021; 28 days prior to vaccination), the patient experienced shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, chills and was hospitalized (date unspecified). He reported that on this past Saturday, 17-APR-2021 (2 days prior to vaccination), he went to the emergency room. He reported that his toenails were coming off, the skin on his toes was coming off, and he had swelling in his right foot and up his leg. He says there was no circulation going to his toe and he was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg. He says he had surgery to open up the arteries in his leg, and also reported gangrene in his toe. The subject was discharged on 21-APR-2021. On 23-APR-2021, the patient experienced feeling hot. He also reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene. He reported that he is going to go back to the hospital, to which he would seek medical attention if he was having issues. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included paracetamol. When called back due to his vaccination dates being after event start dates, the patient said that his memory is not too good, so he &#39;had to take his time to remember the correct dates&#39;. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient was recovering from blood clot in leg, and had not recovered from runny nose, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, chills, feeling hot, gangrene in toe, right leg swollen, and right foot swollen. This report was serious (caused hospitalization).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old  hypertensive and diabetic male patient reported that he was feeling hot and may need to have his fifth toe amputated because it has gangrene 4 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 2 days after discharge form the hospital.  The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, and chills 28 days prior to vaccination.  The patient went to the emergency room 2 days prior to vaccination because his toenails/skin on his toes were coming off, swelling in his right foot and up his leg, gangrene in his toe; he reported that there was no circulation going to his toe and was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg; the patient reported he had surgery to &#34;open up&#34; the arteries in his leg. Four days after vaccination, the patient felt hot and reported reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene.  The patient is taking paracetamol as treatment.  No other details was reported.  Based on the lack of temporal association, the causality is considered not related for the events blood clot in leg, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, right leg swelling, right foot swelling, chills, and runny nose.  The information available regarding event gangrent of fifth toe and feeling hot precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

                                                Approximately three weeks after receiving Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, I began to get pains in legs. Calves were aching and throbbing. Didn&#39;t think anything of it at first....just thought achy muscles and such. The day before Easter (April 3rd 2021) decided since the pain was continuing and the internet will scare you to death - I went to a local Emergency Room in advance,  I had an ultrasound on my left leg and it was noted I had DVT. (blood clot in left calf)  To briefly explain: I had an achilles issue back in Nov. 2020 (slight micro tear - achilles tendonitis) I thought maybe this was related to that, as I had not been to the doctor to get it checked until early March 2021. and it bothered me off and on for a few months. I thought the calf pain may have been related to that?  I explained to the emergency room doctor about my achilles and thought it was an issue related to that. They decided to perform an ultrasound on my left leg. Which noted the DVT/Blood Clot. They put me on a starter pack of Xarelto and I am to follow up with my normal doctor on April 22, 2021.

We thought it was related to the weather getting warm and we work the night shift, so he rested and increased his water intake. He was able to go to work on Monday night and return home and continued to rest on Tuesday. On Tuesday, there was no numbness, but there was weakness in both his legs. On Wednesday, he felt weakness throughout his body, especially in his legs. On Thursday, he collapsed. He did not lose consciences but his legs gave out under him and he was not able to get up up. He was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a stroke, increased sugars (diabetes he has never had before), acute kidney injury, and uncontrolled increased blood pressure. He was hospitalized and discharged April 19, 2021. He was readmitted 04/24/2021 for another stroke.

No concomitant medications were reported.  Patient received J&amp;J vaccine at place of employment. After 24 hours on an unspecified date in APR-2021, the patient developed lower leg DVT (deep vein thrombosis) post COVID injection. It was confirmed by positive d-dimer (coded as Fibrin D dimer) and US (ultrasound scan). Exact results and date of the tests were not provided. The patient was started on rivaroxaban. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of DVT post COVID injection was not reported (captured as unknown). This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: This 52/53-year-old hypertensive male patient of unspecified ethnicity developed lower leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after 24 hours of receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

The patient was started on rivaroxaban. No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

Just want to know if he died from Covid or an adverse reaction from Johnson and Johnson vaccine he received in jail. No one wants to test his blood. He&#39;s at the mortuary awaiting cremation, and I thought it best if some government entity drew some blood to determine if he&#39;s a Covid or vaccine reaction fatality.  Before they cremate his body.

                                                abdominal pain. The pain was so severe that my knees would buckle and several times if I was holding anything, it caused me to drop it. After about a week, I had an appointment at 4:30 and was scheduled for the next morning at 8:30 to meet with a back and spine doctor for xrays.  Xrays were negative.  I was then schedule with a neck and hand specialist a few days later. This appointment could not provide a diagnosis.  Back and abdominal pain increase and soreness had spread to the stomach and groin.  After the news broke of the cerebral blood clots in 6 women.  See attached Continuation Page.

                                                In March I had a pain in my left calf muscle that I could not identify with getting hit or injuring it in any way. I called Urgent care because i read and heard about problem with the J&amp;J vaccine that it was giving people blood clots. Urgent care said there was no need to come in that there was very little reason to believe that it was a blood clot. Then in June I woke up to very severe pain in my left leg from my foot all the way to my thigh. It was hot, swollen and I could barely bend my knee. I went to Urgent Care and they sent me across the street to the Hospital for an ultra sound on my leg. Here are the result from the ultra sound.  Real time color Doppler imaging and spectral analysis were performed during ultrasound evaluation of the left lower extremity is performed. There is persistent occlusive deep venous thrombosis within the mid to distal superficial femoral vein extending nonocclusive bleed to involve the popliteal vein and exclusively within the proximal popliteal and peroneal veins of the calf. The doctor put me on 3 week of taking a blood thinner twice a day and then will go down to taking one blood thinner once a day for 6 months. I also saw MD. Here are his notes from my Drs appt. Patient is seen today, 6/14/2021, to discuss management of left leg DVT.   Patient presented to urgent care on 5/20/2021.  He had noticed soreness in his left leg for a couple of days and then he awoke that day and the leg was swollen.  The duplex scan showed that he had occlusive clot involving left superficial femoral vein extending through popliteal vein down to peroneal vein in the left calf.  He was started on rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily.   He transitions to 20 mg rivaroxaban daily tomorrow.   The leg soreness has eased slightly but the swelling has not improved.  He did have a repeat duplex scan on 6/7/2021 which was unchanged.  Thrombus persisted but was not worse.   He has not had chest pain or breathing issues or dyspnea.  He does recall that about 4 weeks earlier he had a muscle spasm sensation in the left calf.  He had received a Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid immunization in late February, 2021.  He was aware of the public information about venous clotting in women who had received the J&amp;J vaccine and was also aware that it involved cerebral veins.  He called his provider and was asked questions about the leg and otherwise the answers were negative.  So imaging was not obtained.  The muscle spasm sensation did not recur.   His family history is negative for clots in his personal history for clots is otherwise negative.  He is a maintenance manager.  He has not had lengthy travel recently.  He also denies any trauma to the legs.   He has a history of GERD from which she had developed iron deficiency anemia in June 2020.  He had undergone EGD has a result.  He also had a colonoscopy when he turned 50 years of age and had polyps removed and then had repeat colonoscopy 6 months later.  This evaluation occurred with Dr. of gastroenterology. His colonoscopy was on 12/20/2018.  One of the polyps was a hyperplastic polyp.  The second was a tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia/intramucosal adenocarcinoma, 2 cm size.  Polyps were excised.  Had repeat endoscopy on 7/10/2019 he had a hyperplastic polyp in his rectum.   Also he had a PSA checked in summer 2020.  It was 0.5.   He is a smoker only of very infrequent cigars, perhaps every 6 to 8 months.

Left lower extremity DVT.  Etiology unclear.  No definite provocation.  He did receive a Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine in late February, 2021.  He first noticed a muscle spasm sensation in left calf in mid April, 2021 and then had onset of soreness 2 days before his visit with swelling onset the day of his urgent care visit, 5/20/2021.   Currently on rivaroxaban.  Transitioning now to the 20 mg daily dose.   Family history negative for DVT as is his personal history.  PSA was unremarkable and summer 2020.  Has had prior colonoscopy in December 2018 and June 2019.  Did have finding of sigmoid colon polyps with atypia in 1 and possible noninvasive adenocarcinoma.  Repeat scope showed hyperplastic polyp but no additional polyps.  Has also had EGDs in March 2019 and June 2020 because of GERD and iron lack anemia.  Non-smoker.   I discussed with patient that we would usually treat him for 6 months with anticoagulation and then reassess to determine whether it is safe to discontinue therapy.  But if he has ongoing swelling and soreness in his leg it would be difficult to stop treatment because we would lose one of our early indicators of recurrence of DVT.  I also suggested that we should do a lab panel to assure that he does not have any underlying inherited or acquired abnormality that predispose to this clot, since we do not have any clear-cut causative etiology.  (We discussed that the Covid immunization may have been his predisposition, but that existing data suggest that this is a risk factor in females and that most of the episodes were central nervous system venous clots.)     PLAN:   1.  So we will draw lab panel assessing acquired and inherited predispositions for hypercoagulability.  And we will plan to see him back in a couple of months to reassess his status.

I went to the emergency room where they performed on ultra sound examination of my left leg.  Confirmed that I have a deep vain thrombosis (DVT) behind my left knee.  Prescribed Eliquis.  Saw Dr. today.  He could not confirm that DVT was caused by vaccine, but I thought I should report it.  I am to stay on Eliquis for six months at which time I will be evaluated for a blood clot disorder.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 15-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. On 15-MAR-2021, the patient received the vaccine, waited at facility for 15 minutes, and everything was okay.  On 17-APR-2021, the patient experienced neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness, which he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium). He also noticed his feet had a rash from his knee to feet, and according to his sister (who is a healthcare professional) it looked like small micro-embolisms (thrombocytopenia). The patient went to his physician who said the spotty red dots could be petechiae caused by thrombocytopenia.  As recommended by his primary care physician, the patient has an appointment for lab work, including platelet counts, on 20-APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from headache, tiredness, neck ache, rash from knee to feet (red dots), muscle ache, and possible thrombocytopenia, and the outcome of sleepiness was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old male patient was found to have petechiae-like rash on his knees to feet, that according to attending physician could be caused by thrombocytopenia, 2 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient underwent laboratory procedure including platelet count (results not reported).  The patient complained of neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness that he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium) on the day the petechiae-like rash appeared.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information as requested.

Then they installed 2 stents in my heart 2 days later they sent me home and 1 week later I had to return to the hospital after the studies they detected that I had blood clots in both legs, I had no problem before the vaccine and I&#39;m almost 100 percent sure this is what caused these problems.

They gave me blood thinner and now Im taking Eliquis twice a day.  Symptoms continue, I have the same pain, I dont see any improvent.  I did went to work yesterday and I realize that I can do any lifting or be sitting down for at least one hour.

I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

                                                DIAGNOSIS: 1. Superficial thrombophlebitis MEDICAL DECISION MAKING/DIFFERENTIAL DX: Differential diagnosis includes DVT, superficial thrombophlebitis, muscle strain, tendinitis. The patient presented to the emergency department with atraumatic left leg pain. An ultrasound reveals a fairly large blood clot in the greater saphenous vein. Although this is a superficial clot, given its extent, I think it warrants anticoagulation. Per the trial, the patient would benefit from 45 days of 10 mg Xarelto treatment. The patient was given good precautions regarding bleeding risk while on a blood thinner. He will schedule follow-up appoint with his primary care doctor. He will also use Tylenol and warm packs to help with the discomfort from the superficial thrombophlebitis. He was discharged in satisfactory condition.

                                                On March 28th, started noticing symptoms. There was pain in my entire right leg, shin swelling; calf- swelling and skin discoloration; and right foot - swelling. On 4/1, I went to Urgent Care where I was seen, evaluated and treated by Dr. She ordered blood tests and an ultrasound within 20 minutes. I had 4 blood clots in 3 veins in my right leg/DVT. My blood platelet value was 267 and the standard range is 130 to 400. They didn&#39;t consider it low, but it&#39;s still an issue. I was given an injection of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection--1 ml injection twice a day for 5 days, which was started in the ER. I then switched to Pradaxa 150mg pill twice a day. I took that until around the 6th of this month when I noticed my right leg had gotten worse. I was instructed to go back to the urgent care. Another ultrasound was ordered and it showed I still had the 4 blood clots in 3 veins that seems to have worsened, so the meds were not working. He consulted with a vascular surgeon and they put me back on the injection once a day, which I am currently still on. I was told to follow up with my PCP in two weeks and that appt is on Thursday with Dr.

No clear cause of the PE was found. It was thought to be possibly related to superficial thrombosis of his upper extremity secondary to IV that was placed 2 days prior when he was briefly admitted for workup of heavy hematocheiza, at which time he was found to have a mild anemia and discharged. He was treated inpatient at Hospital. I am not sure of the where he obtained the vaccine or the exact date.

His significant other reports that COVID-19 infection went throughout the house in December, although he did test negative, they believe he had it due to his symptoms.  He did have that Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccination at the beginning of April of this year. Apparently the patient was speaking with the 1st responder right up until for minutes prior to EMS arrival and when fire department arrived on the scene the patient was found unresponsive, pulseless, and apneic, and subsequently they performed 1 round of CPR administering epinephrine and Narcan, when the patient regained a pulse.  The patient lost a pulse again, requiring subsequent CPR and airway tube was placed.   The patient arrived in the ED at 10:02 a.m., epinephrine was administered x7 rounds, patient was intubated with a 7.5 ET tube, Lucas device on patient, at 1053 the patient was awake, opening his eyes, squeezing nursing staff hand. At 10:59 a.m., nursing staff reported patient trying to pull his ET tube out.  The patient received at least 1 hour 15 minutes CPR including time on scene, on route to ED, and in ED.  At 11:10 a.m. patient&#39;s O2 saturation decreased to 79%, patient became diaphoretic with decreased responsiveness.  At 11:13 a.m., cardiology was at the bedside.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were significant for platelets 44, INR 1.2, CO2 16, AGAP 24, glucose 475, BUN 17, CR 1.55, ALT 248, AST 274, ALP 123, mg 2.9, lactate 15, troponin negative, 1st ABG:  PH 7.11, pCO2 39.4, base excess -17, PO2 46, HC03 12.6, O2 saturation 100%.  EKG showed right bundle-branch block with ST elevation in lead 3, V1, V2, V3, and V4 leads with ST depression in 1, aVL, and lead II.  Limited stat bedside echo showed akinetic septum and hypokinetic right ventricle.  The patient was taken to the cath lab.  Dr.  completed a pulmonary arteriogram and found bilateral massive emboli subsequently undergoing thrombectomy.  Patient was on epinephrine, norepinephrine, IV fluids, heparin, and propofol.   The patient was seen postprocedure in the intensive care unit while mechanically ventilated and sedated.  The patient&#39;s sedation was stopped and the patient woke up, moved all extremities, and followed some commands.  The patient&#39;s significant other was at the bedside.  He is currently on norepinephrine at 20mcg/min, epinephrine 20mcg/min, heparin per PE protocol after receiving bolus in CCL, propofol 25mcg/kg/min, and IV NS fluids.  The patient&#39;s wife reports that he has a history of chewing tobacco, but quit over 20 years ago.  She believes that he has a family history of blood clots in his sister&#39;s and maybe his dad, but she is not completely sure about that.  6/8/21: 56-year-old man who called EMS with complaints of acute onset shortness breath, was found unresponsive, apneic and without a pulse on arrival of EMS. ACLS protocol was initiated, he was brought to the emergency department where CPR was continued with Lucas device. He was intubated, required administration of 7 rounds of epinephrine, a total of 1 arm 15 minutes of resuscitation was required prior to return of spontaneous CT circulation. Cardiology was emergently consulted, he was taken to the cath had last cath lab with only mild nonobstructive CAD noted. He then underwent pulmonary angiography with the finding of saddle pulmonary embolism as well as bilateral main pulmonary artery thrombosis. He underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the right and left main pulmonary trunk, right upper middle old and lower lobe pulmonary artery, left lower lobe pulmonary artery.  Therapeutic anticoagulation was initiated with IV heparin then transition to oral Eliquis.    He was treated with empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed secondary to legal Rhea and acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy was initiated with CRRT. Clinical response was favorable, he was subsequently extubated and transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis. He was assessed by Physical and Occupational therapy and recommended for acute rehabilitation placement. His been discharged today in stable medical condition to continue hemodialysis as scheduled per Nephrology at the acute rehabilitation unit.

Home meds discontinued: all BP meds, Ibuprofen, Tylenol, and Torodol. Follow up appointments with Dr. oncologist. Also had to cancel upcoming ventral hernia repair after having to wait 3 years due to complications with bowel obstructions and had to lose weight before surgery due to high risk. Now will have to wait longer until cleared medically, primary physician instructed me that it would be 6months or more before being cleared.

Patient experienced fatigue, congestion, headaches, sore throat, body aches, neck pain. Conducted a televisit on Sunday, April 18th, and then went into the doctor on Monday, April 19th. The day of the doctor appointment, the patient could not get out of bed and could not stand for longer than 15 minutes at a time before extreme fatigue set in. Blood tests were taken at the doctor, a Z-pack was prescribed. The evening of the 19th, the doctor called after hour to send patient to emergency room to be admitted to hospital. Patient went immediately to Medical Center at which point, the patient was admitted for the next 19 days. The patient was released from the hospital on Saturday, May 8th.

Patient experienced fevers every night for 15 days straight, and after release from the hospital and &#34;fever free for 4-5 days, experienced fevers again for the next week. Doctors were unable for the first two and a half weeks of hospitalization to draw a conclusion about what was the cause of the sepsis (systemic). Patient received daily blood tests, MRIs, CAT scans, spinal tap, bone marrow biopsy, echocardiogram, etc. Patient spent the first two and a half weeks on an antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral.  The &#34;final&#34; diagnosis, which is still not confirmed, as histoplasmosis, which per the doctor would not have placed the patient in the hospital. Determined the fevers were officially &#34;fevers of unknown origin&#34; with a diagnosis of MIS-A and a vaccine contributing factor. Medication put patient in kidney failure and did not address the fevers (patient had fevers of 103&#43; for 25&#43; days in a row).  On May 27th, doctors are conducing new fungal tests and patient is discontinuing antifungal medication because of severe liver damage.  Patient was not and is not in a situation where histoplasmosis is a logical conclusion based on the patient&#39;s daily activities.

Since the symptoms persisted into June I was sent for an MRI on 6/1. I received a call on 6/2 stating that I had suffered a stroke. I followed up with an MRA on 6/9. I met physician on 6/10 and stated that there were no issues reported in the MRA, however they confirmed that I had suffered a stroke. I After presenting the physician information that the symptoms described in Jansen vaccine were similar to mine they ordered an MRA scheduled for today and blood tests also today.

My PCP scheduled an ultrasound on 3-24-21 where the nurse discovered blood clots in my lower left leg. I started taking Eloquis later that afternoon. I then had an apt with a blood dr. on 4-9-21 where she drew blood for tests. I was experiencing my heart racing and she scheduled me an apt with a cardiologist on 4-13-21 where the cardiologist suspected that the clots had moved into my lungs. The cardiologist did an EKG on the same day. I have a heart echo scheduled for 5-7-21. I am experiencing side effects from Eloquis so 4-19-21 I switched to Xeralto.

                                                Five weeks (05/16/2021) after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, my left leg just started feeling numb. I went into my kitchen and all of a sudden I started feeling dizzy. I lost all strength in my legs and in my left arm. I really couldn&#39;t move my arms or my legs and I felt really light headed. I had to have my 5 year old boys get me some water to drink. My son noticed that my heart was beating really strong and really fast. I saw water boiling over in the pot on the stove and I couldn&#39;t even get out of a chair to turn it off. I couldn&#39;t stand up. I finally managed to go back by my bed from the chair and slowly moved around. I tried holding my phone and it dropped out of my hands a couple of times because I couldn&#39;t hold it. A couple hours later, I felt a little better, but I had to fight to get around. We fell asleep and when I woke up, I still felt bad. I took my children to school and told them that I was going to the hospital to get checked out. At the hospital they performed multiple tests and they back showing I had stroke. I was treated for suffering from a stroke.

You would have to contact her directly for more information. He was found dead in his room  by the manager around 5 pm on April 22nd. Manager told me his body was cold to the touch so she thought he may have passed the previus day on April 21st.  Daughter todl me earlier today that a doctor is running some tests to try to determine the cause of death. You would need to contact her for the doctors name.  My own inpression is that the emphysema was not severe enough to have d=caused his death as he could walk up to half a mile.
