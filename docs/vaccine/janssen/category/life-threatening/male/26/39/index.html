                                                ED NOTE is as follows...from 4/21/21 @ 21:47    a 28 y.o. male who to the emergency room with reports of a headache for the last 48 hours.  He reports this as being one of the worst headaches he has ever had.  He was seen at urgent care and given Toradol, Zofran and Benadryl and still rates his pain an 8 out of 10.  He does feel pressure behind his eyes.  And reports vomiting in the parking lot at urgent care.  He denies abdominal pain back pain, neck pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, numbness or tingling or any other worsening concerns.  Reports that he did receive a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  Patient states he does vape.  He occasionally drinks alcohol he denies any illicit drugs.  Patient denies any head trauma.   Diagnosis management comments: This is a 28-year-old male arrives to the emergency room with reported migraine headache for the last 48 hours.  He did report that he was go to urgent care in which he received a migraine cocktail of Zofran, Benadryl and Toradol.  Patient reported that his headache was not resolved so urgent care sent him on for further evaluation.  Patient upon arrival had a negative neurological exam however he did report that he had pressure behind his eyes.  Was unable to see any papilledema on funduscopic exam.  Check patient&#39;s pressures bilaterally and they were 21 and 18.  Patient did report to me that this was the worst headache of his life.  I did administer IV fluids here as well as Tylenol and morphine.  Patient did report some improvement.  Patient did report in his past medical history had a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  A CBC and CMP was obtained.  Did have thrombocytopenia with a count of 66.  Since my exam was PERRL with normal extraocular movements.  He had no eye redness or eye pain.  Of low concerns for any iritis or uveitis.  Patient&#39;s patient CT of his head did show a abnormal CT that had a dense appearing superior sagittal sinus that was representing a venous thrombosis.  Radiologist did recommend a MRI MRV.  An MRI and MRV was ordered.  Patient MRI MRv did show findings are consistent with a venous thrombosis involving the right jugular right transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus there is also a patchy edematous change within the subcortical white matter areas bilaterally and symmetrically.  There was no CVA.  With patient&#39;s reported migraine headache.  Reported blurred vision, low platelets, recent vaccination I do believe patient has vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.  With this finding I did converse with my overseeing physician Calls were made out to neurology and then a call out did prefer to have patient started on IVIG at 1 g/kg daily for 2 days and blood thinner Xarelto 15 mg p.o. twice daily.  These orders were initiated.  Internal med services was consulted and with conversations of family, internal med services out possible transfer that an interventionalists could be available if patient needed it.  Report was given at 2100 upon my end of shift.

                                                I had extreme chest pain on the 24th of March. It really hurt to breathe and it felt like I had pressure on my chest. I went to the Emergency room and they did a chest x-ray and a Covid-19 both of which were negative. I went home and I returned to the ER because the chest pain became worse. The chest X-Ray the second day showed I had pneumonia. I was told that it could have been from the Covid-19 in December or if was community acquired.  I was prescribed with antibiotics and discharged. I still feel some chest pain  after about a week and I have already finished the full course of antibiotics. I&#39;ve seen my Primary Care physician, my cardiologist and my Pulmonologist.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient received Covid-19 vaccine (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total dose was administered on 08-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported. The Company was unable to perform follow-up to request batch/lot numbers. No concomitant medications were reported.  On unknown date in APR-2021, the patient experienced increasing low back pain and leg pain (around one week) after vaccination. The patient was hospitalized (date unspecified) and was treated for vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) (coded as thrombosis and thrombocytopenia). The patient received treatment, which includes intravenous immune globulin, the anticoagulant argatroban and prednisone. Doctors stated, patient was responding well to treatment and should be released soon (discharge details unspecified). It was reported that, patient had more mild clot, and one in the leg. But certainly it was a real clot, and as patient was in his early 30&#39;s, so it was likely and could be linked to the vaccine. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine was not applicable. The patient was recovering from thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, low back pain and leg pain. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged). This is a spontaneous report concerning a 30 year old male, unknown ethnicity, patient who experienced increasing low back pain and leg pain around one week after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was hospitalized on an unspecified date and was treated for vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).  The patient was responding well to treatment, which included intravenous immune globulin, an anticoagulant (argatroban) and prednisone. The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. There is mention of patient having vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia but information is limited in this case. A relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine cannot be ruled out; thus the relationship is considered indeterminate. Additional information has been requested.

                                                a 31 year old man who received the  COVID-19 vaccine on March 27, 2021 in the  Public Health Department parking lot. Upon arrival and check in, the patient declined any comorbidities and health history but did state that he was nervous. After administration of the vaccine by  NP, the patient lowered himself to the ground, from a sitting position, and had a 60 second tonic clonic seizure. Seizure precautions such as turning the patient on his side, supporting his head, and calling EMS were taken during the seizure. After 60 seconds, the patient came to and asked what happened. PPHD staff oriented the patient to what had happened, to which he proceeded to say ?oh that is normal for me when I get anxious.? With the help of PPHD staff and his wife, the patient was brought to a sitting position and given a granola bar and water to his request. According to clinic lead RN, ?his skin was normal in appearance for race, ethnicity, and age. He was mildly diaphoretic. He verbalized feelings of anxiety and worry surrounding the vaccine.?   As EMS arrived on the scene and began assessing vital signs the patients anxiety appeared to increase; he became less verbal, closed his eyes, and his breathing pattern became shallow. The patient then had a second seizure at this time lasting approximately 25 seconds. When the patient came to he immediately verbalized, ?I?m good, I?m good, I?m fine?. He was slow to respond to verbal cues, but persistently refused transport to the local acute care hospital for further evaluation. He rested on the ground in supine position for approximately 25 minutes, with his partner and EMS at his side. Upon further evaluation of the patient and his wife, it was determined that the patient has a history of seizure activities when he is nervous and that he was ?expecting? this to happen. The patient continued to decline medical care and transportation to the hospital. The patient left in medically stable condition with his wife operating the vehicle.

Presented to clinic on 04/13/2021 and noted to have imaging confirmed &#34;There is occlusive superficial clot starting the upper lateral right thigh and extending distally through the mid to distal lateral calf. This appears to be within a superficial varicosity. Findings are consistent with extensive superficial thrombophlebitis of a varicose vein of the right lower extremity.&#34;

                                                The afternoon after I got the shot I went for a jog. When I returned, I got intense chills and a fever of 103 degrees along with some flu like symptoms. I had a slight headache. Ibuprofen helped but the next day I had similar symptoms, but they went away by the end of the day. On the third day I felt a little better, so I went for a run. I had some shortness of breath and it was difficult to breathe when I was running. I normally run 4 miles daily. The shortness of breath was present for a week after that and also started to happen intermittently even at rest. One week after the shot I saw a doctor and they did some testing but did not find anything definitive. Six weeks after the shot I went to the ER and they diagnosed with Thrombocytopenia. At this point it has been seven weeks the shortness of breath has improved, and I haven&#39;t experienced it for a few days.

                                                RUE DVT in brachial vein at site of injection.  Patient complained of RUE pain and swelling on 4/28. That evening the team ordered a RUE venous duplex. The venous duplex noted a DVT in the proximal aspect of one of the two brachial veins.  He was vaccinated during an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization.   He was evaluated by the medical team on 4/29 and noted to be in stable condition. On discharge he was prescribed xarelto 15 mg BID with food for 21 days with instruction to follow up with PCP in 1-2 weeks. After 21 days of therapy plan was to switch to xarelto 20 mg daily with food until 7/22/21 for a total of 3 months of therapy. The adverse event did not prolong his hospitalization.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine JJ: 32 y.o. male w/ no PMH presenting 2 weeks after receiving his Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine after having severe L calf pain found to have thrombocytopenia.    From H&amp;P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&amp;J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation. As he has had 2 negative US for DVT, unlikely that he has an unresolved DVT. abdominal and head CT are neg for thrombosis.

He received the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/8 and felt well afterwards. Last Friday (4/16) he began to experience constitutional symptoms (fever to 100.4, chills, night sweats feeling drenched, decreased appetite) so decided to get his labs drawn as an outpatient for further evaluation. Symptoms progressed until Tuesday, when they began to subside slightly. At that point, his labs resulted and were notable for thrombocytopenia. He got his labs redrawn the day before admission and it was noted that his thrombocytopenia was worsening, so he was directed to the ED for further evaluation.  Patient seen by hematology, started on dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily as well as IVIG treatment x2. MRV of brain without evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis  ***PATIENT CURRENTLY HOSPITALIZED***

                                                BLOOD CLOTS IN LEFT LUNG; TIRED; FEVERISH; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 34 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 175 pounds, height was 67 inches and Body mass index (NR: not provided) 27.4. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included non smoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders and no recent trauma or travel. The patient was active and ran for 30 mins every day. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number: 043AZ1A or 043A21A) frequency one total, dose was not reported, administered on 05-APR-2021 at 10:15 hours in left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05-APR-2021 in the evening, the patient experienced &#34;normal side effects&#34;, specifically tiredness and fever (temperature was not taken) and he took 2 Advil and went to bed. On 06-APR-2021 in the morning, he felt back to his normal baseline. On an unspecified date of APR-2021 (08-APR-2021 or 09-APR-2021), he felt pain and tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing. He noticed that he had to work harder to do his daily run. On 13-APR-2021, when the symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency room. The patient had blood was taken (results not reported). A computerised tomography (CT) scan showed 2 blood clots in the left lung and duplex scans of both legs did not reveal a clot. A chest x-ray was done but results not provided. The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative, and he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous heparin. It was reported that no oxygen was given. On 14-APR-2021, he was discharged with Eliquis which he should continue for 6 months.  On 16-APR-2021, the chest pain was gone, and his breathing was better in the morning but still difficult later in the day. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from tired, and feverish, and was recovering from blood clots in left lung. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 34 year-old overweight male (BMI 27.4) was hospitalized for 2 blood clots in his left lung 8 days after receiving vaccination with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. He had no chronic medical conditions, was a nonsmoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders, no recent trauma or travel, and exercised every day. On the evening of his vaccination, he felt tired and fever (temperature not taken) and took 2 ibuprofen and went to bed. The following morning, he felt back to normal. Two or three days later, he felt pain/tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing; he found it more difficult to perform his daily exercise. Eight days after vaccination, when his symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency department where a CT scan showed 2 blood clots in his left lung. Covid-19 testing and duplex scans of his legs were negative. Blood tests were performed but results were unknown. He was hospitalized for 1 night, treated with IV heparin, and discharged the following day with apixaban. As of the time of this report, the chest pain had resolved and breathing was improved in the morning but still difficult later in the day. Based on the limited information (e.g. absence of blood test results), the relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant.

                                                Started experiencing extreme chest pains (stabbing feeling) between my lower right breast and upper rib cage on Saturday afternoon, especially when trying to take a big inhale. I went to the emergency room the next day after pain meds (ibprofen) did not help, and they did an EKG and X-Ray and they said it was a muscle strain. I went home and alternated between 3000 MGs of Tylenol every 24 hours, 2400 MGs of Ibuprofen, 8 hours of 4% lidocaine patch and then off for 8 hours &#43; and a heating pad when the patch was off. The pain in my chest got worse and worse on Mon and Tue (started having spasms in the chest that caused extreme sharp shooting pain down my back up into my head) so went back into the ER Tues night.

He was test in the outpatient setting but the results have not yet returned.  He is here today with continued symptoms.  He is well-appearing on exam but mildly tachycardic, low-grade temperature here no significant increased work of breathing no conversational dyspnea lungs are clear heart is regular but tachycardic without murmur he has no signs or symptoms of DVT currently.  His chest x-ray shows all isolated left lower lobe infiltrate.  His labs are unremarkable with normal renal function, normal electrolytes but is rapid COVID test is positive.  Given his immunosuppressive status in infiltrate seen on x-ray initially recommended admission for observation even though he is not initially on any supplemental oxygen is work of breathing is quite comfortable.  I was able to discuss with his transplant surgeon In addition I talked to admitting physician who then discussed with pulmonology here .  In their opinion the best management for the patient would be to provide him with the monoclonal antibody treatment but this can only be performed in the outpatient setting given he has no increased work of breathing no supple ox requirement currently that he is stable for discharge.  He has a pulse monitor at home will also enroll him in a COVID home program.  Pulmonology will call him for follow-up tomorrow.  When I discussed with  they currently do not have any beds available at the hospital for transport.  The patient does not want to go to an outside facility that has a transplant team other than the risks of.  Ultimately the patient would like to go home.  I will add doxycycline for bacterial possibility of his pneumonia seen on x-ray today.  He also had very strict return precautions.  He understands likely had a possibility of worsening symptoms understands to return immediately if any new or worsening symptoms or no improvement.  Patient was given the monoclonal antibody treatment in the ER after ordered by Dr..  He will ultimately be discharged with very close follow-up.

There was no blood in my pee or discoloration however I had to clean my penis tip with a tissue and noticed a blood cloth came out while I was wiping. This concerns me but that was the only time I saw blood, there was none afterward nor has it occur since then.

                                                Patient went to the hospital Monday.  He received the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine on Thursday, April 8 and by Saturday, April 10 he was starting to develop fairly significant peripheral edema without any breathing  difficulties.  This  persisted and was worse by Monday, April 13  EKG showed global nonspecific T-wave abnormalities and ST segment changes so I had him sent to the ER. As it turned out he had a pancytopenia (mostly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) so he was admitted to the hospital. This seemed to resolve pretty much on its own and so they attributed everything to his hepatitis C. Indeed his LFTs are elevated in the 300 range and imaging showed  hepatosplenomegaly.  they also did a bone marrow biopsy for which there are no results yet

Patient called our OP line on 04/17 complaining of fever of 102 and chills. He was instructed to go to local lab and get labs done. They drew basic labs as well as blood cultures. On Sunday, the patient reported his fever was gone and he felt better. Today, he was feeling SOB and presented to his PCP. They ordered a CTA which reportedly showed bilateral PEs. They sent him to the local ED who transferred him here. Of note, his INR has been supratherapeutic for several weeks and pharmacy has been adjusting his warfarin dosing. The patient tested COVID negative prior to transfer. The vaccine lot number information is not accessible to this reporter.

One week ago, on Friday, March 26, he received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for Covid 19. That day he felt fine. The following day he had some muscle aches. Sunday he states he had some slight shortness of breath, only for that day. Then he had some fever and chills feeling. That resolved. The only symptoms that persisted was his muscle aching and tightness. Then yesterday, the day of his presentation to the ER, he noted some bilateral lower extremity edema which prompted his visit. He is feeling mostly fine except a bit of muscle tightness. BNP was 154. Chest x-ray showed pneumonitis. He received antibiotics. Echocardiogram was completed showing preliminary findings of small to moderate pericardial effusion and trace aortic insufficiency.  Will treat with colchicine and ibuprofen.

                                                On April 8, 2021, I received the J&amp;J vaccine. Initially, I only had the chills and body aches. Then, on Monday April 12, 2021, I went to the gym where I worked out. When I came home and after showering, I returned a phone call shortly after 8 P.M. While speaking on the phone, I could tell after a few minutes of talking something was off, and then all of a sudden, the words stopped coming out. After a few more seconds, I was trying to yell upstairs to my wife for help. I sounded like a goat while trying to yell that word. I then snapped out of it, and was able to speak clearly and normal again. I told my wife and called back my friend. My friend said I sounded like I was getting sick when I had the attack. The next morning I went to the hospital. I was diagnosed with a Transient Ischemic Attack &#34;TIA.&#34;

                                                description from patient:  1.. On Wed, Apr 28, I got the JnJ vaccine. Other than fatigue the following day no major issues.  2. On Sat, May 1, I had an afib episode in the morning. Reset to sinus rhythm the next morning around 2:30am. I spoke with you during the episode.   3. On Mon, May 3, I had brain fog. I?m usually tired after an afib episode. But this seemed different. I?ve never experienced something like this before. But I chalked it out to the after effects of the afib and moved on. 4. On Fri, May 7, I started having the stiffness in my right calf. I checked in with you that weekend to make sure it wasn?t a clot. After we spoke I think we ruled out a clot.  5. In addition, I?ve developed some added symptoms since then: (i) Sweaty feet. (ii) Pins and needles sensation in feet.  (iii) Tightness in the arch of the right foot. (iv) Feet and hands feel sensitive to cold.  (v) Burning sensation in feet and left hand.  (vi) Mild headache mostly felt in the left temple.  (vii) A pulling feeling on the left side of the face. (viii) A feeling that if I close my eyes, I may faint.
