                                                around 10 pm started with chills and fatigue with a sore injection location. Around 11:30 pm he got light headed and passed out for 4 seconds. After awaking he doesn&#39;t remember the last 5 minutes. He laid down to go to sleep and was consistently hot and then cold. He does have a history of night terrors but they have remained dormant for about 2.5 years. Around 12 am he started having one of the worst night terrors I&#39;ve seen. The following morning, April 2nd 2021, he was feeling incredibly sore and the injection spot was tender. He said &#34;it feels like I got hit by a truck.&#34; Seems to be doing okay otherwise now.

When he came to, he was totally aware of his surroundings and answered all of our questions. We had called 911 in the mean time. EMt&#39;s checked him thoroughly. His apple watch showed his pulse dropped to 42. EMT&#39;s stayed for about 15 minutes, We gave him water and his wife stayed within reach of him.  We escorted him to his car in one of our wheel chairs after about half hour.

About 5 minutes after vaccination, another patient came over and said that was not feeling well. When going out to patient I noticed he was very pale and sweating.  The patient then proceeded to pass out. I was able to hold the patients head and the other customer was able to hold his shoulders to make sure he did not fall out of the chair. The patient then got very stiff and proceeded to push back in his chair, after about 10 seconds he relaxed. The patient was passed out for about 3 mins, during that time I was able to remove his mask and hold his head. After gaining consciousness, I was able to make sure he was ok. We were able to give him some water and he stated he felt better. I asked the patient to stay for another half hour to monitor. After giving the patient another bottle of water, and having him sit he was able to get up and leave.

Got up to use the bathroom around 5am. Upon finishing peeing while standing, I lost consciousness, falling. As a result of the fall, I fractured my cheek bone, cut open my ear, later requiring three stitches, and was concussed, resulting in a loss of memory. I was nonresponsive when my fiance found me immediately following the crash, and was rushed to the hospital  via ambulance. Upon arrival to the hospital, my fever was found to be 102 F. As a result of the fall, I have a cheek bone fracture, three stiches in my ear, and a concussion.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

                                                The patient was nervous prior to vaccine and had a needle phobia. About 5 minutes post-vaccine, the patient stated he was not feeling well and feeling warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided the patient with water and an ice pack. The patient stated he was feeling faint. The patient fainted for about 20 seconds and then became conscious again. The patient didn&#39;t have any injuries and didn&#39;t fall down. The patient was okay and he laid down and elevated his feet on a chair. He then stated that he has severe needle phobia and has fainted several times in the past with vaccine administration and blood draws. He had experienced this in the past. He was still slightly faint and requested that he be checked out. The EMT arrived and they took his vitals and checked him. By the time the EMT arrived, he was beginning to feel better and had sat up and drinking water. There were no further issues. The EMT stated he was good to head home. We followed up with patient and the patient was feeling good with no further issues.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00am on March 18, 2021 at the Community Center. By about 5:00pm, I started to feel minor flu-like symptoms, but as the night progressed it got significantly worse. Around 8-9pm, I was bedridden with the worst chills/shaking I&#39;ve ever experienced in my life. Around 9:30-10:00pm, I was filling water at my sink and projectile vomitted multiple times into the sink and could not make it to the bathroom. Subsequently, I ate a bagel and drank lots of water, knowing my vomitting could make me dehydrated. Throughout the night, I was awake and shaking, and drank and filled my water bottle repeatedly. At 8:00am, I was filling my water, and without my knowledge of awareness, fainted on my kitchen floor, dropping the Brita filter and likely hitting my head. My roommate heard the commotion and saw me passed out in our kitchen. He tried to wake me up and I phased in, but then subsequently phased out again 20-30 seconds later as I was trying to stand and likely hit my head again. My roommate eventually got me over to our couch and called EMTs. Upon their arrival, EMTs checked my pulse, which was fine, and saw an open laceration on the back of my head, so they took me to Hospital to access the Trauma Center. On the way, I threw up repeatedly and was very lightheaded. Upon my arrival at Hospital, I was checked for any neck bone breaks, given an IV, a CT  scan, an EKG, and staples were placed in the back of my head to heal the laceration. After my release, I was bedridden for 2-3 days and required a daily nap during work (1-2) hours for the next 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. For a while, everything was fine, but recently during the first two weeks of April, it has become apparent that my head is foggy and reacts to changes in the weather, which leads me to believe that I likely banged my head pretty good when I fainted those two times.

I realized he had passed out . I held his arm and said his name he immediately jerked awake and did not know where he was or what he was doing.  He drank some Gatorade and ate a couple of chocolate kisses.  He began to have cold sweats that lasted a few minutes.  I sat with him in counseling room for 15 minutes and then he sat in waiting room  until he felt better.  He did not feel that he needed further attention or medical assistance.

                                                On 04/04/21, around 11 AM, the customer walked in for his COVID vaccine appointment.  After registering for the vaccine , the patient sat in the designated area and one of our immunizing technicians administered the vaccine while I was observing and I left the immunization area while my technician was finishing up cleaning. When the patient asked the immunizing technician a question about side effects, she offered him to talk to the pharmacist at the consultation window. While I was assisting the next customer, I heard a loud sound and saw the customer collapsing on the floor. I ran outside and checked his pulse, and asked to call 911. He was conscious and breathing. I went inside the pharmacy to get EpiPen and informed the customer that I will be administering EpiPen, but he denied it. In the meantime, the immunizing technician was already on hold with 911 and informed that they are on the way. The customers in the waiting area also kept him engaged and were watching him if he is alert. The store manager on duty was also in the pharmacy area. I came inside the pharmacy and offered the patient a chair to sit in. Paramedics arrived in a few minutes to transport him to the hospital. The patient came back to the pharmacy around 2:30PM to collect his immunization card and when I inquired about how he is doing, the patient informed me that he is feeling more better and the ER determined that there was no allergic reaction to the vaccine but the patient most likely stood up too quickly after the vaccine was administered.

As I took the step back towards him, he spontaneously started to sit up and speak. Was diaphoretic, still slow speech eyes glossy. I supported him as best I could. His HR was 42, i lifted his legs up unto to a chair in quazi trandelenburg position. He stated that made him feel alot better. I stayed with him until EMTS arrived. He got himself onto they stretcher and they took him out of the store.

On April 16th I still had the headaches and leg pain , but also while driving I began loosing my vision and started to pass out/faint. I Pulled over and waited at least a half hour. during that time I. noticed I couldn&#39;t type or read anything on my phone as I was trying to reach a friend to help me. eventually after time had passed I was able to drive myself to a friends where I thought the best thing would be to sleep it off. the headaches and leg pain lasted a couple more days and I thought it was going to go away, but it is now May 5th and today and last couple days the leg pain feels more like someone has been punching my left leg. five had chest pain and headaches return. I do not have medical insurance and have avoided going to the hospital or primary care because I am afraid. today the pain is so irritating and sore I wish I could escape my body.

There were no signs of passing out before I did either time.

                                                The patient had symptoms of light-headedness, diaphoresis, and was pale approximately 8 minutes after administration.  No signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis were identified so the patient was observed and monitored.  The patient then became unconscious for approximately 10-15 seconds with small jerking movements identified during this time. 911 was called and the patient was monitored until EMS arrived.  Epinephrine was prepared and ready during this whole time but was not administered because the patient didn&#39;t show symptoms of anaphylaxis (trouble breathing or talking, trouble swallowing, hives, flushing etc).  The  time from vaccine administration to EMS arrival was approximately 20-25 minutes.   The patient was able to talk and communicate clearly the entire time except during the brief unconscious period.

                                                ED NOTE is as follows...from 4/21/21 @ 21:47    a 28 y.o. male who to the emergency room with reports of a headache for the last 48 hours.  He reports this as being one of the worst headaches he has ever had.  He was seen at urgent care and given Toradol, Zofran and Benadryl and still rates his pain an 8 out of 10.  He does feel pressure behind his eyes.  And reports vomiting in the parking lot at urgent care.  He denies abdominal pain back pain, neck pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, numbness or tingling or any other worsening concerns.  Reports that he did receive a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  Patient states he does vape.  He occasionally drinks alcohol he denies any illicit drugs.  Patient denies any head trauma.   Diagnosis management comments: This is a 28-year-old male arrives to the emergency room with reported migraine headache for the last 48 hours.  He did report that he was go to urgent care in which he received a migraine cocktail of Zofran, Benadryl and Toradol.  Patient reported that his headache was not resolved so urgent care sent him on for further evaluation.  Patient upon arrival had a negative neurological exam however he did report that he had pressure behind his eyes.  Was unable to see any papilledema on funduscopic exam.  Check patient&#39;s pressures bilaterally and they were 21 and 18.  Patient did report to me that this was the worst headache of his life.  I did administer IV fluids here as well as Tylenol and morphine.  Patient did report some improvement.  Patient did report in his past medical history had a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  A CBC and CMP was obtained.  Did have thrombocytopenia with a count of 66.  Since my exam was PERRL with normal extraocular movements.  He had no eye redness or eye pain.  Of low concerns for any iritis or uveitis.  Patient&#39;s patient CT of his head did show a abnormal CT that had a dense appearing superior sagittal sinus that was representing a venous thrombosis.  Radiologist did recommend a MRI MRV.  An MRI and MRV was ordered.  Patient MRI MRv did show findings are consistent with a venous thrombosis involving the right jugular right transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus there is also a patchy edematous change within the subcortical white matter areas bilaterally and symmetrically.  There was no CVA.  With patient&#39;s reported migraine headache.  Reported blurred vision, low platelets, recent vaccination I do believe patient has vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.  With this finding I did converse with my overseeing physician Calls were made out to neurology and then a call out did prefer to have patient started on IVIG at 1 g/kg daily for 2 days and blood thinner Xarelto 15 mg p.o. twice daily.  These orders were initiated.  Internal med services was consulted and with conversations of family, internal med services out possible transfer that an interventionalists could be available if patient needed it.  Report was given at 2100 upon my end of shift.

                                                vasovagal syncope or seizure? After receiving the drive-through vaccine, we drove into a parking space to sit and make sure I was ok. Within 5-10 minutes, I was sitting in the car and sending a text and with no warning whatsoever mid-text lost consciousness, profuse sweating, wheezing, lost color in my skin, was making unintelligible noises, and eventually woke up about a minute later but couldn&#39;t speak or comprehend those speaking to me (according to my wife who was terrified).  I was not nervous, stressed, or scared of receiving a vaccine. I regained the ability to speak about a minute later and my wife had summoned the staff on the scene who instructed me to lie back and breathe without a mask. I drank some liquids. A nurse was called over and offered to take my vital signs but I decided I felt ok enough not to. Eventually my normal skin color and came back and sweating stopped after about 5 minutes. We sat for a few extra minutes and once I felt it was past me,  my wife drove us home.

                                                I had extreme chest pain on the 24th of March. It really hurt to breathe and it felt like I had pressure on my chest. I went to the Emergency room and they did a chest x-ray and a Covid-19 both of which were negative. I went home and I returned to the ER because the chest pain became worse. The chest X-Ray the second day showed I had pneumonia. I was told that it could have been from the Covid-19 in December or if was community acquired.  I was prescribed with antibiotics and discharged. I still feel some chest pain  after about a week and I have already finished the full course of antibiotics. I&#39;ve seen my Primary Care physician, my cardiologist and my Pulmonologist.

I asked him to take slow deep breaths, gave him some water. About after 1 more minute he passed out (very unresponsive but still breathing, pupils very dilated) pulse was slow but still palpable. Tried ammonium smelling salts, that did not bring patient around. Called 911. Tried patting patient and talking to patient to bring them back to consciousness. After about a minute or two patient was able to respond to me. He knew his name and date of birth and where he was. Asked him to wait for ambulance to check vitals. Patient said he still felt very dizzy. Kept his head down and eyes closed. Once EMS arrived they checked his vitals, determined BP was low (they did not tell me a number). They monitored patient&#39;s vitals for 10-15 minutes. BP did not &#34;bounce back&#34; per EMS so they took him to the hospital for IV drip possibly.

                                                Patient received vaccine at around 11am.  After waiting around for a few minutes he stated he was light headed.  I went over to observe and gave patient some water.  He was starting to sweat and turned very pale.  1 minute later he passed out.  I brought him to the floor from his chair and he  starting shaking and &#39;seizing&#34; for about 10-15 seconds.  We used pressure on his chest to try to &#34;snap&#34; him out of it.  After about 15 seconds of &#34;seizing,not breathing normally and his left arm completely locked up&#34; he came to and did not know where he was for about 2-3 minutes.  After about that time he started to realize where he was and recognized his wife who was assisting.  EMS was called and arrived shortly,  He was lucid and knew where he was and started to feel normal again.  EMS checked his vitals and they were normal.  Patient refused to go to hospital and EMS released him to his wife.  I checked on patient 4 hours later and he had no ill effects and stated he felt just like he did before receiving the vaccination.

                                                CPT administered Janssen COVID-19 vaccine to the pt 4/5. While sitting in the pharmacy area for his 15 minute observation period, he fainted. He said that he was texting on his phone and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground with people around him asking if he was ok. He stated that he was very sweaty, nauseous, and a little dizzy. We called a code white, provided the pt with a cold compress and elevated his feet. Pt did not want us to call 911. Pt did not have PCP and has not been to a doctor in about 5 years. He said he was very nervous getting the shot and is afraid of needles so that may have contributed. Pt stayed in the pharmacy area for about 45 minutes until he started to feel better and his mom came to get him. I tried calling pt again at 7:10pm to check in, but there was no answer and I could not leave a voicemail due to mailbox being full.

                                                I developed extreme body aches and chills along with an extreme fever, and it progressed throughout the night until I was delirious. I fainted once trying to take medication (ibeprofen) in the bathroom. I never measured the fever because I was delirious and could hardly move due to pain. I have never felt so sick in my life and I am a healthy 30 year old with no other health issues. I am feeling better this morning but have lingering symptoms of chills and aches. I am reporting this because the intensity of the reaction seemed overwhelmingly extreme and scary for someone of my health and age.

I requested the patient sit for another 15 minutes before leaving to which he obliged and thanked me before leaving.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

After washing my hands, I turned to the towel and vaguely remember falling to the floor. When I came to, I was too weak to get up. I laid there for 5 minutes before struggling to sit. After some time I was able to weakly return to bed and drank some rehydration tablets. My best guess was I had been drinking water but not replenishing my electrolytes.

                                                Seizure - I have never had a seizure before and there is no history of epilepsy in my family. I had the Janssen vaccine shot at around 5PM on Thursday and felt mostly fine on Friday. I had typical shot symptoms (tired and soreness near injection sight). On Friday night around 10:00, I was standing talking to one of my friends in the living room when I had a blackout seizure without any warning. The seizure only lasted about 30-45 seconds, and then I became conscious again. It took me about 5-10 minutes to become completely aware and able to stand up. I have never had a seizure before and have not had one since then.  Later the following week, I did have a couple of hours where I felt extremely dizzy and lightheaded, but it went away without another seizure. This is also not typical for me.

                                                a 31 year old man who received the  COVID-19 vaccine on March 27, 2021 in the  Public Health Department parking lot. Upon arrival and check in, the patient declined any comorbidities and health history but did state that he was nervous. After administration of the vaccine by  NP, the patient lowered himself to the ground, from a sitting position, and had a 60 second tonic clonic seizure. Seizure precautions such as turning the patient on his side, supporting his head, and calling EMS were taken during the seizure. After 60 seconds, the patient came to and asked what happened. PPHD staff oriented the patient to what had happened, to which he proceeded to say ?oh that is normal for me when I get anxious.? With the help of PPHD staff and his wife, the patient was brought to a sitting position and given a granola bar and water to his request. According to clinic lead RN, ?his skin was normal in appearance for race, ethnicity, and age. He was mildly diaphoretic. He verbalized feelings of anxiety and worry surrounding the vaccine.?   As EMS arrived on the scene and began assessing vital signs the patients anxiety appeared to increase; he became less verbal, closed his eyes, and his breathing pattern became shallow. The patient then had a second seizure at this time lasting approximately 25 seconds. When the patient came to he immediately verbalized, ?I?m good, I?m good, I?m fine?. He was slow to respond to verbal cues, but persistently refused transport to the local acute care hospital for further evaluation. He rested on the ground in supine position for approximately 25 minutes, with his partner and EMS at his side. Upon further evaluation of the patient and his wife, it was determined that the patient has a history of seizure activities when he is nervous and that he was ?expecting? this to happen. The patient continued to decline medical care and transportation to the hospital. The patient left in medically stable condition with his wife operating the vehicle.

                                                Patient was talking to a friend about five minutes after receiving the vaccine and suddenly passed out and fell to the floor.  He was awake again in about a minute.  The patient was sweating, pale and a little disoriented for a couple minutes but started improving steadily until he was feeling his normal self again.  The EMS was called but the patient declined being taken to the hospital as he felt much better by the time they arrived.

Upon standing up from the laying down position, I got lightheaded, started profusely sweating, became nauseous and ultimately lost consciousness. When I regained my consciousness, there was a loud ringing in my ears and my hands were numb. I took some Tylenol, laid down and it subsided shortly after. I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

He verbalized ahead of time that he has a history of fainting due to his fear of needles.  He does not have any allergic reaction to vaccine components.  After reviewing his PQCF and possible side effects of the vaccine, patient verbally consented to get vaccinated.  I administered the vaccine into the deltoid muscle of his right arm.  I gave him an ice pack.  Right after the vaccine was administered patient said he felt fine.  He relocated from the immunization booth to a Post Vaccine waiting chair with his wife by his side.  He fainted into his wifes&#39;s arms for about 30 seconds.  His father-in-law helped place him on his back on the floor and we raised his legs up on a chair.  Patient came to immediately when placed on supine position and said he just needed to rest.  We called Code White and assistant manager came to the scene.  Patient was conscious and verbalized that he was feeling fine but should just rest.  Patient continued to use ice pack and rested for about 30 minutes.

They ran CT scans and found multiple blood clots in both lungs, pulmonary embolism.  They put me on blood thinners and transferred me to another hospital.  There they monitored me for a couple days and released me with a prescription for blood thinners.

Felt as though nausea was impending. Sensation rose into skull in &#34;crawling waves&#34;. Skull felt heavy. Interpreted the sensation as disorientation. Asked pharmacist if dizziness was normal with the vaccine. Woke up a few seconds later picking myself up off the floor.

                                                The afternoon after I got the shot I went for a jog. When I returned, I got intense chills and a fever of 103 degrees along with some flu like symptoms. I had a slight headache. Ibuprofen helped but the next day I had similar symptoms, but they went away by the end of the day. On the third day I felt a little better, so I went for a run. I had some shortness of breath and it was difficult to breathe when I was running. I normally run 4 miles daily. The shortness of breath was present for a week after that and also started to happen intermittently even at rest. One week after the shot I saw a doctor and they did some testing but did not find anything definitive. Six weeks after the shot I went to the ER and they diagnosed with Thrombocytopenia. At this point it has been seven weeks the shortness of breath has improved, and I haven&#39;t experienced it for a few days.

                                                I typically faint when getting shots or blood drawn. I did faint about 10 seconds after the initial shot injection. I was conscious throughout but was not able to speak clearly or control my body even though I could hear everything going on around me. After 30 minutes, I was feeling back to normal. The remainder of the day I felt drowsy and a little out of it. At 12:15am I began to get severe chills and shakes. This lasted throughout the night but was the worst from about 12:15-1:00am. I woke up at 4am with a fever and sweating. My entire body was stiff and in pain with aches specifically in my arms and legs. Very sore pain in my left deltoid where the shot was injected and is still slightly sensitive. It felt like my veins were stiff and in pain and it hurt to move. I had what I can describe as flu like symptoms (i.e. my teeth hurt, my body ached, fever, shakes, body stiffness and overall tiredness and weakness). These all lasted until about 6:30am at the worst and were relieved over the next few hours. I started to feel back to normal around 3pm later that day. That was April 11th. Last night, April 12th, I had trouble sleeping because my left arm was in pain from my elbow to fingers. It was a lingering pain that went away by this morning and  is mostly gone now (morning April 13th).

                                                Covid-19 vaccine JJ: 32 y.o. male w/ no PMH presenting 2 weeks after receiving his Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine after having severe L calf pain found to have thrombocytopenia.    From H&amp;P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&amp;J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation. As he has had 2 negative US for DVT, unlikely that he has an unresolved DVT. abdominal and head CT are neg for thrombosis.

He was having panic attack due to injection. Called 911. We made him comfortable and then in 5 minutes he started to faint. Ex-Ems was next to him, he started asking him questions and make sure he was awake. Within 5 minutes EMS arrived and they took over, checked all his vitals and found out patient did not eat or drink for whole day and had phobia with needles. Patient refused to go to hospital. Per EMS recommendation patient had drink and a bagel. Patient&#39;s relative came and took him home.

I parked my vehicle and didn?t feel well so I switched seats with my girl friend. As soon as I got into the passenger seat I was out. She said My eyes rolled back in my head and I started shaking and eyes at this point she said where going up down and side to side . She ran for help and after about 1-2 minutes I  woke up. I thought I passed out so I instantly put my feet on the dash of my car and the pharmacist gave me water and chocolate milk.  He then checked my heart rate it seemed good  and after 20 minutes he let us go home.

                                                After administration of Janssen vaccine 0.5mL, pt reported arm was hurting and he began moving arm.  CMA noticed that continued to shake arm after 5 minutes but patient was alert and oriented x 3.  CMA thought the way he was shaking his arm seemed irregular so she advised pt he would be taken to an observation area for further observation.  Half way to the observation area, pt reported to CMA that he was seeing spots and felt like he was going to get sick.  CMA called for help.  Patient experienced a syncopal event just as he made it to the chair.  Several staff was helping to support patient.  Legs were lifted to another chair.  Patient was not responsive for a short time, very diaphoretic, breathing regular and unlabored.  Patients eyes then rolled upward toward the ceiling and patient&#39;s entire body began shaking uncontrollably while staff managed to keep patient from falling to floor from the chair.  Once patient was conscious, he was able to state his name but reported he was very confused and could not think clearly.  He was able to sit upright.  In the meantime while patient was shaking uncontrollably, staff sought urgent care provider to come and see patient.  Patient was then taken over to the urgent care side of the building to evaluate and treat patient.

When medics arrived, the patient had started to feel better and refused ER treatment. Medics left patient without doing vitals or assessments. Patient stayed at the vaccine clinic for another hour and then left after feeling better.

I got up to go to the bathroom and upon finishing, I felt my heart rate skyrocket and felt faint. I immediately went back to the bed where I lost consciousness. My wife said my eyes were open and my body was rigid. I came too within a minute of that and was breathing heavy and sweating and very fatigued. My wife had called 911 as I was coming back to consciousness. The EMTs checked my vitals and all was normal. They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and I said no. My back was extremely sore all day, and I developed small red spots around my eyes. I went to my doctor later that day and told them about it. They took my blood for tests, which I have not heard back about, and they did not conclude anything, but did set me up with an appointment for an MRI of my head, given my past history.

He received the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/8 and felt well afterwards. Last Friday (4/16) he began to experience constitutional symptoms (fever to 100.4, chills, night sweats feeling drenched, decreased appetite) so decided to get his labs drawn as an outpatient for further evaluation. Symptoms progressed until Tuesday, when they began to subside slightly. At that point, his labs resulted and were notable for thrombocytopenia. He got his labs redrawn the day before admission and it was noted that his thrombocytopenia was worsening, so he was directed to the ED for further evaluation.  Patient seen by hematology, started on dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily as well as IVIG treatment x2. MRV of brain without evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis  ***PATIENT CURRENTLY HOSPITALIZED***

I recovered well enough to drive home within 15 minutes afterwards. That night (10pm) I began shivering, which escalated to periods of convulsions, to which a mouth guard was needed to prevent chipping teeth and/or biting my tongue. There was no fever present, and to subside the uncontrollable shivering I sat in a very hot shower until motor functions gradually returned. Periods of headaches, joint pains and sweating ensued for the remainder of the night. There were no other symptoms in the following days.

                                                BLOOD CLOTS IN LEFT LUNG; TIRED; FEVERISH; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 34 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 175 pounds, height was 67 inches and Body mass index (NR: not provided) 27.4. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included non smoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders and no recent trauma or travel. The patient was active and ran for 30 mins every day. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number: 043AZ1A or 043A21A) frequency one total, dose was not reported, administered on 05-APR-2021 at 10:15 hours in left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05-APR-2021 in the evening, the patient experienced &#34;normal side effects&#34;, specifically tiredness and fever (temperature was not taken) and he took 2 Advil and went to bed. On 06-APR-2021 in the morning, he felt back to his normal baseline. On an unspecified date of APR-2021 (08-APR-2021 or 09-APR-2021), he felt pain and tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing. He noticed that he had to work harder to do his daily run. On 13-APR-2021, when the symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency room. The patient had blood was taken (results not reported). A computerised tomography (CT) scan showed 2 blood clots in the left lung and duplex scans of both legs did not reveal a clot. A chest x-ray was done but results not provided. The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative, and he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous heparin. It was reported that no oxygen was given. On 14-APR-2021, he was discharged with Eliquis which he should continue for 6 months.  On 16-APR-2021, the chest pain was gone, and his breathing was better in the morning but still difficult later in the day. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from tired, and feverish, and was recovering from blood clots in left lung. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 34 year-old overweight male (BMI 27.4) was hospitalized for 2 blood clots in his left lung 8 days after receiving vaccination with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. He had no chronic medical conditions, was a nonsmoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders, no recent trauma or travel, and exercised every day. On the evening of his vaccination, he felt tired and fever (temperature not taken) and took 2 ibuprofen and went to bed. The following morning, he felt back to normal. Two or three days later, he felt pain/tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing; he found it more difficult to perform his daily exercise. Eight days after vaccination, when his symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency department where a CT scan showed 2 blood clots in his left lung. Covid-19 testing and duplex scans of his legs were negative. Blood tests were performed but results were unknown. He was hospitalized for 1 night, treated with IV heparin, and discharged the following day with apixaban. As of the time of this report, the chest pain had resolved and breathing was improved in the morning but still difficult later in the day. Based on the limited information (e.g. absence of blood test results), the relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant.

This is a 35-year-old male with complex past medical history including bilateral lung transplant and renal transplant performed several years ago.  He both of them and regarding his transplant management.  He is on immunosuppressive medications.  He is here today out of concern for exposure to COVID.  He was vaccinated with Johnson Johnson vaccine on  3/4.  He is here cause overnight he started developed fever headache sore throat muscle aches.  If continued through today.  He was test in the outpatient setting but the results have not yet returned.  He is here today with continued symptoms.  He is well-appearing on exam but mildly tachycardic, low-grade temperature here no significant increased work of breathing no conversational dyspnea lungs are clear heart is regular but tachycardic without murmur he has no signs or symptoms of DVT currently.  His chest x-ray shows all isolated left lower lobe infiltrate.  His labs are unremarkable with normal renal function, normal electrolytes but is rapid COVID test is positive.  Given his immunosuppressive status in infiltrate seen on x-ray initially recommended admission for observation even though he is not initially on any supplemental oxygen is work of breathing is quite comfortable.  I was able to discuss with his transplant surgeon In addition I talked to admitting physician who then discussed with pulmonology here .  In their opinion the best management for the patient would be to provide him with the monoclonal antibody treatment but this can only be performed in the outpatient setting given he has no increased work of breathing no supple ox requirement currently that he is stable for discharge.  He has a pulse monitor at home will also enroll him in a COVID home program.  Pulmonology will call him for follow-up tomorrow.  When I discussed with  they currently do not have any beds available at the hospital for transport.  The patient does not want to go to an outside facility that has a transplant team other than the risks of.  Ultimately the patient would like to go home.  I will add doxycycline for bacterial possibility of his pneumonia seen on x-ray today.  He also had very strict return precautions.  He understands likely had a possibility of worsening symptoms understands to return immediately if any new or worsening symptoms or no improvement.  Patient was given the monoclonal antibody treatment in the ER after ordered by Dr..  He will ultimately be discharged with very close follow-up.

                                                During the evening around 6pm after I started developing symptoms consistent with the flu.    Fever reached 104 around 8pm.  Uncontrollable chills also were present.  A severe headache followed.  I took fever reducing meds immediately. Confusion and trouble breathing happened during the fever and chills period.  An attempt to go to the hospital was unsuccessful because I lost consciousness while attempting to find phone/car keys.   After I woke up, I felt less confused and could catch my breath, so I decided to take more fever reducing meds and see how I felt in a few hours - this was around 11pm.  Around midnight my fever broke and the chills stopped, but the headache was at the worst it&#39;s been. The headache lasted the entire next day as well.      I wanted to go to the doctor, but was physically unable to and had no one to alert.  I do feel better today.  I have some weak headaches that come and go, along with muscle aches, but I feel that they are minor enough.

I was sweating profusely, experience nausea and then fainted and had a mild seizure. After coming to consciousness, I vomited and the pharmacy staff called the paramedics. I was extremely pale and the fever persisted for several minutes while waiting for the paramedics. I recovered and felt mostly normal after being given saline solution and anti-nausea medication. Hours after being released from the hospital, I have waves of cold chills and hot flashes.

He started feeling sick and got up to go to the restroom. On his way to the restroom, he passed out and fell in the hallway. We then got him to a seat and gave him some water and orange juice. The patient was adamant that we not call an ambulance for him, so we made the patient stay seating under our direct supervision. He sat in the waiting room for about an hour until someone could come to pick him up. By the time someone arrived to take him home, he seemed to be doing much better.

There was no blood in my pee or discoloration however I had to clean my penis tip with a tissue and noticed a blood cloth came out while I was wiping. This concerns me but that was the only time I saw blood, there was none afterward nor has it occur since then.

                                                Patient went to the hospital Monday.  He received the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine on Thursday, April 8 and by Saturday, April 10 he was starting to develop fairly significant peripheral edema without any breathing  difficulties.  This  persisted and was worse by Monday, April 13  EKG showed global nonspecific T-wave abnormalities and ST segment changes so I had him sent to the ER. As it turned out he had a pancytopenia (mostly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) so he was admitted to the hospital. This seemed to resolve pretty much on its own and so they attributed everything to his hepatitis C. Indeed his LFTs are elevated in the 300 range and imaging showed  hepatosplenomegaly.  they also did a bone marrow biopsy for which there are no results yet

When they went to check on him today they found him deceased in his chair.  Further investigation would be needed.

Patient called our OP line on 04/17 complaining of fever of 102 and chills. He was instructed to go to local lab and get labs done. They drew basic labs as well as blood cultures. On Sunday, the patient reported his fever was gone and he felt better. Today, he was feeling SOB and presented to his PCP. They ordered a CTA which reportedly showed bilateral PEs. They sent him to the local ED who transferred him here. Of note, his INR has been supratherapeutic for several weeks and pharmacy has been adjusting his warfarin dosing. The patient tested COVID negative prior to transfer. The vaccine lot number information is not accessible to this reporter.

                                                JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE EUA  I received the vaccine on 3rd April, 2021, at approximately 9:30 am. There were no immediate side effects. Approximately 10 hours later I began to feel EXTREME cold and chills. So much so that I had to put on 3 layers of clothing, socks and cover myself with 3-4 blankets. I also experienced a fever and body soreness. My wife tended to me with two ibuprofen tablets, 200 mg each and continually to put cold presses on my forehead. I drank a lot of water but my fever continued to spike to 102.8. The symptoms continued for another 3 hours. Out of concern we called the emergency room to ask if we should be concerned about the fever. We were advised to take two Tylenol tablets. My wife gave me two Tylenol PM tablets. About 30 mins after taking the Tylenol tablets and continuing to hydrate, my cold and chills began to subside and I began to shed all of my layers. About 30 minutes after that, my fever levelled out to abougt 100.8. Then I passed out. The following morning, I woke up with cold, chills and fever gone. I had a mild headache and took 2 Extra Strength Tylenol tablets. It&#39;s been four hours since then and I feel fine, just a little weak.

                                                patient got his vaccine, put his shirt back on and buttoned it up and asked if it should be sore already.  I told him, yes the shot may cause some discomfort after injection and he was standing at this point.  He was about to say something and he fell backwards and hit a mobile laptop cart and the wall.  The patient went unconscious not talking but breathing was given an epipen and 911 called vaccine given a few minutes before 12:30 and 911 called at 12:29.  He regained consciousness fairly quickly and was assessed by the pharmacist and then EMT and transported to the hospital for monitoring.

About 3-4 minutes after his vaccine, he slumped over in the chair and was unresponsive. The pharmacist and store manager stayed with him as a technician called 911. He was unresponsive for about 30 seconds before he came to but then continued to go in and out of consciousness for the next couple of minutes. He said he had a history of dizziness after vaccines. When he was finally able to hold a conversation with us, he said he felt hot and we gave him a cold bottle to put on his head until the paramedics arrived. His blood pressure was 100/50 when the paramedics arrived about 7-10 minutes after we called and patient was fully responsive then. Paramedics continued to monitor him and followed him home to make sure he was okay.

                                                I woke up 7 days after receiving the vaccine with shooting sharp pains across my abdominal / midsection. While attempting to go to the bathroom, I must have passed out because I woke up some time later on the floor with a busted face and nose, and a severe headache.  Initially the day after the shot, I had sharp shooting pains down my right leg. I have also had a headache on more days since getting the vaccine.  Mental fog and tiredness is also occurring a few days after the initial shot.

He said he was feeling better, so I helped him into the chair. I sat with him for about 15 minutes and he was alert and seemed completely fine. I asked if he had ever had a problem after a vaccine, and he said that he fainted once after a vaccine more than 20 years ago. (He claimed on question 4 of the questionnaire that he had never fainted after a vaccine.) I had him call for a ride home and for someone to pick up his car. He waited another 45 minutes and left. I checked on him frequently throughout the hour he was here and he reported he was fine each time.

Subsequent to passing out I vomited a few times and could not hold anything down. I also urinated on myself at some point when out. I was not getting better so 911 was called and I was transported to the emergency room via ambulance. Once the ambulance arrived at the hospital I vomited again filling about half of the vomit bag. I arrived at the hospital and an IV was not able to be administered so I was given Zofran for nausea and Gatorade to try and hold down. I spent approximately 4 hours in the ER, was able to finally get to the point where the nausea calmed down and I was able to walk around. I was then discharged.

                                                While sitting down during the post-vaccination period, patient asked his wife for water about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Pharmacy staff provided water and pharmacist went over to check on the patient. Patient expressed feeling &#34;hot&#34; and wanted an ice-pack, which was given. Patient expressed feeling &#34;faint,&#34; after which he briefly lost consciousness. Pharmacist immediately started checking for pulse and obtained Emergency Kit. Patient regained consciousness quickly without need of CPR or administration of Emergency Kit medications. At some point patient also released his bladder,  most likely during the syncope episode. Patient expressing feeling &#34;nauseous&#34; and asked for something to throw up in. Pharmacist quickly got a trash can and gave to patient, shortly after which patient started vomiting. Pharmacist was attending to patient and asked patient if he wanted 911 to be called, to which he replied &#34;No&#34; and that he just needed some time to sit. Patient also stated he did not eat much that day. Pharmacist offered Pedialyte, to which patient agreed, in order to replenish fluids/electrolytes lost due to vomiting. Patient also asked for some crackers since he did not eat much earlier. After taking sips of Pedialyte and taking bites of crackers, patient could not hold anything down and continued to vomit. At that time patient&#39;s wife asked pharmacy staff to proceed with calling 911. 911 was called and paramedics took patient&#39;s vitals upon arrival at the scene. Vitals were all stated to be normal. Patient agreed to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. A couple hours later patient&#39;s wife informed pharmacy staff that patient was doing much better and was expected to be released from hospital soon. Before receiving vaccination, patient did share that in the past he had &#34;felt faint&#34; when giving blood but it was not made clear that patient had felt faint or fainted during vaccinations prior. After the incident patient&#39;s wife confirmed that patient had fainted in the past both after giving blood and after receiving vaccinations. Pharmacist called patient at 9:12 AM the following day (4/3/21) to see how patient was doing but was only able to leave a voicemail message.

Pt then laid back in the chair and became unresponsive, but still conscious. Pharmacy team, moved patient to the floor, where he immediately became responsive and color came back to skin. It is noted that the patient was sweating at the time of the event, and he stated he does not do well with shots. All of this took place within 15 minutes of receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine.

I felt nauseous and thought I would vomit, but didn&#39;t and believe I lost consciousness again. I was able to make it to the sink to try to wash my hands, and I fell down on my knees. I knew I was bleeding somewhere but didn&#39;t know from where (my right pinky was cut on an item in the bathroom when I fell). My wife made it to me, and I lost consciousness a couple more times while talking with her. I laid on the bathroom floor for a

When I awoke I was still sweating and cold for the next five to ten minutes.  Paramedics checked my vital signs onsite afterwards (blood pressure, sugar levels, and pulse) and everything appeared to be normal.  I was able to drive home 30 minutes later after making sure that all side effects subsided.  I have not experienced any other side effects from the vaccine.

Rph had reviewed information on consent form including whether he had had any adverse effects to a vaccine that required immediate medical care. His notation on the consent form and verbal information provided to rph prior to injection was no. Immediately after the injection is when he said he should have mentioned that he has fainted in the past when receiving an immunization. EMS was contacted to assess patient and whether it was safe for him to leave pharmacy. EPS monitored blood pressure and other vitals and patient said he felt well enough to leave on his own after 30 minutes observation by rph

Then, on Monday April 12, 2021, I went to the gym where I worked out. When I came home and after showering, I returned a phone call shortly after 8 P.M. While speaking on the phone, I could tell after a few minutes of talking something was off, and then all of a sudden, the words stopped coming out. After a few more seconds, I was trying to yell upstairs to my wife for help. I sounded like a goat while trying to yell that word. I then snapped out of it, and was able to speak clearly and normal again. I told my wife and called back my friend. My friend said I sounded like I was getting sick when I had the attack. The next morning I went to the hospital. I was diagnosed with a Transient Ischemic Attack &#34;TIA.&#34;

                                                Patient received vaccine and immediately felt light-headed and faint. He turned white upon standing and sat back down. He continued to have labored breathing and starting sweating. We were monitoring him and he informed us that it was anxiety related. He couldn&#39;t move his hands and started blacking out. When EMT arrived he started to feel better. They were able to rule out an allergic reaction and it was most likely anxiety related. Patient refused to go to the hospital and was walked out by EMT to make sure he could drive home.

On Sat, May 1, I had an afib episode in the morning. Reset to sinus rhythm the next morning around 2:30am. I spoke with you during the episode.   3. On Mon, May 3, I had brain fog. I?m usually tired after an afib episode. But this seemed different. I?ve never experienced something like this before. But I chalked it out to the after effects of the afib and moved on. 4. On Fri, May 7, I started having the stiffness in my right calf. I checked in with you that weekend to make sure it wasn?t a clot. After we spoke I think we ruled out a clot.  5. In addition, I?ve developed some added symptoms since then: (i) Sweaty feet. (ii) Pins and needles sensation in feet.  (iii) Tightness in the arch of the right foot. (iv) Feet and hands feel sensitive to cold.  (v) Burning sensation in feet and left hand.  (vi) Mild headache mostly felt in the left temple.  (vii) A pulling feeling on the left side of the face. (viii) A feeling that if I close my eyes, I may faint.

THE VACCINE WAS GIVEN WITHOUT INCIDENT AND PATIENT SAID HE FELT OK. HE TRADED PLACES WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND SAT IN A CHAIR IN THE EXAM ROOM. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIS GIRLFRIEND HER VACCINE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS FEELING FUNNY. HIS COLORING CHANGED AND HE WAS DIAPHORETIC. I GOT A PAPERTOWEL WITH COOL WATER ON IT AND PLACED ON HIS NECK AND ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS FOREHEAD. AFTER A MINUTE OR SO, HE DID PASS OUT WHILE IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN CAME BACK TO AND WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED X 4 BUT STILL FELT VERY WEAK. I GAVE HIM A WATER TO SIP ON. HIS GIRLFRIEND STAYED AT HIS SIDE THE WHOLE TIME. HIS O2 WAS 100% AND HIS PULSE 53. HE SAID THAT HE HAD EATEN SHORTLY BEFORE COMING TO GET HIS VACCINE BUT THEN LATER ASKED FOR AN APPLE BECAUSE HE WAS ON A CLEANSE DIET AND REALLY HAD NOT EATTEN MUCH. THE PCT WENT TO GET HIM AN APPLE. AFTER EATING THE APPLE AND SITTING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN HE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE. STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HIS GIRLFRIEND COMMITTED TO DRIVING HIM SO HE DID NOT HAVE TO. HE LEFT WITH NO ASSISTANCE.

                                                Pt had history of anaphylaxis related to bee stings. We asked if he had ever had a reaction to another vaccine and he said no. Pt came up saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the observation period, within about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccination. He look very pale and clammy. I asked if he was ok and he shook his head. Tried to grab a chair for him and he started to collapse. With some help I was able to get him to the ground without injury. We called 911 and I grabbed an epipen. I tried to assess the patient, and he was unable to tell me if he was having any trouble breathing or if his lips/mouth/tongue was swelling. He was conscious but couldn&#39;t speak coherently. I administered the epipen to his right lateral thigh due to his history of anaphylaxis with bee stings. We were able to lay him down while waiting for the ambulance. His color started to return and he was able to respond to questions, but was still slightly confused. He did tell me at this point that he has had similar reactions after vaccines and blood work. The paramedics arrived and took the patients vitals and took him to the hospital.

At around 2am April 11 I went to use the bathroom and blacked out. My wife found me on the floor and was able to rouse me. Went to the ER with severe stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, severe headache, fever, high pulse of 120-140bpm. Pulse dropped to 108bpm by the time i got to te hospital. Hospital administered Zofran for my gastro issues and ran an EKG. We waited 3&#43; hours and never saw a doctor and was never even taken back in the ER. We left due to staff and patients in the waiting room not wearing respirators or masks or even basic sanitary precautions or separation of patients with Covid symptoms from other patients.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.
