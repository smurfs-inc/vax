                                                Had no side effects whatsoever for many hours. Felt completely fine until about 7:30 pm, while I was making my plate of dinner. Felt lightheaded, dizzy, and hot. I began to black out, so I sat down, which helped for a few moments to subside lightheadedness. I was still feeling hot, so I walked a few feet to my back door and sat down on the steps outside to cool off. Within minutes, my vision blurred completely, I saw stars, and completely blacked out. My mother, who was nearby, heard me fall on the steps. She said my eyes rolled back, my body was completely limp, I was not breathing but rather making gurgling noises from my throat. She propped my head up, which allowed me to breathe properly, and I came to.   If my mother had not been nearby, I am convinced I would be dead right now. I saw the light, saw the other side, saw my relatives. I have had a near death experience once before, and this was exactly like that.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                a 27 y.o. female with a history of Covid infection December 26, 2020, positive covid test December 29, 2020. She had approximately 2 weeks of symptoms including generalized body ache and generalized weakness.  Fatigue and some headache.  Had some persistence of symptoms after that time.  Had some benefit from ibuprofen.   Was seen at emergency room on January 27, 2021 stating that she felt that all her symptoms of Covid had resolved except for some chest pain which awoke her on January 27.  She presented to the emergency room.  Had sinus tachycardia at 113 but otherwise unremarkable physical exam, laboratory studies with white blood count elevated 16,004-20, hemoglobin 13.7 g hematocrit 41.8%, MCV 87.1, RDW 12.7%, platelet count 329,000, segs 72.8%, lymphs 20.6%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 1%, basophil 0.6%.  BUN 10.1, creatinine 0.8, AST 24, ALT elevated 56, alkaline phosphatase 68, total protein 7.6, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.6, globulin by subtraction 4.0, troponin less than 0.02, D-dimer quantitative 0.22, urine pregnancy test normal.  Chest x-ray normal.  Chest pain appears to be musculoskeletal and was reproduced by palpation of her chest wall.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  D-dimer was normal.  Heart rate returned to normal after some intravenous fluids.  Patient discharged on Zithromax 500 mg day 1 and then to 50 mg days 2 through 5.  Also continued on ibuprofen.   Received Johnson and Johnson vaccine April 5, 2021.  Over the next week patient started having increasing soreness.  Her joints hurt more than usual and her headache was worse.  She had a sensation that her legs were &#34;numb and tingly&#34; starting at her buttocks and extending down her leg.   Because of reported incidence of cerebral sinus thrombosis or cerebral vein thrombosis patient appropriately presented for screening in the emergency room and was sent for appropriate imaging.   April 16, 2021 CT scan of head with and without contrast no acute intracranial hemorrhage, no mass-effect or midline shift.  On contrast-enhanced images there appears to be a lobular nonocclusive filling defect in the far lateral right transverse sinus.  Lobular occlusive filling defect is also likely present in the mid to central right transverse sinus.  Short segment filling defect in the medial left transverse sinus.  Remainder of sinuses and internal cerebral veins are patent.  Focal lobular filling defect within the confluence of the right and transverse sinus most likely related to arachnoid granulation.  No edema hemorrhage of the cerebellum or cerebrum.  No other significant findings.   April 16, 2021 confirmatory MRI angiogram of head without contrast with no restricted diffusion to suggest acute or subacute infarct.  Contrast void in the middle to central right transverse sinus consistent with occlusive thrombus.  Nonocclusive thrombus in the far lateral right transverse thrombus.  Narrowing of the medial left transverse sinus without complete occlusion.   April 16, 2021 2345 hrs. inital hematology consultation.  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels have been requested stat and are still pending.  If fibrinogen level is low will replace with cryoprecipitate.  If D-dimer is elevated barely confirms diagnosis of possible vaccine related thrombosis.  The fact the patient is not thrombocytopenic at this time is encouraging, however despite the lack of thrombocytopenia she still has clearly documented symptomatic nonocclusive and occlusive thrombus in her cerebral sinus.   From UPtoDate.com Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, also referred to as the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine) ? On April 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended pausing administration of AD26.COV2.S  to further investigate rare cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia [33]. As of that date, six cases had been reported, all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination; during this period, 6.8 million doses were administered (with 1.5 million doses in females of that age range) [121-123]. Since some vaccine recipients have not been followed for longer than the time frame over which these symptoms develop, the incidence may change with additional follow-up. Initial symptoms included headache, backache, chills, and fatigue, and progressed to focal neurologic deficits. Intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboses at other sites were also seen in some patients. All of the five patients who were tested for the anti-PF4 HIT antibody tested positive. Another case, in a young male who was a vaccine recipient in one of the pre-emergency use authorization efficacy trials, had been previously reported. These cases appear similar to those reported following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, another adenovirus-vector vaccine. Although rare, the observed number of events exceeded the expected rate among females &lt;50 years old. Given the extreme rarity of these events, the FDA and CDC acknowledge that they recommended the pause out of an abundance of caution and to ensure awareness of these rare events.    ?Evaluation and management of possible thrombotic complications ? Recipients should be aware of the possible association and seek immediate care for signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombocytopenia (eg, new petechiae or bruising) or thrombotic complications (including shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity edema, persistent severe abdominal pain, unabating severe headache, severe backache, new focal neurologic symptoms, and seizures) [117]. In such cases, some experts suggest evaluation with complete blood count and differential (including the platelet count), quantitative D-dimer, HIT testing, and imaging of any suspected site of thrombosis [113,114,125]. Onset 4 to 20 days after vaccination, platelet count &lt;150,000/microL, elevated D-dimer, and a positive anti-PF4 antibody (HIT antibody) suggest the diagnosis. Treatment with a non-heparin/non-warfarin anticoagulant (eg, argatroban or direct oral anticoagulant) and intravenous immune globulin has been suggested. The CDC recommends not using heparin in individuals with thromboses following receipt of Ad26.COV2.S unless HIT testing is negative [126]. (See &#34;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&#34; and &#34;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Terminology and HIT variants&#39; and &#34;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Role of IVIG&#39;.)   As stated above all the 6 cases were &#34;all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination&#34; this would certainly fit the timeframe that we are seeing in this case.  Recommendations from national guidelines would be to start treatment with dexamethasone immediately while awaiting intravenous gammaglobulin.  To pursue intravenous gammaglobulin treatment at 1 g/kg over 1 to 2 days.  It is recommended to avoid heparin and instead use direct factor X inhibitor such as Eliquis, which this patient is already been started on.     There is unfortunately considerable risk that even though patient&#39;s symptoms appear mild at this time, that she may deteriorate in the very near future and I would recommend treating her aggressively at this time with dexamethasone and intravenous gammaglobulin while we are awaiting further testing.  Patient clearly has had unusual thrombosis, especially in a 27-year-old.     With the fact that she had headache dating back to January, it is impossible to determine the acute versus chronic nature of her venous sinus thrombosis. Covid infection does cause increase in coagulation as well.  However, given the small risk of tragic outcome with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis in the setting of Covid vaccinations, we will proceed aggressively with treatment starting tonight with intravenous gammaglobulin and intravenous dexamethasone.     Will require rapid fasting glucoses to evaluate possible hyperglycemia from high-dose dexamethasone.  Will consider stopping dexamethasone at 48 hours.  Current recommendation for gammaglobulin would be single 1 g/kg or 500 mg/kg over 2 days.  No recommendations for treatment beyond this point.  Current recommendations for gammaglobulin dosing would recommend using an adjusted dose for patients with greater than 125% of their ideal body weight.  This patient at 122 kg on a 5 foot 2 inch frame does qualify for adjusted dose and her orders reflect that.   I appreciate the opportunity see this patient this evening and consultation requested by Dr.  We will follow patient in hospital.  Hopefully she will have gradual improvement and avoid any serious or tragic complications of her cerebral sinus thrombosis.     We will have pharmacy report possible adverse reaction to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to the FDA as required by law.   April 17, 2021 follow up. No new events.  Laboratory studies remained excellent.  White blood count is further elevated, however, this may be secondary to high-dose dexamethasone with a white blood count of 16,060.  Hemoglobin 14.0 g hematocrit 42.8%, MCV 86.8, RDW 12.9%.  Platelet count is actually increased slightly at 374 as of 9:10 AM this morning.  Differential shows left shift as expected with dexamethasone.  Results from yesterday showed fibrinogen normal at 369 (180?415) pro time normal at 10.4 seconds with INR of 0.97, PTT 26.7.  D-dimer 0.23 (0.19?0.50).  With platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer normal I am inclined to believe that this is not an acute post vaccination HIT-like phenomena.  If it were I would still expect to see some degree of thrombocytopenia elevated D-dimer and perhaps low fibrinogen.  The other explanations for her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are either idiopathic spontaneous and merely coincidentally associated at the exact same time as her Covid infection or more likely, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulable state secondary to her Covid infection from December 2020.  Unfortunatly there is no way to accurately date the acuity of the venous thrombosis in her cerebral sinus.  HIT Testing is still pending and most likely will not be available for 3-4 more days despite being ordered stat.  Have called the laboratory and asked them to check with our outside reference lab what the expected return time is on this test. (LabCorp says &#34;Tuesday April 20, 2021).  Patient refused intravenous gammaglobulin infusion which has been ordered last night.  Patient has been receiving dexamethasone which was a bridge until intravenous gammaglobulin could be administered.  Current guidance from the expert hematology panel (EHP) on Covid vaccine induced thrombosis dated April 7, 2021 from the  public health would state that a patient who has a reduced platelet count without thrombosis with a D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen or thrombosis with a normal platelet count and D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen are &#34;unlikely cases&#34;.  They recommend for probable cases who have D-dimers that are elevated to send HIT assay and then give immediate intravenous gammaglobulin while awaiting results.  They recommend fibrinogen supplementation, if needed.  They recommend a direct acting antithrombin agents such as the Eliquis this patient is receiving.  They recommend steroids particularly if there is a delay in getting intravenous gammaglobulin delivered.  With the fact that we now have 24 hours in the hospital with no evidence of thrombocytopenia, no evidence of increased fibrinolytic activity or active thrombosis, and no evidence of hypofibrinogenemia, I would argue that her presentation is subacute.  In this setting, I do not feel intravenous gammaglobulin would be necessary and does involve a small risk as well as considerable cost.  Dexamethasone also involves small risk and negligible cost. I have discontinued both of these medications.  My overall impression would be that this was not related to her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination which was recent, but rather her more distant Covid infection.  It is impossible to definitively answer the question however.  The next question is duration of anticoagulation.  Risk of recurrent cerebral sinus venous thrombosis is relatively small but the morbidity can be high.  Studies have been performed showing medications in the same class as Eliquis have been associated with a decrease in incidence of the recurrence.  Most hematologist recommend 3 months of anticoagulation for provoked venous thrombosis including cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.  I feel this patient&#39;s thrombosis is &#34;provoked&#34;, with her association at the same time of her Covid infection (and possibly vaccination).  I would recommend Eliquis (apixaban) 5 mg twice daily or Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 20 mg daily with food. I would feel comfortable in discharging patient for outpatient follow up IF Dr and other speciality services agree. Plan 3 months of full dose anticoagulation with direct factor X inhibitor.   Circulation 2010 Jun 29;121(25):2740-6 &#34;Long-term evaluation of the risk of recurrence after cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis&#34;, Background: The clinical course of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis (CSVT) is largely unknown because prospective studies with a long follow-up and with the goal to assess thrombosis recurrence rate and predisposing factors for recurrence are lacking. Methods and results: One hundred forty-five patients with a first CSVT were followed up for a median of 6 years after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. End points were recurrent CSVT or other clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism. CSVT recurred in 5 patients (3%) and other manifestations of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism) were seen in 10 additional patients (7%), for a recurrence rate of 2.03 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.14) for all manifestations of venous thromboembolism and 0.53 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 1.10) for CSVT. Nearly half of the recurrences occurred within the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis were male sex (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.86 to 32.7) and, for thromboses other than CSVT, severe thrombophilia resulting from antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency, anti-phospholipid antibodies, or combined abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 16.5). Conclusions: The risk of recurrent CSVT is low and is higher in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment and among men. Mild thrombophilia abnormalities are not associated with recurrent CSVT, but severe thrombophilia entails an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism.   April 19, 2021 Follow up, no change in condition. Discussed case with Dr, will order Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, anti phospholipid and anti cardiolipin antibodies, if she will allow draw. Expect Heparin Induced Thrombosis testing result tomorrow, but with no thrombocytopenia after given heparin, expect will be normal. Will await result. If discharged, would recommend 3 months direct thrombin inhibitor (Eliquis/Xarelto/Pradaxa) at full anticoagulation dose. Then stop, no taper. Overall still feel &#34;provoked&#34; thrombosis due to December Covid, unrelated to J&amp;J Covid vaccine, but can not definitively prove that..

On the third day previous symptoms went away and I got an extreme head cold, congestion, tiredness, lethargic. My varicose veins have been midly painful but it might be from laying all day for a week. On day five I started my menstrual cycle two weeks early, it was completely black and clumpy (not normal). It is now day 10 and I still have a slight cold, very tired, and am still on my period.

                                                I have severe, random, and unprovoked bruising covering both legs. I have abdominal pain that has persistent since being vaccinated. I?m dizzy. I?m bleeding in my urine, stool, and vaginally. Period came early (unrelated to previous vaginal bleeding) and is not clotting. Just significant amounts of red blood, soaking through one ultra absorbency tampon an hour. I have a headache. Went to the ER and my platelets were (345) and my blood sugar low. My bp was 145/90 which is high for me, from the bleeding.  They said I have a ?higher chance of being bitten by a shark? than having a side effect. They diagnosed me with a single contusion and sent me home. Have been feeling worse since leaving the hospital.

                                                Patient was about 15 weeks pregnant and this was her first pregnancy. Her anticipated due date was Oct 1st 2021. On April 9th 2021 during a scheduled doctor visit at 3pm both baby and mother were in good health.  On the same evening after the appointment she went for vaccination at Pharmacy and received the J&amp;J vaccine. After receiving the vaccine in about 15 mins she felt like urinating and noticed blood in the urine and felt vaginal dilation. Within the next 15 to 20 mins she started experiencing mild labor pains and contractions. In the next 30 mins she started bleeding and was immediately taken to the ER. In the ER it was confirmed that she was having a miscarriage and the fetus was delivered. She also had to undergo emergency surgery to remove any remaining placenta in the uterus.

Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                The adverse symptoms I experienced were abnormally severe/heavy menstrual bleeding and abdominal pain. I was on Day 4 of my menstrual cycle on the day of my injection (April 3, 2021). My menstrual cycle usually starts to go away on Day 4 and concludes by Day 7. But the day after my injection, in addition to experiencing the common side effects of fever, chills, aches, and headaches, I also experienced an uptick in bleeding, which included severe/heavy menstrual bleeding with very frequent and large blood clots. That same day (April 4), I started my new birth control cycle as prescribed. By Day 8 (April 7, 2021), my menstrual bleeding continued to be so severe/heavy that I went to my OB-GYN for testing. The OB-GYN ruled out everything but the vaccine as an environmental factor. It was suggested that I take 600mg of Motrin every 6-hours for 48 hours. My menstrual bleeding continued for several more days until concluding on Day 12 (April 11, 2021) but I am still experiencing abdominal pain.

                                                On April 16, 2021 (Day 13 after Vaccine) I was diagnosed with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of my femoral vein in my left leg by Hospital. In other words, I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my upper left leg. Pain in both my legs had started on April 13, 2021 (Day 10 after Vaccine). On April 16, I had a virtual appointment with my doctor, Dr. , who prescribed an ultrasound to rule out DVT.  I went to an ultrasound appointment at  Radiology at 3:30pm where a blood clot was found in my left leg. I was admitted into the emergency room at  Hospital and prescribed medication and follow ups from there.  These adverse symptoms developed after I submitted other adverse symptoms to VAERS on April 13, 2021 (Temporary VAERS E-Report Number: 435841).

                                                Around 5:30 pm in the evening following my vaccine I started having chills, headache, nausea, and fever of 101. Chills got worse, whole body was shaking and shivering. Nausea progressed into constant dry heaving. Head was pounding with the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, worse than natural child birth and worse than running marathons. The nausea was so bad and I could feel my fever burning and getting worse. I was about to vomit so got out of bed to go to the toilet to vomit and the whole room started spinning completely out of control. My heart was racing and I could hear it and feel it pounding rapidly through my ears. I couldn?t walk and was so disoriented I crawled to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. My husband heard me and came and picked me up off the bathroom floor and carried me to our bed. As the night progressed fever got worse, head was in almost unbearable pain, severe body aches over my whole body, heart racing and horrible nausea and dry heaving.  I made it through the night. For two days after I had a headache and fever  and nausea and body aches and couldn?t get out of bed to care for my children. By the third and fourth day I was able to get out of bed at times and still felt fatigue, nausea, headache and body aches. Anytime I would stand up for 10 days after the vaccine it felt like I was rocking on a boat. I am almost at 2 weeks and still feel fatigue and dizziness at times. On April 15th, 9 days after my vaccination I had symptoms of a blood clot in my leg. I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a superficial blood clot of the leg as well as swelling in the vein. I am thankful to be alive!

                                                Patient is a 32-year-old female new patient 5 months post partum &amp; currently breastfeeding, with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and history of childhood asthma, referred by the emergency department to discuss anaphylaxis like reaction to the Johnson Johnson COVID-19 vaccination on 4/28/21.  She received her vaccine around 2:00 p.m. She began developing itchiness in her palms/soles of feet and scalp that quickly developed into a a welt like rash about 3-1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine while on a walk with her husband; this was shortly followed by facial swelling over her right eye.  They made it home and she got in a cold shower to cool down, became dizzy, started seeing spots and had difficulty breathing. Her husband called EMS and she was hypotensive when they arrived.  She was given 2 doses of epinephrine (0.2 mg each per ED note) and a dose of Benadryl which helped. Shortly after the 2nd dose, she began having difficulty swallowing, maintaining the ability to breathe through her nose. She was given a 3rd dose of epinephrine and transferred to the ED; during transport an IV was started with an epinephrine drip. She was seen at Emergency Department; she was given IV fluids, solu medrol, tryptase level and had a normal EKG.  She was discharged with an epi pen prescription. Tryptase is still pending at the time of her visit. She started a new prenatal vitamin at 11 am 4/28/21. Otherwise, she reports no new foods, medications or topical products. She did eat before going on a walk, pepper jack cheese, wheat thins, and black bean hummus. She is pretty sure she was not stung by a bee prior to onset of symptoms yesterday.   Interestingly she reports recent urticarial episodes that occurred in February of 2021. These occurred when she was visiting her in-laws and occurred in the middle of the night, 2 nights in a row during the middle of her visit.  She has never had hives previously.  She reports no family history of hives or anaphylaxis.  She reports no use of new topical products or medications.

                                                I was 9 months pregnant at the time of the vaccination. My due date was April 3, 2021. The actual date of delivery was March 20, 2021 by C-section. I gave birth to a son weighing 8 lbs 6 oz. I had no complications during this pregnancy. I left the hospital on March 22nd. On March 25, I was experiencing shortness of breath and a low pulse (35 bpm; my usual pulse is in the 50s-60s). My OBGYN told me to go to the emergency room, where they did a CT scan. The CT scan showed a small pulmonary embolism. I was in the hospital until March 27th, where I was treated with Heparin and then was released with Lovenox injections. I am currently on the Lovenox. After seeing the pulmonologist for a follow-up appointment, he advised me that I would be able to stop the injections after 3 months.

                                                I found out about my pregnancy the day I got the vaccine (which was after I got the vaccine). After that I proceeded to get a pregnancy test confirmation  (march 26) and it came back positive from the doctors office. On March 28 I began to have bleeding and I passed a blood clot the size of a baseball.  I called the nurse line that next day and they told me they could not give me any medical advice because I had not been seen by a doctor for this pregnancy.  During that week I began to experience a rash that began in the middle of my chest and proceeded to spread All over my stomach and back. It is now April 19 in the rash has continue to spread all over my limbs. On April 5 I went to the pregnancy clinic and was also getting a ultrasound and they were unable to locate the embryo in the uterus. On April 15 I got an ultrasound transvaginal and they were unable to locate an embryo or in a heartbeat. I then went to the hospital the next day on April 16 the hospital that I received my vaccine at and they did not give me any care and told me that my rash was a possible contact to something I may have come in contact recently. I try to express to the doctor that I?ve been experiencing issues since I received the vaccine and he did not connect any of the dots to my experiences.  As of today April 19 I have come across several Different websites that state that red spot is a part of the symptoms an adverse reaction to the vaccine or should be of concern.

                                                During my menstrual cycle I usually have no symptoms other than tender breasts. So these symptoms were very unusual. Leg pains, pain and pressure in pelvis, clitoral pain, pain around vaginal opening, stinging like acid during urination that sent a shock through my entire body, uncontrollable bladder, nausea, large blood clots, lower stomach pain, flank pain, hot/cold chills, if I touch my belly button the pain radiated to my vagina, ovaries hurt, cervix pain, dryness, unable to get comfortable, crawling out of my skin, and constant urge to urinate, depression.  I landed myself in the ER where they told me to take Tylenol and Motrin and sent me on my way. These medications were not able to control the amount of pain I was in. I have now reached out to a couple specialists.

                                                4 days after the vaccine I started having periodic sharp pains in my uterus which made me think my period was coming. 6 days post vaccine I started bleeding lightly and the periodic sharp pains continued. 8 days post vaccine I woke up in the most excruciating pain of my life. It was the most severe menstrual type cramps I have ever experienced. I also had a severe headache which I never get. I took 600mg of ibuprofen. The pain continued for hours and I tried my best to breath through it. When I went to the restroom there was only a little blood but large amounts of fleshy tissue began discharging from me. Later that day when the tissue seemed to slow down the pain began to subside to a tolerable threshold (although still more severe than normal). I then began to bleed heavier than any other previous cycle. Normally I have a medium bleed for 2.5 days. This heavy bleeding lasted 6 days. I felt extremely dizzy and weak. Finally when the bleeding stopped I started to feel myself regain strength over the next few days although the sharp intermittent jabs of pain in my uterus lasted about three days after the bleeding stopped. I now am feeling back to normal and recovered. I never went to the ER but came very close to going during that time.

The patient&#39;s weight and height were not reported. The patient medical history included being 4 months post-partum. The patient had no drug, food or other product allergies, and had no chronic or long-standing conditions. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration and batch number not reported), dose was not reported, administered on 23-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. From an unspecified date, the patient had 2 weeks of headaches and blurry vision, 2 to 3 days of neck stiffness and nausea with 1 episode of vomiting and had been transferred to the current hospital from another. On 04-APR-2021 (12 days post-vaccination), the patient was diagnosed with dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST), transverse/sigmoid (cerebral venous) sinus thrombus (CVST) with associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe as well as thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein (thrombus). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) impressions showed there was a re-demonstrated of intraparenchymal hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe measuring approximately 6.2 x 3.6 cm in maximal axial dimensions. There was surrounding edema and associated mass effect with effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm. There was medialization of the right uncus without transtentorial herniation. The basal cisterns were otherwise patent. There was dural thickening and hyperenhancement overlying the hemorrhage. There was prominent cortical veins along the right frontal temporoparietal convexity consistent with venous congestion. There was also a small are of vasogenic edema in the right anterior temporal lobe separate from the hematoma. There was a right mastoid effusion, but normal orbitals and the calvarium and skull base were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) results revealed non-opacification of the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus and upper internal jugular vein compatible with occlusive thrombosis. A small amount of thrombus also extended into the left transverse sinus. The superior sagittal sinus, remainder of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, left upper internal jugular vein, straight sinus, vein of Galen and bilateral internal cerebral veins demonstrated normal contrast opacification. The patient&#39;s platelet count was 126 upon admission (normal range [NR] not provided), with other workup laboratory test results reported as pending. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The outcome of the right internal jugular thrombus, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, DVST, CVST, headache, blurry vision, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting was reported as unknown. This report was serious (caused/prolonged hospitalization and other medically important condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This case concerns a 34-year-old white female who experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), dural venous sinus thrombosis, right internal jugular vein thrombosis, and cerebral hemorrhage 12 days after receiving covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient was noted to be 4 months post-partum. She presented for medical assistance with a 2-week history of headaches, blurry vision, and neck stiffness for 2 to 3 days as well as nausea with 1 episode of vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe with surrounding edema and associated mass effect resulting in effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm and occlusive thrombus within the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus, and upper internal jugular vein.  A small amount of thrombus extended into the medial aspect of the left transverse sinus. The platelet count on admission was 126,000. Although the post-partum status of the patient may have contributed, based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration) and considering the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

On the third day i started to feel itchy and was super red. On Monday morning, I woke up with the rash all over my body and feeling very dizzy. I went to urgent care and he checked me that I had an allergic reaction to the J&amp;J vaccine. I also experienced vaginal bleeding, uncontrollably and he did the exams and I was told it was my menstrual cycle which lasted one week.  I have not gotten my menstrual cycle since the J&amp;J vaccine.  I do not have my lot # at the moment.

After accidentally double dosing myself with my ACE inhibitor I went into the ER on 5/11 with light headedness/high heart rate and cough. After multiple tests were done it was  discovered that I had a large satellite embolism. in my lung and another one in my left leg.

                                                The morning after the shot, I noticed vaginal bleeding/light spotting. I thought maybe it was just a slight reaction. By the evening, it had become heavier. By the following day, it was heavy and clotting was starting to develop. The Tuesday and Wednesday following the vaccine I had extremely heavy vaginal bleeding and clotting - going through a super plus tampon every hour and a half to two hours. By Thursday it had subsided a bit. By Friday it had lightened tremendously and by the following Saturday it was gone. But then Saturday evening the spotting picked up again. Sunday (3/14) the flow picked up again and by Monday (3/15) it was heavier with small clotting. Today (3/16) it is heavier with clotting again. My gynecologist did an exam and advised that I double my birth control for a few days to see if that will control it. She also took blood work (results not in yet).

                                                The day of the vaccine I was told that my arm might be sore. I felt sore right away and as soon as I got in the car to drive home I was extremely tired and I slept for the entire six hour car ride home. I was very fatigued that night and then I got a bad headache, fever and it lasted for 48 hours. After that, the headache was less intense and they were intermittent but my arm still hurt and I couldn&#39;t lay on it. I was still fatigued for a week. On the fourth day I started to get a weird feeling of vibrations and twitching all over my body. It is especially worse in my temple. It has been a month but I still get the twitching in different parts of my body. My face, arms, legs and temples. It is in different places. It happens less often now, it is not all day but it is still daily and mostly in my head and my legs. I had it happen in my temples last night.  I had my menstrual cycle since the vaccine and it was about three days later than expected. I had a lot of blood clots which was unusual for me. I have had flu like symptoms this week and I have a cough, runny nose and headaches but I am planning on trying to go to the doctor this week.

                                                I went to a community event (held at a church) for the COVID vaccine. After the vaccine, I wanted the 15 minutes and felt ok - just hot. I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

Upon examination, there is subtle swelling to left lower extremity and doppler revealed multiple DVTs in left lower extremity. CT head without contrast was unremarkable, however, CT venogram of the brain reveals thrombi of the right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinuses, as well as IJ. Patient was initiated on argatroban and admitted to inpatient at the time of this report. &#34;Heparin induced platelet antibody&#34; and &#34;lupus anticoagulant evaluation&#34; tests are ordered and pending.

Three weeks after my vaccination, my shot site began to hurt and then I started to exhibit an allergic reaction to foods I had never been allergic to previously. First it was ground turkey, and then two days later, I had an allergic reaction (hives, itchy mouth, and anaphylaxis) to chicken. A few days later I developed the same reaction to beef, and now I have the same reaction to berries and vegetables. My body seems to be attacking everything I eat.

Overnight the bump got a bit smaller and the bruise expanded. Over the next several days the bump kept diminishing. The bruise remained about the same size and kept getting darker. It?s been one week now and the bump is very tiny (size of a small pea), and the bruise is incredibly dark, but showing more of a healing process color.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included amoxicillin allergy.  The patient, age 38, received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805029) dose was not reported, administered on 08-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient was &#34;experiencing headaches 1 week ago&#34;, and also had aphasia later in the week.  On 24-MAR-2021, the patient went to an outside hospital and was found to have intraparenchymal hemorrhage in addition to venous sinus thrombosis and developed intracerebral haematoma.  On 25-MAR-2021, Computerized tomography (CT) of the head without contrast showed parenchymal hemorrhage and persistent hyperdensity in the left transverse sinus, consistent with known venous sinus thrombosis. The patient was being treated for the venous sinus thrombosis with heparin. On an unknown date, platelet count was 78,000 (thrombocytopenia). The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of events thrombocytopenia, intracerebral haematoma, venous sinus thrombosis, experiencing headaches 1 week ago, and computerized tomogram head abnormal was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).  Version 3 was created on 26-APR-2021 for the purpose of quality improvement. The following corrections were made: platelet count was added as the event of thrombocytopenia.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V2: Follow up added additional laboratory information. This report received via VAERs database (ID# 1133212) concerned a 38-year-old female patient who experienced intraparenchymal hemorrhage and venous sinus thrombosis 16 days after vaccination. Diagnosis was confirmed on computerized tomography (CT) of the head. Platelet count was 78,000.   Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Presenting symptoms included headache and aphasia. Treatment included heparin.  Outcome was not reported.   Based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination (Criteria level 2), the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

Also mid-April, on April 17, I had a sudden subjunctive hemorrhage happen in my right eye for no apparent reason.  There was no injury to my eye and my ophthalmologist told me it would heal in a few weeks.  Two weeks ago (beginning of May) a terrible, nearly unbearable headache began.  A few days later, I continued to feel strange and began to get more frequently short of breath and my cough worsened.  On 5/5/2021 I went to my doctor , Family Medicine, and was then sent to the local hospital, and had a cat scan done of my lungs, around 9 AM.  I was  I was diagnosed with a Pulmonary Embolism in my right lung, that is so large that it is taking up 2/3 of the lung and its pushing on my heart.  I am currently taking Eliquis and waiting to be seen by a specialist.  I still have shortness of breath, headaches, and chest pain as a result of my PE.

When I got to the hospital I could not breath my ribs hurt a lot &amp; I had horrible back pain. They put me oxygen and gave me fluids but they said I had to get transfer to another hospital and they transferred me on an ambulance. In the other hospital us where they transferred me they kept poking my stomach when I asked them why they kept poking it they told me that it was to stop the blood cloths. I was hospitalized for 5 days. When I was sent home I was still not feeling good I was feeling sick still I&#39;ve been trying to recover slowly but I am not the same. I&#39;m still in a lot of pain I can&#39;t move my arms because of how much it hurts my back keeps hurting a lot as well.

                                                I started experiencing flu-like symptoms at around 5 PM on 3/14/21.  I was feverish and had chills, muscle aches, and a headache.  I had very strong chills for a few hours and then I noticed that my resting heart rate was around 128 bpm at around 1:30 AM on 3/15/21.  I was running a 100.6 fever at that time.  My fever subsided in the morning and the headache persisted throughout the day, and I was very tired as I did not get much sleep the night before.  I did not work that day (Monday, 3/15).  At the time I was about 7 weeks pregnant.  I noticed some very light spotting later in the day on 3/15, and then I continued spotting on 3/16.  I consulted a midwife at the  facility at 4 PM on 3/16/21 and took a blood test to measure my hCG hormone levels.  The following day, 3/17, I received the results that I had a normal level of hCG hormone and normal hemoglobin levels.  As the day continued, the spotting turned into bleeding, and eventually the bleeding became heavy starting around 4 PM.  I received an ultrasound on 3/18/21 at 8 AM and later spoke with a midwife from facility at 11 AM that day, confirming that there was no viable pregnancy detected via ultrasound.  I had lost quite a bit of blood at that point.  I am, as of 8:35 PM on Friday,  March 19th, still bleeding and experiencing the impact of miscarriage.

                                                PULMONARY EMBOLISM IN CHEST; TIREDNESS; This spontaneous report received from the patient&#39;s mother concerned a 39 year old. The patient&#39;s weight was 251 pounds, and height was 66 inches. The patient&#39;s past medical history included a previous pulmonary embolism on 12-JUL-2012, which the reporter said the physician attributed to the patient being &#34;obese and lays on her bed and doesn&#39;t exercise&#34;.  Concurrent conditions included irregular menstruation, schizoaffective disorder, panic attacks, anxiety attacks, depression, incontinence, gastritis, constipation, sciatica nerve pain, asthma, obese, and doesn&#39;t comprehend well.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802070 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 in total administered on 06-MAR-2021 at left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Non-Company suspect included ethinylestradiol/ferrous fumarate/norethisterone acetate, &#34;for two months&#34; for irregular menstruation.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient&#39;s physician ordered the patient to stop taking.  Concomitant medications included salbutamol, lactulose for constipation, clozapine, gabapentin (noted as the doctor was trying to wean patient off medication), oxybutynin hydrochloride, pantoprazole, risperidone, valproate semisodium, vilazodone hydrochloride, and unspecified breathing treatments. In MAR-2021, the patient&#39;s mother stated that the first few days after vaccination the patient was fine. After a few days, patient was more tired than usual. On 16-MAR-2021, the patients mother noticed the patient&#39;s right leg was swollen and decided to take the patient to the Emergency Room. She was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism in the chest verified with radiology tests of chest and many other tests. Treatment included Eliquis 5 mg 2 times a day to treat the pulmonary embolism in her chest.   The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of pulmonary embolism in chest was not reported.  The patient had not recovered from tiredness.   This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 39-year-old obese (BMI 40.5 kg/m2) female patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism 10 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  Concurrent conditions includes  irregular menstruation, schizoaffective disorder, panic attacks, anxiety attacks, depression, incontinence, gastritis, constipation, sciatica nerve pain, asthma, obese, difficulty in comprehension.  Concurrent medications includes ethinylestradiol/ferrous fumarate/norethisterone acetate, salbutamol, lactulose, clozapine, gabapentin, oxybutynin hydrochloride, pantoprazole, risperidone, valproate semisodium, vilazodone hydrochloride, and unspecified breathing treatments.  There was prior history of pulmonary embolism (PE) 9 years prior to vaccination and was advised to be due to obesity and lack of physical activity.  Emergency room consult for leg swelling 10 days after vaccination; diagnosed with PE with radiology and many other unspecified tests; treated with Eliquis.  Th event is confounded by increased risk with prior history of pulmonary embolism, obesity, OCP, and risperidone (class effect).  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

                                                Sudden onset of menstrual period, lasting 2 weeks with extremely heavy flow and pain.  Saw my Dr. and she did a blood test to check for platelet count, which all labs done were normal. Period lasting from 4/7 to 4/21 all the while I take my birth control as normal with no missed doses. Now on 5/7 having severely heavy flow again with clotting. Dr. prescribed naproxen and an extra &#34;mini-pill&#34; hormone supplement on top of my regular birth control. Will monitor.
