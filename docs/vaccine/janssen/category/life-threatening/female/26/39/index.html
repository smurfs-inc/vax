                                                Patient was administered vaccine and told to wait the 15 minute monitoring period. After about 4 minutes, I heard her say &#34;I&#39;m not feeling right.&#34; I went to where she was sitting and asked &#34;are you ok?&#34; and had her take some slow, deep breaths. I then saw her eyes roll back and she lost consciousness. Thankfully, I was there and grabbed her as she toppled from the chair. I told the staff to call 911 and supported her neck and body in the chair. I could tell she was breathing and she was sweating profusely. I held her and spoke to her, and after about 15 seconds, she began to come out of it. After about a minute she was alert and orientated again.  I had her slowly sip a little water. The EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes and the assessed her vitals. She indicated that this was the first time anything like this had happened to her. They advised that since she had fainted, she should go to the hospital for observation, but she declined, stated that she felt fine at that point. Since she was driving, I insisted that she remain another one-half hour before leaving. During that time she drank more water and alternately sat and walked around the pharmacy. She did indicate that she had drank a protein shake that morning, but not eaten. I advised her to in the future, tell her doctor and/or any immunizer about the event. She left, stating that she was feeling fine, and I called her several hours later to make sure that she had indeed gotten home ok. She again said that she felt fine.

She regained consciousness. 911 was alerted and responded. Pt refused to leave with them. She sat with un an additional 15 minutes before she left for a therapy appointment.

                                                Had no side effects whatsoever for many hours. Felt completely fine until about 7:30 pm, while I was making my plate of dinner. Felt lightheaded, dizzy, and hot. I began to black out, so I sat down, which helped for a few moments to subside lightheadedness. I was still feeling hot, so I walked a few feet to my back door and sat down on the steps outside to cool off. Within minutes, my vision blurred completely, I saw stars, and completely blacked out. My mother, who was nearby, heard me fall on the steps. She said my eyes rolled back, my body was completely limp, I was not breathing but rather making gurgling noises from my throat. She propped my head up, which allowed me to breathe properly, and I came to.   If my mother had not been nearby, I am convinced I would be dead right now. I saw the light, saw the other side, saw my relatives. I have had a near death experience once before, and this was exactly like that.

                                                Around 4 pm I had flu like symptoms. Headache, back pain, fatigue, chills, sweats.  Around 5:30 I started feeling light-headed. I got out of bed and fainted on the floor. Laid there for a few moments. Got water. Laid back into bed and my body completely locked up. It felt like there were pins and needles coursing through my entire body. I couldn?t bend or move my legs. My wrists were bent down and my fingers all locked together. I could not move them at all. I was screaming out in pain. It was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. My roommate called 911. Paramedics arrived and took my temperature and blood pressure. They tried calming me down. eventually I did. And my fingers and legs unlocked but I continued having a severe headache, back pain, muscle aches and nausea. I woke up every hour of the night and threw up several times.  It?s been 24 hours after the shot and I am still having headaches fatigue and muscle spasms.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine at 10:15am. Upon receiving vaccine she sat down on chair to wait for 15 minutes post-vaccination. Just minutes after sitting down patient lost consciousness, fell from chair, hit her head on the floor, seize for a short moment, only to momentarily regain consciousness,  and faint for a second time.  EMS were called and patient was transported to Emergency Department for testing and observation. Patient believes she fainted the first time due to not having eaten much by that point in the day and due to anxiety about receiving the vaccine, and she was told she fainted a second time due to hypotension. She states she has a history of previously fainting during other medical procedures, though no similar previous reactions she can recall after vaccines.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                a 27 y.o. female with a history of Covid infection December 26, 2020, positive covid test December 29, 2020. She had approximately 2 weeks of symptoms including generalized body ache and generalized weakness.  Fatigue and some headache.  Had some persistence of symptoms after that time.  Had some benefit from ibuprofen.   Was seen at emergency room on January 27, 2021 stating that she felt that all her symptoms of Covid had resolved except for some chest pain which awoke her on January 27.  She presented to the emergency room.  Had sinus tachycardia at 113 but otherwise unremarkable physical exam, laboratory studies with white blood count elevated 16,004-20, hemoglobin 13.7 g hematocrit 41.8%, MCV 87.1, RDW 12.7%, platelet count 329,000, segs 72.8%, lymphs 20.6%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 1%, basophil 0.6%.  BUN 10.1, creatinine 0.8, AST 24, ALT elevated 56, alkaline phosphatase 68, total protein 7.6, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.6, globulin by subtraction 4.0, troponin less than 0.02, D-dimer quantitative 0.22, urine pregnancy test normal.  Chest x-ray normal.  Chest pain appears to be musculoskeletal and was reproduced by palpation of her chest wall.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  D-dimer was normal.  Heart rate returned to normal after some intravenous fluids.  Patient discharged on Zithromax 500 mg day 1 and then to 50 mg days 2 through 5.  Also continued on ibuprofen.   Received Johnson and Johnson vaccine April 5, 2021.  Over the next week patient started having increasing soreness.  Her joints hurt more than usual and her headache was worse.  She had a sensation that her legs were &#34;numb and tingly&#34; starting at her buttocks and extending down her leg.   Because of reported incidence of cerebral sinus thrombosis or cerebral vein thrombosis patient appropriately presented for screening in the emergency room and was sent for appropriate imaging.   April 16, 2021 CT scan of head with and without contrast no acute intracranial hemorrhage, no mass-effect or midline shift.  On contrast-enhanced images there appears to be a lobular nonocclusive filling defect in the far lateral right transverse sinus.  Lobular occlusive filling defect is also likely present in the mid to central right transverse sinus.  Short segment filling defect in the medial left transverse sinus.  Remainder of sinuses and internal cerebral veins are patent.  Focal lobular filling defect within the confluence of the right and transverse sinus most likely related to arachnoid granulation.  No edema hemorrhage of the cerebellum or cerebrum.  No other significant findings.   April 16, 2021 confirmatory MRI angiogram of head without contrast with no restricted diffusion to suggest acute or subacute infarct.  Contrast void in the middle to central right transverse sinus consistent with occlusive thrombus.  Nonocclusive thrombus in the far lateral right transverse thrombus.  Narrowing of the medial left transverse sinus without complete occlusion.   April 16, 2021 2345 hrs. inital hematology consultation.  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels have been requested stat and are still pending.  If fibrinogen level is low will replace with cryoprecipitate.  If D-dimer is elevated barely confirms diagnosis of possible vaccine related thrombosis.  The fact the patient is not thrombocytopenic at this time is encouraging, however despite the lack of thrombocytopenia she still has clearly documented symptomatic nonocclusive and occlusive thrombus in her cerebral sinus.   From UPtoDate.com Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, also referred to as the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine) ? On April 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended pausing administration of AD26.COV2.S  to further investigate rare cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia [33]. As of that date, six cases had been reported, all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination; during this period, 6.8 million doses were administered (with 1.5 million doses in females of that age range) [121-123]. Since some vaccine recipients have not been followed for longer than the time frame over which these symptoms develop, the incidence may change with additional follow-up. Initial symptoms included headache, backache, chills, and fatigue, and progressed to focal neurologic deficits. Intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboses at other sites were also seen in some patients. All of the five patients who were tested for the anti-PF4 HIT antibody tested positive. Another case, in a young male who was a vaccine recipient in one of the pre-emergency use authorization efficacy trials, had been previously reported. These cases appear similar to those reported following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, another adenovirus-vector vaccine. Although rare, the observed number of events exceeded the expected rate among females &lt;50 years old. Given the extreme rarity of these events, the FDA and CDC acknowledge that they recommended the pause out of an abundance of caution and to ensure awareness of these rare events.    ?Evaluation and management of possible thrombotic complications ? Recipients should be aware of the possible association and seek immediate care for signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombocytopenia (eg, new petechiae or bruising) or thrombotic complications (including shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity edema, persistent severe abdominal pain, unabating severe headache, severe backache, new focal neurologic symptoms, and seizures) [117]. In such cases, some experts suggest evaluation with complete blood count and differential (including the platelet count), quantitative D-dimer, HIT testing, and imaging of any suspected site of thrombosis [113,114,125]. Onset 4 to 20 days after vaccination, platelet count &lt;150,000/microL, elevated D-dimer, and a positive anti-PF4 antibody (HIT antibody) suggest the diagnosis. Treatment with a non-heparin/non-warfarin anticoagulant (eg, argatroban or direct oral anticoagulant) and intravenous immune globulin has been suggested. The CDC recommends not using heparin in individuals with thromboses following receipt of Ad26.COV2.S unless HIT testing is negative [126]. (See &#34;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&#34; and &#34;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Terminology and HIT variants&#39; and &#34;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Role of IVIG&#39;.)   As stated above all the 6 cases were &#34;all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination&#34; this would certainly fit the timeframe that we are seeing in this case.  Recommendations from national guidelines would be to start treatment with dexamethasone immediately while awaiting intravenous gammaglobulin.  To pursue intravenous gammaglobulin treatment at 1 g/kg over 1 to 2 days.  It is recommended to avoid heparin and instead use direct factor X inhibitor such as Eliquis, which this patient is already been started on.     There is unfortunately considerable risk that even though patient&#39;s symptoms appear mild at this time, that she may deteriorate in the very near future and I would recommend treating her aggressively at this time with dexamethasone and intravenous gammaglobulin while we are awaiting further testing.  Patient clearly has had unusual thrombosis, especially in a 27-year-old.     With the fact that she had headache dating back to January, it is impossible to determine the acute versus chronic nature of her venous sinus thrombosis. Covid infection does cause increase in coagulation as well.  However, given the small risk of tragic outcome with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis in the setting of Covid vaccinations, we will proceed aggressively with treatment starting tonight with intravenous gammaglobulin and intravenous dexamethasone.     Will require rapid fasting glucoses to evaluate possible hyperglycemia from high-dose dexamethasone.  Will consider stopping dexamethasone at 48 hours.  Current recommendation for gammaglobulin would be single 1 g/kg or 500 mg/kg over 2 days.  No recommendations for treatment beyond this point.  Current recommendations for gammaglobulin dosing would recommend using an adjusted dose for patients with greater than 125% of their ideal body weight.  This patient at 122 kg on a 5 foot 2 inch frame does qualify for adjusted dose and her orders reflect that.   I appreciate the opportunity see this patient this evening and consultation requested by Dr.  We will follow patient in hospital.  Hopefully she will have gradual improvement and avoid any serious or tragic complications of her cerebral sinus thrombosis.     We will have pharmacy report possible adverse reaction to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to the FDA as required by law.   April 17, 2021 follow up. No new events.  Laboratory studies remained excellent.  White blood count is further elevated, however, this may be secondary to high-dose dexamethasone with a white blood count of 16,060.  Hemoglobin 14.0 g hematocrit 42.8%, MCV 86.8, RDW 12.9%.  Platelet count is actually increased slightly at 374 as of 9:10 AM this morning.  Differential shows left shift as expected with dexamethasone.  Results from yesterday showed fibrinogen normal at 369 (180?415) pro time normal at 10.4 seconds with INR of 0.97, PTT 26.7.  D-dimer 0.23 (0.19?0.50).  With platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer normal I am inclined to believe that this is not an acute post vaccination HIT-like phenomena.  If it were I would still expect to see some degree of thrombocytopenia elevated D-dimer and perhaps low fibrinogen.  The other explanations for her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are either idiopathic spontaneous and merely coincidentally associated at the exact same time as her Covid infection or more likely, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulable state secondary to her Covid infection from December 2020.  Unfortunatly there is no way to accurately date the acuity of the venous thrombosis in her cerebral sinus.  HIT Testing is still pending and most likely will not be available for 3-4 more days despite being ordered stat.  Have called the laboratory and asked them to check with our outside reference lab what the expected return time is on this test. (LabCorp says &#34;Tuesday April 20, 2021).  Patient refused intravenous gammaglobulin infusion which has been ordered last night.  Patient has been receiving dexamethasone which was a bridge until intravenous gammaglobulin could be administered.  Current guidance from the expert hematology panel (EHP) on Covid vaccine induced thrombosis dated April 7, 2021 from the  public health would state that a patient who has a reduced platelet count without thrombosis with a D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen or thrombosis with a normal platelet count and D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen are &#34;unlikely cases&#34;.  They recommend for probable cases who have D-dimers that are elevated to send HIT assay and then give immediate intravenous gammaglobulin while awaiting results.  They recommend fibrinogen supplementation, if needed.  They recommend a direct acting antithrombin agents such as the Eliquis this patient is receiving.  They recommend steroids particularly if there is a delay in getting intravenous gammaglobulin delivered.  With the fact that we now have 24 hours in the hospital with no evidence of thrombocytopenia, no evidence of increased fibrinolytic activity or active thrombosis, and no evidence of hypofibrinogenemia, I would argue that her presentation is subacute.  In this setting, I do not feel intravenous gammaglobulin would be necessary and does involve a small risk as well as considerable cost.  Dexamethasone also involves small risk and negligible cost. I have discontinued both of these medications.  My overall impression would be that this was not related to her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination which was recent, but rather her more distant Covid infection.  It is impossible to definitively answer the question however.  The next question is duration of anticoagulation.  Risk of recurrent cerebral sinus venous thrombosis is relatively small but the morbidity can be high.  Studies have been performed showing medications in the same class as Eliquis have been associated with a decrease in incidence of the recurrence.  Most hematologist recommend 3 months of anticoagulation for provoked venous thrombosis including cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.  I feel this patient&#39;s thrombosis is &#34;provoked&#34;, with her association at the same time of her Covid infection (and possibly vaccination).  I would recommend Eliquis (apixaban) 5 mg twice daily or Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 20 mg daily with food. I would feel comfortable in discharging patient for outpatient follow up IF Dr and other speciality services agree. Plan 3 months of full dose anticoagulation with direct factor X inhibitor.   Circulation 2010 Jun 29;121(25):2740-6 &#34;Long-term evaluation of the risk of recurrence after cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis&#34;, Background: The clinical course of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis (CSVT) is largely unknown because prospective studies with a long follow-up and with the goal to assess thrombosis recurrence rate and predisposing factors for recurrence are lacking. Methods and results: One hundred forty-five patients with a first CSVT were followed up for a median of 6 years after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. End points were recurrent CSVT or other clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism. CSVT recurred in 5 patients (3%) and other manifestations of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism) were seen in 10 additional patients (7%), for a recurrence rate of 2.03 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.14) for all manifestations of venous thromboembolism and 0.53 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 1.10) for CSVT. Nearly half of the recurrences occurred within the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis were male sex (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.86 to 32.7) and, for thromboses other than CSVT, severe thrombophilia resulting from antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency, anti-phospholipid antibodies, or combined abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 16.5). Conclusions: The risk of recurrent CSVT is low and is higher in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment and among men. Mild thrombophilia abnormalities are not associated with recurrent CSVT, but severe thrombophilia entails an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism.   April 19, 2021 Follow up, no change in condition. Discussed case with Dr, will order Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, anti phospholipid and anti cardiolipin antibodies, if she will allow draw. Expect Heparin Induced Thrombosis testing result tomorrow, but with no thrombocytopenia after given heparin, expect will be normal. Will await result. If discharged, would recommend 3 months direct thrombin inhibitor (Eliquis/Xarelto/Pradaxa) at full anticoagulation dose. Then stop, no taper. Overall still feel &#34;provoked&#34; thrombosis due to December Covid, unrelated to J&amp;J Covid vaccine, but can not definitively prove that..

She received her first COVID vaccine 8 hours prior. No cough. She felt well before the shot. No bleeding or leaking fluid. Her COVID test was negative. She was tachycardic to the 140&#39;s and the baby was tachycardiac to the 180&#39;s starting at presentation. She was treated with oral tylenol and IV fluids. After about 90 minutes of monitoring a prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration was noted to the 60&#39;s for 6 minutes. This recovered with repositioning. After another hour a reactive tracing was noted with a normal heartrate for baby. In induction of labor was started.

About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

PT with her mother, became light-headed and dizzy while walking from vaccination site back to vehicle for 15 minute wait. PT became unresponsive with mother and fainted.  Parking staff alerted rapid response team, PT regained responsiveness and was given chair to sit on, water to drink.  Rapid response team arrived to a responsive, A&amp;Ox4, pale female who was still feeling weak and light-headed.  PT was transferred to a cot (in the shade) where she was placed in supine position with legs elevated on a chair.  Pt was given water and hard candy to suck on while vitals were taken,,  Airway, breathing and circulation were all WNL.     PT states she presently has a strep infection (throat area)  and has been afebrile, and is to begin oral antibiotics once she picks RX up from pharmacy.     PT began feeling significantly better over 10-15 minutes of laying down in the shade.    EMS LAFD was called and transfer of care to EMS Station 93 for further work-up was instituted.  PT felt much better and was able to stand and ambulate from cot to EMS vehicle without issue.    PT chose to go home with her mother instead of being transported by EMS to medical facility.

After 5 minutes of waiting the patient slumped over and passed out onto the floor.  Her color was very pale and her eyes were rolling in the back of her head.  She regained consciousness but her color was still poor and we called and ambulance because she was still feeling faint.  The  EMT&#39;s immediately took her blood pressure and it was extremely low.  She acknowledged that she did not eat or drink anything at all that morning.  The EMT&#39;s recommended she go to the hospital but she refused.  After 30 minutes with emergency personnel she felt better and well enough to leave with her family member who was with her.

It is now day 10 and I still have a slight cold, very tired, and am still on my period.

I?m bleeding in my urine, stool, and vaginally. Period came early (unrelated to previous vaginal bleeding) and is not clotting. Just significant amounts of red blood, soaking through one ultra absorbency tampon an hour. I have a headache. Went to the ER and my platelets were (345) and my blood sugar low. My bp was 145/90 which is high for me, from the bleeding.  They said I have a ?higher chance of being bitten by a shark? than having a side effect. They diagnosed me with a single contusion and sent me home. Have been feeling worse since leaving the hospital.

Tingling fingers on hand from vaccination arm (left), swelling from vaccination injection site, headache, and neck pain all developed on 3/10/2021.  Headache and neck pain could be due to head trauma from vasovagal syncope. Tingling fingers were not observed on 3/11/2021.    *I have had vasovagal syncope in the past, but never with vaccines. It always occurs when I see my own blood.

On April 9th 2021 during a scheduled doctor visit at 3pm both baby and mother were in good health.  On the same evening after the appointment she went for vaccination at Pharmacy and received the J&amp;J vaccine. After receiving the vaccine in about 15 mins she felt like urinating and noticed blood in the urine and felt vaginal dilation. Within the next 15 to 20 mins she started experiencing mild labor pains and contractions. In the next 30 mins she started bleeding and was immediately taken to the ER. In the ER it was confirmed that she was having a miscarriage and the fetus was delivered. She also had to undergo emergency surgery to remove any remaining placenta in the uterus.

She asked her sister to move her to the floor to lay down.  She was out for about 3 minutes and then came to.  She sat on the floor for a minute and then transitioned to the chair.  We offered cold cloths which she refused.  She did accept an orange juice.  She was fine after waiting 15 minutes and left the store.

                                                Initial injection site felt a lot of pressure and at first there were mild symptoms of ringing in the ears and mind fogginess. Within 5 minutes after receiving injection I got up and walked less than 10 feet when I began experiencing extreme dizziness, ringing in the ears, lightheadedness, felt warm, and began to feel chills/tingling throughout my whole body but especially in my head.  I ended up passing out and was unable to sit up in a chair without assistance. For about 10 minutes I was profusely sweating all over my entire body, had continued chills/tingling, difficulty breathing and was semi coherent. The nurse at the pharmacy had me sniff ammonia salt and gave me water to help. I waited for 20 more minutes before finally feeling able to get up and walk around the store. Body chills and cold sweats continued for a while but no further symptoms at this time (2hrs after vaccination).

She regained consciousness and I had her lay on the ground on her back. Her blood pressure was 88/69, heart rate was 86 and she was sweating a lot. EMS came and took her blood pressure again and it was 110/80. She went to the hospital for further observation and they did an EKG and said everything was normal, and now she is feeling okay.

A few minutes later she fainted and fell out of the chair onto the floor. We helped her up to a sitting position and gave her a bottle of water and an ice pack.  The right side of her forehead appeared red from apparent hit on the floor when she fainted.  We had her wait on the floor for about 30 minutes to ensure she remained conscious.  Patient reported an ache on her forehead at site of hit.  She was also sweating and reported feeling hot. Patient had a partner with her who agreed to escort her to an urgent care clinic in the same building as the pharmacy. Store manager in charge took the patient to the urgent care clinic by wheelchair to be examined.

Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

Became sweaty, nauseous, and my blood pressure dropped to 85/57.  Took roughly 30 min for pulse and bp to return to normal.   Within 8 hours I developed a fever 100.5-101 degrees and body aches.

I turned around because I didn?t think I would make it to bathroom and told site worker I felt dizzy. He tried walking me back to car but my sight for super blurry and I passed out. I came back into it pretty quickly after passing out. I was super sweaty after shot.

                                                30 year old femail received Janssen vaccine Lot# 1808982 exp: 6/23/21 at approximately 3pm in the left deltoid.  Immediately after being vaccinated, pt. requested to remain seated.  The nurse noted that the pt. was getting pale so she suggested the pt. take off the surgical mask to get some air.  Before pt. had a chance to take off the mask she lost consciousness.  Together with another nurse patient was lowered onto the floor.  Pt. regained consciousness for 30-45 seconds and then began to have seizure like activity.  Her eyes rolled back and her body became stiff and began a jerking motion.  911 was called. This seizure like activity lasted 4-6 seconds at which time pt. regained consciousness and immediately sat up.  Pt was pale and diaphoretic.  BP 98/64, HR 78, Pulse Ox 99%.  Pt vomited multiple times.  Ice was applied to the posterior neck and a cold compress to the forehead .  EMS arrived and took vitals: BP 78/40.  Pt. was aware of person, place and situation.  Pt. was taken to Hospital accompanied by her husband.  Pt was called by me Friday and she was home.  All tests showed no sign of having a seizure.

                                                The adverse symptoms I experienced were abnormally severe/heavy menstrual bleeding and abdominal pain. I was on Day 4 of my menstrual cycle on the day of my injection (April 3, 2021). My menstrual cycle usually starts to go away on Day 4 and concludes by Day 7. But the day after my injection, in addition to experiencing the common side effects of fever, chills, aches, and headaches, I also experienced an uptick in bleeding, which included severe/heavy menstrual bleeding with very frequent and large blood clots. That same day (April 4), I started my new birth control cycle as prescribed. By Day 8 (April 7, 2021), my menstrual bleeding continued to be so severe/heavy that I went to my OB-GYN for testing. The OB-GYN ruled out everything but the vaccine as an environmental factor. It was suggested that I take 600mg of Motrin every 6-hours for 48 hours. My menstrual bleeding continued for several more days until concluding on Day 12 (April 11, 2021) but I am still experiencing abdominal pain.

                                                On April 16, 2021 (Day 13 after Vaccine) I was diagnosed with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of my femoral vein in my left leg by Hospital. In other words, I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my upper left leg. Pain in both my legs had started on April 13, 2021 (Day 10 after Vaccine). On April 16, I had a virtual appointment with my doctor, Dr. , who prescribed an ultrasound to rule out DVT.  I went to an ultrasound appointment at  Radiology at 3:30pm where a blood clot was found in my left leg. I was admitted into the emergency room at  Hospital and prescribed medication and follow ups from there.  These adverse symptoms developed after I submitted other adverse symptoms to VAERS on April 13, 2021 (Temporary VAERS E-Report Number: 435841).

                                                Around 5:30 pm in the evening following my vaccine I started having chills, headache, nausea, and fever of 101. Chills got worse, whole body was shaking and shivering. Nausea progressed into constant dry heaving. Head was pounding with the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, worse than natural child birth and worse than running marathons. The nausea was so bad and I could feel my fever burning and getting worse. I was about to vomit so got out of bed to go to the toilet to vomit and the whole room started spinning completely out of control. My heart was racing and I could hear it and feel it pounding rapidly through my ears. I couldn?t walk and was so disoriented I crawled to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. My husband heard me and came and picked me up off the bathroom floor and carried me to our bed. As the night progressed fever got worse, head was in almost unbearable pain, severe body aches over my whole body, heart racing and horrible nausea and dry heaving.  I made it through the night. For two days after I had a headache and fever  and nausea and body aches and couldn?t get out of bed to care for my children. By the third and fourth day I was able to get out of bed at times and still felt fatigue, nausea, headache and body aches. Anytime I would stand up for 10 days after the vaccine it felt like I was rocking on a boat. I am almost at 2 weeks and still feel fatigue and dizziness at times. On April 15th, 9 days after my vaccination I had symptoms of a blood clot in my leg. I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a superficial blood clot of the leg as well as swelling in the vein. I am thankful to be alive!

                                                Mild headache and nausea set in shortly after the injection on Friday, but went away after rest and eating/drinking. My arm was sore for the entire evening. I woke up around 2am Saturday morning and became dizzy. I fell to the floor and passed out for a short period of time. When I woke, I was extremely nauseous to the point of nearly vomiting. I had chills and fever. I could hardly move due to weakness - I needed help getting back into bed. When I woke the next morning, I had 100.3 fever, I had a headache and my entire body was sore. My fever went away late Saturday afternoon, but I still felt mildly nauseous. It is Monday and I still have mild nausea and light-headedness. My arm is only slightly sore.

                                                Patient fainted about 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She was in the monitoring area and fell over and hit her head on the ground. I went to her aid and monitored her until the paramedics showed up.  She was unconscious for a 10-15 seconds with her eyes open before regaining consciousness.  IShe was not having breathing problems or other symptoms of anaphylaxis so i did not administer an epi-pen or benadryl to her.  I rolled her on her side in case she became nauseas.  Then the paramedics arrived and attended to her.

I woke up to my husband holding my head and yelling my name. I had been seizing and had bitten my tongue. I was very white and nauseous and cold and shaky. They gave me water and a cold pack. The seizure probably only lasted for 5 seconds but it&#39;s hard to say. I felt very fatigued afterwards. I stayed for 10 more min and drank water and then they sent me on my way.

                                                Patient was given the Janssen Covid 19 vaccine on 4/7/21 around 11:55am in her left deltoid. She was accompanied by her husband at the clinic. After the immunization she was seated in the waiting area to be observed for 30 minutes after her vaccine. Approx. 5 mins after the vaccine was given, the patient passed out in the chair and I (the pharmacist) was alerted. The patient came back to when I arrived at her seat and was able to talk and asked for water. Her husband stayed by her side while I went to obtain water and I heard her husband say she passed out again and then regained consciousness. He layed her on the floor while I called 911. An ambulance came and took the patient to the hospital.

My body shook, and it appeared that I had a seizure. Immediately upon waking I started vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements for about an hour. I felt confused for about 30 minutes and was unable to speak for a few moments upon waking. When I arrived at the hospital I was still vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements. I was given fluids and zofran and sent home without further testing.

                                                The patient received the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine from a certified immunizing technician. She was asked to wait 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine before leaving the pharmacy and remained seated in the post vaccination waiting area chair. She began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. She was caught by her family members and the pharmacist on duty before she fell. She briefly had a mild seizure and lost consciousness for a minute. When she regained consciousness she stated that she felt nauseous and was seeing double. 911 was called. EMTs arrived and checked her alertness and how she was feeling. The EMTs then took her off in a stretcher to the hospital out of an abundance of caution due to brief loss of consciousness.

On that moment I lost consciousness and passed out. In my opinion, I experimented a down on sugar, which had never happened before. My husband was able to catch me and sat me on the floor. A minute after I recovered and my husband gave me fruit (Melon) to raise my blood sugar. On that moment I had lots of nauseas and diarrhea. I was feeling weak and dizzy all night and the next day. Today Wednesday March the 17 I have been feeling much better.

                                                After getting the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot at 3:15PM on Saturday (I did pass out at the vaccine clinic approx 2 minutes after receiving the vaccine and had to be escorted to a room to lay down) I developed chills, fever, and aches that night, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m reporting.  Sunday night, I developed painful red spots on my right inner labia. Monday morning, they had multiplied and darkened. I went in and saw my gynecologist, at 2:00PM. By that time they had worsened again. She could not immediately identify it, but swabbed it to test for herpes. She also prescribed an anti-viral, a rotating dose of OTC 600 ibuprofen and 500mg tylenol, and that I should pick up Orajel for topical numbing.  By Wednesday, the herpes test came back negative (as I expected, having never had herpes), and the spots had grown in size and turned into black and grey ulcers that were shedding with necrosis and were extremely painful. In addition, I was experiencing near exhaustion.  Dr. diagnosed them as Lipshütz ulcers. A severe immune response to the vaccine. In addition to the antiviral, she prescribed a steroid to help quiet the immune response and a few days worth of Hydrocodone to help with the very acute pain.  As of writing this on 4/20/2021, I am still not fully recovered, although Dr. believes it will be cleared up completely in the next couple of days.

                                                Patient is a 32-year-old female new patient 5 months post partum &amp; currently breastfeeding, with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and history of childhood asthma, referred by the emergency department to discuss anaphylaxis like reaction to the Johnson Johnson COVID-19 vaccination on 4/28/21.  She received her vaccine around 2:00 p.m. She began developing itchiness in her palms/soles of feet and scalp that quickly developed into a a welt like rash about 3-1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine while on a walk with her husband; this was shortly followed by facial swelling over her right eye.  They made it home and she got in a cold shower to cool down, became dizzy, started seeing spots and had difficulty breathing. Her husband called EMS and she was hypotensive when they arrived.  She was given 2 doses of epinephrine (0.2 mg each per ED note) and a dose of Benadryl which helped. Shortly after the 2nd dose, she began having difficulty swallowing, maintaining the ability to breathe through her nose. She was given a 3rd dose of epinephrine and transferred to the ED; during transport an IV was started with an epinephrine drip. She was seen at Emergency Department; she was given IV fluids, solu medrol, tryptase level and had a normal EKG.  She was discharged with an epi pen prescription. Tryptase is still pending at the time of her visit. She started a new prenatal vitamin at 11 am 4/28/21. Otherwise, she reports no new foods, medications or topical products. She did eat before going on a walk, pepper jack cheese, wheat thins, and black bean hummus. She is pretty sure she was not stung by a bee prior to onset of symptoms yesterday.   Interestingly she reports recent urticarial episodes that occurred in February of 2021. These occurred when she was visiting her in-laws and occurred in the middle of the night, 2 nights in a row during the middle of her visit.  She has never had hives previously.  She reports no family history of hives or anaphylaxis.  She reports no use of new topical products or medications.

                                                Pt was given the vaccine. Within less than 5 minutes, she said she was feeling light-headed and proceeded to pass out. She fell to the floor, and I went out to assist her. She was able to keep her head from hitting the floor, and I supported her head as she regained consciousness. She tried to sit up but lost consciousness again and appeared to convulse (arms and legs drawn up). She regained consciousness again, and was completely lucid. We called 911 and EMT arrived and continued their usual procedures including checking blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose. Her BP was 130/80 laying, and 80/60 sitting. Her pulse was 50. Her blood sugar was 56 before consuming glucose and 71 after. She was given water as well. She declined a ride to the hospital but did have a friend give her a ride home.

I gave birth to a son weighing 8 lbs 6 oz. I had no complications during this pregnancy. I left the hospital on March 22nd. On March 25, I was experiencing shortness of breath and a low pulse (35 bpm; my usual pulse is in the 50s-60s). My OBGYN told me to go to the emergency room, where they did a CT scan. The CT scan showed a small pulmonary embolism. I was in the hospital until March 27th, where I was treated with Heparin and then was released with Lovenox injections. I am currently on the Lovenox. After seeing the pulmonologist for a follow-up appointment, he advised me that I would be able to stop the injections after 3 months.

After that I proceeded to get a pregnancy test confirmation  (march 26) and it came back positive from the doctors office. On March 28 I began to have bleeding and I passed a blood clot the size of a baseball.  I called the nurse line that next day and they told me they could not give me any medical advice because I had not been seen by a doctor for this pregnancy.  During that week I began to experience a rash that began in the middle of my chest and proceeded to spread All over my stomach and back. It is now April 19 in the rash has continue to spread all over my limbs. On April 5 I went to the pregnancy clinic and was also getting a ultrasound and they were unable to locate the embryo in the uterus. On April 15 I got an ultrasound transvaginal and they were unable to locate an embryo or in a heartbeat. I then went to the hospital the next day on April 16 the hospital that I received my vaccine at and they did not give me any care and told me that my rash was a possible contact to something I may have come in contact recently. I try to express to the doctor that I?ve been experiencing issues since I received the vaccine and he did not connect any of the dots to my experiences.  As of today April 19 I have come across several Different websites that state that red spot is a part of the symptoms an adverse reaction to the vaccine or should be of concern.

                                                I was very ill on Friday night after receiving the vaccination. Flu-like symptoms, high fever, shortness of breath, pain in my abdomen, horrible headache, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness and leg pain (both legs). The flu-like symptoms passed on Saturday, but by Tuesday, April 13 I was continuing to have a terrible headache, abdominal pain and leg pain. I saw my primary doctor on the 13th and was sent over to the hospital for an ultrasound of my leg. No clots were found and I was told to continue trying to recover at home unless it got worse. I was seen at the emergency room on April 14th for abdominal pain, leg pain, dizziness and headache. The nurse told me I was probably hysterical over the vaccination being pulled, and I told him this was not the case. They performed CT (without contrast) on my abdomen and head, then released me with instructions to return if I was worse. By the 16th I was unable to walk as my left side was completely numb. I went back to the ER. I had a CT of my abdomen and head with and without contrast. I had a lumbar puncture and several labs. I was given IV antibiotics for some infection they found in my urine. I was given fluids and pain meds, and my BP was shooting up to 145/94 (which is very high for me), when standing. My vision was blurry and I was unable to remember much of the last week. I was admitted from the 16th through the 20th and had an MRV, 2 MRIs, more lab work and medicine for my headache. I was released on the 20th and the headache was unbearable and I was still numb on my left side, going back to my doctor on the 22nd. He suggested the ER, and the ER admitted me back to the stroke unit. I was released on the 22nd with a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine that could cause stroke-like symptoms (ZERO history of headaches previously). I was sent home with a walker and home health services. PT visited on April 30th and ordered two visits per week for the next month. I am unable to walk without a walker. I cannot shower or use the stairs without assistance. My memory is still foggy. I am unable to concentrate for long. I often stutter and can&#39;t remember basic words. I have also stopped and forgotten where I am at a given moment. I am on Depakote nightly for the headaches, and they have lessened slightly, but when they flare up it is debilitating and I often vomit. I have instructions to follow up with my primary tomorrow morning and see what the next steps are.

She waited in the area for at least 20 minutes before she said she felt ok to leave.  She was eating a protein bar while waiting, to help with the low blood sugar.

I gave the vaccine and pt said she was okay. a couple minutes later she said she was feeling very warm and asked for something to fan herself with. I asked another pharmacist is get her a cold compress. When she came back with it and went to give it to the patient she fainted and slumped in her chair; she did not fall out of the chair. she was unconscious for less than 30 seconds and lost bladder control. I continued to rub her wrists and neck with the cold paper towel and she regained consciousness and said she was okay. we observed her for at least 20 minutes more and then she left. she said she did not require any further medical attention.

                                                Patient mom reports patients eyes rolled back into head and she slumped in her seat for 20 seconds during her first 15 minutes of observation. Mom brought patient to me for assessment. When patient presented to me, patient was alert and vitals were normal. I asked patient to remain seated for 15 more minutes of observation.  Mom did say patient exhibited this behavior once before at the eye doctor.  I informed mom to please check with patients doctor for follow up. Patient exhibited some mental disability and thats is why the mother is involved. I dont believe patient is capable of taking care of herself.

I couldn?t walk 3 feet without having to sit with my head between my knees. I passed out in a 5 foot walk but luckily i sat down on my couch as it was happening. I?m not diabetic, haven?t ever been hypoglycemic. Ibuprofen and food after about 2 or 3 hours is a must.

While I was sitting down, waiting for about 15 minutes I felt dizzy and fainted. My head hit the floor. The store called the paramedics. I woke up sweating and the paramedics arrived. The paramedics took my bloodpressure and reported it at 84 over 50. They waited while I felt ready to stand up. After a 3 to 4 minutes I felt I could stand up and they took me outside. Once outside they took my blood pressure again and it was at 110/80. I opted to go home instead of the hospital and I feel tired.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after the vaccine I developed a very bad headache followed by chills, sweats, congestion, chest pain, body pain, muscle pain, fatigue and fever. The muscle pain and weakness was so bad I would loose balance when walking. I then started to menstruate clots, not my normal cycle timing,  which lasted about 2 days. The clots subsided but I am still bleeding today. I was in bed for 4 days with severe immune response symptoms. After those symptoms subsided the fatigue was so extreme it was hard to function.

                                                During my menstrual cycle I usually have no symptoms other than tender breasts. So these symptoms were very unusual. Leg pains, pain and pressure in pelvis, clitoral pain, pain around vaginal opening, stinging like acid during urination that sent a shock through my entire body, uncontrollable bladder, nausea, large blood clots, lower stomach pain, flank pain, hot/cold chills, if I touch my belly button the pain radiated to my vagina, ovaries hurt, cervix pain, dryness, unable to get comfortable, crawling out of my skin, and constant urge to urinate, depression.  I landed myself in the ER where they told me to take Tylenol and Motrin and sent me on my way. These medications were not able to control the amount of pain I was in. I have now reached out to a couple specialists.

                                                4 days after the vaccine I started having periodic sharp pains in my uterus which made me think my period was coming. 6 days post vaccine I started bleeding lightly and the periodic sharp pains continued. 8 days post vaccine I woke up in the most excruciating pain of my life. It was the most severe menstrual type cramps I have ever experienced. I also had a severe headache which I never get. I took 600mg of ibuprofen. The pain continued for hours and I tried my best to breath through it. When I went to the restroom there was only a little blood but large amounts of fleshy tissue began discharging from me. Later that day when the tissue seemed to slow down the pain began to subside to a tolerable threshold (although still more severe than normal). I then began to bleed heavier than any other previous cycle. Normally I have a medium bleed for 2.5 days. This heavy bleeding lasted 6 days. I felt extremely dizzy and weak. Finally when the bleeding stopped I started to feel myself regain strength over the next few days although the sharp intermittent jabs of pain in my uterus lasted about three days after the bleeding stopped. I now am feeling back to normal and recovered. I never went to the ER but came very close to going during that time.

The patient&#39;s weight and height were not reported. The patient medical history included being 4 months post-partum. The patient had no drug, food or other product allergies, and had no chronic or long-standing conditions. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration and batch number not reported), dose was not reported, administered on 23-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. From an unspecified date, the patient had 2 weeks of headaches and blurry vision, 2 to 3 days of neck stiffness and nausea with 1 episode of vomiting and had been transferred to the current hospital from another. On 04-APR-2021 (12 days post-vaccination), the patient was diagnosed with dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST), transverse/sigmoid (cerebral venous) sinus thrombus (CVST) with associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe as well as thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein (thrombus). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) impressions showed there was a re-demonstrated of intraparenchymal hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe measuring approximately 6.2 x 3.6 cm in maximal axial dimensions. There was surrounding edema and associated mass effect with effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm. There was medialization of the right uncus without transtentorial herniation. The basal cisterns were otherwise patent. There was dural thickening and hyperenhancement overlying the hemorrhage. There was prominent cortical veins along the right frontal temporoparietal convexity consistent with venous congestion. There was also a small are of vasogenic edema in the right anterior temporal lobe separate from the hematoma. There was a right mastoid effusion, but normal orbitals and the calvarium and skull base were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) results revealed non-opacification of the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus and upper internal jugular vein compatible with occlusive thrombosis. A small amount of thrombus also extended into the left transverse sinus. The superior sagittal sinus, remainder of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, left upper internal jugular vein, straight sinus, vein of Galen and bilateral internal cerebral veins demonstrated normal contrast opacification. The patient&#39;s platelet count was 126 upon admission (normal range [NR] not provided), with other workup laboratory test results reported as pending. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The outcome of the right internal jugular thrombus, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, DVST, CVST, headache, blurry vision, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting was reported as unknown. This report was serious (caused/prolonged hospitalization and other medically important condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This case concerns a 34-year-old white female who experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), dural venous sinus thrombosis, right internal jugular vein thrombosis, and cerebral hemorrhage 12 days after receiving covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient was noted to be 4 months post-partum. She presented for medical assistance with a 2-week history of headaches, blurry vision, and neck stiffness for 2 to 3 days as well as nausea with 1 episode of vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe with surrounding edema and associated mass effect resulting in effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm and occlusive thrombus within the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus, and upper internal jugular vein.  A small amount of thrombus extended into the medial aspect of the left transverse sinus. The platelet count on admission was 126,000. Although the post-partum status of the patient may have contributed, based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration) and considering the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

Immediately after she had a syncopal episode and was unresponsive for about 1 minute. We immediately called 911, lay her flat and raised her legs. She became responsive and was alert and oriented X  3. We were unable to get a BP reading but her color was improving and she remained alert. We repositioned her in a supine position and she had another syncopal episode. We raised her legs again and she improved immediately. EMS arrived shortly after. She remained alert and responsive  and was evaluated for about an hour and released to her spouse. She didn&#39;t want to be evaluated at the hospital. She made record of having a similar episode during a procedure at her doctor&#39;s office.

Approximately 4-5 minutes later I started feeling really hot. Then I started getting nauseous and dizzy. I tried to get up and walk to the pharmacy desk (vaccine occurred at pharmacy) but fainted midway there. I was out less than one minute and after sitting down and having some water and putting ice packs on my face I felt better. I have never in my life fainted before. I wasn?t nervous or scared to have the vaccine.   I followed up with my regular doctor on the Monday following the vaccine and had an EKG and bloodwork done all of which came back normal.

I also experienced vaginal bleeding, uncontrollably and he did the exams and I was told it was my menstrual cycle which lasted one week.  I have not gotten my menstrual cycle since the J&amp;J vaccine.  I do not have my lot # at the moment.

                                                The morning after the shot, I noticed vaginal bleeding/light spotting. I thought maybe it was just a slight reaction. By the evening, it had become heavier. By the following day, it was heavy and clotting was starting to develop. The Tuesday and Wednesday following the vaccine I had extremely heavy vaginal bleeding and clotting - going through a super plus tampon every hour and a half to two hours. By Thursday it had subsided a bit. By Friday it had lightened tremendously and by the following Saturday it was gone. But then Saturday evening the spotting picked up again. Sunday (3/14) the flow picked up again and by Monday (3/15) it was heavier with small clotting. Today (3/16) it is heavier with clotting again. My gynecologist did an exam and advised that I double my birth control for a few days to see if that will control it. She also took blood work (results not in yet).

The technician held the pt up and supported her head and neck while asking pt if she was OK.  When pt came to she was happy and said &#34;hi&#34; to the technician.  Soon after she laid on the floor and started crying and saying her hands were cramping and in pain.  She also stated she was very nauseous and felt like she was going to throw up.  Pts husband agreed that we should call an ambulance which we did.  When paramedics arrived pt was feeling better and refused a ride to the ER.  Pt&#39;s husband took her to the car and drove her to the ER.

I got hot and sweaty and horrible tunnel vision, I almost fainted. I laid down on one of their medical beds to recover while the sweet nurse fanned me.  I was observed over 30 min before leaving.  I woke up yesterday and felt weird along with bodyaches, chills, joint pains, random stinging sensations throughout my body (almost like a pen prick), sporadic short headaches and muscle cramps.  I left work yesterday and didn?t even go in today.

I stabilized her and directed my staff to call 911 and store management. Within 15 seconds of its inception, she regained consciousness. We ended the phone call for next level care. We gave the patient an ice pack for her neck and a bottle of water. Once aware again, she mentioned that she hadn&#39;t eaten anything today. We got her a candy bar as well. Within 20 minutes, she was able to walk out of the store under her own power.

Patient sat down to try and relieve symptoms and after sitting a minute proceeded to feint. She regained consciousness within a few moments and was then disoriented for a short time. EMS arrived and evaluated her and since she was pregnant she agreed to go with them for further evaluation. We followed up with her the next day, she was feeling better having recovered fully and was told at hospital everything was fine medically with her health and her pregnancy.

                                                I got the vaccine at 4pm at the pharmacy where I work. I had no symptoms except for very mild local injection discomfort but was able to do my usual normal activities. At 2 am that evening, I woke up with  a lot of pain in my legs, I felt they were so heavy to move around in bed. My lower back was extremely painful too, I tried to stand up to walk a bit, the pain was very severe and I couldn?t stand straight, it was very hard to drag my feet, they felt very heavy and my muscled were painful to the touch even. So went back to bed, and was in agony. I had to go to work in the morning to open the store I work at until they find me coverage. Driving was very hard with my painful legs. J reached the store and I was walking very slowly, I couldn?t have a full control over my legs, they were painful waist down, and felt very heavy, when I sat down my muscles were painful wherever pressure was applied to them (from the chair).  Lightheadedness: I felt lightheaded when I woke up from bed at night to try to walk and ease the pain. So decided to go back to bed to prevent falls. At work, while walking and sitting, I had episodes of very light headidness and sat often on the floor and lifted my legs. Measured my blood pressure on 3 occasions it was 90/50  then 100/50 then 110/60. One time only I fainted where my colleagues put me down and lifted my legs.  At 8am (morning of 3/9/20201) I had a feeling of  heavy breathing. Needed to take deep breath as if my lung muscles were tired and needed to take deep breath to fill them with enough air. At work and because of the increased intensity of muscles pain, I started to breath faster and deeper coz I was in agony   Headache: severe and excruciating headache started from 6am to 12pm on 3/9/21.   Throughout the symptoms, I refused to take medications to let the vaccine run its course. My family drove me back from work coz I was weak and lightheaded and in severe pain at 10.30am. Came home, took one Advil 200mg at 11am. I was completely pain free  at 12pm. Lungs still felt weak, needed to breath deeper for two days but then got better.

I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

                                                I took the J&amp;J shot roughly at 11:50a, and naturally felt the immediate burn, and swear I felt the liquid moving through my arm. My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

                                                Pt was CAO x 4 upon EMS arrival. EMS 3 stated pt experienced a syncopal episode after getting her COVID vaccine. Pt had a brief LOC and was initially hypotensive. IV was initiated by EMS 3 and NS was started. VS were WNL upon EMS arrival. Pt skin was still pale and clammy during assessment. Pt stated this has happened in the past with shots and blood draws, however, she has never fully lost consciousness. Pt was still c/o dizziness. Pt requested transport to REX ER. Pt was on the cardiac monitor upon EMS 14 arrival and a sinus rhythm was noted. 12 lead revealed a sinus rhythm with no STEMI criteria met. Pt was able to stand and pivot onto the stretcher without incident. Pt secured via straps and loaded into the unit. Once in the unit, VS reassessed. NS was reduced to a KVO rate due to improvement in BP. Pt had received approx 200mL of NS at the time. Pt denied any chest pain, SOB, N/V, or abd pain. Pt only complaint was dizziness. Pt was initially very anxious and was coached through breathing techniques which improved her anxiety. EMS left en route to REX ER. Pt was monitored during transport with improvement in her condition. Pt skin color and condition improved and her VS remained WNL. Pt denied any complaints during transport other than dizziness which she reported was improving. EMS arrived at REX ER. Pt was taken into the ER triage area and was able to stand and pivot onto a wheel chair. NS DC&#39;d, pt received approx 300mL total. Report given to the triage RN and care transferred to same.

                                                As the vaccine was being administered into my left deltoid, the vaccine hurt at the injection site and I immediately felt very strange and felt a rushing sensation to my head and throughout my body, with a concentration in my upper body.  It felt like an out of body experience: I fainted, hitting my head on the adjacent wall and fell to the ground, where the impact caused a bruise to my shoulder and back.  It was reported to me that I lost consciousness for about 10 seconds.  I felt disoriented, but lucid when I came to.  I was not exactly sure what happened, but I could feel that I hit my head on the right side and asked if I fainted since I was disoriented and on the floor.  With assistance, I was able to sit back on the bench, but felt extremely dizzy, light headed, fuzzy/strange type of blurry vision, and intense sweating.  I did not feel well and knew I would have an unsteady gait if I attempted to stand.  After about 15 minutes, I felt well enough to return home.

She was breathing  and had a low pulse. She became responsive in 1-2 mins and started responding to our questions. We gave her glucose tablet and some water as she stated she had not had anything to eat for the past 2  hours. We monitored  her for additional 30 mins and let her leave when she was normal.

Patient was prescribed Fioricet (butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine). 2021-04-05 - patient developed right-sided neck pain 2021-04-06 - patient got tested for COVID-19, resulted negative on 2021-04-07 2021-04-08 - patient seen at Medical Center emergency department for headache and right-sided neck pain that shoots to (2021-04-08 cont.) the head and shoulder, for which patient self-medicated with ibuprofen. Patient reported to ED provider that using ibuprofen nearly relieves headache and makes her functional and had the most improvement the day she visited the ED prior to her visit. Patient received a CT scan of the head without contrast that was unremarkable. Patient was diagnosed with headache and neck sprain and was prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours, and diazepam 5 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times a day as needed for muscle spasm. 2021-04-12 - patient developed left lower extremity pain 2021-04-14 - patient followed up with Neurologist outpatient as directed by ED provider and was advised to get an MRV and left lower extremity doppler. Patient was prescribed tramadol 50 mg and butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine (Fioricet) by the Neurologist. 2021-04-15 - patient presented to Medical Center ED before outpatient MRV and LLE doppler could be done due to worsening right-sided neck pain and inability to ambulate comfortably due to lower extremity pain that had been worsening over several days. Upon examination, there is subtle swelling to left lower extremity and doppler revealed multiple DVTs in left lower extremity. CT head without contrast was unremarkable, however, CT venogram of the brain reveals thrombi of the right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinuses, as well as IJ. Patient was initiated on argatroban and admitted to inpatient at the time of this report. &#34;Heparin induced platelet antibody&#34; and &#34;lupus anticoagulant evaluation&#34; tests are ordered and pending.

Three weeks after my vaccination, my shot site began to hurt and then I started to exhibit an allergic reaction to foods I had never been allergic to previously. First it was ground turkey, and then two days later, I had an allergic reaction (hives, itchy mouth, and anaphylaxis) to chicken. A few days later I developed the same reaction to beef, and now I have the same reaction to berries and vegetables. My body seems to be attacking everything I eat.

                                                The next morning I woke up and felt very groggy and slightly chilled. I decided to take a shower to warm up. While in the shower I became dizzy and light headed to the point I fainted. I contacted my family physician. I was told as long as I was feeling okay to be on bed rest for the day with my feet elevated and to continue to drink lots of fluids. I was fine the following day.

                                                Most concerning reaction was: on Wed., 3/10/21, at approx. 9:30am, I fainted. I had just had a couple bites of food then felt really warm and nauseous. I fainted at table, then my spouse didn&#39;t know when he came downstairs, he thought my head was just resting at the table. He asked if I wanted to walk to the couch to rest, and as he helped me do so, I fainted and he caught me and carried me to the couch. Recovered within 1 minute but my hearing was  fuzzy for a couple more minutes, sounded like static in my ears.  Other reactions were:  Standard ones I read could happen- Fever of 100.1 that lasted less than a day, chills, aches, warm feeling and fatigue.

Overnight the bump got a bit smaller and the bruise expanded. Over the next several days the bump kept diminishing. The bruise remained about the same size and kept getting darker. It?s been one week now and the bump is very tiny (size of a small pea), and the bruise is incredibly dark, but showing more of a healing process color.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included amoxicillin allergy.  The patient, age 38, received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805029) dose was not reported, administered on 08-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient was &#34;experiencing headaches 1 week ago&#34;, and also had aphasia later in the week.  On 24-MAR-2021, the patient went to an outside hospital and was found to have intraparenchymal hemorrhage in addition to venous sinus thrombosis and developed intracerebral haematoma.  On 25-MAR-2021, Computerized tomography (CT) of the head without contrast showed parenchymal hemorrhage and persistent hyperdensity in the left transverse sinus, consistent with known venous sinus thrombosis. The patient was being treated for the venous sinus thrombosis with heparin. On an unknown date, platelet count was 78,000 (thrombocytopenia). The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of events thrombocytopenia, intracerebral haematoma, venous sinus thrombosis, experiencing headaches 1 week ago, and computerized tomogram head abnormal was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).  Version 3 was created on 26-APR-2021 for the purpose of quality improvement. The following corrections were made: platelet count was added as the event of thrombocytopenia.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V2: Follow up added additional laboratory information. This report received via VAERs database (ID# 1133212) concerned a 38-year-old female patient who experienced intraparenchymal hemorrhage and venous sinus thrombosis 16 days after vaccination. Diagnosis was confirmed on computerized tomography (CT) of the head. Platelet count was 78,000.   Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Presenting symptoms included headache and aphasia. Treatment included heparin.  Outcome was not reported.   Based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination (Criteria level 2), the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

                                                I started experiencing flu-like symptoms at around 5 PM on 3/14/21.  I was feverish and had chills, muscle aches, and a headache.  I had very strong chills for a few hours and then I noticed that my resting heart rate was around 128 bpm at around 1:30 AM on 3/15/21.  I was running a 100.6 fever at that time.  My fever subsided in the morning and the headache persisted throughout the day, and I was very tired as I did not get much sleep the night before.  I did not work that day (Monday, 3/15).  At the time I was about 7 weeks pregnant.  I noticed some very light spotting later in the day on 3/15, and then I continued spotting on 3/16.  I consulted a midwife at the  facility at 4 PM on 3/16/21 and took a blood test to measure my hCG hormone levels.  The following day, 3/17, I received the results that I had a normal level of hCG hormone and normal hemoglobin levels.  As the day continued, the spotting turned into bleeding, and eventually the bleeding became heavy starting around 4 PM.  I received an ultrasound on 3/18/21 at 8 AM and later spoke with a midwife from facility at 11 AM that day, confirming that there was no viable pregnancy detected via ultrasound.  I had lost quite a bit of blood at that point.  I am, as of 8:35 PM on Friday,  March 19th, still bleeding and experiencing the impact of miscarriage.

Couldn?t open eyes or move fingers.  Light headed...blacking out when I got up to go the bathroom.  Couldn?t have any sounds (like tv) on.  Just needed to lay still and sleep.    The above lasted 19 hours.    Then my temperature ended.  I had trouble walking and standing for another 20 hours. No stamina.   I went to work near the end of this and noticed I had trouble looking at my paperwork and figuring what to do for my job.  Not sure if this was still the fatigue just in a different way.  Then it disappeared.

When I looked over, I saw patient experiences minor convulsions. She was still in her chair. Episode lasted not even 10 seconds. Patient awoke and said she blacked out. She was coherent and responsive. We called 911. Patient said she has no history of seizures or low blood sugar. She said she tends to faint when giving blood or during vaccines due to the needle. Paramedic checked patient out and cleared the patient. No ambulance was taken. Will call patient tomorrow to follow up.

                                                After the immunization was administered to the patient, she was asked to have a seat in the waiting area for observation.  A few minutes after she sat, she told her husband who was seated with her she didn&#39;t feel well (he did not inform us).  The technician observing her noticed she passed out and reported to the pharmacist (myself).  I designated a team member to call 911 and ran out to the patient.  She was extremely pale and her lips were blue.  With the assistance of her husband I laid her on the floor, had him elevate her feet and checked for pulse and breathing.  I couldn&#39;t immediately find her pulse but within 30 seconds she began to come to.  She appeared to tremor a few times as she came to and her color began to return.  She was extremely confused and did not know where she was upon awakening.  EMS arrived on the scene approximately 10-15 minutes after the event.  They did standard patient evaluation which was unremarkable and proceeded to bring her to the local ED,  According to the patient, the ED visit yielded nothing and they said &#34;she couldn&#39;t be more healthy&#34;.  One note, that was revealed in conversation with the patient while waiting for EMS to arrive is that the patient had very little to eat or drink prior to being administered the vaccine.

                                                On March 10 (the day after my vaccine) I felt the normal body aches and had a pretty bad headache. That all went away in the evening on March 10. Since that day I have had off and on dizziness/lightheadedness. On March 19 I fainted in my kitchen. I hit my kitchen table and had a huge knot on my head and bruises all down my left side of my body. My left shoulder still hurts from the fall and I still have a small knot on my head (left side just above my left eye on my forehead). I went to my primary care doctor on  March 24 and reported the event. I asked if it could be related to the COVID vaccine and she said she wasn&#39;t sure since the Jansen one was so new, but that she had seen these effects from the other two vaccines.  At the doctor&#39;s office my blood pressure was on the lower end (110/60). My normal blood pressure runs about 118/70. They ran some blood work and that all came back normal. They did an EKG in the office, but my blood pressure stayed pretty close to the same as it was the first reading. They then sent me to get a CT scan on my head, which also came back normal. She did diagnose me with a concussion. I was out of work the entire week (March 22-March 26) due to this. She also ordered me to have an echo done. While at the office for the echo, my blood pressure ran 99/46 (this was on March 31). The results of the echo came back normal.  I also got a monitor to wear for 72 hours on March 31. I took that to the doctor on April 5 and I am still waiting on results from that.  Since the event on March 19, I have had headaches and body aches. I have also had slight lightheadedness off and on.

                                                PULMONARY EMBOLISM IN CHEST; TIREDNESS; This spontaneous report received from the patient&#39;s mother concerned a 39 year old. The patient&#39;s weight was 251 pounds, and height was 66 inches. The patient&#39;s past medical history included a previous pulmonary embolism on 12-JUL-2012, which the reporter said the physician attributed to the patient being &#34;obese and lays on her bed and doesn&#39;t exercise&#34;.  Concurrent conditions included irregular menstruation, schizoaffective disorder, panic attacks, anxiety attacks, depression, incontinence, gastritis, constipation, sciatica nerve pain, asthma, obese, and doesn&#39;t comprehend well.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802070 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 in total administered on 06-MAR-2021 at left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Non-Company suspect included ethinylestradiol/ferrous fumarate/norethisterone acetate, &#34;for two months&#34; for irregular menstruation.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient&#39;s physician ordered the patient to stop taking.  Concomitant medications included salbutamol, lactulose for constipation, clozapine, gabapentin (noted as the doctor was trying to wean patient off medication), oxybutynin hydrochloride, pantoprazole, risperidone, valproate semisodium, vilazodone hydrochloride, and unspecified breathing treatments. In MAR-2021, the patient&#39;s mother stated that the first few days after vaccination the patient was fine. After a few days, patient was more tired than usual. On 16-MAR-2021, the patients mother noticed the patient&#39;s right leg was swollen and decided to take the patient to the Emergency Room. She was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism in the chest verified with radiology tests of chest and many other tests. Treatment included Eliquis 5 mg 2 times a day to treat the pulmonary embolism in her chest.   The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of pulmonary embolism in chest was not reported.  The patient had not recovered from tiredness.   This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 39-year-old obese (BMI 40.5 kg/m2) female patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism 10 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  Concurrent conditions includes  irregular menstruation, schizoaffective disorder, panic attacks, anxiety attacks, depression, incontinence, gastritis, constipation, sciatica nerve pain, asthma, obese, difficulty in comprehension.  Concurrent medications includes ethinylestradiol/ferrous fumarate/norethisterone acetate, salbutamol, lactulose, clozapine, gabapentin, oxybutynin hydrochloride, pantoprazole, risperidone, valproate semisodium, vilazodone hydrochloride, and unspecified breathing treatments.  There was prior history of pulmonary embolism (PE) 9 years prior to vaccination and was advised to be due to obesity and lack of physical activity.  Emergency room consult for leg swelling 10 days after vaccination; diagnosed with PE with radiology and many other unspecified tests; treated with Eliquis.  Th event is confounded by increased risk with prior history of pulmonary embolism, obesity, OCP, and risperidone (class effect).  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

                                                Sudden onset of menstrual period, lasting 2 weeks with extremely heavy flow and pain.  Saw my Dr. and she did a blood test to check for platelet count, which all labs done were normal. Period lasting from 4/7 to 4/21 all the while I take my birth control as normal with no missed doses. Now on 5/7 having severely heavy flow again with clotting. Dr. prescribed naproxen and an extra &#34;mini-pill&#34; hormone supplement on top of my regular birth control. Will monitor.
