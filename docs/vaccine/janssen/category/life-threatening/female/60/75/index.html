My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

I woke up and I was talking gibberish. I was aware that nothing I said was making sense. I went to bed and slept almost 24 hours. I woke up feeling wiped out but I wasn&#39;t confused and I was talking normal again. Right arm hurt and is numb. ( right side of my body typically is kind of numb but the right arm seemed more so numb after the vaccine)

My vitals were checked, I was given water and moved to a cooler area of the facility.  HR was still elevated but I wasnt feeling as flushed.  By 4pm that evening I began having having chills and a fever of 100-100.4 which lasted about 4hrs.  Later that evening my HR elevated to 125 with the feeling of feeling I was having a heart attack.  By that Wed. my HR was still at 125 in motion and about 75 still so I went to visit my PCP on Thurs and when I arrived the HR was 77 but during the visit it elevated to 125 and blood work was done resulting in my tyroid level elevated and since getting the vaccine my HR had been up and down.  When in motion its elevated and when sitting its around 75.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included seasonal allergies, and codeine allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802068, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 05-MAR-2021 to left arm as prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, after vaccination, she felt fine all day and night. The next morning she woke up and felt sick. She had nausea, headache, hive under eye. She laid back down and tried to sleep. A few hours later, she woke up to use the bathroom. She was very nauseous and dizzy. She lost consciousness and fell trying to get to the bathroom. She fell on her bed and was uninjured. The paramedics took her to the hospital. She was given medication for nausea, headache, and IV fluids. She gave blood for lab tests and they came back normal. No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, fatigue, inflammation on left eye, and small hives under eye on MAR-2021, and vomiting on 07-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from canker sore under tongue, and the outcome of fall on bed was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).  Additional information was received from the patient on 23-Mar-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history added as seasonal allergies and codeine allergy, Vaccination site as left arm added; Additional events as small hives under eye, fall on bed; lab test of blood work added; Event outcome of loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: v1: Follow up information received updates  patient&#39;s medical history (seasonal allergies and codeine allergy), Vaccination site as left arm; Additional events (small hives under eye and fall on bed), laboratory test (Blood Work); Event outcome  (loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved). This updated information does not alter prior causality assessment of reported events 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-headache, nausea and fatigue. These events are labeled and are therefore considered potentially related. 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-loss of consciousness, fainted, heart racing, dizzy, vomiting, canker sore under tongue. These events are considered unassessable. The events have a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, are unlabeled, and have unknown scientific plausibility. There are no information on any other factors potentially associated with the events.

She then was given water.  She then became unresponsive, eyes closed, snoring with head slumped down while sitting.  After we realized patient could not be awoken, property manager called 911.  While ambulance was on thier way, patient &#34;woke up&#34; but was drowsy and could barely communicate.  No epinephrine or diphenhydramine was administered.  BP was 130/100.  After EMS arrived, patient&#39;s partner came in from the car and reported this has happened multiple times at doctor appointments/procedures.  Patient was unconscious for around 5minutes.  Patient reported she went to the ED but was discharged after a short visit.

                                                Prior to vaccination, the patient stated that she was nervous, but seemed relieved and okay directly following the vaccination.  Following vaccination, patient became restless during the 15 minute post-vaccination window about 2-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.
