                                                Patient experienced a brain hemorrhage and was hospitalized on Monday, March 15. Despite numerous tests, doctors could not find the source or cause of the bleeding. Over time, the bleeding spread to other areas of her brain including her brain stem. Damage from the bleeding was so severe that she would not recover. She passed away on March 24 after being removed from life support.

                                                I woke up from almost like a pop in my brain and fluid started pouring down my throat and I started choking.  I woke up and was able to spit some of it out. It was clear and also tinged with blood. It stopped once I stood up. I immediately thought my brain was leaking.  I told my daughter about this the next day.  My balance was off and I had a weird flapping in my head for the next few days.  As well as a headache.  A few days after I heard about the blood clots. I am not 100% sure if it was from the shot but it was literally hours from when I received it. It was very scary.

She had several bad headaches since that vaccine up until her death on April 21st.  She was given the J&amp;J vaccine on April 8th at the CVS.  Died on April 21. at home. I just saw an article today, May 4th that about 1-2 hours from her death, another female in her 30&#39;s got the J&amp;J vaccine on the SAME DATE April 8 and she died on APRIL 19th. Pretty close in deaths and same vaccine. IS IT CONNECTED?

                                                Whether the adverse events were caused by the vaccine is to be determined.  We are available to discuss more details if this information can be used to help others from experiencing these reactions.  The morning after getting the vaccine, patient discovered that she could not swallow.  As her condition worsened, she was taken to the emergency room.  Over the past month, patient went to the emergency room 4 times.  The last time resulted in extended hospitalization that continues to this day.  In addition to the swallowing problem, two other major adverse events need to highlighted.  First, on 27 March, while in the hospital, vaginal bleeding started.  On 29 March, her doctor, performed a hysteriscopy/DNC finding &#34;  &#34;an unexplained blood clot (hematoma).&#34;  The second major event was when patient demonstrated significant confusion and lack of memory.  On 7 April, she was diagnosed with Metabolic Encephalopathy.  Neurologists at the hospital suspected that her MS was reacting to her UTI and once the infection is eliminated her memory should come back.  But as of 10 April, she was still having issues including hallucinations.  Although she is eating some as of 13 April, she is still very weak and will likely by moved from the Hospital to a rehab facility.  She still does not remember much of the last 37 days.

Stayed off my feet. Right foot became very cold. 3/30/21 Saw my primary care physician at med center. She sent me for an ultrasound at medical arts. From there I was sent to the emergency room at hospital. I asked the attending physician assistant about a correlation between the blood clot and the Covid vaccine because I had read about it being a concern in other countries. He stated that was a bunch of baloney. Was told to have a repeat ultrasound in a few days and was prescribed a 30 day starter pack of Xarelto and released.  3/30 repeat penis ultrasound of right leg showed the same results. 4/1 appointment with hematologist. Prescribe Xarelto for three months and ordered a repeat ultrasound in three months and bloodwork at that time.

                                                My sister, received the J &amp; J vaccine on March 5th.  I now know that she was not feeling well for a few days afterwards.  She then felt better until day nine after the vaccine.  On the evening of the ninth day,  she began having abdominal pain, vomiting &amp; diarrhea, headache. This was Sunday evening.  Unfortunately I wasn?t aware of how she was feeling and she didn?t go to the emergency rm. until Tuesday morning.  Tests determined her platelet level was low and abdominal CT showed bleeding from her adrenal glands.  She was given platelets, pain meds and admitted into the hospital.  Later that night staff felt she wasn?t responsive and a head CT was performed.  It was determined she had a brain hemorrhage and emergency surgery was performed. It is my understanding that there was brain damage at that point.  During the early morning hours of the 10th day, post surgery, a repeat CT scan was done showing more hemorrhaging and blood clots. She also developed a  DVT and PE and was kept on a respirator until the 13th day post vaccine to allow family to say their goodbyes.  On the morning of the 13th day patient was removed from life support and she passed.

Began at around 10am. Felt like I was dying. Placed on Stroke Unit. Scans and tests all negative for stroke and Drs. thought could be panic attack or TIA. Since then my lingering effects point to TIA, Seemed to clear up around 2pm with gradual improvement through the day. Still experiencing some side effects including tinnitus, memory and word retrieval issues, fatigue, anxiety.  DO NOT HAVE PANIC ATTACKS. The only time I have had a panic attack was at 26 after the death of my mother.

She sent me for a doppler on my legs where a blood clot was found  behind my right knee.  I started taking Xarelto that night - 15mg twice daily for 21 days.  The pain increased considerable and by 4/20/2021 I could hardly walk.  I went back to the doctor that day and she ordered a second doppler study.  The blood clot was stable but there was no change.  Continued on the Xarelto.  Third visit to the doctor on 5/5/2021.  Some lessening of the pain by then.  Doctor changed the Xarelto dosage to 20 mg. one a day for the next two months.  Then we&#39;ll schedule another doctor visit and probably another Doppler Study.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included hypertension, hypothyroidism, and intermittent pancytopenia, and concurrent conditions included metronidazole allergy, hashimoto&#39;s disease, and microscopic colitis. The patient was previously treated with metronidazole.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805018, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 09-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, levothyroxine, losartan, rosuvastatin calcium, and ubidecarenone.  On 09-Mar-2021, the patient got the vaccine and after few days she had aches and pains (very mild reaction) and went to bed early. The patient thought she was fine. On 18-Mar-2021, 04:00, she woke up with an excruciating headache above her left eye in her eyebrow. The patient wondered if it was an aneurysm and took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol and it helped. The patient stated that after every 5-6 hours, excruciating headache came back. The patient had the same headache for over a week. The patient got tested for Covid-19 and it was negative. The patient thought she had sinus problems but had no other symptoms. On 30-Mar-2021, the patient woke up with headache. Her eye was killing her, was sore and swollen, and felt like it was going to burst and her left eye was swollen shut in a couple of hours. The patient narrated it was excruciatingly painful. The patient&#39;s husband drove her to urgent care, where ophthalmology tested the pressure: right eye was normal (she thinks it was 18- normal) and the left eye was 51 (normal is 14-19), units unspecified (intraocular pressure decreased). The eye doctor started prednisone and the patient had a CT scan and lab work done. MRI was also ordered but they were unable to do it right away. On unspecified date in Dec/2020 the platelets were 349 in December and came down to 64, which was very low (low threshold was 150) (thrombocytopenia). The CT scan was performed, they thought she had a cavernous carotid fistula and she was scheduled for an angiogram for a further diagnosis on 01-Apr-2021. The angiogram determined she did not have fistula. The patient was admitted to the hospital after the angiogram and on 02-April-2021, MRI was done. All throughout the process, the ophthalmologist, radiologist and internist all thought it was related to the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. The prednisone started working and the pressure started dropping in her eye. The patient states that doctors think an artery burst behind her eye. After discharge, the patient was taking prednisone which was helping. On the 13th, she was watching television and saw that the vaccine was being put on hold due to the women with clots whose progression matched hers exactly (severe headaches, low platelets, and required attention). She was on prednisone for a month. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: COVID-19 virus test negative (NR: not provided) negative, CT scan (NR: not provided) Not reported, and Platelet count (NR: not provided) 64 (units unspecified). Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: prednisone, and paracetamol. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from thrombocytopenia, intraocular pressure decreased, ocular discomfort, periorbital swelling, and eye pain, excruciating headache on 02-APR-2021, and aches and pains on 12-MAR-2021, and the outcome of artery burst behind her eye was not reported.

My vitals were checked, I was given water and moved to a cooler area of the facility.  HR was still elevated but I wasnt feeling as flushed.  By 4pm that evening I began having having chills and a fever of 100-100.4 which lasted about 4hrs.  Later that evening my HR elevated to 125 with the feeling of feeling I was having a heart attack.  By that Wed. my HR was still at 125 in motion and about 75 still so I went to visit my PCP on Thurs and when I arrived the HR was 77 but during the visit it elevated to 125 and blood work was done resulting in my tyroid level elevated and since getting the vaccine my HR had been up and down.  When in motion its elevated and when sitting its around 75.

                                                I called a message that patient had experienced a stroke recently and had also rececived the Jansson vaccine. I called patient, who had reported that it happened on 4/2. She had woke up and couldn&#39;t put her robe on. Her left arm was not working right. She also noted  that she had drooled. She kept thinking that she was find and got ready and went to work. During work she was typing and found that her left hand was not working still, but still went throughout her day and typed with her right hand. Later that evening when she got home, her husband took her to the ER. There, she reports that her blood pressure was through the roof. She had a CT scan and MRI and labs done and was diagnosed with a TIA. She was started on Plavix, baby aspirin, and was started on a statin drug (couldn&#39;t remember the name as that information was at home and she was at work at time of call). She is on a heart monitor for 4 weeks and has follow ups with her outside PCP and cardiologist. Today she states that she is feeling back to normal and has regained function on her left side. She reports that she had a headache at time that had lasted for a while. She also reports that she feels like she was having issues weeks before because her brain felt foggy and just was not thinking right.

                                                Had Janssen vaccine on 4/9 and within a day  developed subjective fevers and dyspnea which progressed until admitted to  Hospital on 4/11 and promptly intubated for respiratory distress.  Found to be in sepsis and ARDS with multiple negative COVID tests including an extensive respiratory viral panel, we have failed to culture any bacteria from multiple sputum cultures, Legionella antigen and HIV negative.  Have been treating as ARDS 2/2 atypical pneumonia, possible aspiration (although no aspiration event reported) with hospital course complicated by VAP.  Concern remains for possible reaction to Janssen vaccine.  Still admitted to ICU at Hospital.

She prescribed presdone and gave me a work order for a vascular ultrasound to be performed on my left arm. I went on unspecified date for the scan. It was discovered that a DVT blood clot had formed in my brachial vein in the left arm. I was then prescribed eliquis, 20 mg a day for 7 days and told not to take the predesone. NP called my pcp, his office immediately called me and asked me to come in as they are concerned about the high dosage of the eliquis.

                                                Patient went to ER 4/4/21 with severe headache, inability to stay awake. CT scan of the head revealed multiple areas of SAH (unexplained no head injury) and a very large ruptured MCA aneurysm. Patient was COMPLETELY asymptomatic prior to vaccination. The aneurysm was repaired with success but the cerebral hemorrhages kept appearing - unexplained. Cerebral edema became so severe (midline shift up to 9-10mm) neurosurgery ended up performing a burr hole craniotomy to relieve pressure as well as placement of a ventriculostomy. This patient later ended up with severe vasospasms which results in an ischemic stroke of the L frontal lobe. Patient later died in a rehabilitation facility, all of this secondary to the Janssen vaccine. This vaccine should not be administered until further studied. This was a healthy 63 year old woman. Vitals always WNL labs WNL very active, BMI WNL. Absolutely NO comorbidities. A lifelong nurse who raised 2 nurses of her own.  These events took place for over a month. The trauma not only the patient has experienced but her family is unforgivable.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included no known allergies and smoker. Other relevant history included no alcohol intake, nor any drug abuse/illicit drug use. The patient received COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration and dose not reported, batch number: 1805029, and expiry: unknown) administered on 14-MAR-2021 on the left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient had &#34;ankle calf both swollen&#34; indicating potential deep vein thrombosis. She went to hospital emergency room, and &#34;HCP confirmed small  clot&#34;. The action taken with COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S was not applicable. The patient was recovering from &#34;ankle calf both swollen&#34; and had not recovered from potential deep vein thrombosis and small blood clot. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This is a spontaneous report of a 64 year old female who developed a swollen calf and ankle swelling indicating a potential deep vein thrombosis 3 days after receipt of Janssen COVID 19 vaccine. Patient was seen in the emergency room by HCP, who confirmed a small clot. No other medical history was reported but patient was noted to be a smoker, reported as 2x a year. Age increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis, but the there is insufficient other details to make a meaningful medical assessment.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure and diabetes.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 17-MAR-2021 at left arm for prophylactic vaccination.  No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient had experienced headache after vaccination. On 27-MAR-2021, the patient began to experience intermittent pain on right leg. On 30-MAR-2021, she experienced headache again and was still having leg pain; she visited the Emergency Room (ER) and was admitted on 30-MAR-2021. On 02-APR-2021, the patient experienced clots on right leg. On APR-2021, a catheter was placed in catheterization procedure and her right leg vein was unclogged of a clot. A second clot did not require removal because the vein had already unclogged itself after medication. The patient was administered unspecified anticoagulants. She was discharged on 5-APR-2021 and was prescribed ticagrelor which was then changed to clopidogrel. On 18-APR-2021, the patient experienced a headache again and feeling of pressure on legs and hands. Patient was advised to visit ER. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from clots on right leg and intermittent pain on right leg on 02-APR-2021, recovered with sequelae from headache on 19-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from pressure on both legs and pressure on hands. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 64 year-old Hispanic or Latino female with history of high blood pressure and diabetes was hospitalized for clots in her right leg 13 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Concomitant medications were not reported. On the day of her vaccination, she experienced a headache. Ten days later, she began to experience intermittent leg pain. Three days later (ie, 13 days post vaccination), she went to the emergency room (ER) and was admitted to the hospital. During the hospitalization, a clot was removed via catheterization and she was administered unspecified anticoagulants. A second clot resolved on its own without surgical intervention. After 6 days in the hospital, she was discharged with ticagrelor which was later changed to clopidogrel. She recovered from the clots. Thirteen days after discharge, she began to experience headache and &#34;pressure&#34; in both legs and hands. She was advised to go to the ER; no further information was provided. Based on the limited information, the relationship of the serious events with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant. Additional information is being sought.

She stated that her sister received the J and J vaccine on 3/12/21 (confirmed in State vaccine system) at the hospital where she receives her oncology care.  She reported the following:  &#34;She had a massive stroke on MARCH 27TH, 2021 leaving her paralyzed on the right side with the inability to speak, swallow, or see. She was initially diagnosed with Ovarian cancer approximately three and one half years ago. She was chosen for a study with Pharmaceuticals and her diagnosis was changed to a vary rare form of cancer called clear cell carcinoma which originates in the gynecological area. She did have a previous stroke approximately three years ago, (just after original diagnosis) but she was on a different course of treatment at that time...Oncologists have explained that this most recent stroke event would not be considered a side effect of her current treatment routine. She wanted to bring it to the attention of the health department in case it needs to be looked at more closely by the J&amp;J research/scientific team. She passed away on 4/5/21. Her current treatment consisted of palliative chemo only. &#34;  Decedent was a resident but was vaccinated in another state. After the CVA she was brought to the hospital and subsequently transferred to the Medical Center where she died on 4/5/2021. Sister is willing to speak with any investigators if deemed necessary.

On 23-APR-2021, the CTA (Computed tomography angiography) of chest was done with and without contrast and found out central and peripheral pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe. The patient had no CT (computerized tomography) evidence of right heart strain. The patient&#39;s ground glass opacities within the right lower lobe was somewhat band like in appearance and concerned for early pulmonary infarcts. It was reported that this might also relate to sub segmental atelectasis or less likely an inflammatory/infectious process. The patient had also small right pleural effusion; no acute inflammatory process in the abdomen or pelvis. On 23-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s platelet count was 252 k/mcL and was tested negative for covid test. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism; she consulted hematology/oncology specialist and recommended with initiation of argatroban for treatment of pulmonary embolism. The patient was admitted to inpatient on 23-APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of pulmonary embolism/right sided mid back pain was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0;-covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s-Pulmonary Embolism. This event(s) is considered unassessable. The event(s) has a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, is unlabeled, and has unknown scientific plausibility.

We called the emergency services when they arrived she had collapsed. They broke the window and took her to the hospital, upon arrival we were informed that she has got a hemorrhage possible clotting due to high blood pressure. I now know the term is Cerebral Hemorrhage, she has been in ICU on a ventilation machine while they tried to drain the blood and clots. She&#39;s currently out of ICU however still complains about headache and back pain. We are informed that she has now developed some blood pressure and diabetes however it could be cleared in the short term. She&#39;s at the hospital and unknown how long she would have to stay there.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s pre-existing medical conditions included the patient has chronic conditions like Patient Medical History of Hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, type II diabetes,  coronary artery disease with recent segment elevation myocardial infarction left anterior descending s/p Percutaneous coronary intervention, low ejection fraction 30% from 60% s/p single chamber 6/202. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805018, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 06-MAR-2021 10:29 for prophylactic vaccination.  No concomitant medications were reported. On 22-MAR-2021, the patient experienced swelling of legs, venous stasis ulcers, and thrombocytopenia. The patient on unspecified date was shifted in emergency room and later she was hospitalized. Number of days in hospital the patient was admitted was unknown. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: Blood pressure (NR: not provided) Moderate to severe pulmonary HTN, and Echocardiogram (NR: not provided) worsening EF- 15% from 30%m Moderate MR. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from swelling of legs, venous stasis ulcers, and thrombocytopenia. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: A 66 year old female, unspecified ethnicity, was diagnosed with venous stasis ulcers and thrombocytopenia 16 days after receiving the covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s. The patient went to the emergency room for the leg swelling (start date unknown) that was progressing over 2 days. Medical history includes hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and type II diabetes. Patient also has coronary artery disease with recent segment elevation myocardial infarction left anterior descending (STEMI LAD) s/p Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, low Ejection Fraction 30% (from 60%), s/p Single Chamber ICD. Concomitant medications not reported. Smoking history not provided. Echocardiogram revealed worsening EF - 15% from 30%, Moderate MR, Moderate to Severe Pulmonary Hypertension. Thrombocytopenia was reported without a reported platelet count. The patient was subsequently admitted to the hospital for unspecified number of days and was reported to have recovered from all events. Given the patient&#39;s extensive medical history, there is a plausible alternate explanation for swelling of legs and venous stasis ulcers, and there is limited information to make a meaningful assessment of the report of thrombocytopenia. Additional information is requested.

Patient was found to have a right parietal multifocal parenchymal hemorrhage measuring 19x36x37mm and small right temporal lobe SAH. Subsequent CTA showed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and the right frontoparietal cortical veins as well has nonocclusive thrombus of right transverse and sigmoid sinus. The patient was also noted to have focal seizure of mouth and tongue and was loaded with phosphenytoin. After discussing case with neurology, nuero IR, NSGY and family it was decided to transfer the patient to sunrise for close monitoring and consideration of cerebral venous sinus thrombectomy if she worsens. I had a long discussion with multiple sisters about the risks of anticoagulation with argatroban given the IPH but the necessity given the cerebral venous thrombosis. I also discussed that argatroban is not readily reversible and that heparin is contraindicated if there is concern about vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia due to possible PF4 ab related to HIT. The patients VITT modified 4T score is 4 and she is intermediate risk for this being VITT. #Right parietal IPH, right temporal SAH and Superior saggital sinus thrombosis with nonocclusive thrombus of right transverse and sigmoid sinus -concern for vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia given johnson and johnson vaccine 2 days prior -modified VITT 4T score of 4- intermediate -send fibrinogen, d dimer, consider IVIG 1gm/kg per day for two days if high dimer, low fibrinogen and falling platelets -will start argatroban, avoid heparin until HIT ab (PF4) is resulted, if HIT positive avoid heparin -neuro IR consulted for possible IR intervention if worsens -transfer accepted by sunrise ICU, appreciate transfer for IR evaluation -continue phosphenytoin -SBP goal &lt;150 with nicardipine and esmolol gtts -monitor daily fibrinogen, dimer, coags #AKI- monitoring uop and cr, consider renal US if worsens #DM- ISS #HTN- nicardipine and esmolol gtts for SBP &lt;150, target 140 Patient seen, examined, labs and imaging reviewed, agree with resident note

In the emergency room labs remarkable for platelet count 92, INR 1.0, glucose 170, GFR 70.7, AST  48, alkaline phosphatase 167, troponin I 0.039.  COVID-19 and other viral serologies not detected.   CT of the brain showed a small subacute infarct in the right body of the corpus callosum. MRI  advised by radiology. Patient received aspirin, amlodipine 10 mg, enalapril 1.25 mg IV then 0.625  mg IV for uncontrolled hypertension.  MRI of brain reveals small subacute infarct involving the body of the  corpus callosum, and punctuate acute infarct to the posterior left frontal lobe.  Angiogram of brain was performed revealing focal severe stenosis of the mid basilar artery, moderate to severe stenosis of the short segments of both intracranial internal carotid  arteries and moderate to severe short-segment stenosis of the intracranial left vertebral artery, felt to be chronic and unrelated to current symptoms. She was started on dual antiplatelet therapy: clopidogrel  75 mg PO DAILY and   aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (Dr/Ec)  81 mg PO DAILY.  It should be noted that lab work reveals Thrombocytopenia chronically from 2011 forward.
