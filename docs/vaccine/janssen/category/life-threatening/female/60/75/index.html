                                                Patient experienced a brain hemorrhage and was hospitalized on Monday, March 15. Despite numerous tests, doctors could not find the source or cause of the bleeding. Over time, the bleeding spread to other areas of her brain including her brain stem. Damage from the bleeding was so severe that she would not recover. She passed away on March 24 after being removed from life support.

                                                Felt hot within a few minutes after the vaccine, then passed out. The NP on site said she was unable to find a pulse so did 10 chest compressions before I woke up. Called the rescue squad who did an EKG on route to Hospital and once I was in the ER another EKG was performed along with blood work and chest X-ray. Entry was noted as allergic reaction but diagnosis was noted as Vasovagal Syncope, Adult. EKG?s performed along with labs were normal. I have pulled muscles, tendons and ligaments from the chest compressions which were questionable but since that day have experienced tingling in upper body and arms and have felt bad. Went back to my Primary Care Doctor for follow up on March 29 for another EKG. Have had panic attacks from the situation and per Doctor will take 2 months for my chest, muscles, tendons and ligaments to heal. Hard to determine if the way I have felt is from the vaccine or what transacted when I fainted. Today which is April 9, I still feel weak, normally I am very energetic. Just wanted to report as when I saw the news that others had some situations thought best to let you know.

The patient also had a more pronounced stroke system. We read today that people with the systems of low platelets and stoke system need to report. I have called everyone and have had no help. I believe it has to be the health department.

She has no history of a positive COVID test. She reported receiving the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/6 and reports headaches since then. She also had a syncopal episode that prompted her presentation to the ED. She underwent MRV of the brain looking for sinus thrombosis. The brain portion was normal but she was found to have a LIJ thrombus. She denies prior history of VTE. It is overall unclear if this thrombus is related the her symptoms, to the vaccine, or completely incidental. Pt was started on a heparin drip in the hospital...

I woke up and was able to spit some of it out. It was clear and also tinged with blood. It stopped once I stood up. I immediately thought my brain was leaking.  I told my daughter about this the next day.  My balance was off and I had a weird flapping in my head for the next few days.  As well as a headache.  A few days after I heard about the blood clots. I am not 100% sure if it was from the shot but it was literally hours from when I received it. It was very scary.

My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

                                                Beginning approximately 10 PM (about 8 hours post-injection), I started to have chills (feet were freezing) and was exhausted. Went to bed, and slept most of the night, only waking once to urinate and to drink a small amount (approx 2 oz) of Coca Cola -- I was very nauseous and thought it would help settle my stomach. During the night I sweated profusely. At 8 AM,  I woke again and went to urinate. At that time I felt very nauseous, dizzy, and light headed. When I walked about 2 -3 feet to my bedroom, I collapsed on the floor - unconscious. My partner called EMS, they arrived minutes later. By then I was conscious. They transported me to Medical Center Emergency Room, where I remained for several hours. They indicated that my SYNCOPE was a result of dehydration. TODAY, 4/13, news of BLOOD CLOTS has compelled me to report my adverse reaction.

Stayed off my feet. Right foot became very cold. 3/30/21 Saw my primary care physician at med center. She sent me for an ultrasound at medical arts. From there I was sent to the emergency room at hospital. I asked the attending physician assistant about a correlation between the blood clot and the Covid vaccine because I had read about it being a concern in other countries. He stated that was a bunch of baloney. Was told to have a repeat ultrasound in a few days and was prescribed a 30 day starter pack of Xarelto and released.  3/30 repeat penis ultrasound of right leg showed the same results. 4/1 appointment with hematologist. Prescribe Xarelto for three months and ordered a repeat ultrasound in three months and bloodwork at that time.

                                                Whether the adverse events were caused by the vaccine is to be determined.  We are available to discuss more details if this information can be used to help others from experiencing these reactions.  The morning after getting the vaccine, patient discovered that she could not swallow.  As her condition worsened, she was taken to the emergency room.  Over the past month, patient went to the emergency room 4 times.  The last time resulted in extended hospitalization that continues to this day.  In addition to the swallowing problem, two other major adverse events need to highlighted.  First, on 27 March, while in the hospital, vaginal bleeding started.  On 29 March, her doctor, performed a hysteriscopy/DNC finding &#34;  &#34;an unexplained blood clot (hematoma).&#34;  The second major event was when patient demonstrated significant confusion and lack of memory.  On 7 April, she was diagnosed with Metabolic Encephalopathy.  Neurologists at the hospital suspected that her MS was reacting to her UTI and once the infection is eliminated her memory should come back.  But as of 10 April, she was still having issues including hallucinations.  Although she is eating some as of 13 April, she is still very weak and will likely by moved from the Hospital to a rehab facility.  She still does not remember much of the last 37 days.

                                                My sister, received the J &amp; J vaccine on March 5th.  I now know that she was not feeling well for a few days afterwards.  She then felt better until day nine after the vaccine.  On the evening of the ninth day,  she began having abdominal pain, vomiting &amp; diarrhea, headache. This was Sunday evening.  Unfortunately I wasn?t aware of how she was feeling and she didn?t go to the emergency rm. until Tuesday morning.  Tests determined her platelet level was low and abdominal CT showed bleeding from her adrenal glands.  She was given platelets, pain meds and admitted into the hospital.  Later that night staff felt she wasn?t responsive and a head CT was performed.  It was determined she had a brain hemorrhage and emergency surgery was performed. It is my understanding that there was brain damage at that point.  During the early morning hours of the 10th day, post surgery, a repeat CT scan was done showing more hemorrhaging and blood clots. She also developed a  DVT and PE and was kept on a respirator until the 13th day post vaccine to allow family to say their goodbyes.  On the morning of the 13th day patient was removed from life support and she passed.

Began at around 10am. Felt like I was dying. Placed on Stroke Unit. Scans and tests all negative for stroke and Drs. thought could be panic attack or TIA. Since then my lingering effects point to TIA, Seemed to clear up around 2pm with gradual improvement through the day. Still experiencing some side effects including tinnitus, memory and word retrieval issues, fatigue, anxiety.  DO NOT HAVE PANIC ATTACKS. The only time I have had a panic attack was at 26 after the death of my mother.

                                                started vomiting at 1:30 and I felt really dizzy and confused. My roommate found me on the floor passed out. I am not sure how long I was passed out. I woke up and I was talking gibberish. I was aware that nothing I said was making sense. I went to bed and slept almost 24 hours. I woke up feeling wiped out but I wasn&#39;t confused and I was talking normal again. Right arm hurt and is numb. ( right side of my body typically is kind of numb but the right arm seemed more so numb after the vaccine)

                                                A few minutes after the vaccine my heart began palpatating and I began sweating profusely.  My vitals were checked, I was given water and moved to a cooler area of the facility.  HR was still elevated but I wasnt feeling as flushed.  By 4pm that evening I began having having chills and a fever of 100-100.4 which lasted about 4hrs.  Later that evening my HR elevated to 125 with the feeling of feeling I was having a heart attack.  By that Wed. my HR was still at 125 in motion and about 75 still so I went to visit my PCP on Thurs and when I arrived the HR was 77 but during the visit it elevated to 125 and blood work was done resulting in my tyroid level elevated and since getting the vaccine my HR had been up and down.  When in motion its elevated and when sitting its around 75.

                                                The day after having been vaccinated with Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen COVID19 vaccine (04/11/2021),  my mother started to feel intense pain, swelling, tenderness and cramping  in her legs, especially her right leg, to the point that she couldn&#39;t walk. By the fourth day after the vaccine her right leg was completely swollen, twice as big as its normal size, the pain was unbearable and she experienced fatigue and shortness of breath. I took her to the ER  on 04/14/2021

                                                I received the Janssen COVAX on Monday morning, 5 Apr 2021.  A week later, on Monday evening, 12 Apr 2021, I experienced extremely painful leg cramps and broke out in a sweat. I felt extremely nauseous, and weak, this was followed by a sever pain in my head that was so extreme that I passed out. After coming to, the pain in my head finally began to subside, along with the leg cramps. My husband indicated that I was unconscious for just under a minute.  For the next two days, I had bouts of nausea, headaches, sweats, and was extremely tired.  On Wednesday, 14 Apr, after learning of the issues related to the Janssen vaccine, and the symptoms described being what I experienced, I contacted the advice (cont&#39;d)..Additional information for Item 18: Line and was told to go to Emergency Room at the hospital, which I did.  I do not feel that they addressed my concerns or the symptoms that I was experiencing, and at no time did they try to determine if it was due to the vaccine.  The discharge papers did not even address the &#34;event&#34; and the &#34;symptoms&#34; that I described.  They did not take any information down related to the vaccine, lot number, etc., that I had received.  They seemed to go through a set routine:  blood pressure, blood work, temperature, EKG, and CAT scan.    21. (continued)...Visited Emergency Room, however, was requested by ER to go to Primary Care as follow-up, however, as a  Employee we cannot be seen by Primary Care on THIS site.  Instead , we have to go on the local clinic to receive care.  The issue is that this was a vaccine that I was scheduled by my leadership to receive, with no choice in choosing which vaccine I could receive, and without follow-up care for adverse reactions. The hospital did not indicate to me that I should report this incident, however, I am concerned as a result of the &#34;event&#34; that I experienced, that it should be reported.  Furthermore,we should have a choice as to which vaccine we want to receive, just as everyone does.  Your form does not allow for input addresses  Also, your form does not allow for a phone number.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I grew exhausted and had to sleep into late evening and was chilled,  had a fever of 101 and developed severe pain and inflammation on the top of my collar bone that was feverish and migrated toward my shoulder region on the same side as my vaccine. Ibuprofen would not help with the pain but helped with the fever. My mind told me that I had things to tend to the next day, but still was forced to sleep off and on for 2 more days. After a week and a half, not only did I have thirst, but also food didn&#39;t taste right and was metallic.  This lasted for 2 days and finally my taste was restored. The exhaustion lasted off and on for 2 weeks and I just listened to my body. The pain and inflammation on my collar bone has subsided 4 days ago but still have pain in my shoulder when I sleep.  On April 5 around 8:30 a.m. a nasty virus hit me out of the blue. I grew week and tired and had to go to bed. I slept all day until around 9:00 p.m. and woke to uncontrollable diarrhea and fainting spell while in the bathroom. I had abominable pain and nausea that last for a half hour and then I returned to bed. The next 2 days, I was week and exhausted but continued with my regular routine.  My equilibrium is still affected from time to time.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included seasonal allergies, and codeine allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802068, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 05-MAR-2021 to left arm as prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, after vaccination, she felt fine all day and night. The next morning she woke up and felt sick. She had nausea, headache, hive under eye. She laid back down and tried to sleep. A few hours later, she woke up to use the bathroom. She was very nauseous and dizzy. She lost consciousness and fell trying to get to the bathroom. She fell on her bed and was uninjured. The paramedics took her to the hospital. She was given medication for nausea, headache, and IV fluids. She gave blood for lab tests and they came back normal. No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, fatigue, inflammation on left eye, and small hives under eye on MAR-2021, and vomiting on 07-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from canker sore under tongue, and the outcome of fall on bed was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).  Additional information was received from the patient on 23-Mar-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history added as seasonal allergies and codeine allergy, Vaccination site as left arm added; Additional events as small hives under eye, fall on bed; lab test of blood work added; Event outcome of loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: v1: Follow up information received updates  patient&#39;s medical history (seasonal allergies and codeine allergy), Vaccination site as left arm; Additional events (small hives under eye and fall on bed), laboratory test (Blood Work); Event outcome  (loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved). This updated information does not alter prior causality assessment of reported events 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-headache, nausea and fatigue. These events are labeled and are therefore considered potentially related. 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-loss of consciousness, fainted, heart racing, dizzy, vomiting, canker sore under tongue. These events are considered unassessable. The events have a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, are unlabeled, and have unknown scientific plausibility. There are no information on any other factors potentially associated with the events.

Found to be in sepsis and ARDS with multiple negative COVID tests including an extensive respiratory viral panel, we have failed to culture any bacteria from multiple sputum cultures, Legionella antigen and HIV negative.  Have been treating as ARDS 2/2 atypical pneumonia, possible aspiration (although no aspiration event reported) with hospital course complicated by VAP.  Concern remains for possible reaction to Janssen vaccine.  Still admitted to ICU at Hospital.

She prescribed presdone and gave me a work order for a vascular ultrasound to be performed on my left arm. I went on unspecified date for the scan. It was discovered that a DVT blood clot had formed in my brachial vein in the left arm. I was then prescribed eliquis, 20 mg a day for 7 days and told not to take the predesone. NP called my pcp, his office immediately called me and asked me to come in as they are concerned about the high dosage of the eliquis.

Patient waited in waiting area and complained to her husband about feeling dizzy and might faint. Pharmacists went to aid the patient and lay her down gently, monitored her blood pressure which was high at the time, once patient sat up her BP decreased, it fluctuated the whole time, EMT was called and once they arrived and monitored her, they said the cause of her fainting was due to her blood pressure. Patient was alert and responsive the whole time. Patient was unsure if she took her BP medicine this morning.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included no known allergies and smoker. Other relevant history included no alcohol intake, nor any drug abuse/illicit drug use. The patient received COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration and dose not reported, batch number: 1805029, and expiry: unknown) administered on 14-MAR-2021 on the left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient had &#34;ankle calf both swollen&#34; indicating potential deep vein thrombosis. She went to hospital emergency room, and &#34;HCP confirmed small  clot&#34;. The action taken with COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S was not applicable. The patient was recovering from &#34;ankle calf both swollen&#34; and had not recovered from potential deep vein thrombosis and small blood clot. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This is a spontaneous report of a 64 year old female who developed a swollen calf and ankle swelling indicating a potential deep vein thrombosis 3 days after receipt of Janssen COVID 19 vaccine. Patient was seen in the emergency room by HCP, who confirmed a small clot. No other medical history was reported but patient was noted to be a smoker, reported as 2x a year. Age increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis, but the there is insufficient other details to make a meaningful medical assessment.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure and diabetes.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 17-MAR-2021 at left arm for prophylactic vaccination.  No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient had experienced headache after vaccination. On 27-MAR-2021, the patient began to experience intermittent pain on right leg. On 30-MAR-2021, she experienced headache again and was still having leg pain; she visited the Emergency Room (ER) and was admitted on 30-MAR-2021. On 02-APR-2021, the patient experienced clots on right leg. On APR-2021, a catheter was placed in catheterization procedure and her right leg vein was unclogged of a clot. A second clot did not require removal because the vein had already unclogged itself after medication. The patient was administered unspecified anticoagulants. She was discharged on 5-APR-2021 and was prescribed ticagrelor which was then changed to clopidogrel. On 18-APR-2021, the patient experienced a headache again and feeling of pressure on legs and hands. Patient was advised to visit ER. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from clots on right leg and intermittent pain on right leg on 02-APR-2021, recovered with sequelae from headache on 19-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from pressure on both legs and pressure on hands. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 64 year-old Hispanic or Latino female with history of high blood pressure and diabetes was hospitalized for clots in her right leg 13 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Concomitant medications were not reported. On the day of her vaccination, she experienced a headache. Ten days later, she began to experience intermittent leg pain. Three days later (ie, 13 days post vaccination), she went to the emergency room (ER) and was admitted to the hospital. During the hospitalization, a clot was removed via catheterization and she was administered unspecified anticoagulants. A second clot resolved on its own without surgical intervention. After 6 days in the hospital, she was discharged with ticagrelor which was later changed to clopidogrel. She recovered from the clots. Thirteen days after discharge, she began to experience headache and &#34;pressure&#34; in both legs and hands. She was advised to go to the ER; no further information was provided. Based on the limited information, the relationship of the serious events with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant. Additional information is being sought.

She stated that her sister received the J and J vaccine on 3/12/21 (confirmed in State vaccine system) at the hospital where she receives her oncology care.  She reported the following:  &#34;She had a massive stroke on MARCH 27TH, 2021 leaving her paralyzed on the right side with the inability to speak, swallow, or see. She was initially diagnosed with Ovarian cancer approximately three and one half years ago. She was chosen for a study with Pharmaceuticals and her diagnosis was changed to a vary rare form of cancer called clear cell carcinoma which originates in the gynecological area. She did have a previous stroke approximately three years ago, (just after original diagnosis) but she was on a different course of treatment at that time...Oncologists have explained that this most recent stroke event would not be considered a side effect of her current treatment routine. She wanted to bring it to the attention of the health department in case it needs to be looked at more closely by the J&amp;J research/scientific team. She passed away on 4/5/21. Her current treatment consisted of palliative chemo only. &#34;  Decedent was a resident but was vaccinated in another state. After the CVA she was brought to the hospital and subsequently transferred to the Medical Center where she died on 4/5/2021. Sister is willing to speak with any investigators if deemed necessary.

We called the emergency services when they arrived she had collapsed. They broke the window and took her to the hospital, upon arrival we were informed that she has got a hemorrhage possible clotting due to high blood pressure. I now know the term is Cerebral Hemorrhage, she has been in ICU on a ventilation machine while they tried to drain the blood and clots. She&#39;s currently out of ICU however still complains about headache and back pain. We are informed that she has now developed some blood pressure and diabetes however it could be cleared in the short term. She&#39;s at the hospital and unknown how long she would have to stay there.

                                                SWELLING OF LEGS; VENOUS STASIS ULCERS; THROMBOCYTOPENIA; This spontaneous report received from a patient concerned a 66 year old female. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s pre-existing medical conditions included the patient has chronic conditions like Patient Medical History of Hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, type II diabetes,  coronary artery disease with recent segment elevation myocardial infarction left anterior descending s/p Percutaneous coronary intervention, low ejection fraction 30% from 60% s/p single chamber 6/202. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805018, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 06-MAR-2021 10:29 for prophylactic vaccination.  No concomitant medications were reported. On 22-MAR-2021, the patient experienced swelling of legs, venous stasis ulcers, and thrombocytopenia. The patient on unspecified date was shifted in emergency room and later she was hospitalized. Number of days in hospital the patient was admitted was unknown. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: Blood pressure (NR: not provided) Moderate to severe pulmonary HTN, and Echocardiogram (NR: not provided) worsening EF- 15% from 30%m Moderate MR. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from swelling of legs, venous stasis ulcers, and thrombocytopenia. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: A 66 year old female, unspecified ethnicity, was diagnosed with venous stasis ulcers and thrombocytopenia 16 days after receiving the covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s. The patient went to the emergency room for the leg swelling (start date unknown) that was progressing over 2 days. Medical history includes hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and type II diabetes. Patient also has coronary artery disease with recent segment elevation myocardial infarction left anterior descending (STEMI LAD) s/p Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, low Ejection Fraction 30% (from 60%), s/p Single Chamber ICD. Concomitant medications not reported. Smoking history not provided. Echocardiogram revealed worsening EF - 15% from 30%, Moderate MR, Moderate to Severe Pulmonary Hypertension. Thrombocytopenia was reported without a reported platelet count. The patient was subsequently admitted to the hospital for unspecified number of days and was reported to have recovered from all events. Given the patient&#39;s extensive medical history, there is a plausible alternate explanation for swelling of legs and venous stasis ulcers, and there is limited information to make a meaningful assessment of the report of thrombocytopenia. Additional information is requested.

After EMS arrived, patient&#39;s partner came in from the car and reported this has happened multiple times at doctor appointments/procedures.  Patient was unconscious for around 5minutes.  Patient reported she went to the ED but was discharged after a short visit.

                                                Prior to vaccination, the patient stated that she was nervous, but seemed relieved and okay directly following the vaccination.  Following vaccination, patient became restless during the 15 minute post-vaccination window about 2-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.

I don&#39;t know when the SOB started but it continued through the month of March. I thought it was an exacerbation of my chronic issues, by Sunday 4/4/20221  I coughed up blood, and on Monday I went to the hospital and had a CT scan and was told I had a pulmonary embolism and a clot in my leg. Now I&#39;m on an injectable blood thinner for the rest of my life and I was told it would take 3-4 months to resolve the blood clots.
