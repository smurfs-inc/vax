While talking to the patient she leaned forward and was held to prevent her from falling out of chair. She was very sweaty and was slow to regain full consciousness. Emergency services was called where she was evaluated and found to have had a vasovagal response. Paramedics had her lie down before she was sent home.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

                                                Patient was instructed to wait and sat down in observation area for 15 minutes. She fainted within first 5 minutes. I immediately got to her, felt her pulse and she was breathing so I lifted her legs. She immediately came to. We gave her ice packs and sat with her until she was able to move on her own accord. She was light headed and nauseated and had a friend take her home.

Felt as if I were floating to chair. Sat for 20mins, legs weak, odd sensation across shoulder blades &amp; cervical spine. &#34;Slow&#34; &amp; woozy for duration of evening. Physically moved slow, cognitively slowed down, inability to focus. Internal body-wide sensation difficult to define. All very similar to immediate effects I have from alcohol. Passed out (sleep) 9hrs later &amp; woke 100% fine at 8am.

I did go to the Dr. for a follow  up my heart was a little up and down but still within the normal wrong.  She told me to take a week off.

Patient stated she started feeling nauseous and light headed so asked if she can wait outside for some fresh air. When she went outside, she sat on the edge of the stairs and fell backwards and passed out. The store manager was there to catch her before her head hit the pavement. Patient wasn&#39;t alert for about 2 minutes. Pharmacist came out and assessed the patient and she was communicative. She was in and out but was able to tell us her name, DOB and where she was. We sat her up,  gave her some water, and waited with her. She requested not to call the ambulance. I checked her pulse at 1:15pm and it was 92. I checked her pulse again at 1:30pm and it went down to 72. Patient was fully alert and speaking in full sentences by 1:35pm. She called her mom and was able to stand up without feeling dizzy. She walked to the car with assistance and was driven home by her mother.

                                                Had chest pain on and off for 5 days (started Thursday 3/25),  which I thought was related to acid reflux. On Tuesday 3/30 when it became worse and was no longer managed with ibuprofen I went to patient 1st. I was given an ekg which was abnormal and then sent to ER. There it was determined that I had a blood clot and 100% blockage in my right coronary artery. That night I had surgery and they placed a stent.

                                                I started having an annaphylaxis reaction a short time after i left. At first it was intense all over body itching that felt like it was from the inside out. By the time i got home i was getting red blotchy patches over my face, neck, and chest. I took benedryl which did nothing to subside the reaction. When my chest started feeling tight i went to the emergency room. My lips were itching and puffy. At the er  i received treatment for annaphylaxis once and about a half hour to forty minutes before i was to be discharge i had a reoccurance of symptoms and was treated for it a second time and admitted to the hospital. This was from the March 31st clinic held at the fire department.

                                                Pt received vaccine and had a safety barrier bandaid put on. Seconds later, the injection site started heavily bleeding over and around the bandaid. Rph applied constant pressure using cotton balls to the area for 5-7 minutes. Bleeding had stopped and a new bandaid was applied. Injection site adverse event was then resolved. Pt expected this due to her having a medical condition of anemia and taking subsequent B-12 injections. Pt was observed for 30 minutes and no bleeding re-occurred or was seen. Pt was directed to put ice and pressure on it for further home care.

                                                Massive nose bleed with a huge blood clot to follow.  Went to urgent care but it had stopped by then so they sent me home and told me if it happened again to go to ER.  I haven?t had a nosebleed in years so it was scary to get it the day after my vaccine.  The nose bleed lasted about 10 minutes and was very strong once the clot came through it slowed down and then stopped and did not return again.

                                                I discovered patient on the floor at approx. 3:03pm. She was lying face down on the floor next to the chair she was sitting on during her 15-minute observation post-covid19 vaccine. Unknown person turned patient over face-up, Face was clammy and warm/hot to the touch. Pulse was taken (weak). Sweating. Eyes were closed when EpiPen was injected on left thigh through pants. It was decided to inject patient as we did not know what exactly happened, why she was on the floor, and she was unconscious at the time we initially thought to give epi injection. 1 pen injected. Pharmacist called emergency services at 3:05pm. Patient eventually regained consciousness while waiting for the paramedics. She was able to talk and answer questions. She was taken outside the gym on stretcher, but her son met us at the school to pick her up. She declined going to the hospital for further treatment.

My husband was monitoring me, laid down and elevated my legs above my head, took Benadryl, hydrated, and rested. When I could stand, I took a pure hot shower to warm up. I thought I was going to die. The episode started to lessen about 45 minutes after taking Benadryl and elevating legs. Much better today but still not feeling well.

                                                I went to bed with a stomach ache around 10:00pm.  At 3:00am I was awoken by severe abdominal pains/cramps and in a cold sweat.  When I got out of bed I was lightheaded and passed out in the bathroom as I was getting Tylenol.  I took 2 Tylenol and had diarrhea about 10 mins later.  I went to get some gatorade and passed out again in the hallway on the way to the kitchen.  About an hour after taking Tylenol symptoms began to improve but became nauseous and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  As of 2pm Sunday current symptoms are extreme nausea and extreme exhaustion.

However, given the thrombosis occurred on the same day as the vaccine was administered, we felt it was a reportable event

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I blacked out while getting ready for work.  I was feeling a little light headed and thirsty.  Next thing I know, I was on the floor. When I came to, I was disoriented and very sweaty.  The fall caused a cut to my head, bleeding and a bruised elbow. Within an hour, I was feeling less dizzy.

Felt like I may blackout. It&#39;s three hours later and I&#39;m ok now.

                                                I had the shot on weds afternoon. On Thursday I felt ill with flu-like symptoms, mainly body aches and headache. These symptoms were gone by Friday and I felt great. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:30am and needed to use the bathroom/, which is about 10 steps from my bed. As I entered the bathroom I completely blacked out, causing me to fall and break my ribs. This has never happened to me, and there was nothing else wrong with me (I spent 2 days in the hospital checking heart, brain, inner ear, etc). In addition to the 4:30am blackout, it also happened again several hours later at 11am, saturday morning. This time I again got so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stay on my feet, and while my husband was right there lowering me to the floor I was in a daze, a cold sweat, and absolutely no control over it.

Was able to roll down my window and honk horn for emt in parking lot before fainting. Woke up to emt checking blood pressure, pulse and putting oxygen mask on. Then had to throw up, continue oxygen, sat and waited about 45 minutes until I felt like I could safely drive home.  Had mild flu like symptoms starting about 3 hours later, became more moderate symptoms about 8 hours after injection - headache, fatigue, fever, body aches, nausea. Slept all next day, only remained. Still feel fatigue on Wednesday

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

                                                10 days after the vaccine I developed dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth,chest pressure, shortness of breath and felt like I was going to pass out, and I had a feeling of extreme doom. I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

Went to doctor 4 days later because I was in pain mainly in feet, was told I broke my foot.  I asked if vaccine could have caused it and was blown off by 3 different healthcare providers, I thought by law they were supposed t report adverse effects like this.

                                                Following the vaccine injection which was provided by the personnel, I have developed minor fainting spells and angina for the past 10 plus days. A large dried blood clot was noted on the first day of my period which occurred on March 16th. I continue to pass large blood clots while I was having my period. I also want to point out that a personnel who gave me an injection was incorrectly injected the vaccine outside of the area of the preferred injection zone. I have reported this event to the supervisor who was on site. I have not yet contacted my health care provider at this time but plan to contact her tomorrow as these symptoms have been persisting.

                                                She developed a large pulmonary embolus, and she died on 3/17 at Hospital. She developed symptoms of SOB on 3/11, and was admitted to the hospital. She was initially stable and not requiring oxygen and was sent home on anticoagulation. However she returned the same day with worsening symptoms, troponin now elevated, and ECHO showing signs of right heart strain. Embolus on imaging had increased in just over days from previous CT scan. She became pulseless and died despite resuscitative efforts. It is my opinion (Dr.) that she died of a pulmonary embolus, and an autopsy is pending.

I was experiencing headaches all day. The following morning on Sunday I woke up and passed out, I guess my blood pressure dropped and I don?t know why and this is never happened.  Had no appetite since Friday and maybe that?s why but my BP is 120/60 as of 10:08am AFTER I passed out at around 8:30am. I?m now feeling better all of a sudden, can drink coffee and hopefully I?ll get a shower....... oh and my joints are sore, I think whatever could go wrong , did!

Rph caught her as she started to lean forward and she almost fell but I was able to get her to turn sideways and instead lay down on bench rather than fall forward.  So she basically fainted for a minute and then laid for awhile while 911 was called. Ambulance arrived and patient remained conscious.

Slept the rest of the morning and had some feeling of tightness in my chest in the late afternoon and evening.  Thursday morning when I woke up, my arm was sore but I felt mostly better (still a bit of tightness in the chest).  Did not seek medical attention at this time - just monitoring symptoms as of Thursday, 4/8/21.

Paramedics were sent to my vehicle, they laid me back, took vitals and assured me that eyesight would return, which it did. They monitored me for 30 minutes and gave me a granola bar which I ate. When I was stable, I drove home.

After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

My husband suggested I take Theraflu Nighttime for the pain and to sleep, which I took. Around 4:42 AM, I woke up to use the restroom. I was drenched so I guess I sweated out a fever. Went back to bed. My husband woke me up and suggested I drink some water. I went to the restroom, still feeling out of it, then made my way to a chair where I sat and down and collapsed. According to my husband he tried several times to revive me and finally I began gasp for air. The paramedics arrived and I was taken to Medical Center.

Patient did not fall down or was she injured by fainting. Patient slowly rolled off chair and patients friend helped lower her to floor where patient regained her awareness . Pharmacist raced quickly to be by patient&#39;s side to monitor her vitals and to see if an allergic/ anaphylactic reaction had occured. No symptoms of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis was observed by pharmacist. Patient quickly regained her awareness and stated that fainting is common to her when routine blood work, injections, giving blood, etc.. Patient stated that fainting is something that has occurred several times in her past. No signs of allergic reaction, redness, hives, facial swelling, cardiovascular collapse were observed by pharmacist while closely monitoring her vitals after 911 was called. EMTs and paramedics arrived quickly and after closely examining patient and talking with her it was decided by Paramedics that patient fainted due to an emotional response by patient and there was no allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to report, nor any injury sustained by patient after fainting. Patient was quickly back to normal, and she verbally declined ambulance. Patient stated that she felt fine and that she was going to do some shopping and return home to relax.

We sat with the patient for about 5 minutes and asked that she stay seated for the remainder of her &#34;15 minute wait period.&#34; She was accompanied by her husband. Roughly 10 minutes after administration, one of our technicians alerted the pharmacists that the patient had experienced vasovagal syncope, so we rushed to the patient, called 911, and remained with her until she woke up (which was within less than 1 minute after the event) and was in the care of other healthcare personnel.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after administering the vaccine, the patient reported feeling dizzy.  I checked her blood pressure and pulse and both were normal.  On 4/8/21, an email from our manager of Human Resources stated that the patient was in the hospital since 4/7/21.  It also stated she had a heart attacked and issues with her gallbladder.

                                                Prior to receiving her COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was already having symptoms from anxiety/nervousness about the vaccine. Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient&#39;s face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;. EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient&#39;s friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient&#39;s vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient&#39;s husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.

That evening she was taken to the Cath Lab and had an IVC filter placed. The next day patient began to have paresthesias and discoloration of the right lower extremity.  Ultrasound showed high-grade occlusion of the right proximal superficial femoral artery.  Patient was pre-treated with platelets and  taken back to Cath Lab emergently.  In addition to the right SFA there is also thrombotic occlusion of bilateral iliacs.  Patient had bilateral thrombectomy and bilateral common iliac stent placement. The following day developed gross hematuria.
