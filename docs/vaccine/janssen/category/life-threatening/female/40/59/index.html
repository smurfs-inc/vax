                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

I tried to drink some water and my husband and I tried to walk to the tent for observation. I fell down and fainted. I was wheeled in a wheelchair to the ER and vital sign and blood sugar and EKG were performed. I declined being admitted to the hospital for further investigation.

                                                Chills/shaking began approximately 8 hours after injection.  Other symptoms of an achy upper body, temperature of 103.1, and nausea came shortly after initial symptoms (within 1 hr.).    In the middle of the night, I began heavily sweating (something I have never experienced).  I was drenched with sweat and needed to change in the middle of the night.   Absolutely no energy and a horrible headache.    24 hrs. after the injection I no longer had a high fever.  However, consistently for a week, every day, I had at least one symptom (headache, nausea, chills, or lack of energy) at some point throughout the day.  When I received the injection, I was on day 2 of my period.  It ended one day later than normal.  However, what was not normal was that on 4/3/21, I began to bleed again.  I passed 2 clots and had spotting for an additional 5 days.  This is in no way normal to my cycle.

I noticed that my blurred vision intensified.  I went to the eye doctor 3/16 and that is where they found blood clots behind my right eye close to my center.  I was referred to a Retinol specialist 3/26/21 and sent me to get  a physical to check for diabetes.  It had started to heal a little. There was not clear diagnosis on what could have been causing the the blood behind my eye.  4/2/2021 Went for physical at PCP and results of physical was good with no Diabetes.

                                                experienced a sudden pain to the forehead. Pain increased from 0-100 very rapidly, I became very nauseated to the point of having projectile vomit. Experienced blackout segments. Took 1 dose of 100mg Sumatriptan at about 930pm and tried to sleep w/the immense pain. Took 2nd dose at about 12am. Pain did not dissipate but fell asleep. When i woke up pain was gone but felt very sore, dizzy and disoriented. Fast forward to April 9th while laughing uncontrollably the right side of my face spasmed/cramped  closing my right eye and contracting my right cheek as if having Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never experienced this before. Face did not continue to droop but has left a tick/twitch sensation under my right eye.

The x-ray didn&#39;t show anything however my cbc was of concern and she also did a d timer.  It came back elevated,  so she sent me over for a CAT scan with contrast. It showed pneumonia in my upper and lower right lung and also my lower left lung. She sent me home to try and treat it there. Over the weekend I felt worse and my husband took me to the ER.  Upon arrival my blood pressure was 160 over 120 and heart rate was 140. They admitted me to the hospital for treatment of sepsis and pneumonia and pain management. I was there for 4 days. I was released on the 22nd of April and I am still feeling all of these effects on my body. Headache that I have not been able to get rid of even with the help of  prescription medication.

She was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Platelet count normalized 9 days after admission.  She underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement 11 days after admission and was extubated 4 days later, then transferred out of the ICU 2 days after that.  Course complicated by pulmonary embolism diagnosed 4 days after she left the ICU which is being treated with apixiban.  She has a right hemiparesis and continues to have dysphagia and dysarthria.  She is dependent on NG feeds for nutrition.  Anticipate discharge to long-term acute care within the next 2-3 days.

                                                Was diagnosed with a DVT 3.5 weeks after vaccination. Started experiencing symptoms of DVT 20 days after the vaccine. Symptoms were not atypical and were almost not checked for DVT at ER.  Started with twinges in my right leg for several days. Then pain in my back right behind my heart. Then developed sporadic chest pain and heart palpitations. I was afraid to go to the ER because of COVID because my 12-year-old daughter has a heart condition.  Then on April 30 mid-day my right thigh began to hurt like a  pulled muscle although I had not injured it or pulled it. I couldn&#39;t walk on my leg the pain was so intense. My family was very worried about a blood clot because of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. That night I had really sharp chest pains and my thigh pain was no better by the next morning. I went to the ER told them my symptoms. After the ER doctor examined me he said he was 99% sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot because my pain was in my thigh and there was no redness or swelling. He told me my chest pain was probably due to anxiety. I asked if he would check my leg anyway. Once the ultrasound of my leg was done the DR came back and said I had a DVT. Then I had to have an MRI of my chest which he told me was a lot of radiation. I did not have a PE. They did not prescribe Heparin because they felt the DVT was from the vaccine. So I was giving Eliquis. Since then my family DR has run more tests and I do not have any genetic reason to have the DVT. I do not and have not taken birth control in the past 20 years. I am now on a blood thinner for at least 90 days if not longer and I am continuing to have twinges and chest pain twinges.

                                                Had a few cocktails and I blacked out, was highly sensitive to the alcohol. I was throwing up for two hours. I couldn?t move. I couldn?t stop the overwhelming need to vomit. I would try and lay down and was in pain. I ended up telling my partner to call an ambulance after two hours of being in such pain. We were across the street from a hospital so we drove. I was given fluid and blood work was done. I left before receiving the results. I couldn?t stand another minute lying there freezing. The machine that was monitoring me kept beeping quickly. I was able to get home and I slept for 12 hours and woke up feeling achy and was having hot flashes for a few hours.

I immediately got to her, felt her pulse and she was breathing so I lifted her legs. She immediately came to. We gave her ice packs and sat with her until she was able to move on her own accord. She was light headed and nauseated and had a friend take her home.

I couldn?t take it anymore, as I was preparing myself to go to the emergency room. I got into the shower the steam from the shower felt like it was suffocating me and I passed out my children took me out of the bathtub and rushed me to the emergency room where I was given several tests that include x-ray, CAT scan, artery bloodwork and vein bloodwork. I was being treated for asthma and given several different breathing treatments and steroids, unable to keep my stats at a decent level and the hard rebound even after continuous treatments, I was admitted because the breathing treatments were not effective. I am still uncertain of the ?actual outcome? the Hospital doctors treated me for an asthmatic episode and gave me directions how to handle my asthma i was prescribed prednisone and referred  to my primary that would then refer me to a pulmonologist and cardiologist. At the hospital I was told that there was black spots on my lungs I was told that I was being treated for infection, but then also told it could be pneumonia no certain  answer was ever given and i was given and antibiotic and was also told that I needed to see my primary for a way to maintain my asthma. The antibiotics seem to work for a couple of days and again I&#39;m back to having difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, muscle pain soreness and mild lingering headaches.

                                                ? Acute CVA (cerebrovascular accident)  Hospital Course/test results:  Work up with MRI showed 2 small acute infarcts in R temporal lobe region, and findings which could represent subacute infarcts in L frontal lobe.  Neuro deficits now resolved.  Neurology consulting.  Suspicious for embolic phenomenon.  She does also have a IUD to treat her menorrhagia, which may predispose her to clotting.  However when we did further research Mirena IUDs were not found to raise the risk for blood clot-related heart attack and strokes but the company does recommend clinical consideration for removal in such situations. We contacted  OBGYN oncall physician and spoke to doctor today. From his recommendation is not to remove the IUD at present time because the risk is very low comparing to the higher risk of severe menorrhagia that patient had experienced in the past. Since she will have annual visit with her GYN at OBGYN, patient should have that conversation with her GYN for options.    Patient remains stable and symptoms free. Repeated brain MRI and new MRV did not reveal new findings. Her HA resolved on its own. She was initially started statin and full dose of ASA then changed to low dose ASA plus Plavix (21 days) then ASA as monotherapy after. Currently hypercoag panel is still pending. Echo showed no evidence of intracardiac shunting with fair quality and technically adequate study. Neurology recommended outpatient follow up with neurologist and 30 days heart monitor to look for Afib/flutter. Currently her headache is resolved as well R hand weakness/tingling is resolved. She is stable to go home today.    A1C is 7.3 while on Metformin (2000mg daily). She may need additional agent to get A1C &lt; 7 as outpatient.    Neuro also recommended outpatient sleep study.

It had the appearance and consistency of vegemite or molasses. Black sludge. At first it was extremely heavy with very large black clots. Then it became tiny little black clots suspended in a brown sludge. This continued for 6 days until 04/18. Then on 04/19 my menstruation turned bright red with no clots, but has not abated at all for another 4 days. I am currently today on Thurday 04/22 still bleeding almost 2 weeks after taking the J&amp;J shot. I cannot believe I am still bleeding after 10 full days!!! Never in 30 years of menstruating have I had a 10 day period. I am very scared and upset.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

I did go to the Dr. for a follow  up my heart was a little up and down but still within the normal wrong.  She told me to take a week off.

Patient stated she started feeling nauseous and light headed so asked if she can wait outside for some fresh air. When she went outside, she sat on the edge of the stairs and fell backwards and passed out. The store manager was there to catch her before her head hit the pavement. Patient wasn&#39;t alert for about 2 minutes. Pharmacist came out and assessed the patient and she was communicative. She was in and out but was able to tell us her name, DOB and where she was. We sat her up,  gave her some water, and waited with her. She requested not to call the ambulance. I checked her pulse at 1:15pm and it was 92. I checked her pulse again at 1:30pm and it went down to 72. Patient was fully alert and speaking in full sentences by 1:35pm. She called her mom and was able to stand up without feeling dizzy. She walked to the car with assistance and was driven home by her mother.

                                                Severe burning sensation when injected. Extremely sore arm once injection removed. Directed to park car for to be monitored for 15 minutes. Parked the car. Car was in park but still running. Attendant at the clinic instructed me to move my car forward. I put the car in ?Drive? and as I moved forward I lost consciousness. Completely blacked out. Foot released off brake and unconscious in the car, the car rolled for some distance and crashed in a parked car. I was revived once someone tried to wake me up. I was white and delirious and had no idea what had happened.  Presently have no smell and have been very tired with the chills. I was sweating in my sleep, shivering and woke up in a wet bed from all my sweat. The next day my arm is extremely sore and I am running low grade fever. If the car attendant did not tell me to move my car I would have blacked out in a stationary car and not cause damage to someone else?s car. This has caused nearly $7000 in damages to my car not to mention the other car.

                                                Had chest pain on and off for 5 days (started Thursday 3/25),  which I thought was related to acid reflux. On Tuesday 3/30 when it became worse and was no longer managed with ibuprofen I went to patient 1st. I was given an ekg which was abnormal and then sent to ER. There it was determined that I had a blood clot and 100% blockage in my right coronary artery. That night I had surgery and they placed a stent.

                                                I started having an annaphylaxis reaction a short time after i left. At first it was intense all over body itching that felt like it was from the inside out. By the time i got home i was getting red blotchy patches over my face, neck, and chest. I took benedryl which did nothing to subside the reaction. When my chest started feeling tight i went to the emergency room. My lips were itching and puffy. At the er  i received treatment for annaphylaxis once and about a half hour to forty minutes before i was to be discharge i had a reoccurance of symptoms and was treated for it a second time and admitted to the hospital. This was from the March 31st clinic held at the fire department.

She contacted her doctor on 3/25 and he thought maybe she had an inner ear infection.  Symptoms continued to worsen and eventually an ambulance was called on 3/27 because patient stated she was having severe SOB and headache along with dizziness and fever.  Patient was transported to Hospital where they tested her for covid and pneumonia.  Both came back negative.  After several tests it was confirmed she had a blood clot in her lung and was also told she had clots in her leg and heart as well.  She was in the hospital for 3 days where she was given heparin and several medications for the headache.  Patient was discharged on lovenox and coumadin and eventually switched to xarelto by pcp who is managing her anticoagulation.  She still has follow up appointments with a cardiologist and neurologist.  She said she is still experiencing some dizziness and SOB but overall doing better

She passed out and when she came to she experienced decreased vision.  She was taken to the emergency room via ambulance for tests.  She was diagnosed with a blood clot to her lungs after CT scans.  She also had aditional scans and blood work and stayed at Hospital in town (I am having trouble adding this to the shaded area in question 21).

While I was getting her tylenol she fainted, hitting her head on the floor. When she came to, she started experiencing the chills along with an irregular body temperature. I put blankets on her, gave her water, and tended to her eye. I was able to move her from the floor to the bed within 15 minutes. She fell asleep around 2am. She has been doing better but has been experiencing off &amp; on headaches &amp; nausea. We did not go to the doctor since we do not have insurance.

I was so severly sick, in bed and couldnt hardly move.  On Sat I was being transported  to the hospital when I got super nauseaed so my husband pulled over and I passed out and went unconscious and fell out the car onto the ground.  EMT was called and transported me to the hospital when a CT Scan and EKG was performed. I was given IV fluids, monitored and released after some time.  Over the next few days I felt absolutely awful.  On 4/15 I had a phone F/U visit with my PCP.  I still havent felt to myself to date and had to go back to the ER last night because I was so nauseaed and dizzy I couldnt stand or do anything and I am still having the diarreah also

These symptoms persisted and my doctor advised me to go to the ER for brain imaging 24 hours after the vaccine. On day 3 after the vaccine, my symptoms had diminished but not subsided and I began to have new symptoms: extreme heat and pressure starting at my right ear and spreading through my face and head. The heat has subsided but not the pressure, as I am writing this it is day 13. Tests came back normal, but weakness and pressure neurological symptoms persist.

                                                My first menstrual period following the vaccine was exceedingly heavy in flow for the first two days, which is atypical for me.  Heavy clots of menstrual discharge were observed. It is not yet known whether these side effects will continue for my next menstrual cycle. Lesser effects followed two days after the vaccine with fatigue, sore arm, armpit, and glands in the injection arm. These side effects dissipated by day 3 status post vaccine administration.

                                                I reported previously that the day of the shot (that evening at close to midnight) I fainted.  I woke up on my bathroom floor.  I walked down my hall and saw black dots and felt dizzy with nausea.  The next thing I knew I was on the bathroom floor and didn?t remember how I had gotten there.  It is Friday and I now am experiencing shooting pains in the side of my head.  I also have been experiencing pains in my calf muscles and some chest pains.  I am still extremely tired and having abdominal pain.  I have contacted my doctor?s office about the fainting but I am going to call Monday to get an appointment to get checked out.  I am concerned about possible blood clots.

One week later, March 20, 2021, she started complaining of severe headaches, dizziness and vomiting.  This continued so she visited the ER on Wednesday, March 24, 2021, where she suffered a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.  She was pronounced brain dead on March 27, 2021, which is also the same day she was pronounced dead.

The strange thing was that I was having a hard time not passing out for at least 10 minutes after this shot.  I have never experienced this before.  I had no energy for the rest of the night.  By the next day I had a fever and felt like i had the flu for over 24 hours.  My husband did as well but he did not pass out.

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine, pt had complete loss of consciousness for approximately 30-45 seconds.  Pt was lowered to the floor and placed in trendelenburg.  BP 132/71, HR 93, 98% on RA.  BP 10 minutes later with pt lying down dropped to 83/49, HR 52 and 99% on RA.  Each time we attempted to have pt sit up, Pt would begin to have tingling in extremities and ringing in ears.  EMS called.  BP eventually raised to 127/66 with pt sitting upright but EMS preferred to transport pt to Hospital. Pt evaluated in ED and notes indicate that EKG was done and revealed normal sinus rhythm. Determined to be vasovagal reaction leading to syncope. Pt discharged to home in stable condition.

Rph applied constant pressure using cotton balls to the area for 5-7 minutes. Bleeding had stopped and a new bandaid was applied. Injection site adverse event was then resolved. Pt expected this due to her having a medical condition of anemia and taking subsequent B-12 injections. Pt was observed for 30 minutes and no bleeding re-occurred or was seen. Pt was directed to put ice and pressure on it for further home care.

Went to urgent care but it had stopped by then so they sent me home and told me if it happened again to go to ER.  I haven?t had a nosebleed in years so it was scary to get it the day after my vaccine.  The nose bleed lasted about 10 minutes and was very strong once the clot came through it slowed down and then stopped and did not return again.

                                                About five minutes after receiving the vaccine I began to feel something was terribly wrong. I then blackout for several minutes. From my son&#39;s description I believe I might of had a seizure. He said my eyes were wide open, I was slumped over, and gurgling. I was completely unresponsive to him. He summoned the paramedics who loaded me in an ambulance soon after I came to. They checked my vitals. My heart rate was 47 bpm and blood pressure was 80/40. They also checked my blood sugar. It was 116. They decided I needed to go to the hospital and began giving me iv fluids in route. At the hospital an EKG was taken, which came out normal, they continued iv fluids, and did a urinalysis on me. All test indicated I was healthy. It about three hours before my blood pressure and heart rate stabilized. Just as long for me to feel like I would be ok. They discharged me at this point. Since they I have just been extra tired and have had muscle discomfort.

At night I woke up from deep sleep and started crying that my leg  was hurting badly and felt like something was stuck in my knee couldn?t  move for couple min.  5 min later I got up to take pain medicine and try to walk  and  I was able to walk after that so went to use bathroom ( to urinate) while I got up.   After that since I had pain in my leg earlier  I went to grab  pain medicine than again I started crying and saying I don?t feel good than I passed out completely and was unconscious.   My husband picked me up and brought me to bed and said I had black out and fell on my face  on floor .

                                                Received Janssen vaccine 4/6.  Started menstrual cycle 12 hours after vaccine even though had just completed last cycle 1 week prior.  Normally cycles are 28-30 days apart.  They have not been quite as regular since Covid and has had some shorter periods between normal cycles.  After the vaccine bleeding was heavier than normal with large clots but by end of last week had changed color and looked like it was ending.  Today had no discharge upon awakening but again has a small amount of bright blood.  Of course, there is concern for coagulopathy related to the vaccination.  No leg pain, no shortness of breath.  Has had HA off and on since had Covid but no worse now than in previous weeks.  Left ear pain has been painful since Covid but now has pain in both ears when that occurs.  Quit taking ibuprofen last week for discomfort and switched to Tylenol.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on 3/5/2021.  My first menstrual cycle after the vaccine, which started on 3/21/21, was significantly different than any other period.  I woke in the middle of the night to extreme pain in my abdomen and bled along the floor as I walked to the bathroom.  There were clots in the blood in addition to extraordinarily heavy blood flow.  The period was so significantly different from any other that I scheduled an appointment with a nurse practitioner that works with my primary care doctor.  I asked her to &#34;run&#34; all tests that were available and approved by insurance, which she did.  All came back normal.  Due to the significant difference in my period this month, the ARNP  requested an inner-uterine ultrasound which found the below:

I told my husband (who was in the middle of getting his shot) and the administrator that  I was passing out.  I blacked out. They ran over. They said 5 minutes passed in which my eyes were wide open and dilated. I suddenly began profuse sweating  and convulsions/ severe full body shaking. They could not keep me lucid, and called 911.  Paramedics came and got a systolic BP of 36 (I?m unaware of the diastolic BP) with blood sugar at 111 ish. I could not form words and kept going in and out of consciousness. I was transported by ambulance to the ER. A few minutes into the ambulance ride I was able to form words, and vitals stared to return.  I?ve passed out a few times and this WAS NOT a normal episode of syncope.

White count was noted as 2.8. Chest pain went away after 24 hours and palpitations started 4/11/21, severe at times for several hours at a time. Saw my cardiologist on 4/15/21 for severe palpitations and he ordered a halter monitor to be worn for 2 weeks. I stated  to him that I felt like I was in SVT, or something stronger than just palpitations. This continued for several hours a day from 4/11/21 to 4/24/21, when I was on the telemetry pack at work and went into an arrythmia that was later evaluated by my cardiologist as SVT and A FIB. On 4/25/21, I had mild &#34;palpitations&#34; but have not had any incidences since. I am now on metoprolol to control it and did not have a cardiac issue prior to receiving the vaccine.

                                                I discovered patient on the floor at approx. 3:03pm. She was lying face down on the floor next to the chair she was sitting on during her 15-minute observation post-covid19 vaccine. Unknown person turned patient over face-up, Face was clammy and warm/hot to the touch. Pulse was taken (weak). Sweating. Eyes were closed when EpiPen was injected on left thigh through pants. It was decided to inject patient as we did not know what exactly happened, why she was on the floor, and she was unconscious at the time we initially thought to give epi injection. 1 pen injected. Pharmacist called emergency services at 3:05pm. Patient eventually regained consciousness while waiting for the paramedics. She was able to talk and answer questions. She was taken outside the gym on stretcher, but her son met us at the school to pick her up. She declined going to the hospital for further treatment.

My husband was monitoring me, laid down and elevated my legs above my head, took Benadryl, hydrated, and rested. When I could stand, I took a pure hot shower to warm up. I thought I was going to die. The episode started to lessen about 45 minutes after taking Benadryl and elevating legs. Much better today but still not feeling well.

I didn?t think it was a big deal, but it was unusual for me to faint.  I haven?t fainted since I moved in 1985 because of altitude.  I also had moderate body aches different from my fibromyalgia or RA symptoms.  This all happened about 25 hours after I received the Johnson Johnson vaccine.  I didn?t think to report it until I read the news.  I am fine now and don?t need any help.

                                                Around five hours after shot I felt what I would describe as brain fog and light headache, by the evening I was aching, chilling and had 101 fever. Aches in my muscles and joints as if I had Rocky mountain spotted fever again. That is what the side effects reminded me of. This went on for over 48 hours. I have never been so sick. Very nauseous by next day. Also fell to the floor from nearly passing out the following morning. Took a minute for the light headed To pass. Arm pain still today. It was very scary and seemed to be a very serious reaction. Friday after noon finally started feeling better. The other strange part of this is that my daughter and best friend and I received the shot together in the same lot number and every one of us was deathly ill with the same symptoms. I am the only one with the fainting spells. Still feel fatigued today. And shoulders and left arm injection site still sore and achy.

                                                Later that day of the vaccine I woke up about 11pm with a fever, all joints hurting, my eyes were hurting and flu like symptoms which continued throughout the night.  I was extremely thirsty which caused me to consume over 60 ounces of water overnight.  Woke up about 7am and went to prepare coffee and blacked out.  When I woke up I was on the floor and had a bursted nose and EMT was called.  I was transported to the ER where I was administered IV fluids, EKG and CBC were done but clear and I was diagnosed as severly dehydrated.  I was released about 5hrs later but the consistant feeling of constant thirst has remained even still today.  I have also had a lingering headache also.

                                                About 4 days after I started having abdomen pain, it was like having contractions, then bleeding and spotting, and it was a different type of color instead of a period color, more burgundy. it lasted 26 days, when I&#39;d eat it would start again, I started having headaches, and had vision problems, then SOB started and I used the inhaler to help. I also had a low grade fever of 99.8 - 100 that lasted up until about 5 days ago. I started having bruising and leg pain, the bruising would be if someone helped me get up, I have little bruising dots over my body.  I went to the ER 3/16/2021 because the stomach and headache pains, they did a MRI and Ct and said it was acute stomach pain and migraines and told me to see a OBGYN for the bleeding and gave me meds for stomach pains. Bentel for stomach and Floraset for headaches but it never worked. I had a nerve block on my head for the migraines but it didn&#39;t work.  The GYN gave me something to stop the bleeding and she&#39;s wants to do a D&amp;C. I&#39;m waiting to see my PCP on the 19th.  I still have the purple dots and headaches, I still get the contractions and the stomach issues have settled some.

                                                BLOOD CLOT IN ARM; FEELING SICK; This spontaneous report received from a patient via a company representative concerned a 47 year old female. The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of report The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 05-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On an unspecified date in APR-2021, the patient experienced burning sensation in arm, tenderness of arm, and pronounced veins on arm; also she was feeling sick. She saw the healthcare professional (HCP) after these symptoms. She was told about a blood clot (tenderness / burning sensation/ pronounced veins) in the arm. HCP recommended her taking aspirin and applying heat to the arm. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: acetylsalicylic acid. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from blood clot in arm, and the outcome of feeling sick was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 47-year-old female patient reported burning sensation and tenderness in arm, pronounced veins in arm, and feeling sick after an unspecified duration from receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  HCP was consulted and was &#34;told&#34; about a blood clot and prescribed aspirin with advice to apply her to the arm.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

I woke up at 3am and started to pass out and I couldn&#39;t see and falling down. I went to the ER and my pulse and blood pressure were low and I was mildly dehydrated. I had Sinus Bradycardia which they said may be transient. I have never had an unusual rhythm readings.  I experienced the lightheadedness for about a week. I did not drive or ride my bike because I might need to lay down.  Three weeks after the vaccine it seemed to get better a little a time and the events were less frequent. It has been four weeks and I feel fine now and I have resumed my normal activities.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included aspirin allergy, and hypertension. On 31-MAR-2021, the patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, administered in left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported. The company was unable to perform follow up for Batch/lot numbers. The concomitant medications included unspecified natural pills. On 05-APR-2021, the patient was hospitalized for venous thrombotic cavern sinus and thrombocytopenia 25,000, computerised tomogram head abnormal, fibrin d dimer increased, magnetic resonance imaging head abnormal, and developed platelet count decreased, venogram abnormal.  On 05-APR-2021, the subject experienced full blood count. The patient was hospitalized (date unspecified) for 12 days. The following laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: CT scan results not provided, Complete blood count results not reported, Fibrin D dimer was elevated (value not provided), MRI results were not reported and Venogram was abnormal. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the cavernous sinus thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, computerised tomogram head abnormal, fibrin d dimer increased, magnetic resonance imaging head abnormal, platelet count decreased, venogram abnormal and full blood count was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).  This case version (1) was created on 30-APR-2021 for the purpose of quality improvement the following corrections were made. The MAC was added to the pharmacovigilance narrative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V1: This spontaneous report received from a patient via VAERS (ID: 1238777) concerned a 47-year-old woman who experienced cavernous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 5 days after vaccine. Concurrent conditions included hypertension and concomitant medications included unspecified natural pills. Five days after vaccine, the patient was hospitalized for venous cavernous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (25,000) with an elevated D dimer (unspecified.) CT head and MRV were performed with results not provided. The patient was hospitalized for 12 days and treatment details were not provided. Based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration-BC), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination (BC Criteria level 1), the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination. Reporter contact information was not provided which precludes meaningful additional information in this version.

                                                I went to bed with a stomach ache around 10:00pm.  At 3:00am I was awoken by severe abdominal pains/cramps and in a cold sweat.  When I got out of bed I was lightheaded and passed out in the bathroom as I was getting Tylenol.  I took 2 Tylenol and had diarrhea about 10 mins later.  I went to get some gatorade and passed out again in the hallway on the way to the kitchen.  About an hour after taking Tylenol symptoms began to improve but became nauseous and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  As of 2pm Sunday current symptoms are extreme nausea and extreme exhaustion.

My initial symptoms included tingling, numbness, and inability to walk.  The doctors confirmed during MRI that I had had a stroke.  I was in the hospital for four days, and released to PT/OT three times a week for the next 4 weeks to regain full use of the right side.  I  am also unable to work during this time.

                                                I am not sure if my event was caused by the vaccine I received on  April 8, but I have a very strong feeling it is, as never in my life have I experienced anything like it.  My day began normally, and I just had returned home from an appointment.  I had some lunch, and a few minutes later as I was standing in my kitchen,  I began sweating terribly,  heart was racing, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I  managed to make it to a large living room chair, and once I say down and put my head back, I passed out.   My daughter witnessed everything and said when I passed out, my arms were trembling and my eyes rolled back.  This lasted for about 30 seconds.  She was unable to arouse me for a bit, but when I came to my speech was slurred.   I did not know what had happened.  My daughter called 911.  By the time medics arrived, I was feeling much better and aware of everything happening.  The checked for signs of stroke, vital signs, blood sugar, and everything was normal.   I was transported to the ER, and my work up there was normal, including EKG and blood work.  The physician that I saw diagnosed me with  vasovagal syncope and did not feel the event was related to the vaccine.  I  completely recovered, and like I said  I?m not sure if it was related to the vaccine I received or not.  I just feel that it may be worth noting since I?ve never had an experience like this and  I?m pretty healthy with really no medical history.

My husband took my temperature which was 103.  Massive headaches, full body aches and pains, chills which made my body shake uncontrollably.   My whole body hurt.  Could not get up to use the restroom, tried and fainted back into the bed.  Heart felt like it was beating out of my chest.  My husband wanted to call 911 but I didn&#39;t want to.  Felt like I had COVID again.

I am currently taking Eliquis and various additional testing has been done to see why this has occurred but are pending the results. I still have edema and the minor cramping in my leg and foot also.

Hand was somewhat sore for weeks before vaccine.  J &amp; J vaccine on 3/12/2021.  5 days later 5/17/2021 left hand very painful and huge blood clot.  Went to doctor and diagnosed blood clot and precribed clindamycin 300 mg 3X a day for 7 days.  It wasn&#39;t until the 7th day the pain was gone and swelling of the vein back to normal.

                                                I have a history of untreated fibroids that were diagnosed in December 2019.  Because the coronavirus pandemic began in February 2020, elective surgeries were not allowed in my state.  My bleeding and blood clots were caused by the fibroids during menstruation.  On March 20, 2021, I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson 1-shot COVID vaccine.  By March 26th, the blood clots that were coming out of my body were enormous.  They had NEVER been that large.  Being concerned, I immediately saw my doctor as soon as my period ended.  Today, I learned the J&amp;J vaccine has been paused due to blood clots.   I believe that my blood clots became so large because I was given this particular vaccine.  WOMEN SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT IF THEY HAVE BLOOD CLOT CAUSING FIBROIDS, DO NOT TAKE THE JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON COVID-19 VACCINE.

That following Friday she was not able to attend work due to shortness of breath.  Saturday morning she cold not inhale and  couldn?t stop coughing. She was then attempted to be taken to urgent care, but upon arrival she was coughing up blood and was instructed to go straight to the hospital.  At the hospital upon test being done she was admitted to the covid unit and diagnosed with pneumonia due to covid 19 virus, bilateral pulmonary embolism in both lungs. She is now home in quarantine taking blood thinners for the next three months and unable to work.

When she got home around 5 PM she was still feeling short of breath and reported that her heart was racing. She was unable to speak clearly, but was stating that it was due to be being short of breath.  She also reported feeling lethargic and fell asleep until the next morning. She slept until approximately 12 pm the next day. When she woke up she reported feeling right sided cheek tingling. At that time she thought she had just slept wrong. When she attempted to walk down stairs she was limping and reported just feeling very weak on her left side. On Wednesday she slept in late again complaining of lethargy. When she awoke that Wednesday (3/10) her speech was markedly slurred. She was also saying things that didn&#39;t make sense. She was dragging her left leg when she tried to walk. We immediately took her to the ER and she was worked up for stroke. When she was triaged in the ER we mentioned that she had just had her COVID vaccine and voiced concerned that maybe she had a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She was admitted to hospital on 3/10 for a possible stroke.  Her MRI was done later on 3/11, Her MRI showed that she has strokes on both sides of her brain in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The doctor referred to her stroke as being caused by a &#34;showering of clots&#34;. The doctor said this usually only happens to someone with cardiac issues. My mom has no cardiac history. Her doctor ordered an 2D Echo of her heart and no abnormalities were found (3/12).   She is still disabled from her stroke. She was hospitalized from 3/10 - 3/16. She was the discharged to other care facility from 3/16-3/26. She is currently needing outpatient rehab in a day neuro program. She attends this at outpatient facility. She has to walk with a cane due to persistent left leg weakness. Her speech has a slight slur, and she suffers from short term memory loss. She intermittently has trouble with her equilibrium and reports feeling dizzy. She sometimes has a hard time swallowing or says that it doesn&#39;t feel right when  she swallows. She also trouble with word retrieval. She has left-sided neglect which correlates  left eye visual deficits. She currently requires care from a general physician, neurologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, neuro ophthalmologist and neuo psychologist. She was started on a new medication regime 325 mg aspirin daily, plavix for 21 days (now completed), metformin, amlodipine, coreg and losartan. She is going to need outpatient rehab until at least June from the last update we received from her rehab doctor.

She was instructed to sit in a chair along with her husband by her side. In the meantime, RPH called for help in the store. Store PIC came over and called 911. After the PIC was on the phone with 911 for 2-3 minutes, the pt complained of trouble breathing and faintness. She was then administered an epi-pen. She started to feel a little better, less faint and could breathe a little easier (maybe 10% improvement) but not great. After 5 minutes, the paramedics had not shown up yet so she was given another dose of epipen because she started to have more faintness, lightheadedness, sweatyness, tingly and SOB. 3-5 minutes after 2nd dose of epi was given, paramedics then arrived to the scene. They took her BP and it was ~ 76/40. They took her away in the aid car.

These symptoms were gone by Friday and I felt great. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:30am and needed to use the bathroom/, which is about 10 steps from my bed. As I entered the bathroom I completely blacked out, causing me to fall and break my ribs. This has never happened to me, and there was nothing else wrong with me (I spent 2 days in the hospital checking heart, brain, inner ear, etc). In addition to the 4:30am blackout, it also happened again several hours later at 11am, saturday morning. This time I again got so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stay on my feet, and while my husband was right there lowering me to the floor I was in a daze, a cold sweat, and absolutely no control over it.

Was able to roll down my window and honk horn for emt in parking lot before fainting. Woke up to emt checking blood pressure, pulse and putting oxygen mask on. Then had to throw up, continue oxygen, sat and waited about 45 minutes until I felt like I could safely drive home.  Had mild flu like symptoms starting about 3 hours later, became more moderate symptoms about 8 hours after injection - headache, fatigue, fever, body aches, nausea. Slept all next day, only remained. Still feel fatigue on Wednesday

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

                                                10 days after the vaccine I developed dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth,chest pressure, shortness of breath and felt like I was going to pass out, and I had a feeling of extreme doom. I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

They got me in on March 25 (Thursday). Dr inspected and told me it&#39;s thrombus that caused huge pain. They did the surgery right away, removed thrombus. I never had blood clots problem and I was healthy, which my blood test result can prove. Thrombus generated 12 days after my J&amp;J vaccine shot, I am reporting this side effect. You may find all my medical record from Doctor&#39;s office.

Went to doctor 4 days later because I was in pain mainly in feet, was told I broke my foot.  I asked if vaccine could have caused it and was blown off by 3 different healthcare providers, I thought by law they were supposed t report adverse effects like this.

When I got up from sitting to walk to the bathroom, my legs were wobbly as if I was going to fall.  I also developed a severe headache that lasted 3 days.  The black-outs ended after 12 hours.  Then Tuesday-Friday I had the &#34;expected&#34; feel like the flu hit me.

By 11:00 PM pt. felt faint and nauseated and left leg was swollen and discolored. Rescue squad was called and took pt. to Hosp where she was told it was sciaticia. After showing the medical professionals her leg and insisting upon an ultrasound of her leg she was told the &#34;machine&#34; was not available and she would be called the next day to be scheduled. Per pt&#39;s daughter, she was never called and daughter called hospital to have U/S scheduled. Pt. went back to hospital on 4/14 at 3:15 PM for U/S and she was diagnosed with multi DVT&#39;s in left leg which at that time had swelling all the way down to her foot. Pt. was put on Coumadin.

SHE WAS FINE FOR 24-48 HOURS WHEN ALL THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED SYMPTOMS RETURNED BUT EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED AND SHE HAD EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA WITH INCREASED PAIN AT THE INJECTION SITE.  AT SOME POINT DURING ALL THIS SHE VISITED HER MAIN PHARMACY AND AS SHE WAS TELLING THE PHARMACIST ABOUT HER SYMPTOMS SHE FAINTED AND WOKE TO EMS AND WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL.  THE ER DID NOT FIND ANY REASON FOR HER FAINTING. SHE WAS HYDRATED AND THINKS IT WAS ANXIETY BROUGHT ON BY HER EXPERIENCE.  SHE CALLED ME TODAY 4/15/21 TO TELL ME ABOUT HER SYMPTOMS AND EXPERIENCE. SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD A NEW SYMPTOM OF A SHARP PAIN IN HER BACK SO I STRONGLY SUGGESTED SHE GO BACK TO ER TO CONTINUE TESTING IN CASE THE PAIN WAS SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE VACCINE INCIDENT. SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO TO URGENT CARE IF SHE FELT THE PAIN WAS BAD ENOUGH.

                                                BLOOD CLOT; This spontaneous report received from a patient concerned a 50 year old female. The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of report. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 203A21A expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 08-APR-2021 19:18 at right arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 10-APR-2021 at 02.30 patient experienced severe cramping on front and back of right leg; she was unable to stand and had to sit down on the floor. The patient then started feeling the left leg also  cramp and was rushed to the hospital. At 02:45 was in the hospital and received intravenous morphine and laboratory tests (hemoglobin and metabolic panel - test results not provided). At 04:24 patient received intravenous Valium. That same day, 10-APR-2021 at 05:07 Sodium Chloride (NaCl 0.9%) was stopped and the patient was released from hospital.  On 13-APR-2021 the patient received D-Dimer testing. She stated the levels were 0.95 (units unspecified) &#34;which was elevated compared to average 0.5&#34;. Her doctor notified her not to fly anywhere and have an ultrasound. On 14-APR-20-21 ultrasound performed. Reports came back with no Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but still blood clotting was present in unknown location. On 15-APR-20201 patient has requested  another D-Dimer test with her physician. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of blood clot was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old female patient was rushed to the hospital for severe cramping of right leg 2 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S on right arm.  Hemoglobin and metaboic panel was awaiting results; D-Dimer was reported to elevated at 0.95; and ultrasound showed no deep vein thrombosis but was told that there was still blood clotting in an unknown location.  Additional work up is being done.  The patient was treated with Valium and IV fluid and was released from the hospital.  Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as indeterminate with the causal association to immunization, per the WHO causality classification for adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  Considering temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information has been requested for further assessment.

I experienced a reoccurrence for 4 days in mid April. I wouldn&#39;t have said anything but friends nagged us after the J&amp;J blood clotting issue.

                                                I had 2 adverse reactions to the Janssen Covid-19 Vaccine EUA: AE #1) Roughly 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, the lower half of my face went numb for approximately 3 hours. The people who administered the vaccine made me stay at the site for about an hour and a half to make sure that the reaction did not get worse. AE #2) 10 days after receiving the vaccination, the lower part of my left leg began to swell significantly. I went to the emergency room on 4/13/2021. When I was there, they did tests and confirmed that I have a blood clot behind my knee. To treat the blood clot, the emergency room doctor gave me lovenox 110mg and warfarin 5mg. Since then, I have followed up with my primary doctor who has me taking warfarin 10mg ( 1x daily) and lovenox (as needed).

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included overweight, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 207A21A expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 06-APR-2021 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 07-APR-2021, the patient experienced a mild fever. On 08-APR-2021, the patient was achy and had a mild headache. The headache continued for several day and became pretty bad for about two days. On an unspecified date in Apr-2021 the patient was treated with Tylenol for headache. On 12-APR-2021, the patient experienced leg cramps in her right leg. On 15-APR-2021, the patient had an ultrasound and a blood clot was found in her right leg. The patient started on Apixaban (Eliquis). The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from headache on an unknown date in APR-2021, and the outcome of blood clot, ache, leg cramps and fever was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old female was found to have blood clot in her right leg 9 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. There was reported mild fever, headache, and &#34;aches&#34; 1 to 2 days after vaccination that was treated with Tylenol.  The symptom reported was leg cramps on right leg 5 days after vaccination, and ultrasound showed blood clot in her right leg 3 days after the symptom of cramps was noted.  No other laboratory/diagnostic test reported.  The patient was treated with apixaban.  The outcome of blood clot in leg was not reported.  Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.

                                                Within 5 minutes from receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I went to sit down and I started feeling very hot in my body. My heart started to race, had chest discomfort and had trouble breathing, my trachea closed up, had blurry vision and pain in my chest. I felt like I could not breathe and when the nurse came over to ask me I could not speak to her, I went into a shock and I was placed on the floor and I could not hear anything nor could open my eyes, from my hips down to my feet I could not feel anything, my legs went completely numb and I had a syncope. What I was told from the nurse that I was given an Epi-pen to help with my reaction. When I came back my body was having convulsions, felt my head spinning, had pain in my chest that so very intense and the nurse got me up and took me to a nearby ambulance and the EMT staff placed like a heart monitor because my heart was racing super fast. I also felt heaviness in my chest and inside the ambulance I was given two injections on my left arm and when I slowly started coming back, I was already at the hospital. I was at the hospital from 2pm to 4:30pm more less being monitored.  At the hospital x-ray of the chest was performed as well as lab work and I was discharged home. When I got home, I still did not feel good, I felt heaviness to my chest, still have trouble breathing and get chills during the night. I also could not stand up and have a nerve sensation to my body and the chest pain to my left side is still very present. I have blurry vision, dizziness, headaches, and my heart-beat continues to race very fast.  I get headaches, have abdominal pain and I peed blood few times then that&#39;s when I was able to pee, my abdominal pain was painful like having a baby. On Friday 04-08-2021, I again went to the hospital because I had fallen to the floor on my kitchen floor and my daughter took me to the hospital. I let the nurse staff know that I still have continued chest pain and pressure, difficulty breathing and headaches, dizziness and they monitored and gave me three pills as medication. I was discharged home about 5pm with a referral to see a neurologist due to my chest pain, blurry vision, dizziness and fever which I had these past three weeks. I do not know why I felt all these symptoms after my J&amp;J vaccine.

A large dried blood clot was noted on the first day of my period which occurred on March 16th. I continue to pass large blood clots while I was having my period. I also want to point out that a personnel who gave me an injection was incorrectly injected the vaccine outside of the area of the preferred injection zone. I have reported this event to the supervisor who was on site. I have not yet contacted my health care provider at this time but plan to contact her tomorrow as these symptoms have been persisting.

She was initially stable and not requiring oxygen and was sent home on anticoagulation. However she returned the same day with worsening symptoms, troponin now elevated, and ECHO showing signs of right heart strain. Embolus on imaging had increased in just over days from previous CT scan. She became pulseless and died despite resuscitative efforts. It is my opinion (Dr.) that she died of a pulmonary embolus, and an autopsy is pending.

Was able to maintain consciousness but was very out of it. Possibly from lack of oxygen when neck and head swelled. Began to lose ability to recite address or remember address by the time was placed in paramedic van. Paramedic put IV in hand. Paramedics administered ephedrine, Benadryl, prednisone and reaction subsided. Was taken directly to hospital arrived there for monitoring by 3:15 Pm . Felt much better at hospital.  Had one wave/head rush where it felt like the reaction was starting again and may pass out but that subsided and they continued to monitor. Had a few waves of nausea which did not last long. The IV placed in hand by paramedic was infiltrated so attempts at giving fluids failed and it was never corrected at hospital. After 2 hours of monitoring I was told to go home and given a prescription for steroids. I was asked to monitor for the remainder of the night for any trouble breathing. Night sleep was not good waking often with one occasion of wheezing which subsided after taking Benadryl. Continue to monitor.

                                                Bad headache developed on April 8th at 11 AM.  By 2:30,  needed to sleep.  Unconscious for 3 and 1/2 days.   I have no recollection of any of this time.  I?m only listening to what have  told by the medical field and my family.   My husband started calling MEDICAL CENTER Friday morning and A called the helicopter by Friday afternoon at three.   They were ruling out a stroke.  By the time they landed the helicopter they knew it was not a stroke and started doing testing like CAT scans , lumbar punctures.  From what I?ve been told they ran four antibiotics IVs.  I remember waking up Sunday morning and someone was sitting in the chair next to me and all I kept saying was that I was hungry.  The lady started crying and said that I had been unconscious.  She tried to tell me who I was and that I was something called married and that I had children.  She tried to explain what had happened but I wasn?t able to comprehend.  I didn?t know what it meant that I lived on a farm or that I had animals.  Or that we had a vet practice.   I remember medical people asking me who I was and what the date was and if I remember how I got there and all I could do was smile.   It?s like the words just would not come.  And they diagnosed it as an cephalitis over the next couple days.  Where the brain swells up and you have memory loss and I had a high fever.  I had a lot of nausea after they put me on oral anabiotic?s.  I kept hearing from nurse reports that I had almost died.  These were hard things to here.  I?m forever thankful for all the people that have gone before me for doing the drug trials.    I am a energetic lady and I?m slowly getting back to myself.  I feel very thankful for the great care at the medical center.  I appreciate everything that you do every day.   I would not recommend getting vaccinated with this drug.  I am one of the healthiest people that I know. No I can?t believe this is happened to me.  I take good care and eat healthy and have no bad habits. I meditate and pray and have a joy filled life.

Given platelets, admitted 3/26/21, given steroids and BP meds. D/c&#39;d 3/28/21. Dx: ITP. Given 4 day dose of Dexamethasone. Platelets increased. 1 week later platelets dropped. By 4/15/19, they dropped some more and seem to have leveled out (4/19/21), but still testing weekly. ANA blood work positive, but no other symptoms to fit most common autoimmune diseases. Saw rheumatologist today for more blood work.

I was experiencing headaches all day. The following morning on Sunday I woke up and passed out, I guess my blood pressure dropped and I don?t know why and this is never happened.  Had no appetite since Friday and maybe that?s why but my BP is 120/60 as of 10:08am AFTER I passed out at around 8:30am. I?m now feeling better all of a sudden, can drink coffee and hopefully I?ll get a shower....... oh and my joints are sore, I think whatever could go wrong , did!

                                                Covid shots administered at airport for employees.  I received shot, and within a minute or two- my lips and tongue started to tingle, swell and go numb.  My throat started to swell too.  Had a hard time starting to breathe and took my xopenex inhaler.  I had taken a benadryl beforehand, and ended up taking two more as EMT came over to  help me there at the site.  She kept an eye on me.  My A Fib was speeding up and getting irregular too.  After about half an hour, it stopped getting worse and seemed to level off.  They offered to take me to ER, and had me promise to call 911 if it got bad again.  Still felt bad the rest of the day.  Felt a little better later the next day, and a little better (today is day 3), but still not 100%.  I did contact my doctor to check in

I became so dizzy, lightheaded that 2 people had to hold me up and escorted me (as I slouched) to a tented cot in the area. I felt I drifted back and forth into a black out state for about 20 minutes.

I was transported by ambulance to the hospital. A CT and MRI was done, no signs of blood clots or stroke.  I am still experiencing numbness and tingling in the right arm. Follow up appointments with the eye doctor indicate additional vision loss in the right eye with pressure behind the eye. I have a follow up appointment today with the neurologist for a brain scan and tomorrow for an eeg. My PCP, eye doctor, and neurologist believe it may be a blood flow issue. I have not had this type of event before.

                                                Lady had vaccine, was told it was Janssen but lot # is Moderna.  She got the vaccine, the night of the vaccine around 5:30 she got a raging headache (she does get reactions to most vaccines).  She took Tylenol and her arm did hurt.  The next day she was still really hurting, her headache was really, really bad, and it stayed until Sunday.  Then on Sunday she was ok.  On Monday when she went to work and her right arm went limp, and while she was walking her right leg gave way and almost fell, grabbed hold and steadied herself.  The raging headache/migraine came back and she started getting nauseous, her lower back hurt, her upper neck area hurt like somebody was pounding her neck.  Then she got diarrhea and really really tired on Monday and Tuesday and also had loss of appetite.  Then yesterday 4/13/201 she just had the headache and a sound in her ear, went to UC and got drops for it.  Her temperature was 96.5, and her normal is 98.7, and was told that she was really cold.  Her PB was really high and the doctor took it again but it was not as high, attributed it to anxiety.  Last night the lower abdomen pain started, feeling like she was getting her period which she has not had in over a year.  She saw a little blood on her panty liner, and was thinking she was going to have a period, but the pain is excruciating in her lower abdomen.   She has also taken Tylenol off and on for her symptoms, and feels like she is cramping.     She is having hot/cold flashes as well, and has not had these issues from menopause.

Since I had surgery (see above) my doctor sent me fir an ultrasound where a clot was found. Went to emergency room to further evaluate and get treated. Was given elequis and am taking for 3 months. Was told clot was likely related to immobility from injury, but wanted to report just for your consideration

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included hypertension, and anaphylaxis to peanuts. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 02-APR-2021 to right arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported. On 02-APR-2021, after vaccination patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction. The patient was at her local pharmacy and was waiting in chairs as instructed; then she walked to her vehicle and began to feel light-headed and lost consciousness. Her husband was with her and was able to administer life saving measures, the local pharmacist was able to administer an epi-pen to her right thigh. On 02-APR-2021, the patient stopped breathing and was then transported to the local ER(emergency room) where she was treated. She regained consciousness and had persistent emesis and the patient was kept in hospital for 24 hours before being discharged. The patient was hospitalized for one day. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from syncope/lost consciousness, and was recovering from light headed, vomiting/persistent emesis, and anaphylactic reaction, stopped breathing. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused/ Prolonged, and Life Threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 A 52-year-old female patient with the past medical history remarkable for anaphylaxis to peanuts experienced anaphylactic reaction the same day the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2 was administered. The patient began to feel light-headed and lost consciousness, an epi-pen was administered. The next day the patient stopped breathing and was treated in the local ER (emergency room). Later she had persistent emesis. Given the close temporal relationship and history of anaphylaxis to peanuts the events are considered related.

                                                Vomiting, vision impairment (read very slow to me), and seizure(s). Rushed to ER in ambulance. Was put on a ventilator (sedation). Received a CT scan showing a CVST and hemorrhaging in her right temporal lobe.  Life-Lined to Hospital. Wore an EEG on her head to monitor seizure activity for 4-5 days. Was put on 4 types of seizure medication and blood thinner for the clot. Did another CT scan which showed her Mid-Line shift was pushing into the left side of the brain by 15mm. Discharged from Hospital on 3/27/21 to Rehabilitation Hospital. She was discharged to home with a caregiver on 4/16/21. She will continue outpatient therapy at the rehabilitation hospital. She will see Speech, Vision, PT, and OT every week until further notice.

                                                Had shot on Monday.  Horrible pain in arm at injection site that went up my neck to my head.  Sinuses flared up and ears started beeping.  Became dizzy and nauseous and had difficultly breathing.  Went to pass out due to blood pressure drop.  Had to breath in alcohol wipes and then both arms went into pain as if falling asleep only 100 times worse.  Could not moves my arms - hands were cramping.  Took 1 hour to get back to some normal to drive home. The next day/Tues my sinuses where still a little swollen along with a little bit of arm pain, nausea and fatigue.   Wed - Fri sinuses continued to be swollen then on Fri - Sun had coughing.  Following Mon was weaker and feeling low immune.  Tues ended up at doctor&#39;s office having gone into a sinus infection.  Was also experiencing shallow breathing in neck and chest.  Started Augmentin 875mg 2 x a day Tues - Fri.  Then Fri night went into a severe inflammation in my chest, throat and esophagus with difficulty to catch my breath and couldn&#39;t eat.  Sat reached out to document through EMR and was prescribed a Steroid (6 days) which I started on Sun morning.  Was very weak and took that whole week with full does of steroid to get back to normal breathing.  Finished Antibiotics (12 days worth) 2 days after completing the steroid which was now Sunday.  Then still had some sinus recovery where ear was beeping in and out for 2 more days.  By Wed of the 4th week things were returning to normal.  Total time to recover was exactly 4 weeks.

So she basically fainted for a minute and then laid for awhile while 911 was called. Ambulance arrived and patient remained conscious.

                                                After about 7 minutes of getting the Janssen Covid-19 vaccines, patient husband said patient is not feeling well.  I attended to patient immediately.  She said she is not feeling well, and her eye was rolling (as if when she tried to look up and couldn&#39;t get their eye to remain open) a for about few seconds and then she her eye was open back to normal.  She was sweating on both hands and face were cold to the touch.  I got the manager from the store to help me lie patient flat on the floor&#39;s surface gently to prevent her from falling off the chair.    Based on this our adverse event protocol, patient exhibited similar symptoms to Syncope (paleness, sweating, coldness of extremities), so I patient is lying flat on the floor, feet elevated, and cold compression was apply on her arms and face.  Unfortunately, patient conditions was not improving as it seem but she was alert and able to breath (fast pace) the whole entire time the incident occurred where she answer all questions when we myself, then the paramedics asked her questions.  Paramedic arrived at scene within 10 minutes after individual got off the phone with 911.  They took her away around 9 am and said patient probably experience anxiety attack.

                                                Patient reports tear in esophagus on 3/24/21 in the evening whenever she felt sick to her stomach. She did not feel well, drank one beer, and ate a packet of tuna. She continued to not feel well and felt the food did not go down correctly, so she reached into her throat and noticed blood. She called her doctor and the doctor recommended monitoring for increased bleeding. Later that night, she reports not feeling well again, made herself throw up, and noticed the vomit was all blood. The patient then called 9-1-1, and presents to the hospital. During the hospital visit she noticed that she saw &#39;blood clots about the size of a quarter&#39; when she went to the bathroom. Patient reports the hospital gave her 4 pints of blood, 4 bags of &#39;yellow stuff&#39; (patient assumes its plasma), protonix, antibiotics, and NS. Patient was in the ICU and reports being in the hospital for about 5 days total, whenever the doctor recommended being put on hospice. The patient did want to be put on hospice and wants to be treated, so she contacted her heart doctor and is waiting on an appointment with him on the 28th of April. Patient reports that doctor told her that she &#39;needs a new heart&#39;, but that she is not a good candidate, and that the Dr. told her this just a day or two ago. Patient reports that she did not know it was a tear in her throat (esophagus) until they &#34;stuck a scope down there&#34;.

The patient had no known allergies.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805029, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 16-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included Centrum Multi-Gummies for Women.  On an unspecified date in MAR-2021 the patient began to experience slowly progressive shortness of breath; on 01-APR-2021 she had left upper quadrant pain. On 03-APR-2021 the patient presented to the emergency room.  Laboratory data included: Pulmonary Angiogram/CT Chest - abnormal and computerised tomogram abdomen/pelvis at 09:37, showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs. Small volume perisplenic hemorrhage and small volume pneumoperitoneum in the pelvis or findings concerning for spontaneous splenic rupture and moderately enlarged spleen. Additional CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast at 23:05 showed: Small to moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, slightly increased since the earlier study. There is definitely new blood adjacent to the liver. The hemorrhage adjacent to the spleen appears similar to the earlier study. Due to the timing of the scans with relation to the contrast injection, the physician could not confirm a splenic laceration, although it was suspected to be the source of hemorrhage. Small amount of mesenteric blood was slightly increased. Continuous heparin infusion was started for bilateral pulmonary embolism. On 04-APR-2021, an inferior vena cava filter was placed and patient was vaccinated with Acthib (HIB Vaccine), Bexsero (meningococcal vaccine) and Prevnar (pneumococcal vaccine) in anticipation of splenectomy. On 07-APR-2021, a laparoscopic splenectomy was performed. The spleen was evaluated by pathology which reported that organizing blood clot on surface was consistent with rupture. No evidence of malignancy was reported.  The patient was also treated with anticoagulant therapy (dates unspecified). The patient remained inpatient while recovering from surgery.  On 12-APR-2021, the patient was transitioned to rivaroxaban for therapeutic anticoagulation. Patient remained hospitalized as of 12-APR-2021.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from pulmonary embolism, haemoperitoneum, mesenteric haemorrhage, splenic haemorrhage, splenic rupture, splenic thrombosis, splenomegaly, dyspnoea, abdominal pain upper, and left upper quadrant/abdominal pain. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, Disability Or Permanent Damage).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old female patient of unspecified ethnicity was found to  have pulmonary embolism and spontaneous splenic rupture 18 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  No concurrent illness and medical history reported. Emergency room consult for slowly progressive shortness of breath and left upper quadrant pain that starts on an unspecified date after vaccination.   Pulmonary Angiogram/CT Chest showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs; small volume perisplenic hemorrhage and small volume pneumoperitoneum in the pelvis; moderately enlarged spleen with findings concerning for spontaneous splenic rupture.  CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast showed small to moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, slightly increased since the earlier study; definite new blood adjacent to the liver.  Continuous heparin infusion was started; vaccinated with Acthib (HIB Vaccine), Bexsero (meningococcal vaccine) and Prevnar (pneumococcal vaccine).  Laparoscopic splenectomy was done 22 days after vaccination; pathology report is consistent with splenic rupture with no evidence of malignancy.  The patient was shifted to rivaroxaban.  No other details reported. The information available regarding splenic rupture precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  Based on the information that is available, the event pulmonary embolism is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism; considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, the potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.

Help responded and I came out of it, and proceeded to vomit 4-5 times.  Felt weak, dizzy, nauseous.  My mom came to drive me home.  Slept the rest of the morning and had some feeling of tightness in my chest in the late afternoon and evening.

Did not seek medical attention at this time - just monitoring symptoms as of Thursday, 4/8/21.

I was having some blood when blowing my nose  and remember seeing some small, hard balls which I now realize were clots. I did not go to the doctor because my back was very bad and  I was in a lot of pain and  I had an upcoming appointment with my doctor. I believe that the symptoms resolved after 2 or 3 days and I did not even mention it to my doctor when I saw him.  I felt  a lot of pain in my leg, but this is probably due to my ongoing  sciatica/radiculopathy /bursitis problems that I experience.

Felt fine until Wednesday then broke out in hives and later that day fainted. Still to this day I am breaking out almost every day and I think it is tied to heat. Met with doctor today and she put me on steroid to try to calm down the break outs and then re-evaluate.

This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 54-year-old obese female with BMI of 30.7 was hospitalized due to bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to lower extremities and pulmonary embolism (PE) in both lungs 35 days after receiving JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE (covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s) in left arm for prophylactic vaccination.  The patient&#39;s past medical history included cancer. The subject had chills 2 days prior to the vaccination and body ache 1 day post vaccination.  The symptoms resolved 5 days post vaccination. She started experiencing bilateral leg pain 33 days post vaccination and chest pain 34 days post vaccination. The patient visited emergency room and was hospitalized. She was diagnosed with bilateral DVTs to the lower extremities and PE in both lungs. Details of the hospitalization were not reported. She was discharged after 5 days of hospitalization with prescription of enoxaparin injection twice a day for 6 months.

                                                I woke up at approximately 9:30 AM the morning of Sunday May 2nd 2021 the day after getting my covid vaccine and had to rush to the bathroom. I proceeded to have blood and blood clots come out my urethra very urgently. I had abdominal pain and pressure. I proceeded to need to urinate blood and blood clots for approximately 4 hours urgently. I could not go far from the bathroom without having to return quickly to the toilet. I wet myself several times. The clots stopped coming around 1:30 PM. I proceeded to have to have no control over urination urge and could not leave the bathroom. Around approximately 2:00 PM I could leave the bathroom without fear of wetting myself. I continued to have a small amount of a mix of blood and normal urine passing for another hour or so. I have a picture of the blood and clots that came out of my urethra. I continue to have dull pain and pressure in my abdomen.

After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

These symptoms came on suddenly and lasted until I fell asleep after two hours. Symptoms remained when awoke next day, but were much less intense. Had a period of one hour the next day where right arm and hand went numb. This resolved after one hour. Had BP checked and was equal in both arms and normal. No neurological symptoms. Nausea removed for two more days. Otherwise, all other symptoms resolved after one day.

                                                Three waves of discomfort... felt like ice water was poured inside of my body.  Extreme  weaknesses of arms/legs.  Visual issues.  First wave within 60 seconds of shot (ended up on floor - embarrassing!).  Second, and most severe, wave about 10 minutes later while sitting in chair.  Apparently, I passed out with my eyes open.  Hubby got nurse.  They said I was unresponsive.  Nurse checked blood pressure and heart rate after second wave - both normal.  Third wave, much less severe, hit after 10 more minutes.  Ice water/weakness feeling in arms and legs and not so much in chest area.  Nurse speculated it could be low blood sugar (based on medications).  Have never had low blood sugar event previously AND had eaten about an hour prior to vaccination.  However, drank 4 ounces of orange juice, just in case.  Went home about 20 minutes later... no other significant side effects.  No swelling/redness at injection site.  No other illnesses, etc.

The vaccinator got help immediately, and patient&#39;s husband was in the room.  She remained in a seated position with her husband holding her head up while standing behind her.  Her blood pressure dropped to 78/80, heart rate was 45 bpm.  She was unconscious for approximately one minute and 30 seconds.  911 was called immediately and she was transported to medical center. When I called the patient today, she did say that she was feeling better.  She mostly felt nauseous and dizzy following her vaccination.  She reports that her arm still feel itchy and that she has been taking Benedry

But around 6pm,  I was sitting outside on a cool night with a jacket and scarf on and I suddenly very very hot and  had to take off my layers. I felt nauseous. I got up to go inside because I thought I would throw up and then fainted.  I came to a second later (some friends where with me) and felt extremely nauseous. My friends brought me a bucket and I got sick. I felt immediately better. But later that night I had a headache, and chills. I didn&#39;t get sick again, but I left as if I had the flu.  I felt better in the morning.

After 4 days of that I got a really super heavy period with cramping and blood clots in my menustral flow.  It was a horrible period, while the one after the surgery in Feb was very light.  Dizzy and fatique  10 days after shot on the April 8 I took a fall from a chair outside, and from Thrusday to the Saturday  10th I ended up in the Emergency room with a concussion and head symptoms including dizziness and nose bleeds.  This was from a simple fall, and i suspect the covid shot might have caused complications after the fall with additional swelling and brusing.

This was followed by dysarthria and facial droop. The symptoms persisted until the following day at which point she went to urgent care and then here to our ER. We did a head CT which showed she has and acute/subacute stroke in the right posterior MCA territory. I am the Hospitalist physician that admitted her yesterday. I have and MRI of the brain as well as an MRA and MRV ordered though not performed yet. Her symptoms are improving.

                                                BLOOD CLOT IN LEFT THIGH; SWELLING; FATIGUE; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 55 year old female. Initial information received on 13-APR-2021, processed along with information received via telephone communication on 15-APR-2021 The patient&#39;s weight was 100 pounds, and height was 152.4 centimeters. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included progressive multiple sclerosis, swelling of the left leg and foot, and non smoker, and other pre-existing medical conditions included the patient had no known drug allergies. the patient was not a pregnant at the time of reporting. The patient had no family history of thrombosis, no prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1808609, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 22-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included baclofen, escitalopram oxalate, and risedronate sodium (received 2 doses and stopped after the event).  The patient&#39;s husband reported that in MAR-2021, the patient had symptoms of fatigue.  On 23-MAR-2021, the patient had swelling and fatigue.  Her fatigue was resolved on 24-MAR-2021 and swelling was resolving.  On 05-APR-2021, the patient developed left thigh swelling. On 06-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s swelling was not going down and she visited her primary care physician. The physician could not determine the cause of swelling (left thigh very noticeable clot swollen around where clot was located) and the physician suspected clot and performed an AD dimer (fibrin degradation) test to look for potential blood clotting. The patient also had a venous duplex ultrasound that showed left leg clot.  At 19:00 on the same day, the patient&#39;s physician advised to visit emergency room and determined there was a clot on left thigh and she was prescribed Eliquis Starter Pack (apixaban) for 3 months treatment and recommended another scan in several months. On 06-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s vitals were reported as blood pressure 124/70 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm and oxygen saturation of 99%. Laboratory data included prothrombin time (PT) 13.4 sec , International normalized ratio (INR) 1.2 and  activated partial thromboplastin time  (APTT) 34.8 sec. (Normal range not reported for all) d-dimer and platelet count results were not available and Covid-19 test was not performed. Body max index was 19.5 kg/m2. On an unspecified date the patient was feeling better but had not recovered from the event. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from fatigue on 24-MAR-2021, had not recovered from blood clot in left thigh, and recovering from swelling. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This case concerns a 55-year- old female subject, immobile due to progressive multiple sclerosis who developed a left thigh swelling 12 days after Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered intramuscularly for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included body max index of 19.5 kg/m2, progressive multiple sclerosis and swelling of the left leg and foot. She is a non-smoker, no known drug allergies, no family history of thrombosis, or prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Symptoms started with swelling of the left thigh and fatigue. The fatigue resolved the next day. The patient&#39;s swelling in the left thigh was not going down and she visited her primary care physician who checked her D-dimer dimer (level not known to patient) and scheduled a venous duplex ultrasound that showed a clot in the left thigh.  Her vital signs were blood pressure of  124/70 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm and oxygen saturation of 99%. and she was prescribed Eliquis Starter Pack (apixaban) for 3 months treatment and recommended another scan in several months. Laboratory data included PT 13.4 sec, INR 1.2 and APTT 34.8 sec. D-dimer and platelet count results were not available and Covid-19 test was not performed. The patient is feeling better but had not recovered from blood clot in the left thigh, and is recovering from the swelling. Given underlying progressive multiple sclerosis with immobility and preexisting swelling of the left leg and foot on the same lower extremity, the clotting of the left thigh is considered not related to Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Additional information has been requested.

Took an alleve which helped but the headache did not go away. 4/7-4/12  bad headache exacerbated by  going outdoors in sunlight. persistent grogginess every  morning. very difficult to wake up. I  run several days a week was able to  complete 4 miles no problem .  but headaches would be worse being outside in daylight. 4/13 I read news of headaches and  clotting rx  so I saw my Dr.  did blood work and scheduled for MRI.  blood work /platelets came back WNL . MRI was cost prohibitive for me so I cancelled MRI would follow up with MRI if headaches worsened and or developed other symptoms. 4/13-4/21 Persistent , annoying headache but improving somewhat. Still have difficulty waking up in the am. 4/22 First day that headache mostly was not present. Difficulty waking up in the am still.  4/17

                                                8 hours after injection started having severe lower back and leg pain. Then came the horrible headache causing nausea and dizziness which ultimately resulted in causing me to pass out while attempting to get to the couch. Once I came to the body trembles  started accompanied by being freezing cold. The headache and diarrhea lasted into the next day with symptoms not lessening until day 3. Still have to take Tylenol every 4 hours to keep headache manageable.  I did not seek medical treatment but would strongly warn those getting this shot of the possible  loss of consciousness. It came on very fast, 8 hours after the injection,  and could be deadly if someone was driving or not near soft surroundings.

                                                In the middle of the night of the 10th of April I started having what seemed like normal side effects---muscle aches, headache, fatigue.. and then all day on the 10th the same side effects.   Then last night I slept 9 straight hours but woke up  sweating a couple times in night and in morning woke up sweating but my aches and headache seemed better than the day before so I went downstairs to make tea.  After pouring a glass of orange juice and having a couple sips I started to feel strange --dizzy and oversome with a strange feeling that was not quite like the feeling before fainting -- my back had a weird pain and i was a little nauseous as well. ..it was more overwhelming -- more loss of control like a huge wave of dizziness and ringing.  I made my way to a couch to try to regain balance -- but was still very dizzy-- something happened to make me try to get up and go upstairs so I remember walking 12 feet or so then told myself to sit down.  Before that happened I must have blacked out.  I faintly remember moving myself across the floor but then must have blacked out again.  I woke up at the base of the stairwell and then was able to walk upstairs.    I had collapsed the first time onto a hard floor as my orange juice glass had spilled all over and when I got upstairs my sweatshirt was covered in juice.  I don&#39;t remember any of that.  Once upstairs I drank water and have been fine since then.  I had eaten dinner the night before but maybe it was the sweating in the night that dehydrated me and i cramped up and had a strange pain in my back---i don&#39;t know.  I am a very healthy 56 yr old woman 5&#39;3&#34; 105 lbs so maybe the Johnson and JOhnson one dose was a lot for my body or maybe my body was just doing what it&#39;s supposed to do to react to vaccine.... i also may have had asymptomatic covid in the last year so my body was overreacting.   This happened 7 hours ago and I seem fine aside from slight headache and continued weakness from vaccine but I thought I should report the incident in case there might be something more or in case others had similiar responses.

As more days passed; I was feeling tired, could not raise my arms, legs were weak and hurting.  If I did anything (shower or carry a simple laundry basket) my arms would hurt so bad, I was out of breath and my heart was pounding so hard.  By the week of March 29th - I was laying down in the middle of the day, no energy at all.  Called the doctor and because of the shortness of breath &amp; Body aches, they would only schedule a video visit for Monday, April 5th.  After talking to me, they schedule to see me that day at 11:45 AM.  I had weak muscle response in my arms, pale, and out of breath.  They did blood work.  Two hours after getting home; they called and said I needed to get to the emergency room.  My red blood cell count was dangerously low, and they ordered a blood transfusion.  I sent 6 days in the hospital.

My husband suggested I take Theraflu Nighttime for the pain and to sleep, which I took. Around 4:42 AM, I woke up to use the restroom. I was drenched so I guess I sweated out a fever. Went back to bed. My husband woke me up and suggested I drink some water. I went to the restroom, still feeling out of it, then made my way to a chair where I sat and down and collapsed. According to my husband he tried several times to revive me and finally I began gasp for air. The paramedics arrived and I was taken to Medical Center.

After about 5-6 minutes in the car, I started to feel bad, and I felt I should pull over.  I was on the road and traffic was super busy. I did pass out in front of a store on the road while driving my car. I came too and saw a restaurant. I pulled into their parking lot and texted my husband to come and get me. When he got there, I could barely stand. I layed down in the back of his truck because I could not sit up. My arm went number but I could wiggle my fingers.  We did drive to the hospital because I was so weak. but after the 15 minute drive to get to the hospital, I was able to sit up and walk again. I did not want to pay the $500 deductible so I my husband drove me home where I am sitting on the couch resting now.  My husband is a Chiropractor, so he has a lot of medical background.

I was taken to the ER and kept there approx. 5 hours.  I was extremely weak, could not lift my head and had trouble forming thoughts and words.  They gave me medication via IV&#39;s and observed me.  I started to feel better after about 4 hours after the vaccine, but have had more headaches than usual after receiving it.  I still have some issues with being upset and anxious about the reaction and if it will have long term adverse effects on me.  I will never get another vaccine of any type again.

Patient did not fall down or was she injured by fainting. Patient slowly rolled off chair and patients friend helped lower her to floor where patient regained her awareness . Pharmacist raced quickly to be by patient&#39;s side to monitor her vitals and to see if an allergic/ anaphylactic reaction had occured. No symptoms of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis was observed by pharmacist. Patient quickly regained her awareness and stated that fainting is common to her when routine blood work, injections, giving blood, etc.. Patient stated that fainting is something that has occurred several times in her past. No signs of allergic reaction, redness, hives, facial swelling, cardiovascular collapse were observed by pharmacist while closely monitoring her vitals after 911 was called. EMTs and paramedics arrived quickly and after closely examining patient and talking with her it was decided by Paramedics that patient fainted due to an emotional response by patient and there was no allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to report, nor any injury sustained by patient after fainting. Patient was quickly back to normal, and she verbally declined ambulance. Patient stated that she felt fine and that she was going to do some shopping and return home to relax.

We sat with the patient for about 5 minutes and asked that she stay seated for the remainder of her &#34;15 minute wait period.&#34; She was accompanied by her husband. Roughly 10 minutes after administration, one of our technicians alerted the pharmacists that the patient had experienced vasovagal syncope, so we rushed to the patient, called 911, and remained with her until she woke up (which was within less than 1 minute after the event) and was in the care of other healthcare personnel.

                                                Prior to receiving her COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was already having symptoms from anxiety/nervousness about the vaccine. Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient&#39;s face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;. EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient&#39;s friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient&#39;s vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient&#39;s husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included right leg deep vein thrombosis (2011), arthroscopic meniscus surgery (2011), and superficial thrombophlebitis on left leg from mid-calf up to mid-thigh (AUG-2020), and concurrent conditions included factor V Leiden mutation. (2011). The patient was not on oral contraceptive pills. No immediate family had history of clots. A family member on mom&#39;s side has had clots. She had right leg deep vein thrombosis in 2011 after arthroscopic meniscus surgery on right knee, followed by long car ride. She was diagnosed with Factor V Leiden mutation in 2011 at the time of that clot. She was on warfarin for about 4 months then taken off. She did well for almost a decade. In last AUG-2020 had a superficial thrombophlebitis in left leg from mid-calf up to mid-thigh. She was Xarelto (rivaroxaban), monitored with ultrasound, taken off on 15/17-JAN-2021. The patient was previously treated with warfarin for right leg deep vein thrombosis, and rivaroxaban for superficial thrombophlebitis on left leg from mid-calf up to mid-thigh.  The patient received COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1808980), administered on 30-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 30-MAR-2021, the patient felt good with slight cough on the day. She experienced achy by 7 PM, went to bed, then started getting the chills. At 2 AM on 31-MAR-2021 she had fever of 102 F.  The laboratory appointment on Thursday, 01-APR-2021 unrelated laboratory was ordered.  On 01-APR-2021, she was walking from parking lot to a building and was very short of breath. On 03-APR-2021, she was going up one flight of stairs, and felt severely short of breath and had dry cough. On 4-APR-2021, she experienced pain between shoulder blades in back. Oxygen saturation at home was 93-94% on RA while resting. On 4-APR-2021, she went to emergency room at a computerized tomogram (CT) of chest with contrast around at 6:30 PM showed massive pulmonary embolism. The right chamber the heart was enlarged due to the blockage from the embolism. Blood levels for &#34;stress on heart&#34; came back high. The patient went to cath lab for pulmonary angiogram on 4-APR-2021 and had EKOS catheter direct thrombolysis. She was started on heparin and transitioned to Xarelto (rivaroxaban) on 5-APR-2021.  She was on blood thinners and the left lung was cleaned up and removed. The clot was still on the right lung, unable may or may not be cleared. The patient was discharged on 06-APR-2021. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days. On 04-APR-2021, Platelet count was 181 (normal range 140-440), on 5-APR-2021, Platelet count was 160 (normal range 140-440), on 6-APR-2021 Platelet count was 154 (normal range 140-440). At the time of this massive PE event, the patient was not on any anticoagulation and since the event, had been restarted on Xarelto, and she was told she needs to continue for life. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from pulmonary embolism, and the outcome of feeling achy, chills, fever and slight cough was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: A 57-year-old woman with a history of Factor V Leiden deficiency (off anticoagulation for several months) and previous DVT 10 years ago was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism four days after vaccine. The same day after vaccine, the patient reported chills and a 102 F fever. Two days after vaccine she experienced shortness of the breath and four days after vaccine, the shortness of breath became worsened with pain in the back between the shoulder blades. The patient went to the hospital and was diagnosed with massive pulmonary embolism with enlargement of the right side of the heart. She underwent direct catheter thrombolysis in the cath lab and was started on Xarelto. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days and is doing well. Although there is a close temporal relationship, the history of Factor V Leiden with previous DVT provides plausible alternate explanation for the event.

I woke up with a swollen juggler vein that ended up being a blood clot, 10 days later my arm was swollen up twice the size of my leg, the juggler was still swollen. I call the urgent care nurse they said to go to ER. I went to hospital got a CAT scan and ultrasound, I was given a shot of warfarin that was supposed to last for 12 hours. I went home and the next morning instead of going to the hospital, I went to hospital and they found 2 blood clots in brain, arm and leg and neck. I have had no history of blood clots and this all happened after the J&amp;J vaccine. They did a procedure where they tried to put a balloon to relieve the pressure. The blood clots in the brain cannot be removed because of their location and it would be dangerous to remove and I am on blood thinners for the rest of my life. Multiple blood clots in body brain, arm and shoulder.

                                                Patient developed acute dyspnea with exertion 04/27.  Went to hospital ED, found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure.  CT-PE showing submassive saddle pulmonary embolism with several large emboli in bilateral upper and lower pulmonary arteries.  Transferred from outside hospital to another Hospital.  Started on IV Heparin  infusion with transition to Enoxaparin.  Had significant drop in platelet count and developed peripheral thrombi in all extremities.  Concerned for HIT at that time, and review of CDC recommendations for COVID vaccine-associated thrombi, patient transitioned to Fondaparinux and remains on at present.

Initial information was received on 27-APR-2021, with additional information obtained via telephone follow up from the physician on 29-APR-2021. The patient&#39;s specific height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included fatty liver, and the patient was overweight.  Family history was significant for a deep venous thrombosis treated with anticoagulants in the patient&#39;s mother, and a history of unspecified blood clots in her maternal grandmother. The patient was on no medications, including no estrogen containing pharmaceutical products or supplements. She has never been exposed to heparin. The patient had no history of COVID-19 infection. The patient received COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number not reported) on 12-APR-2021. The batch number has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported. On 18-APR-2021, 6 days after receiving vaccine, the patient developed a headache. On 23-APR-2021, 11 days after receiving vaccine, the patient presented to the hospital with complaints of headache and abdominal pain. COVID test in the emergency room was negative. On 23-APR-2021, imaging of the head and abdomen revealed:  left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, left internal jugular vein thrombosis.  The patient also had thrombocytopenia, with platelet count on presentation 22,000 (units not provided).  D-dimer was elevated at &gt;12.8 (units not provided), Fibrinogen was low at 103 (units not provided), HIT antibody test by ELISA was positive, and physicians made the diagnosis of Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT). The patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Treatment medications included argatroban, steroids and IVIG.  Following treatment, the platelet count remained low, with a nadir of 17,000. On 27-Apr-2021, she underwent thrombectomy and thrombolysis of the intra-abdominal clots. This was performed due to the potential for portal hypertension in the future, given the extent of the thromboses. Repeat CT venogram of the head on an unknown date, revealed resolution of the sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis; the internal jugular thrombosis persisted. The patient has steadily improved since the thrombectomy. Abdominal pain and headache are improving.  Platelet count has steadily risen, to 138,000 on 29- Apr-2021. Her transaminases were slightly elevated on admission and have not worsened, and she appears to have no organ dysfunction. A dialysis catheter had been placed in the event she would require plasmapheresis, but this was never used.  Additional laboratory data included: IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-COVID-2 nucleocapsid protein positive; Protein C deficiency negative; Protein S deficiency negative; Homocysteine level (NR: not provided) negative.  Serotonin release assay, anticardiolipin panel and Factor V Leiden tests were pending. The plan was to transition the patient to an oral anticoagulant and remove the dialysis catheter on 30-APR-2021, with a possible discharge on 01-MAY-2021. The patient had not recovered from left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, and left internal jugular vein thrombosis, and was recovering from left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, headache and abdominal pain.  This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).  Additional information was received from physician on 29-APR-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into the case narrative: patient history, disease course, events, outcome, lab data, concomitant drugs.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This spontaneous report concerns a 58-year-old female patient who experienced left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, left internal jugular vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, headache and abdominal pain, 11 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S.  The patient is overweight and there is a family history of clots in her mother and maternal grandmother. Imaging of the head and abdomen revealed multiple sites of thrombus formation, platelet count was 22,000, D-dimer was elevated at &gt;12.8 (units not provided), Fibrinogen was low at 103 (units not provided),  and HIT antibody test by ELISA was positive. Physicians made the diagnosis of  Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT).  The patient was treated with argatroban, IVIG, and steroids.  Platelet counts remained low and she underwent thrombectomy of the intra-abdominal thrombi.  Following thrombectomy the platelet counts rose and abdominal pain began to improve.  Lab data included a positive test for IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-COVID-2 nucleocapsid protein.   Based on the evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

                                                As described above, about 13 hours after the vaccine I woke up at 3 am with a severe pounding and constant headache. I was also extremely fatigued so much so that I did not get out of bed or do anything all day 4/11 and didn&#39;t start feeling better until the following Monday. Then I hear in the news about the 6 adverse reactions and the J&amp;J vaccine shutdown, possibility for blood clots etc. and to keep an eye out for various symptoms over next 2-3 weeks! It was stressful enough registering and not being able to secure the Moderna or Pfizer so I just said ok and got the J&amp;J. Now I have something else to worry about. Heart and blood clot issues are in my family. I do not take any blood thinners and don&#39;t plan to. But now am questioning whether I should have gotten the vaccine at all. I have had enough chronic illness in my life. In fact, December 2019 I was in another town taking care of my mother and her subsequent death when I caught someone&#39;s cough. Urgent care diagnosed me with pneumonia, fluid in the lungs, put me on course of antibiotics. I couldn&#39;t breathe, needed a nebulizer etc. They called me and said it was not pneumonia or flu a or b (I get the shot every year) and to go to the ER if it got worse. I couldn&#39;t eat or move much for three weeks and breathing was extremely difficult. I had to get a nebulizer. Eventually went away. Then in March Covid 19 became official. When I tested for Covid 19 here at a state site in 2021, I tested negative.

                                                Eight days after receiving the vaccine, my wife developed shortness of breath, headache, fatigue, and unusual vision problems. She was taken to the emergency room on 4/15 where she underwent a battery of tests (see details below). She was admitted to the hospital (where she currently is) and was diagnosed with blood clots in the lungs and two strokes in the area of the brain that affects vision. She then underwent ultrasound tests of her legs and carotid artery, which were negative for signs of blood clots. Although my wife&#39;s symptoms are different than the symptoms of others that led to the vaccine pause, her doctors strongly encouraged us to report it to the VAERS. My wife had no underlying or pre existing conditions that would lead to blood clots in her lungs, and stroke. After extensive testing there is no evidence that the blood clots in her lungs as well as the clot/clots that went to her brain initiated in her legs. They believe that some sort of &#34;event&#34; would have had to happen to cause these blood clots, and the only unusual thing in the time frame of this condition is the vaccine. As I mentioned earlier, my wife is still hospitalized.

I called my urologist and was seen on 04-14-2021. My blood platelets were extremely low. I was then referred to see a hematologist who sent me to the hospital. I was admitted at Hospital where they performed lab work, MRI&#39;s and CT scans. I stayed two days at the hospital. The hematologist who saw me said I have thrombocytopenia. Other tests were also performed and they checked me for stroke and I did not have a stroke. I am concerned due to my thrombocytopenia, if I get cut, I will bleed a lot and this is interfering with my job and to carry out my daily functions.   I am still not recovered and my platelets are low. I still have to follow-up with my PCP and my hematologist has to check my bone marrow as the next step of treatment.

Pain subsided in about an hour after resting. On April 28th, I experienced vaginal bleeding.  I awoke to a dry cough and felt the leakage.  The blood was bright red and I&#39;d estimate 4-6 Tablespoons.  I feel light-headed, concerned, but otherwise fine.

                                                On 4/19, I woke up with severe abdominal cramping, vomiting and diarrhea.  The diarrhea turned to bright red blood, so I went to the ER.  I was diagnosed with severe sepsis and colitis.  Although I was diagnosed with sepsis, I never had a fever and all blood cultures came back negative.  Before I was released, I went into uncontrolled atrial fibrillation.  I never had any history of colitis or atrial fibrillation prior to this.  No one can explain why there was no fever or pathogen detected.
