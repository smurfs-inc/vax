Other symptoms of an achy upper body, temperature of 103.1, and nausea came shortly after initial symptoms (within 1 hr.).    In the middle of the night, I began heavily sweating (something I have never experienced).  I was drenched with sweat and needed to change in the middle of the night.   Absolutely no energy and a horrible headache.    24 hrs. after the injection I no longer had a high fever.  However, consistently for a week, every day, I had at least one symptom (headache, nausea, chills, or lack of energy) at some point throughout the day.  When I received the injection, I was on day 2 of my period.  It ended one day later than normal.  However, what was not normal was that on 4/3/21, I began to bleed again.  I passed 2 clots and had spotting for an additional 5 days.  This is in no way normal to my cycle.

I noticed that my blurred vision intensified.  I went to the eye doctor 3/16 and that is where they found blood clots behind my right eye close to my center.  I was referred to a Retinol specialist 3/26/21 and sent me to get  a physical to check for diabetes.  It had started to heal a little. There was not clear diagnosis on what could have been causing the the blood behind my eye.  4/2/2021 Went for physical at PCP and results of physical was good with no Diabetes.

                                                Started with a fever, on day 3 fever was higher and I was short of breath as well as wheezing.  On Thursday the 15th I went to the dr. The x-ray didn&#39;t show anything however my cbc was of concern and she also did a d timer.  It came back elevated,  so she sent me over for a CAT scan with contrast. It showed pneumonia in my upper and lower right lung and also my lower left lung. She sent me home to try and treat it there. Over the weekend I felt worse and my husband took me to the ER.  Upon arrival my blood pressure was 160 over 120 and heart rate was 140. They admitted me to the hospital for treatment of sepsis and pneumonia and pain management. I was there for 4 days. I was released on the 22nd of April and I am still feeling all of these effects on my body. Headache that I have not been able to get rid of even with the help of  prescription medication.

                                                Was diagnosed with a DVT 3.5 weeks after vaccination. Started experiencing symptoms of DVT 20 days after the vaccine. Symptoms were not atypical and were almost not checked for DVT at ER.  Started with twinges in my right leg for several days. Then pain in my back right behind my heart. Then developed sporadic chest pain and heart palpitations. I was afraid to go to the ER because of COVID because my 12-year-old daughter has a heart condition.  Then on April 30 mid-day my right thigh began to hurt like a  pulled muscle although I had not injured it or pulled it. I couldn&#39;t walk on my leg the pain was so intense. My family was very worried about a blood clot because of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. That night I had really sharp chest pains and my thigh pain was no better by the next morning. I went to the ER told them my symptoms. After the ER doctor examined me he said he was 99% sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot because my pain was in my thigh and there was no redness or swelling. He told me my chest pain was probably due to anxiety. I asked if he would check my leg anyway. Once the ultrasound of my leg was done the DR came back and said I had a DVT. Then I had to have an MRI of my chest which he told me was a lot of radiation. I did not have a PE. They did not prescribe Heparin because they felt the DVT was from the vaccine. So I was giving Eliquis. Since then my family DR has run more tests and I do not have any genetic reason to have the DVT. I do not and have not taken birth control in the past 20 years. I am now on a blood thinner for at least 90 days if not longer and I am continuing to have twinges and chest pain twinges.

Anaphylactic Reaction:  sore throat went to very sore strep throat feeling, throat felt like closing, difficult breathing 15 minutes: coughing asthma began. Blood sugar felt it was dropping ( 20 min prior had breakfast sandwich before shot). Right arm hand tremors began, week in legs even when sitting  sever headache.  Asked staff get a Benadryl- call 911. Took 25 mg tab benedryl 5 min prior to EMT arrived.  Same time another woman started difficulty breathing and staff at facility asked if Emt could look at her too. Emt called another ambulance to scene as strap into gurney. Way to ER gave me liquid steroid. ER given epi, nebulizer breathing treatment  Abuterol help breathing, pepicid too.  Discharge after 3:30 pm. 40 mg prednisone ( 2 tabs a day for 4 days) and instructed Benedryl 4-6 hours. Use epi pen if throat and sever sore throat comes back- return to er.

                                                Immediately after the JANSSEN vaccine I felt tenderness in my jaw that lasted for about two days. My body was sore, my Legs felt like I was having cramps ?growing pains? I also was experiencing allergy/asthma like symptoms that included difficulty breathing and shortness of breath that worsened over time I couldn&#39;t speak in full sentences or laugh I was unable to walk 10 steps without gasping for air, after a couple of days of trying to maintain and cope with my theses symptoms. I couldn?t take it anymore, as I was preparing myself to go to the emergency room. I got into the shower the steam from the shower felt like it was suffocating me and I passed out my children took me out of the bathtub and rushed me to the emergency room where I was given several tests that include x-ray, CAT scan, artery bloodwork and vein bloodwork. I was being treated for asthma and given several different breathing treatments and steroids, unable to keep my stats at a decent level and the hard rebound even after continuous treatments, I was admitted because the breathing treatments were not effective. I am still uncertain of the ?actual outcome? the Hospital doctors treated me for an asthmatic episode and gave me directions how to handle my asthma i was prescribed prednisone and referred  to my primary that would then refer me to a pulmonologist and cardiologist. At the hospital I was told that there was black spots on my lungs I was told that I was being treated for infection, but then also told it could be pneumonia no certain  answer was ever given and i was given and antibiotic and was also told that I needed to see my primary for a way to maintain my asthma. The antibiotics seem to work for a couple of days and again I&#39;m back to having difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, muscle pain soreness and mild lingering headaches.

                                                ? Acute CVA (cerebrovascular accident)  Hospital Course/test results:  Work up with MRI showed 2 small acute infarcts in R temporal lobe region, and findings which could represent subacute infarcts in L frontal lobe.  Neuro deficits now resolved.  Neurology consulting.  Suspicious for embolic phenomenon.  She does also have a IUD to treat her menorrhagia, which may predispose her to clotting.  However when we did further research Mirena IUDs were not found to raise the risk for blood clot-related heart attack and strokes but the company does recommend clinical consideration for removal in such situations. We contacted  OBGYN oncall physician and spoke to doctor today. From his recommendation is not to remove the IUD at present time because the risk is very low comparing to the higher risk of severe menorrhagia that patient had experienced in the past. Since she will have annual visit with her GYN at OBGYN, patient should have that conversation with her GYN for options.    Patient remains stable and symptoms free. Repeated brain MRI and new MRV did not reveal new findings. Her HA resolved on its own. She was initially started statin and full dose of ASA then changed to low dose ASA plus Plavix (21 days) then ASA as monotherapy after. Currently hypercoag panel is still pending. Echo showed no evidence of intracardiac shunting with fair quality and technically adequate study. Neurology recommended outpatient follow up with neurologist and 30 days heart monitor to look for Afib/flutter. Currently her headache is resolved as well R hand weakness/tingling is resolved. She is stable to go home today.    A1C is 7.3 while on Metformin (2000mg daily). She may need additional agent to get A1C &lt; 7 as outpatient.    Neuro also recommended outpatient sleep study.

It had the appearance and consistency of vegemite or molasses. Black sludge. At first it was extremely heavy with very large black clots. Then it became tiny little black clots suspended in a brown sludge. This continued for 6 days until 04/18. Then on 04/19 my menstruation turned bright red with no clots, but has not abated at all for another 4 days. I am currently today on Thurday 04/22 still bleeding almost 2 weeks after taking the J&amp;J shot. I cannot believe I am still bleeding after 10 full days!!! Never in 30 years of menstruating have I had a 10 day period. I am very scared and upset.

                                                I took the vaccine at 2:10pm on 4/8/21 and 20 minutes later at 2:30pm on 4/8/21 my cycle started a whole week early, which is very abnormal for me. I am bleeding clots of blood for 5 days now with weakness and pains. My normal cycle is very regular and lasts 3 days, the first day is heavy then moderate, then light on the third day i barely need a liner. This has been heavy bleeding with sizable blood clots.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

                                                I went in for a scheduled MRI of my foot and the MRI found that I have a 7mm blood clot on my foot. It was found on my left foot plantar region (bottom of my foot). A few days after the vaccine I had swelling on the top and bottom of my left foot. I got two vascular images completed and the MRI was never sent to the vascular department. My podiatrist confirmed the blood clot on an ultrasound. I&#39;m still experiencing swelling.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I got the vaccine the evening of 03/23/21. Overnight I noticed my body starting to hurt and felt chills. The morning  of 03/24/21 I woke up with full body aches, chills, and fever over 100 F. These symptoms lasted all day. Fever went up to 102 F.  Recently I have noticed a change in my menses since having the vaccine and I wonder if it is linked. I have been on birth control since last year to control heavy bleeding. It was helping very well. The period I had in April and May were like it was before I started the pill. It was heavy and I had numerous large clots. I will be scheduling an appt with my ob/gyn regarding this change.

Had I not taken the Allegra D that morning and Famotidine 1 hour before the shot, I would have gotten hives all over my torso and face and swelling would have started in my face.   I had an anaphylactic reaction but the histamine blocker and anti histamine kicked in after about 10-15minutes and I felt better.  Had I not taken the medicine I would have ended up in the Emergency Room.  That night I developed Oral Lichen Planus.  This became extremely bad and uncomfortable for the next 48 hours.  Then it started to heal.  It fully went away after 6-7 days.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included penicillin allergy (itchy throat/swelling), and doxycycline allergy (throat swells shut and marbles in there). The patient was previously treated with escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro 20mg). The patient was not pregnant at the time of reporting. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 203A21A expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported,1 total administered on 09-APR-2021 15:30:00 on left deltoid for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  It was reported that after vaccination on 9-APR-2021, the patient immediately got headache but her left eye felt numb. She waited 30 minute because she had anaphylactic side effects and it felt really weird. The headache and left eye felt numb/left eye piercing while she was driving back (from vaccination center) which lasted for hour and half (short lived and resolved). On 11-APR-2021 she experienced right back pain (that radiates) which lasted for about five days. After that her inner thigh veins all got bright red for 2 days (only inner thigh nowhere else) and she thought she had something on her and tried wiping it off. On 16-APR-2021, she went to the doctor it was about one week from she received the shot, her left eye was swollen almost shut and that swelling lasted about five days. She was not able to see out of her eyes. She was not able to produce a word which was kind of weird for her. After that, the side effect she had, was her left side of tongue felt lazy and was lingering. She went to the doctor 3 days later news of clot came out doctor said those were the side effect of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and there was nothing to worry about. She was trying to figure out why her eye was so big and performed D-dimer test which came back normal. She attempted Benadryl for 2 days did nothing but made her tired and she stopped taking it. She thought may be those were allergies at that time. She used an ice pack on her eye, so that swelling would go down a little. There was no discharge from her eye it was just swollen. In APR- 2021, Laboratory data included: Fibrin D dimer (NR: not provided) as Normal. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl).

                                                I started having an annaphylaxis reaction a short time after i left. At first it was intense all over body itching that felt like it was from the inside out. By the time i got home i was getting red blotchy patches over my face, neck, and chest. I took benedryl which did nothing to subside the reaction. When my chest started feeling tight i went to the emergency room. My lips were itching and puffy. At the er  i received treatment for annaphylaxis once and about a half hour to forty minutes before i was to be discharge i had a reoccurance of symptoms and was treated for it a second time and admitted to the hospital. This was from the March 31st clinic held at the fire department.

                                                Had chest pain on and off for 5 days (started Thursday 3/25),  which I thought was related to acid reflux. On Tuesday 3/30 when it became worse and was no longer managed with ibuprofen I went to patient 1st. I was given an ekg which was abnormal and then sent to ER. There it was determined that I had a blood clot and 100% blockage in my right coronary artery. That night I had surgery and they placed a stent.

                                                Patient started not feeling well on 3/24.  She was experiencing dizziness, headache, chills and fever. She contacted her doctor on 3/25 and he thought maybe she had an inner ear infection.  Symptoms continued to worsen and eventually an ambulance was called on 3/27 because patient stated she was having severe SOB and headache along with dizziness and fever.  Patient was transported to Hospital where they tested her for covid and pneumonia.  Both came back negative.  After several tests it was confirmed she had a blood clot in her lung and was also told she had clots in her leg and heart as well.  She was in the hospital for 3 days where she was given heparin and several medications for the headache.  Patient was discharged on lovenox and coumadin and eventually switched to xarelto by pcp who is managing her anticoagulation.  She still has follow up appointments with a cardiologist and neurologist.  She said she is still experiencing some dizziness and SOB but overall doing better

                                                1 hour after the vaccine I was walking with my sister and began experiencing neurological adverse effects--I was dragging my right lag and slurring my speech. 3 hours after the vaccine my right arm and right leg began tingling, went numb, and became weak. These symptoms persisted and my doctor advised me to go to the ER for brain imaging 24 hours after the vaccine. On day 3 after the vaccine, my symptoms had diminished but not subsided and I began to have new symptoms: extreme heat and pressure starting at my right ear and spreading through my face and head. The heat has subsided but not the pressure, as I am writing this it is day 13. Tests came back normal, but weakness and pressure neurological symptoms persist.

Heavy clots of menstrual discharge were observed. It is not yet known whether these side effects will continue for my next menstrual cycle. Lesser effects followed two days after the vaccine with fatigue, sore arm, armpit, and glands in the injection arm. These side effects dissipated by day 3 status post vaccine administration.

Clinical Presentation and Course: 1 week after receiving Janssen COVID19 vaccination, patient developed gradually worsening headache. On March 17th, patient presented to Hospital with dry heaving, sudden worsening of headache and  L sided weakness.  Evaluation with head CT revealed a large R temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 1.3cm midline shift.  She ended up getting intubated for worsening mental status. On evaluation at arrival in Medical Center, she was noted to have extensor posturing.  Repeat imaging revealed worsening midline shift to 1.6cm.  CTA showed cortical vein thrombosis involving the right transverse and sigmoid sigmoid sinus with tentorial herniation. Patient developed brain herniation and brain death was pronounced on March 18th, 2021.

                                                3/13 vaccination. 3-4 hours later, I started having symptoms to include tickle in throat, post nasal drip. By 11:40 I had a HA, I was very tired, quite a bit of secretion. I continued taking Benadryl every 3 hours. At 2 :30 PM, heart palpitations and angina. My BP was 98/69. I took more Benadryl, drank some fluids. By 4:15, I was getting drowsy and tired, having pain in multiple joints through my body; 8/10 scale, especially in my hands in feet. I took something for pain. My arm was very sore. I had mild to moderate slight cough. By 7:40 PM I took my regular medication.  I was having a sudden intense HA and pain in joints was 9/10. I was having stiffness, chest congestion, feeling &#39;flu like&#39; symptoms, brain fog, and weird pains / electro shock pains on extremities. By 830, my symptoms increased to almost a really bad allergic reaction. I couldn&#39;t think well, dizzy, cough, chest congestion and my lungs started to hurt. By 10:30pm, I started to have a low grade fever, pain 9/10, I took Ibuprofen and Benadryl every 3 hours.  3/14 Ibuprofen, slight fever, slight HA, joints were swollen and stiff; 8/10 on pain and stiffness. I had muscle pain and brain fog, could not say words. Dull pain back of head. My kidney area, I felt like it hurt, severe anaphylactic reaction it felt like. I still had photophobia. It continued into the evening. I continued taking the Benadryl and ibuprofen. Around 6pm, I had 101.5 temperature, nauseated, crying, chest congestion. By 10:45, my temp was going up again.  Monday I had low grade fever, continued medication. Symptoms continued for a few more days with palpitations, brain fog, pain in lungs and kidneys. I couldn&#39;t do anything. By the end of the week, I started to recover.  *My PCM knew before I got the vaccine they were on board and knew what was going to happen in regards to my reaction, EKG, I had epi pen, didn&#39;t pass out, I decided I was going to stay home.  *It took me a good couple weeks to recover to my baseline. But it was pretty tough.

Started the night of May 25th and I didn&#39;t think any of it cause I have always had &#34;jumpy&#34; legs when I&#39;m falling asleep. But Then the sensation was getting more intense the night of May 26th so the morning of May 27th I went to the ER.

Rph applied constant pressure using cotton balls to the area for 5-7 minutes. Bleeding had stopped and a new bandaid was applied. Injection site adverse event was then resolved. Pt expected this due to her having a medical condition of anemia and taking subsequent B-12 injections. Pt was observed for 30 minutes and no bleeding re-occurred or was seen. Pt was directed to put ice and pressure on it for further home care.

Went to urgent care but it had stopped by then so they sent me home and told me if it happened again to go to ER.  I haven?t had a nosebleed in years so it was scary to get it the day after my vaccine.  The nose bleed lasted about 10 minutes and was very strong once the clot came through it slowed down and then stopped and did not return again.

                                                Received Janssen vaccine 4/6.  Started menstrual cycle 12 hours after vaccine even though had just completed last cycle 1 week prior.  Normally cycles are 28-30 days apart.  They have not been quite as regular since Covid and has had some shorter periods between normal cycles.  After the vaccine bleeding was heavier than normal with large clots but by end of last week had changed color and looked like it was ending.  Today had no discharge upon awakening but again has a small amount of bright blood.  Of course, there is concern for coagulopathy related to the vaccination.  No leg pain, no shortness of breath.  Has had HA off and on since had Covid but no worse now than in previous weeks.  Left ear pain has been painful since Covid but now has pain in both ears when that occurs.  Quit taking ibuprofen last week for discomfort and switched to Tylenol.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on 3/5/2021.  My first menstrual cycle after the vaccine, which started on 3/21/21, was significantly different than any other period.  I woke in the middle of the night to extreme pain in my abdomen and bled along the floor as I walked to the bathroom.  There were clots in the blood in addition to extraordinarily heavy blood flow.  The period was so significantly different from any other that I scheduled an appointment with a nurse practitioner that works with my primary care doctor.  I asked her to &#34;run&#34; all tests that were available and approved by insurance, which she did.  All came back normal.  Due to the significant difference in my period this month, the ARNP  requested an inner-uterine ultrasound which found the below:

                                                flu like symptoms with headache 4/8/21. Chest pain, nausea, sweating, lightheadedness  started 4/10/21, was seen in ER and discharged home. White count was noted as 2.8. Chest pain went away after 24 hours and palpitations started 4/11/21, severe at times for several hours at a time. Saw my cardiologist on 4/15/21 for severe palpitations and he ordered a halter monitor to be worn for 2 weeks. I stated  to him that I felt like I was in SVT, or something stronger than just palpitations. This continued for several hours a day from 4/11/21 to 4/24/21, when I was on the telemetry pack at work and went into an arrythmia that was later evaluated by my cardiologist as SVT and A FIB. On 4/25/21, I had mild &#34;palpitations&#34; but have not had any incidences since. I am now on metoprolol to control it and did not have a cardiac issue prior to receiving the vaccine.

Also on 03-28-2021, I woke up with extreme left leg pain. I had difficulty holding things with my arms and I almost collapsed to the floor due to my left leg pain and weakness. I also had heavy menstrual bleeding with giant clots for the Month of March 2021.  I can say today I have no symptoms of my left leg or headaches today.

                                                About 4 days after I started having abdomen pain, it was like having contractions, then bleeding and spotting, and it was a different type of color instead of a period color, more burgundy. it lasted 26 days, when I&#39;d eat it would start again, I started having headaches, and had vision problems, then SOB started and I used the inhaler to help. I also had a low grade fever of 99.8 - 100 that lasted up until about 5 days ago. I started having bruising and leg pain, the bruising would be if someone helped me get up, I have little bruising dots over my body.  I went to the ER 3/16/2021 because the stomach and headache pains, they did a MRI and Ct and said it was acute stomach pain and migraines and told me to see a OBGYN for the bleeding and gave me meds for stomach pains. Bentel for stomach and Floraset for headaches but it never worked. I had a nerve block on my head for the migraines but it didn&#39;t work.  The GYN gave me something to stop the bleeding and she&#39;s wants to do a D&amp;C. I&#39;m waiting to see my PCP on the 19th.  I still have the purple dots and headaches, I still get the contractions and the stomach issues have settled some.

                                                BLOOD CLOT IN ARM; FEELING SICK; This spontaneous report received from a patient via a company representative concerned a 47 year old female. The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of report The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 05-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On an unspecified date in APR-2021, the patient experienced burning sensation in arm, tenderness of arm, and pronounced veins on arm; also she was feeling sick. She saw the healthcare professional (HCP) after these symptoms. She was told about a blood clot (tenderness / burning sensation/ pronounced veins) in the arm. HCP recommended her taking aspirin and applying heat to the arm. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: acetylsalicylic acid. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from blood clot in arm, and the outcome of feeling sick was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 47-year-old female patient reported burning sensation and tenderness in arm, pronounced veins in arm, and feeling sick after an unspecified duration from receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  HCP was consulted and was &#34;told&#34; about a blood clot and prescribed aspirin with advice to apply her to the arm.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included aspirin allergy, and hypertension. On 31-MAR-2021, the patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, administered in left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported. The company was unable to perform follow up for Batch/lot numbers. The concomitant medications included unspecified natural pills. On 05-APR-2021, the patient was hospitalized for venous thrombotic cavern sinus and thrombocytopenia 25,000, computerised tomogram head abnormal, fibrin d dimer increased, magnetic resonance imaging head abnormal, and developed platelet count decreased, venogram abnormal.  On 05-APR-2021, the subject experienced full blood count. The patient was hospitalized (date unspecified) for 12 days. The following laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: CT scan results not provided, Complete blood count results not reported, Fibrin D dimer was elevated (value not provided), MRI results were not reported and Venogram was abnormal. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the cavernous sinus thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, computerised tomogram head abnormal, fibrin d dimer increased, magnetic resonance imaging head abnormal, platelet count decreased, venogram abnormal and full blood count was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).  This case version (1) was created on 30-APR-2021 for the purpose of quality improvement the following corrections were made. The MAC was added to the pharmacovigilance narrative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V1: This spontaneous report received from a patient via VAERS (ID: 1238777) concerned a 47-year-old woman who experienced cavernous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 5 days after vaccine. Concurrent conditions included hypertension and concomitant medications included unspecified natural pills. Five days after vaccine, the patient was hospitalized for venous cavernous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (25,000) with an elevated D dimer (unspecified.) CT head and MRV were performed with results not provided. The patient was hospitalized for 12 days and treatment details were not provided. Based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration-BC), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination (BC Criteria level 1), the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination. Reporter contact information was not provided which precludes meaningful additional information in this version.

She is perimenopausal and couldn&#39;t say for sure if she was having a hot flash or a fever. Her previous seizure was a year ago she said. Around 2:00 a.m. she woke up with stretching movements with her arms over hear head that she couldn&#39;t control, but didn&#39;t feel like a seizure to her. Patient went back to bed, but woke up around 5:30 a.m.. with temp of 102 degrees F. She took 2 ibuprofen 200mg (total dose 400mg) every 4 to 6 hours starting at 5:30 a.m. for a total of 3 doses. She felt better by later afternoon. She complains that her arm is still sore today. She just reported this to us this morning when she was back in the pharmacy.

My initial symptoms included tingling, numbness, and inability to walk.  The doctors confirmed during MRI that I had had a stroke.  I was in the hospital for four days, and released to PT/OT three times a week for the next 4 weeks to regain full use of the right side.  I  am also unable to work during this time.

                                                On Saturday, April 10, 2021, I had started having pain and swelling in my right calf that lasted for several days on and Tuesday, April 13th, I started having pain on the left side of my chest.  On Thursday, April 15th, I went to the ER due to pain and selling in my leg and it was discovered that I had 2 clots in my leg (on at my calf and a second one on the right side of my knee).  Not realizing my chest pain was related, I discussed with my primary care at a follow up visit on Monday, April 19th, and a CT scan was performed confirming I have  an pulmonary embolism (extensive pulmonary emboli in both lungs).  I was immediately put on Xarelto blood thinner and sent home.

Been on the tamoxopine for over a year and no side effects at all. Headaches and breathing issues all started after the vaccine

                                                My mother received the Jansen vaccination on April 6, 2021.  2 days post vaccination she had 2 asthma attack at work. That following Friday she was not able to attend work due to shortness of breath.  Saturday morning she cold not inhale and  couldn?t stop coughing. She was then attempted to be taken to urgent care, but upon arrival she was coughing up blood and was instructed to go straight to the hospital.  At the hospital upon test being done she was admitted to the covid unit and diagnosed with pneumonia due to covid 19 virus, bilateral pulmonary embolism in both lungs. She is now home in quarantine taking blood thinners for the next three months and unable to work.

                                                I have a history of untreated fibroids that were diagnosed in December 2019.  Because the coronavirus pandemic began in February 2020, elective surgeries were not allowed in my state.  My bleeding and blood clots were caused by the fibroids during menstruation.  On March 20, 2021, I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson 1-shot COVID vaccine.  By March 26th, the blood clots that were coming out of my body were enormous.  They had NEVER been that large.  Being concerned, I immediately saw my doctor as soon as my period ended.  Today, I learned the J&amp;J vaccine has been paused due to blood clots.   I believe that my blood clots became so large because I was given this particular vaccine.  WOMEN SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT IF THEY HAVE BLOOD CLOT CAUSING FIBROIDS, DO NOT TAKE THE JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON COVID-19 VACCINE.

Called my OBGYN, they said let it run it&#39;s coarse and they had they had many similar phone calls. I take a Nuva ring for birth control, I was concerned about estrogen and the blood clots.  I did not feel well at all for about a week after my vaccine, everyday around 4pm I would get really bad headaches for about 3-4 weeks. I was nauseated and sweating.

On 5/24/21, she did not report feeling sick or having a headache and threw up around 11 am.  Throwing up was the only way I knew to ask her how she was feeling.  She said, I think I threw up because my head hurt.  I asked her where it hurt and she said, in the back.  I took her to the ED and she had a brain bleed and 5 blood clots in the major veins and sinuses of the left hemisphere of her brain.  Her medical team said this is a very rare part of the brain to have blood clots.  I would like further investigation into whether this was related to the vaccine.

                                                10 days after the vaccine I developed dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth,chest pressure, shortness of breath and felt like I was going to pass out, and I had a feeling of extreme doom. I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

They got me in on March 25 (Thursday). Dr inspected and told me it&#39;s thrombus that caused huge pain. They did the surgery right away, removed thrombus. I never had blood clots problem and I was healthy, which my blood test result can prove. Thrombus generated 12 days after my J&amp;J vaccine shot, I am reporting this side effect. You may find all my medical record from Doctor&#39;s office.

Didn&#39;t think anything of it until I mentioned it to my mom who received her vaccine at the same time &amp; place from the SAME BOTTLE and she too was waking with bloody clots in her nose. I experienced a reoccurrence for 4 days in mid April. I wouldn&#39;t have said anything but friends nagged us after the J&amp;J blood clotting issue.  (We both also experienced severe piercing &amp; throbbing pain in the bone beneath the injection  for about 14 days.) I mentioned both events to my GP on 3/26/21

                                                I had 2 adverse reactions to the Janssen Covid-19 Vaccine EUA: AE #1) Roughly 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, the lower half of my face went numb for approximately 3 hours. The people who administered the vaccine made me stay at the site for about an hour and a half to make sure that the reaction did not get worse. AE #2) 10 days after receiving the vaccination, the lower part of my left leg began to swell significantly. I went to the emergency room on 4/13/2021. When I was there, they did tests and confirmed that I have a blood clot behind my knee. To treat the blood clot, the emergency room doctor gave me lovenox 110mg and warfarin 5mg. Since then, I have followed up with my primary doctor who has me taking warfarin 10mg ( 1x daily) and lovenox (as needed).

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 07-APR-2021, the patient experienced a mild fever. On 08-APR-2021, the patient was achy and had a mild headache. The headache continued for several day and became pretty bad for about two days. On an unspecified date in Apr-2021 the patient was treated with Tylenol for headache. On 12-APR-2021, the patient experienced leg cramps in her right leg. On 15-APR-2021, the patient had an ultrasound and a blood clot was found in her right leg. The patient started on Apixaban (Eliquis). The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from headache on an unknown date in APR-2021, and the outcome of blood clot, ache, leg cramps and fever was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old female was found to have blood clot in her right leg 9 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. There was reported mild fever, headache, and &#34;aches&#34; 1 to 2 days after vaccination that was treated with Tylenol.  The symptom reported was leg cramps on right leg 5 days after vaccination, and ultrasound showed blood clot in her right leg 3 days after the symptom of cramps was noted.  No other laboratory/diagnostic test reported.  The patient was treated with apixaban.  The outcome of blood clot in leg was not reported.  Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.

                                                Presented 5/13 to Hospital.  Presented to Hospital on 5/13 with one week of symptoms including cough, dyspnea, diarrhea. COVID-19 testing was positive on 5/8.   Treatments prior to arrival included remdesivir and dexamethasone, started 5/13.  She was also placed on pulse dose steroids 1000 mg/day methylprednisolone given her history of ground glass lung opacities in 2018.  Progressed to high-flow nasal cannula, then BiPAP on 5/14, and was intubated on 5/17.   Paralysis and proning initiated.  Transferred to another hospital for possible VV ecmo candidacy. Patient with severe acute respiratory failure d/t covid who has failed treatment with the ventilator despite paralysis and proning.   CTS asked to place patient on VV ECMO.    5/20/21 1135am  initiated ECMO Patient is a 50yr old female with past medical history of hypertension, asthma, OSA and obesity BMI 41.5 who presented to hospital on 5/13 with progressive cough and shortness of breath for about a week.  Of note, patient also has a history of respiratory failure presenting with ground glass opacities on CT scan in 2018 with unclear etiology despite bronchoscopy and serologic studies which resolved with high dose corticosteroids.  Patient recently tested positive for COVID on 5/8 and received johnson and johnson vaccine in April. Patient was admitted on 5/13 and treated with decadron, remdesivir and tocilizumab.  Course complicated by progressive respiratory failure requiring HFNC followed by Bipap and ultimately intubation on 5/17.  Due to elevated d-dimer, lower extremity dopplers were obtained which were negative, however a heparin gtt was initiated. Course further complicated by cold left lower extremity; arterial duplex demonstrated distal popliteal artery thormbus extending into the peroneal, anterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. therefore heparin was switched to argatroban and a HIT panel was sent.  On 5/19 patient continued to decline despite paralytic and pronning.  Patient transferred to ICU for further level of care and VV ECMO evaluation. On arrival patient was started on veletri; however due to continued respiratory decline a shock call was placed for VV ECMO and patient cannulated for VV @ 1200. Cannulation was difficult and patient was felt to have an IVC thrombus as clot was seen going into the ECMO circuit during cannulation. Post cannulation she developed worsening septic shock and DIC. She received 2uprbc, 1unit cryo, 1 platelet, 2 FFP, 5 liters crystalloid and 1L albumin. Blood cultures positive for GPC in clusters. Escalating vasopressors (Epi/NE/vaso) and ongoing hypoxia family opted to change code status to DNR. Patient then continue to have worsening hemodynamic instability and went into PEA and ultimately asystole. She was pronounced deceased at 1815. Family was en route already due to her instability thus will be notified of her passing once they arrive. Dr. was notified of patients death.

                                                Following the vaccine injection which was provided by the personnel, I have developed minor fainting spells and angina for the past 10 plus days. A large dried blood clot was noted on the first day of my period which occurred on March 16th. I continue to pass large blood clots while I was having my period. I also want to point out that a personnel who gave me an injection was incorrectly injected the vaccine outside of the area of the preferred injection zone. I have reported this event to the supervisor who was on site. I have not yet contacted my health care provider at this time but plan to contact her tomorrow as these symptoms have been persisting.

                                                She developed a large pulmonary embolus, and she died on 3/17 at Hospital. She developed symptoms of SOB on 3/11, and was admitted to the hospital. She was initially stable and not requiring oxygen and was sent home on anticoagulation. However she returned the same day with worsening symptoms, troponin now elevated, and ECHO showing signs of right heart strain. Embolus on imaging had increased in just over days from previous CT scan. She became pulseless and died despite resuscitative efforts. It is my opinion (Dr.) that she died of a pulmonary embolus, and an autopsy is pending.

                                                Patient has had chronic intermittent pain on her left lower leg for the past 5 years. However, she has noticed more pain on the left lower leg since having the COVID-19 Janssen vaccine on 3/19/2021. She is a chronic smoker. Thus, a left lower extremity arterial doppler was done on 5/20/2021 which incidentally revealed a DVT in the gastronemius vein of the left lower extremity. A subsequent bilateral US venous doppler of both lower extremities was done which revealed no DVT. Therefore, a repeat venous doppler of the left lower extremity was ordered for today, 5/21/2021, and remains pending at this time. Of note, patient was started on eliquis on 5/20/2021 (10 mg BID for the first 7 days with subsequent decrease to 5 mg BID thereafter). She will be referred to a hematologist for continued management.

                                                Both sides of my neck were very swollen. There was extreme pain on my right arm. The pain was severe and numbness in my finger. I went to the ER and they said I have radial thrombus, a clot in the radial artery.  Before the shot, my heart was checked multiple times and I was fine. After the shot, my coronary arteries are now very small. There are now luminal changes inside my coronary arteries which are still now very small. I now have been diagnosed with CAD. I had a heart cath on March 29. My arm is still in a lot of pain. My neck is still swollen.

She developed severe bruising to the site of injection on left arm. Later she developed more bruising on abdomen, wrist and arms. She presented to the hospital with right flank pain with kidney stone and found to be severely thrombocytopenic of which likely was ITP. Received IVIG and steriods with improvement in her platelet response. Thankfully no bleeding.  Patient has been in hospital for 4 days and still hospitalized at the time of this report.

I received shot, and within a minute or two- my lips and tongue started to tingle, swell and go numb.  My throat started to swell too.  Had a hard time starting to breathe and took my xopenex inhaler.  I had taken a benadryl beforehand, and ended up taking two more as EMT came over to  help me there at the site.  She kept an eye on me.  My A Fib was speeding up and getting irregular too.  After about half an hour, it stopped getting worse and seemed to level off.  They offered to take me to ER, and had me promise to call 911 if it got bad again.  Still felt bad the rest of the day.  Felt a little better later the next day, and a little better (today is day 3), but still not 100%.  I did contact my doctor to check in

I was transported by ambulance to the hospital. A CT and MRI was done, no signs of blood clots or stroke.  I am still experiencing numbness and tingling in the right arm. Follow up appointments with the eye doctor indicate additional vision loss in the right eye with pressure behind the eye. I have a follow up appointment today with the neurologist for a brain scan and tomorrow for an eeg. My PCP, eye doctor, and neurologist believe it may be a blood flow issue. I have not had this type of event before.

She got the vaccine, the night of the vaccine around 5:30 she got a raging headache (she does get reactions to most vaccines).  She took Tylenol and her arm did hurt.  The next day she was still really hurting, her headache was really, really bad, and it stayed until Sunday.  Then on Sunday she was ok.  On Monday when she went to work and her right arm went limp, and while she was walking her right leg gave way and almost fell, grabbed hold and steadied herself.  The raging headache/migraine came back and she started getting nauseous, her lower back hurt, her upper neck area hurt like somebody was pounding her neck.  Then she got diarrhea and really really tired on Monday and Tuesday and also had loss of appetite.  Then yesterday 4/13/201 she just had the headache and a sound in her ear, went to UC and got drops for it.  Her temperature was 96.5, and her normal is 98.7, and was told that she was really cold.  Her PB was really high and the doctor took it again but it was not as high, attributed it to anxiety.  Last night the lower abdomen pain started, feeling like she was getting her period which she has not had in over a year.  She saw a little blood on her panty liner, and was thinking she was going to have a period, but the pain is excruciating in her lower abdomen.   She has also taken Tylenol off and on for her symptoms, and feels like she is cramping.     She is having hot/cold flashes as well, and has not had these issues from menopause.

Since I had surgery (see above) my doctor sent me fir an ultrasound where a clot was found. Went to emergency room to further evaluate and get treated. Was given elequis and am taking for 3 months.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included hypertension, and anaphylaxis to peanuts. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 02-APR-2021 to right arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported. On 02-APR-2021, after vaccination patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction. The patient was at her local pharmacy and was waiting in chairs as instructed; then she walked to her vehicle and began to feel light-headed and lost consciousness. Her husband was with her and was able to administer life saving measures, the local pharmacist was able to administer an epi-pen to her right thigh. On 02-APR-2021, the patient stopped breathing and was then transported to the local ER(emergency room) where she was treated. She regained consciousness and had persistent emesis and the patient was kept in hospital for 24 hours before being discharged. The patient was hospitalized for one day. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from syncope/lost consciousness, and was recovering from light headed, vomiting/persistent emesis, and anaphylactic reaction, stopped breathing. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused/ Prolonged, and Life Threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 A 52-year-old female patient with the past medical history remarkable for anaphylaxis to peanuts experienced anaphylactic reaction the same day the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2 was administered. The patient began to feel light-headed and lost consciousness, an epi-pen was administered. The next day the patient stopped breathing and was treated in the local ER (emergency room). Later she had persistent emesis. Given the close temporal relationship and history of anaphylaxis to peanuts the events are considered related.

                                                I started with getting red, hard knots in my leg. They were hard, hard knots. Almost felt like  blood clot. My blood pressure rose extremely high like never before. Then I got edema. I went to the vein doctor. I saw the nurse assistant and they said it wasn&#39;t a blood clot. Finally, I got to see him at another visit and he thought it was bug bites. But it sounded odd like that I would have these red splotches up and down my legs and they were hard and he put me on Prednisone. The symptoms disappeared completely. About 4 -6 days after the medication was over, all the symptoms re-appeared. At some point, I went to the ER - because I was worried about blood clots. They gave me Cephlex - as they thought it was bug bites  - so I was on that for 6 or 7 days. And the symptoms got better with this medication - made it better but not disappear like Prednisone did. Then after that, it was horrible again - the symptoms. I have an appt tomorrow to get checked again. I have never have had this stuff before in my life. My blood pressure is elevated but not so high as it was in the beginning. My legs are in pain - I can&#39;t even touch them. My skin so red  - it looks like it&#39;s on fire. I went to Orthopedic doctor thinking it was related to a previous injury or sprain. But they said it wasn&#39;t related to that at all .The skin so tight gets so tight and sore that I can barely walk. The skin is broken like it&#39;s thin and very fragile. My left leg is  significantly worse than the right leg in the calf area (it&#39;s two times the size as the right calf).  Still have edema I can&#39;t hardly wear shoes. At the end of the day, it&#39;s worse, but still in the morning now they are still swollen.

                                                Patient reports tear in esophagus on 3/24/21 in the evening whenever she felt sick to her stomach. She did not feel well, drank one beer, and ate a packet of tuna. She continued to not feel well and felt the food did not go down correctly, so she reached into her throat and noticed blood. She called her doctor and the doctor recommended monitoring for increased bleeding. Later that night, she reports not feeling well again, made herself throw up, and noticed the vomit was all blood. The patient then called 9-1-1, and presents to the hospital. During the hospital visit she noticed that she saw &#39;blood clots about the size of a quarter&#39; when she went to the bathroom. Patient reports the hospital gave her 4 pints of blood, 4 bags of &#39;yellow stuff&#39; (patient assumes its plasma), protonix, antibiotics, and NS. Patient was in the ICU and reports being in the hospital for about 5 days total, whenever the doctor recommended being put on hospice. The patient did want to be put on hospice and wants to be treated, so she contacted her heart doctor and is waiting on an appointment with him on the 28th of April. Patient reports that doctor told her that she &#39;needs a new heart&#39;, but that she is not a good candidate, and that the Dr. told her this just a day or two ago. Patient reports that she did not know it was a tear in her throat (esophagus) until they &#34;stuck a scope down there&#34;.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included hormone replacement therapy: bioidenticals, and surgery. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) dose, start therapy date were not reported 1 administered for prophylactic vaccination. Vaccination site was unknown. The batch number was not reported. The Company is unable to perform follow-up to request batch/lot numbers. No concomitant medications were reported. On an unspecified date, after two week of vaccination, the patient had a brain fistula which was considered as a stroke because it was a bleeding not a clot. She had really bad headache and was throwing up all night (vomiting). She called her primary health care physician they told her to visit hospital. First she went to the community hospital in her local city from where she was transferred to another hospital for surgery. The surgery occurred in first week of April. She was currently hospitalized. Number of days in hospital were unspecified. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the headache, vomiting, brain fistula, brain bleed and stroke was not reported.

The patient had no known allergies.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805029, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 16-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included Centrum Multi-Gummies for Women.  On an unspecified date in MAR-2021 the patient began to experience slowly progressive shortness of breath; on 01-APR-2021 she had left upper quadrant pain. On 03-APR-2021 the patient presented to the emergency room.  Laboratory data included: Pulmonary Angiogram/CT Chest - abnormal and computerised tomogram abdomen/pelvis at 09:37, showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs. Small volume perisplenic hemorrhage and small volume pneumoperitoneum in the pelvis or findings concerning for spontaneous splenic rupture and moderately enlarged spleen. Additional CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast at 23:05 showed: Small to moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, slightly increased since the earlier study. There is definitely new blood adjacent to the liver. The hemorrhage adjacent to the spleen appears similar to the earlier study. Due to the timing of the scans with relation to the contrast injection, the physician could not confirm a splenic laceration, although it was suspected to be the source of hemorrhage. Small amount of mesenteric blood was slightly increased. Continuous heparin infusion was started for bilateral pulmonary embolism. On 04-APR-2021, an inferior vena cava filter was placed and patient was vaccinated with Acthib (HIB Vaccine), Bexsero (meningococcal vaccine) and Prevnar (pneumococcal vaccine) in anticipation of splenectomy. On 07-APR-2021, a laparoscopic splenectomy was performed. The spleen was evaluated by pathology which reported that organizing blood clot on surface was consistent with rupture. No evidence of malignancy was reported.  The patient was also treated with anticoagulant therapy (dates unspecified). The patient remained inpatient while recovering from surgery.  On 12-APR-2021, the patient was transitioned to rivaroxaban for therapeutic anticoagulation. Patient remained hospitalized as of 12-APR-2021.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from pulmonary embolism, haemoperitoneum, mesenteric haemorrhage, splenic haemorrhage, splenic rupture, splenic thrombosis, splenomegaly, dyspnoea, abdominal pain upper, and left upper quadrant/abdominal pain. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, Disability Or Permanent Damage).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old female patient of unspecified ethnicity was found to  have pulmonary embolism and spontaneous splenic rupture 18 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  No concurrent illness and medical history reported. Emergency room consult for slowly progressive shortness of breath and left upper quadrant pain that starts on an unspecified date after vaccination.   Pulmonary Angiogram/CT Chest showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs; small volume perisplenic hemorrhage and small volume pneumoperitoneum in the pelvis; moderately enlarged spleen with findings concerning for spontaneous splenic rupture.  CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast showed small to moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, slightly increased since the earlier study; definite new blood adjacent to the liver.  Continuous heparin infusion was started; vaccinated with Acthib (HIB Vaccine), Bexsero (meningococcal vaccine) and Prevnar (pneumococcal vaccine).  Laparoscopic splenectomy was done 22 days after vaccination; pathology report is consistent with splenic rupture with no evidence of malignancy.  The patient was shifted to rivaroxaban.  No other details reported. The information available regarding splenic rupture precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  Based on the information that is available, the event pulmonary embolism is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism; considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, the potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.

                                                I am on menopausal replacement estrogen and take progesterone a few times a year to force a &#34;period&#34;. While on progesterone I dont have bleeding until I stop the progesterone I got the shot and had my period while ON the. progesterone..  Usually because I am menopausal I have 2 days of light panty liner bleeding.  I was taking my progesterone (May 18-may 28) and got the vaccine on May 21.  By May 25th I started a heavy period with significant bleeding and clotting.  The heaviest period I ever remember in my life.  It was heavy flowing . while in the shower or on the toilet.  Very strange never experienced anything like it before.  other symptoms cramping etc were normal level based on the bleeding.  Day #6 still have some bleeding but mostly over at this time.  As a pharmacist I am aware of other possible clotting disorders so I am watching and looking for other adverse events within the next few weeks to assure I have no other problems.  So far besides exhaustion it seems like the  vaginal/endometrial bleeding is  the only issue.

She presented to the ER today, June 12 2021, and was found to have a right calf DVT as well as multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Her ER visit today also shows newly diagnosed metastatic lesions in the liver and a colonic mass.  It is not clear if any of the thromboembolic disease is secondary to the Covid vaccine at all, or all related to the new metastatic disease.  Decision was made to report this event due to her reported timing of symptoms and patient request to report as well.  She is being transferred to Medical Center for hospitalization and treatment.

I had a full hysterectomy in 1999, 21 years ago. Alarmed. I took myself to urgent care. I was tested for a Urinary Tract Infection and a Yeast Infection by pelvic examination. Both tests were NEGATIVE. I was prescribed Diflucan 2 doses 150mg each to take 3 days apart. I discontinued the Diflucan upon learning of the negative result for yeast. April 10, 2021 I was still experiencing Vaginal bleeding upon waking up. April 11, 2021 the spotting had ceased.

I was having some blood when blowing my nose  and remember seeing some small, hard balls which I now realize were clots. I did not go to the doctor because my back was very bad and  I was in a lot of pain and  I had an upcoming appointment with my doctor. I believe that the symptoms resolved after 2 or 3 days and I did not even mention it to my doctor when I saw him.  I felt  a lot of pain in my leg, but this is probably due to my ongoing  sciatica/radiculopathy /bursitis problems that I experience.

I proceeded to have blood and blood clots come out my urethra very urgently. I had abdominal pain and pressure. I proceeded to need to urinate blood and blood clots for approximately 4 hours urgently. I could not go far from the bathroom without having to return quickly to the toilet. I wet myself several times. The clots stopped coming around 1:30 PM. I proceeded to have to have no control over urination urge and could not leave the bathroom. Around approximately 2:00 PM I could leave the bathroom without fear of wetting myself. I continued to have a small amount of a mix of blood and normal urine passing for another hour or so.

After 4 days of that I got a really super heavy period with cramping and blood clots in my menustral flow.  It was a horrible period, while the one after the surgery in Feb was very light.  Dizzy and fatique  10 days after shot on the April 8 I took a fall from a chair outside, and from Thrusday to the Saturday  10th I ended up in the Emergency room with a concussion and head symptoms including dizziness and nose bleeds.  This was from a simple fall, and i suspect the covid shot might have caused complications after the fall with additional swelling and brusing.

                                                BLOOD CLOT IN LEFT THIGH; SWELLING; FATIGUE; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 55 year old female. Initial information received on 13-APR-2021, processed along with information received via telephone communication on 15-APR-2021 The patient&#39;s weight was 100 pounds, and height was 152.4 centimeters. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included progressive multiple sclerosis, swelling of the left leg and foot, and non smoker, and other pre-existing medical conditions included the patient had no known drug allergies. the patient was not a pregnant at the time of reporting. The patient had no family history of thrombosis, no prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1808609, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 22-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included baclofen, escitalopram oxalate, and risedronate sodium (received 2 doses and stopped after the event).  The patient&#39;s husband reported that in MAR-2021, the patient had symptoms of fatigue.  On 23-MAR-2021, the patient had swelling and fatigue.  Her fatigue was resolved on 24-MAR-2021 and swelling was resolving.  On 05-APR-2021, the patient developed left thigh swelling. On 06-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s swelling was not going down and she visited her primary care physician. The physician could not determine the cause of swelling (left thigh very noticeable clot swollen around where clot was located) and the physician suspected clot and performed an AD dimer (fibrin degradation) test to look for potential blood clotting. The patient also had a venous duplex ultrasound that showed left leg clot.  At 19:00 on the same day, the patient&#39;s physician advised to visit emergency room and determined there was a clot on left thigh and she was prescribed Eliquis Starter Pack (apixaban) for 3 months treatment and recommended another scan in several months. On 06-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s vitals were reported as blood pressure 124/70 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm and oxygen saturation of 99%. Laboratory data included prothrombin time (PT) 13.4 sec , International normalized ratio (INR) 1.2 and  activated partial thromboplastin time  (APTT) 34.8 sec. (Normal range not reported for all) d-dimer and platelet count results were not available and Covid-19 test was not performed. Body max index was 19.5 kg/m2. On an unspecified date the patient was feeling better but had not recovered from the event. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from fatigue on 24-MAR-2021, had not recovered from blood clot in left thigh, and recovering from swelling. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This case concerns a 55-year- old female subject, immobile due to progressive multiple sclerosis who developed a left thigh swelling 12 days after Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered intramuscularly for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included body max index of 19.5 kg/m2, progressive multiple sclerosis and swelling of the left leg and foot. She is a non-smoker, no known drug allergies, no family history of thrombosis, or prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Symptoms started with swelling of the left thigh and fatigue. The fatigue resolved the next day. The patient&#39;s swelling in the left thigh was not going down and she visited her primary care physician who checked her D-dimer dimer (level not known to patient) and scheduled a venous duplex ultrasound that showed a clot in the left thigh.  Her vital signs were blood pressure of  124/70 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm and oxygen saturation of 99%. and she was prescribed Eliquis Starter Pack (apixaban) for 3 months treatment and recommended another scan in several months. Laboratory data included PT 13.4 sec, INR 1.2 and APTT 34.8 sec. D-dimer and platelet count results were not available and Covid-19 test was not performed. The patient is feeling better but had not recovered from blood clot in the left thigh, and is recovering from the swelling. Given underlying progressive multiple sclerosis with immobility and preexisting swelling of the left leg and foot on the same lower extremity, the clotting of the left thigh is considered not related to Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Additional information has been requested.

I went to my PCP and he measured my legs and sent me to hospital because he said that it looked like I had blood clots. While in the ER, they started performing tests, and they found a DVT in the left leg and to PE&#39;s, one on each lung. I was under observation because I was given Lovonex to thin my blood. While in the hospital the swelling started to go down and that is when I was discharged. I am now seeing a vein specialist and a pulmonary doctor. I was given Eloquis 5mg 2x per day. I am still having pain and swelling in both legs, but the leg with the DVT is worse. It is very hard to walk around because my left leg will swell a lot.

And then a few days later, my oxygen started dropping down to the 70s and my body temp dropped to 95.1- I was passing out at home, although I didnt realize that is what was happening, I would just wake up and an hour would have passed and I didnt even realized I was out, and this kept happening especially during the time that my temperature kept dropping below 95. I rushed to the emergancy room which after I had been there a long time- they found that I had a  *************** *********BLOOD CLOT- MASSIVE********************** A SADDLE BLOOD CLOT ************** IN  LUNGS They immediately admitted me, and immediately started me on Lovonox and Coumidin I am currently on oygen and I will have to take Coumidin for the rest of my life. Due to the size of the clot (5-6 inches) they were concerned about my heart, the clot caused a strained on the right side of my heart, so they put my on a different beta blocker Coreg to slow my heart rate down, I will also have to take this medication for the rest of my life

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included right leg deep vein thrombosis (2011), arthroscopic meniscus surgery (2011), and superficial thrombophlebitis on left leg from mid-calf up to mid-thigh (AUG-2020), and concurrent conditions included factor V Leiden mutation. (2011). The patient was not on oral contraceptive pills. No immediate family had history of clots. A family member on mom&#39;s side has had clots. She had right leg deep vein thrombosis in 2011 after arthroscopic meniscus surgery on right knee, followed by long car ride. She was diagnosed with Factor V Leiden mutation in 2011 at the time of that clot. She was on warfarin for about 4 months then taken off. She did well for almost a decade. In last AUG-2020 had a superficial thrombophlebitis in left leg from mid-calf up to mid-thigh. She was Xarelto (rivaroxaban), monitored with ultrasound, taken off on 15/17-JAN-2021. The patient was previously treated with warfarin for right leg deep vein thrombosis, and rivaroxaban for superficial thrombophlebitis on left leg from mid-calf up to mid-thigh.  The patient received COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1808980), administered on 30-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 30-MAR-2021, the patient felt good with slight cough on the day. She experienced achy by 7 PM, went to bed, then started getting the chills. At 2 AM on 31-MAR-2021 she had fever of 102 F.  The laboratory appointment on Thursday, 01-APR-2021 unrelated laboratory was ordered.  On 01-APR-2021, she was walking from parking lot to a building and was very short of breath. On 03-APR-2021, she was going up one flight of stairs, and felt severely short of breath and had dry cough. On 4-APR-2021, she experienced pain between shoulder blades in back. Oxygen saturation at home was 93-94% on RA while resting. On 4-APR-2021, she went to emergency room at a computerized tomogram (CT) of chest with contrast around at 6:30 PM showed massive pulmonary embolism. The right chamber the heart was enlarged due to the blockage from the embolism. Blood levels for &#34;stress on heart&#34; came back high. The patient went to cath lab for pulmonary angiogram on 4-APR-2021 and had EKOS catheter direct thrombolysis. She was started on heparin and transitioned to Xarelto (rivaroxaban) on 5-APR-2021.  She was on blood thinners and the left lung was cleaned up and removed. The clot was still on the right lung, unable may or may not be cleared. The patient was discharged on 06-APR-2021. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days. On 04-APR-2021, Platelet count was 181 (normal range 140-440), on 5-APR-2021, Platelet count was 160 (normal range 140-440), on 6-APR-2021 Platelet count was 154 (normal range 140-440). At the time of this massive PE event, the patient was not on any anticoagulation and since the event, had been restarted on Xarelto, and she was told she needs to continue for life. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from pulmonary embolism, and the outcome of feeling achy, chills, fever and slight cough was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: A 57-year-old woman with a history of Factor V Leiden deficiency (off anticoagulation for several months) and previous DVT 10 years ago was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism four days after vaccine. The same day after vaccine, the patient reported chills and a 102 F fever. Two days after vaccine she experienced shortness of the breath and four days after vaccine, the shortness of breath became worsened with pain in the back between the shoulder blades. The patient went to the hospital and was diagnosed with massive pulmonary embolism with enlargement of the right side of the heart. She underwent direct catheter thrombolysis in the cath lab and was started on Xarelto. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days and is doing well. Although there is a close temporal relationship, the history of Factor V Leiden with previous DVT provides plausible alternate explanation for the event.

I woke up with a swollen juggler vein that ended up being a blood clot, 10 days later my arm was swollen up twice the size of my leg, the juggler was still swollen. I call the urgent care nurse they said to go to ER. I went to hospital got a CAT scan and ultrasound, I was given a shot of warfarin that was supposed to last for 12 hours. I went home and the next morning instead of going to the hospital, I went to hospital and they found 2 blood clots in brain, arm and leg and neck. I have had no history of blood clots and this all happened after the J&amp;J vaccine. They did a procedure where they tried to put a balloon to relieve the pressure. The blood clots in the brain cannot be removed because of their location and it would be dangerous to remove and I am on blood thinners for the rest of my life. Multiple blood clots in body brain, arm and shoulder.

                                                April  14, my sister was transported to hospital feeling faint and numbness in her left leg. As a result, she was admitted and treated for: ? blood pressure readings as low as 82/43, 76/50 while standing ? blood clots on her heart that traveled to her brain that were causing multiple mini strokes ? 95% blockage in her right heart vessel which required a stent  ? 50% and 60% blockage in other chambers that will require attention She was given heparin and then switched to a different blood thinner to dissolve the clots.  she was discharged on April 23rd with instructions to followup with her cardiologist and neurologist.

CT-PE showing submassive saddle pulmonary embolism with several large emboli in bilateral upper and lower pulmonary arteries.  Transferred from outside hospital to another Hospital.  Started on IV Heparin  infusion with transition to Enoxaparin.  Had significant drop in platelet count and developed peripheral thrombi in all extremities.  Concerned for HIT at that time, and review of CDC recommendations for COVID vaccine-associated thrombi, patient transitioned to Fondaparinux and remains on at present.

Initial information was received on 27-APR-2021, with additional information obtained via telephone follow up from the physician on 29-APR-2021. The patient&#39;s specific height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included fatty liver, and the patient was overweight.  Family history was significant for a deep venous thrombosis treated with anticoagulants in the patient&#39;s mother, and a history of unspecified blood clots in her maternal grandmother. The patient was on no medications, including no estrogen containing pharmaceutical products or supplements. She has never been exposed to heparin. The patient had no history of COVID-19 infection. The patient received COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number not reported) on 12-APR-2021. The batch number has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported. On 18-APR-2021, 6 days after receiving vaccine, the patient developed a headache. On 23-APR-2021, 11 days after receiving vaccine, the patient presented to the hospital with complaints of headache and abdominal pain. COVID test in the emergency room was negative. On 23-APR-2021, imaging of the head and abdomen revealed:  left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, left internal jugular vein thrombosis.  The patient also had thrombocytopenia, with platelet count on presentation 22,000 (units not provided).  D-dimer was elevated at &gt;12.8 (units not provided), Fibrinogen was low at 103 (units not provided), HIT antibody test by ELISA was positive, and physicians made the diagnosis of Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT). The patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Treatment medications included argatroban, steroids and IVIG.  Following treatment, the platelet count remained low, with a nadir of 17,000. On 27-Apr-2021, she underwent thrombectomy and thrombolysis of the intra-abdominal clots. This was performed due to the potential for portal hypertension in the future, given the extent of the thromboses. Repeat CT venogram of the head on an unknown date, revealed resolution of the sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis; the internal jugular thrombosis persisted. The patient has steadily improved since the thrombectomy. Abdominal pain and headache are improving.  Platelet count has steadily risen, to 138,000 on 29- Apr-2021. Her transaminases were slightly elevated on admission and have not worsened, and she appears to have no organ dysfunction. A dialysis catheter had been placed in the event she would require plasmapheresis, but this was never used.  Additional laboratory data included: IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-COVID-2 nucleocapsid protein positive; Protein C deficiency negative; Protein S deficiency negative; Homocysteine level (NR: not provided) negative.  Serotonin release assay, anticardiolipin panel and Factor V Leiden tests were pending. The plan was to transition the patient to an oral anticoagulant and remove the dialysis catheter on 30-APR-2021, with a possible discharge on 01-MAY-2021. The patient had not recovered from left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, and left internal jugular vein thrombosis, and was recovering from left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, headache and abdominal pain.  This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).  Additional information was received from physician on 29-APR-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into the case narrative: patient history, disease course, events, outcome, lab data, concomitant drugs.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This spontaneous report concerns a 58-year-old female patient who experienced left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, left internal jugular vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, headache and abdominal pain, 11 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S.  The patient is overweight and there is a family history of clots in her mother and maternal grandmother. Imaging of the head and abdomen revealed multiple sites of thrombus formation, platelet count was 22,000, D-dimer was elevated at &gt;12.8 (units not provided), Fibrinogen was low at 103 (units not provided),  and HIT antibody test by ELISA was positive. Physicians made the diagnosis of  Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT).  The patient was treated with argatroban, IVIG, and steroids.  Platelet counts remained low and she underwent thrombectomy of the intra-abdominal thrombi.  Following thrombectomy the platelet counts rose and abdominal pain began to improve.  Lab data included a positive test for IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-COVID-2 nucleocapsid protein.   Based on the evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

Initial information was processed along with additional information on 04-JUN-2021. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included vertebral dissection of right vertebral artery in 2000, hiatal hernia, chemotherapy, radiation, vertebral tear, 5 years of cancer drugs and stroke-like symptoms, and concurrent conditions included 2 times breast cancer survivor, non-smoker, and sulfa drug allergy cause night time swells in mouth and tongue. The patient experienced pain in base of spine when treated with pegfilgrastim for breast cancer. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 042A21A expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 in total administered at left arm on 09-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, and pravastatin. On an unspecified date in 2021, the patient had elevated lactate level of 2.5 (unit unspecified) and was 1.5 (unit unspecified) on repeat and also had elevated chloride level was 110 (unit unspecified). The patient was dehydrated. On 09-APR-2021, the patient had left torso and both arms itching for 4 hours, started within half hour after received vaccine. On 10-APR-2021, the patient experienced pain in base of spine, which was exactly the same as when she received Neulasta during a previous cancer treatment regimen and patient experienced headache for 3 days. On 21-APR-2021, the patient woke up with left side numbness from head to toes, feeling like being choked as if like an allergy, felt heaviness in chest, within one hour patient felt shaky and like she was going to faint, felt dizziness/lightheaded and laid down for 2 days, later felt like her eyes were going to pop out of her head, was putting Refresh eye drops in her eyes and was having problems focusing her eyes (vision disturbances). The patient was only able to stay up for 2 hours, then had lie down because felt sick and weakness and had sever fatigue. All like stroke-like symptoms. The symptoms started on 21-APR-2021. The patient went to emergency room on 24-APR-2021 and discharged on same day. On 28-APR-2021, the patient had computed tomography scan and showed occluded right Vertebral artery. The patient had a computed tomography scan one year ago and there was no occlusion. They did a computed tomography scan that showed a same occlusion as on 28-APR-2021. On 28-APR-2021, the patient had stenosis of right carotid artery. The patient went back to emergency room on 15-MAY-2021 because she was throwing up blood and dizzy and she was told to go to emergency room. On 11-JUN-2021, she was going to see a stroke neurologist specialist a neurosurgeon 16-JUN-2021. On 15-MAY-2021, the patient went to emergency room and they re-performed a computed tomography scan and it showed an occluded right vertebral artery just as first scan did. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from left torso and both arms itching on 09-APR-2021, had not recovered from pain in base of spine, and stroke-like symptoms, and the outcome of heavy feeling in chest, feeling like being choked, felt shaky, felt sick, dehydration and throwing up blood was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This spontaneous report received from a patient concerned a 58-year-old female who experienced stroke-like symptoms and occluded vertebral artery 15 days after vaccine. Past medical history included vertebral dissection of right vertebral artery in 2000, hiatal hernia, chemotherapy, radiation, vertebral tear, 5 years of cancer drugs and stroke-like symptoms, and concurrent conditions included 2 times breast cancer survivor. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, and pravastatin. On day 12 after vaccine, the patient woke up with left side stroke-like symptoms. The patient went to emergency room on day 15 and discharged on same day. On day 19, the patient had computed tomography scan and showed occluded right Vertebral artery. The patient had a computed tomography scan one year ago and there was no occlusion. She was discharged and evaluated by stroke neurologist. There is no report of thrombocytopenia to suggest thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Given the pre-existing history of vertebral artery dissection, there is a plausible alternative explanation for the event.

                                                As described above, about 13 hours after the vaccine I woke up at 3 am with a severe pounding and constant headache. I was also extremely fatigued so much so that I did not get out of bed or do anything all day 4/11 and didn&#39;t start feeling better until the following Monday. Then I hear in the news about the 6 adverse reactions and the J&amp;J vaccine shutdown, possibility for blood clots etc. and to keep an eye out for various symptoms over next 2-3 weeks! It was stressful enough registering and not being able to secure the Moderna or Pfizer so I just said ok and got the J&amp;J. Now I have something else to worry about. Heart and blood clot issues are in my family. I do not take any blood thinners and don&#39;t plan to. But now am questioning whether I should have gotten the vaccine at all. I have had enough chronic illness in my life. In fact, December 2019 I was in another town taking care of my mother and her subsequent death when I caught someone&#39;s cough. Urgent care diagnosed me with pneumonia, fluid in the lungs, put me on course of antibiotics. I couldn&#39;t breathe, needed a nebulizer etc. They called me and said it was not pneumonia or flu a or b (I get the shot every year) and to go to the ER if it got worse. I couldn&#39;t eat or move much for three weeks and breathing was extremely difficult. I had to get a nebulizer. Eventually went away. Then in March Covid 19 became official. When I tested for Covid 19 here at a state site in 2021, I tested negative.

                                                Eight days after receiving the vaccine, my wife developed shortness of breath, headache, fatigue, and unusual vision problems. She was taken to the emergency room on 4/15 where she underwent a battery of tests (see details below). She was admitted to the hospital (where she currently is) and was diagnosed with blood clots in the lungs and two strokes in the area of the brain that affects vision. She then underwent ultrasound tests of her legs and carotid artery, which were negative for signs of blood clots. Although my wife&#39;s symptoms are different than the symptoms of others that led to the vaccine pause, her doctors strongly encouraged us to report it to the VAERS. My wife had no underlying or pre existing conditions that would lead to blood clots in her lungs, and stroke. After extensive testing there is no evidence that the blood clots in her lungs as well as the clot/clots that went to her brain initiated in her legs. They believe that some sort of &#34;event&#34; would have had to happen to cause these blood clots, and the only unusual thing in the time frame of this condition is the vaccine. As I mentioned earlier, my wife is still hospitalized.

I called my urologist and was seen on 04-14-2021. My blood platelets were extremely low. I was then referred to see a hematologist who sent me to the hospital. I was admitted at Hospital where they performed lab work, MRI&#39;s and CT scans. I stayed two days at the hospital. The hematologist who saw me said I have thrombocytopenia. Other tests were also performed and they checked me for stroke and I did not have a stroke. I am concerned due to my thrombocytopenia, if I get cut, I will bleed a lot and this is interfering with my job and to carry out my daily functions.   I am still not recovered and my platelets are low. I still have to follow-up with my PCP and my hematologist has to check my bone marrow as the next step of treatment.

Pain subsided in about an hour after resting. On April 28th, I experienced vaginal bleeding.  I awoke to a dry cough and felt the leakage.  The blood was bright red and I&#39;d estimate 4-6 Tablespoons.  I feel light-headed, concerned, but otherwise fine.

I was diagnosed with severe sepsis and colitis.  Although I was diagnosed with sepsis, I never had a fever and all blood cultures came back negative.  Before I was released, I went into uncontrolled atrial fibrillation.  I never had any history of colitis or atrial fibrillation prior to this.  No one can explain why there was no fever or pathogen detected.

Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: Biopsy soft tissue (NR: not provided) unknown, Pathology test (NR: not provided) unknown. On 08-APR-2021, the subject died from possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient died of possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, brain compression, brain stem haemorrhage, brain stem syndrome, cerebral haemorrhage, hemiplegia, seizure, haemorrhagic stroke and continued to bleed on 08-APR-2021, had not recovered from headache, vomiting, and platelet count decreased, and the outcome of biopsy soft tissue and brain scan abnormal was not reported. This report was serious (Death, and Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged). This case, involving the same patient is linked to 20210441454.  Additional information was received on 24-MAY-2021. Following information was added and incorporated into the narrative. Additional events of haemorrhagic stroke and continued to bleed were added, seriousness of events platelet count, vomiting, and headache was updated, additional reference numbers were added, additional vaccination date added in narrative, labeling updated, and course of event and laboratory data updated. It was determined that Manufacturer Case Number 20210441454 was a duplicate of this case. All relevant information regarding this case will be submitted under Manufacturer Case Number 20210500861. Upon review, the following information was amended: events biopsy soft tissue and brain scan abnormal was updated from non-serious to serious as this was on the earlier VAERS report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V2: Additional information received regarding updates in seriousness of events, labeling, course of events, case identifier; and additional evets of hemorrhagic stroke and &#34;continued to  bleed&#34; did not alter prior assessment.    This fatal spontaneous report (VAERS ID 1244328) concerned a 59- year- old female who experienced vomiting, headache and seizures and was hospitalized for brain compression, brain stem hemorrhage, brain stem syndrome, cerebral hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, hemiplegia, possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 16 days after Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient was pre-diabetic with no known allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. Biopsy soft tissue was done (results not reported) and brain scan showed multi-focal brain bleeds and increased compression of brain; the patient underwent neurosurgery.  The platelet count  was decreased (result not reported) and received platelet transfusion. Follow-up scan next day showed increased/continued bleeding and brain stem injury and a day later she died from possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. Although the  subject&#39;s pre-diabetic status may have contributed, based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration - BC) and considering the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination (BC Criteria level 5), the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: POSSIBLE CEREBRAL VENOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS
