In a few minutes she was able to sit upright in the chair. EMS was called and she later went to hospital for further evaluation.

Her symptoms included dizziness, syncope, stomach ache, foaming at the mouth, vision disturbances.  911 was called and paramedics arrived..  Her vital signs were all normal.  Patient did not wish to go to hospital, and her mother took her home.  Other pertinent information is that patient has a history of seizures and had been off of her seizure medication for 4 weeks.  I believe that I understood her mother to say that her neurologist knew she was getting the vaccine today.  Patient reported no allergies to any other vaccine, medication, or other.

Within a minute, her skin color became pinkish, and breathing was detected.  She became aware of her environment.  While we waited for the paramedics, her breathing and skin came back to normal.  She reported of no breakfast or lunch before getting the vaccine.  We gave her some chocolate and water.  Her family later reported that she passed out after a flu shot a few years back.  Her family refused to take her to hospital after the paramedic&#39;s advice.

                                                Patient fainted upon receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. They were in a chair in the waiting area and did not fall or injure themselves. We gave her no food or drink, took her blood pressure and stayed with her. She then fainted again at which point we called for a paramedic. They evaluated her and took her blood pressure again and her blood sugar. She then recovered and walked out of the store unassisted. She did not go to the ER but chose to go to an urgent care center I believe.

While assisting the pt into a reclining position she briefly lost consciousness; total duration 3-5 seconds.  She regained consciousness immediately once she was flat and her feet were elevated.  I monitored her blood several times and it was normal.  Over the course of 30-40 minutes she recovered and left the pharmacy.

She had pale blue lips, ringing in ears, changes in vision/blurry vision, she felt dizzy/light headed. The symptoms began improving at roughly 12:10 and had almost completely resolved by 12:15. I kept the patient for an additional 15 minutes for monitoring. I counseled patient on what to do if they felt as though they were going to pass out. I provided a cold compress for the back of the patient&#39;s neck, and had ammonia inhalant on standby but didn&#39;t have to use to help keep patient conscious.  By 12:30 the patient was feeling completely normal again. Her mom/stepmom was with her and was able to drive her home. I asked them to reach out in case of any other symptoms developed.

She came to within a minute and was aware of her surroundings.  She stated she felt ok but her head hurt from hitting the floor.  We gave her an ice pack for her head.  After about 5 minutes  she got back in the chair and was here until EMS arrived.  While they were there questioning her she lost consciousness again two separate times and displayed potential seizure activity again. They put her on the stretcher and took her to the hospital.  She reported she has not had seizures in the past but has fainted from a vaccination in the past but was younger and received 3 immunizations.

I couldn&#39;t get a reading on the BP monitor at that time as it was too low to read and she couldn&#39;t move her limbs. While waiting  for EMS she could breathe fine, I could feel a faint pulse, but I had to keep taping her leg and talking to her to keep her awake. She was able to tell us her name and how many fingers I was holding up. I kept trying to get her to squeeze my hand, but I could only feel the tips of her fingers twitching and the whole time she was unable to move her feet/toes. I was able to look at her HR on her watch right before EMS arrived and it was at 62 and by that time her body temp seemed to be back to normal as her Mom said she felt cool and clammy. The BP reading by EMS was 100/60 and they tried to get her to stand but she couldn&#39;t and she still kept wanting to roll her head back and sleep.

A cold compress was placed on the back of her neck and a pillow was placed under her head.  9-1-1 was called.  When EMS responded, she had normal blood pressure and blood sugar, but was still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;.  She was place on a stretcher and taken to the ambulance, but did not get transported.  She had a family member pick her up from the clinic.  She was able to walk from the ambulance to the car on her own.

I ran over, and as soon as I got there she started to convulse, therefore appeared to be having a seizure. I help her fiance get her onto the ground safely and placed her on her side, then called for my tech to call 911. The seizure/convulsions only seemed to last 10-15 seconds. She then came to, and was disoriented. Then she felt nausous, and threw up a small amount. The paramedics arrived, checked her out. She said she was felt fine, and refused to go with them to the hospital.

                                                On 4/8/2021 I developed a headache after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I took the next few days easy, and laid in bed for the majority of the weekend. On 4/10/2021 I left my residence to get dinner and noticed I was short of breath just walking from the building to my car. The shortness of breath worsened over the next few days. On 4/13/2021 I called a clinic and told them I had been short of breath and they directed me to the ER. I arrived to the ER around 2:30 in the afternoon. They ordered a chest x-ray and ran a test to determine if I could have a blood clot. The test came back with results indicating I could have a blood clot, so they did a chest CT and an MRI. The chest CT showed a blood clot in my left pulmonary artery. They prescribed a blood thinner, told me to stop taking oral birth control, and discharged me.

                                                Patient was given the injection and then she started feeling dizzy right after administration.  She sat with her head against the wall and dropped her phone and passed out for just a moment.  She had a slight tremor/shake for a few seconds. (I did not witness, unsure exactly what happened or how long)   She came too fairly quickly after being yelled at, are you ok?  When she regained consciousness she complained of being hot all over for a bit.  We gave her ice packs to cool down.  She felt hot for maybe 10-15 minutes, but felt relief with the ice packs.  She also drank some sips of cool water which seemed to help her cool down.

About ten to fifteen minutes after we left (in total, about 25-30 minutes post-vaccination) I felt so sick (nausea, sweating, chills) that I couldn&#39;t keep my head up. I briefly fainted, but I woke up about two minutes later. My mom finished driving me home, and my condition improved with rest over the following hours.

                                                Patient briefly slumped over and appeared to pass out shortly after receiving the vaccine.  This only lasted about 30 sec to a minute before she became responsive again.  Patient reported that this has happened multiple times before when she has received vaccines and was anxious (crying) prior to receiving the vaccine.  An initial blood pressure reading was 100/64 at 12:50.   She was then able to sit up in the chair and began feeling a little better, asking for water.  A second reading five minutes later was 94/54.  The patient then chose to drink some water and eat some candy she had brought and this seemed to make her feel better.  Lightheadness/weakness was the only symptom she complained of.  By 1:03, 15 minutes after the vaccine, she reported &#34;feeing much better.&#34;  I continued to observe her, seated, for 15 more minutes and a final blood pressure reading at that time was 115/74.  Patient reported feeling normal again and went home.

                                                Patient passed out and we could not get her to come to.  She was taken to the hospital by ambulance.  Her blood pressure was very low.  She became very weak.  She had a horrible and very scary reaction to the vaccine. She was in the hall face down when we found her and we could not get her to wake up.  When she did come to, we could not calm her. Patient normally lives by herself and luckily was with us when this happened.  We can&#39;t imagine what would have happened if she was alone.

                                                Two days after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson  vaccine, the patient (myself) awoke in the middle of the night with painful cramps in the lower abdomen. She got up in the morning to some blood in her underwear. The next day, she awoke to an immense of amount of blood coming out of her vagina to the point it was dripping down her leg. For context, the patient received the Mirena IUD several months ago and had not had a period since receiving the IUD, besides spotting. This is why these events were startling since she had not had a period in several months and this immense bleeding and cramping  was abnormal to her. As of today (4/15/2021), she has been experiencing heavy bleeding for 5 days. Again, this is very abnormal to her since she has not experienced a period for several months.

My apartment-mate who came with me for the shot laid me down on the floor until I could sit up again without feeling dizzy (~15 min). I also had pretty serious bruising at the injection site for ~9 days following the injection and my arm was swollen and painful (although this is a pretty normal side-effect).

Ten days after the vaccine I was in the shower and a large blood clot came out of my nose. It was a large clot about the size of a quarter and there was no other blood with it. The clot came out of my left nostril but it was not like a nose bleed. I went to the Urgent Care but they did not do tests.

I got up to shower and get some food as I was going upstairs I grew very faint,  my vision grew black and my hearing faded. I was able to make it to my bed then ask for some help. After taking Tylenol, my fever began to be very hot instead of chills. I was able to fall asleep until I woke back up to chills again and taking more medicine.  The next morning, I was still dizzy when I walked around but the fever was gone. I was still very fatigued which made me unable to go to class or work. Day 3 I was back to my normal self.

                                                I felt fine immediately following my shot, as well as the rest of the day. Overnight I started developing a fever which I knew was normal. However at 3 am I got up to use the restroom. I was sitting on the toilet and then next thing I remember I was on the floor with my face down. I passed out, and I am unsure how long I was out for, before I realized what happened. I have never passed out before, and do not have a history of doing so, so it is unclear why I passed out randomly.

                                                History of Present Illness     This is a 22-year-old female who was previously healthy with no significant past medical history presenting to the emergency department after a syncopal event.  She was getting her COVID-19 shot today (Johnson Johnson).  After her shot she was texting on the phone with her mom, felt slightly dizzy and the next thing she remembers was lying on the ground.  Witnesses reported that she syncopized and had some convulsive like behavior afterwards.  She was not postictal or incontinent however.  She reportedly hit the front of her forehead on the left side.  She denies any chest pain, abdominal pain, hemoptysis, recent surgeries, immobilization or recent travel.  She reports that when she woke up her hands felt a little bit tingly.  When the fire department arrived they found her to be bradycardic however by the time the medics arrived her heart rate had resolved.  Her blood sugar was 110 on the scene.  Medics noted that she was orthostatic on the scene as well.   She currently is feeling well, has no complaints.  States that she has gotten dizzy before in the past with COVID vaccines.

                                                patient experienced a wave of nausea, light-headedness, and briefly lost consciousness during vaccination. When she lost consciousness, I supported her weight and she remained in the chair for approx 15 seconds until she regained consciousness. I  had two technicians to assist in calling a code white and documenting the event. At 10:43 am, patient lost consciousness and regained 15 seconds later. Once I knew the patient was stable enough to support her own weight, i held her hands to make sure she was not going to lose consciuosness again. I administered an ice pack and a cool towel at 10:45 am. Code white was responded to by associates from AP and manager. I observed the patient for 15 minutes, and AP associate observed for another 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. The patient recovered fully and had a friend drive her home.

She felt faint and let us know so we laid her down elevated her legs, and she fell out for a few seconds she continued to have a strong pulse.   We gave her an ice pack and water after she came back and had her lay down for 10 more minutes.  I checked with her a few days later she said she had fever and chills 8 hours after the vaccine but felt better.

                                                I received the shot at 14:30, in which medical staff in the jail&#39;s medical center watched me for 20 minutes to ensure there were no immediate reactions. I went about my day afterward with no symptoms. At 21:30 when I went to sleep, I got some aches in my joints and took 1 dose of liquid capsule NyQuil to help with the pain and went to sleep. At 00:30, the 7th, I woke up groaning in my sleep to the extreme pain in my joints and feeling hot internally. I decided to get up and take a warm bath to ease the aches. I went and ran the bath and all of a sudden while it was running, I had a severe need to throw up, but could not naturally. Since this was concerning, I got up and walked out of the bathroom and all of a sudden in the hall I got a feeling of impending doom and that something was not right and I fainted. I laid on the floor for what I would approximate to be 5 minutes going in and out of consciousness waiting for the blood to fully return to the brain. After this, I instantly felt like I needed to survive and that I felt like I could be dying so I slowly crawled down the stairs to get to my military ID so I could call the military&#39;s nurse advice line. I had to take a break and lay on the concrete in my garage because I felt so dizzy and so hot and began to feel my vision disappear like I was going to faint again. I waited a few minutes before getting back up the stairs crawling to my phone to call. When I called them 00:58, they told me to call 911 because they believed I would be having a severe reaction, though I noted to them I did not have a rash or hives. I then called 911 at 01:08. They sent EMT&#39;s to my home which took my vitals. I had normal blood pressure, SPo2, and temp, but an elevated heart rate of just under 100 and a high respiration rate. EMT&#39;s made the decision for me to stay home since the hospital did not seem immediate in their opinion. After this I stayed on the couch for a few minutes and then felt very tired so I walked slowly to my room and fell asleep. I woke up at 06:00 for work, and arrived at 07:00. In the hour after waking up I was achy, sweating, and felt light headed. I got to work and my Sergeant told me to go home and sleep. I slept another 5 hours at 08:00 and when I woke up most of my symptoms went away other than aches and getting flush very easily for 5 days.  At this current time all I notice is some random light headedness that quickly resolves and comes a few times a day at random and without cause.

                                                Immediately after receiving the shot I began to have fairly intense pain at injection site. It continued in waves. I began to walk around the store for the allotted 15 minutes. I began to feel very dizzy and faint. My ears began ringing and I didn?t feel well. I stumbled back to the pharmacy to ask for help. At this point I was also feeling like it was very hard to breathe. I explained all these symptoms to the pharmacists on duty and they told me to just sit down. After sitting down I still felt faint but suddenly felt the need to vomit. I stumbled to the bathroom where I collapsed in front of the toilet and passed out twice, striking my head and throat on the bowl. After awaking I was very disoriented and felt very hot and clammy. The pharmacist then came and found me and told me to once again sit down and continue waiting. After sitting down for about 5 more minutes I began to feel less dizzy and was having an easier time breathing. I left the store as the pharmacist was ignoring me and didn?t seem concerned about my symptoms. After arriving home I was tired and week and very very cold. I noted my body temp was lower than usual. I took a nap and then these symptoms continued for about 24 hours. I am now feeling much better.

                                                I passed out in my bathroom the morning after the vaccine shot around 5:30am. I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                Patient received her Janssen COVID vaccine and was sitting in a chair in the conference room when she slumped over in her chair and became unresponsive.

Her sweater was removed and ice packs again were applied to her neck and axillary area.  Patient continued to have a pulse and was breathing.  EMS was called.

                                                Initial injection was recieved with arm extended out and raised in car window. Really painful injection. Several seconds after vaccine injected I felt a wave of chills on my body and immediately started profusely sweating. Seconds after that i then began to get extremely dizzy, blacking out, trying to stay conscious for a personnel to walk by and after a few moments the feeling slowly lightened up minus the excessive sweating and chills. Personnel then told me it was just anxiety and brushed it off. I have never had a reaction like this from a vaccine before so this experience was unsettling.

                                                Prior to administration of Janssen Covid-19 vaccine the patient was anxious but was completely fine once the procedure commenced and concluded. After finishing explaining the possible side effects of the vaccine and handing the patient the V-Safe handout, she got up slowly and proceeded to our designated post vaccination monitoring seating arrangement. Upon concluding the vaccination process with the patient?s partner, she alerted the pharmacist that she does not feel well. To which he asked her to further elaborate on what she is experiencing. She began to say she thinks she?s going to faint as she is attempting to drink water. As she was having a drink of water she fainted. To which he responded by running over and catching her before she hit the ground, cradling her upper torso, specifically the head and laid her down on the floor with the assistance of pharmacist and her partner. In the midst of everything he instructed another pharmacy technician to call 911 for the paramedics. As she was in the process of drinking water I saw her other hand go to the region of the neck, thinking it was also an allergic reaction and administered a dose of Epi-Pen. He administered the Epi-Pen on the upper side of her thigh, directly to the skin not through clothing. There was a very brief moment where the patient began to convulse but gradually regain consciousness. The patient became lucid and was conversing with him, apologizing for the incident. He assured her there was nothing to apologize for and to which she told me she had similar incidents from vaccinations as a child. She did not mention this prior to administration of the vaccine and through conversation we believe the incident may be caused from high anxiety of needles / vaccinations. When the paramedics arrived, they assisted the patient from the floor and gave a warning that she believed she was going to faint again, and fainted in the arms of the paramedics.

                                                Trouble breathing as the shot was administered. Vision began to black out after 3 minutes. Urge to vomit, extreme nausea. Passed out, unconscious within 5 minutes of receiving the shot. Could not sit up/dizzy for 30 minutes. Nausea, weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity/memory. Later that night, and through the night for 10 hours, severe back pain. Nausea, severe weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity and memory, sweats and chills.  The next day (day immediately after receiving vaccine) symptoms continued but lessened by 5 pm. Each day since then, the symptoms have ALL remained in a more mild form. Today is day 6 and I still have moderate back pain and occasional sweats, weakness and fatigue.

                                                Patient was a walk-in COVID-19 applicant. She filled out her form and told me she&#39;s very scared of needles and has fainted in the past from getting a vaccine. I asked whether she was comfortable receive vaccine at pharmacy setting and she said she really wanted the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine to avoid getting two shots. She appeared calm and the administration of the vaccine went smoothly without any issues. During the 15 minute observation period, patient&#39;s mother and technicians alerted me she has fallen over. I quickly instructed by technician to call 911, while the other paged CODE WHITE and I rushed to the patient. Her father helped me lie her down on their back (supine) and I elevated the patient s feet onto the chair. I took of her mask to listen to make sure she was breathing and she quickly regained consciousness and looked right at me. I had her take some deep breaths for me to make sure airways were clear and helped her sit down in a chair. I asked her to stay an additional 15 minutes to ensureshe is feeling fine. She decline emergency personnel from coming to the store. She was fine and left the store after 15 minutes. I will follow up with her to make sure she&#39;s doing well on 05/10/21.

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine I began to feel slightly dizzy. By the time I walked across the room to the observation table I was feeling lightheaded. They sat me down, gave me water and a cookie, but about 2min after the injection the dizziness was so intense that I began to black out. I was unconscious for about 1-2min, then came to but my vision was still unclear. I was taken via wheelchair to the paramedics on the opposite end of the gymnasium, and at this point I was heavily perspiring and very pale but still coherent. I felt my vision and dizziness significantly improve after being able to lay down. I was transported to the hospital for observation but had much improved by the time I arrived. An EKG, bloodwork, and cardiac tests were recommended to discern possible underlying heart related conditions, but I declined because I already had a PAT for thyroid surgery scheduled the next day that would be running those same tests. This reaction was likely due to not having eaten  for several hours prior to the vaccine. After about an hour I felt well enough to drive myself back home and dealt with mild aches and pains that evening, chills, and a low grade fever all of which resolved themselves by the next morning.

She became unconscious and began to stumble unto the floor but was caught and held by her mother. After 1 minutes, the patient regained consciousness. She was given cold water and rubbing alcohol to forehead to help her. Her mother reported that the patient has a fear of needles and was anxious. The ambulance arrived but was refused by patient. The fire department arrived and monitored patient&#39;s blood pressure.

                                                After vaccination the patient looked to be doing well, good color in the face and communicating freely. After providing the same immunization to her spouse she lost color in her face, began sweating, and became faint. She did not lose consciousness but was drowsy, diaphoretic, pale and stated she lost hearing for a couple minutes. I kept her awake and asked her questions to assess for alertness. She was aware of date, location, name, year. She was not improving after 5 minutes so paramedics were called to evaluate her. She was cared for by the paramedic team and recovered after 40 minutes. She was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the vaccine. She refused transport to the ER and left of her own accord.

When I attempted to take a shower, I fainted for a few seconds and it was a struggle to move. Only felt comfortable when I was laying down. My muscles all felt painful and sore, had a painful headache, felt very disoriented and woozy. It was a struggle to walk or move, and couldn&#39;t talk loud or for a long time at once. Had to go home from work and spent the rest of the day sleeping. Around 4pm, 24 hours after the injection, my muscles felt less sore and was feeling better. The next morning, I was back to being completely normal.

                                                I walked up the stairs to go to bed at 10:45pm and started feeling very dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID vaccine at a clinic today at approximately 2:10pm.  When seated in a chair in the waiting area, patient stated she started to feel light headed and sweaty and has fainted before (not from a vaccine), so she sat back in the chair and then awoke on the floor.  She bumped her forehead on the floor and has an egg-sized raised bump on her forehead.  We applied ice instantly and monitored her blood pressure until she felt well enough to sit up.  She did not feel she needed an ambulance and refused going to urgent care. She is feeling fine other than the bump.  A worker took a report and I discussed with her what to watch for to monitor for concussion.  Her roommate is driving her home.  Event will also be reported today.

                                                Menstrual bleeding started about 2 hours later. Fever, chills, aches, joint pain, sharp headache, around that afternoon at 7PM. Fever and chills went away after 24 hours. Joint pain and stabbing headache remained for about 48. Currently still bleeding on day 5 and getting occasional sharp headache pains that last around 5 minutes and go away for hours. Joints still feel a lingering ?soreness? almost. Last night, day 4 the cramps that accompanied the bleeding intensified greatly and were very painful. Today I have much more ?period like? cramping still. Previously cramps were there but minimal and occasional.

Onsite paramedics stated blood sugar, blood pressure, and pulse were within normal range after sitting on stretcher for 15 minutes. I signed a release refusing transport to hospital as i was feeling better. Throughout the first day I started feeling tired and sore but that was to be expected. Following day 4/11, extremely nauseous, headache, body aches and typical flu like symptoms, low grade fever of 100-101. At roughly 9:45 am and again at 11:25 am started throwing up bile/stomach acid.  Flu like symptoms did not subside until morning of 4/13.

When she  came to the pharmacist gave her some orange juice.  It didn&#39;t help and she  was very nauseous.  When  she got up to leave she was totally incoherent, was unable to walk on her own.  When she got home she was no better so I first called our family doctor which both said take her to the ER.  There they did many tests and they all came back fine so they sent her home.  By that evening she was able to walk on her own and talking right.  She was terribly tired and still today 4/14 she is feeling worse but still not 100%. With the pause today for this vaccine we are very worried about this.

Will also get HIT antibodies to evaluate for possibility of Vaccine induced thrombocytopenia(VIT). - Will plan on treating with Dexamethasone 40mg Daily x 4 days to increase platelet count.  D/w hematologist, and he will see the patient and run the test for HIT antibodies (PF-4) and initiate IVIG treatment, which would help treat the low platelets either from exacerbation of ITP or VIT. If these come back positive, will likely transfer patient to HN for admission and delivery to be followed by therapeutic anticoagulation with non-heparin based therapy, consistent with usual therapy for HIT.

                                                About 7 minutes of receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I started to feel nauseous while sitting down and waiting for my fifteen minutes of monitoring. I experienced pain in my left arm and my heart was beating fast. My vision was in and out, started seeing black and white spots. I then got up from my chair and I went to the counter and as I was talking to the clerk telling her I did not feel good, I just went down and fainted. I had fainted and when I came back, woke up a nurse was trying t put an epi-pen on me but I told her I did not need it. They called the ambulance and they monitored me there. The EMT said to me that my blood pressure had dropped and I had had a &#34;vasovagal syncope&#34; and that my body probably went into shock. I did not go to the hospital and went home. For the rest of the day I felt ill, and out of it. I also felt pain, an aching pain to the right buttocks region. The next day I still felt not good. Also I have noticed since the J&amp;J vaccine, I had my menstrual cycle but normally my menstrual cycle lasts 5 days now this month it only lasted about 4 hours and I this concerns me.  Before this vaccine, I did not have experience these symptoms.
