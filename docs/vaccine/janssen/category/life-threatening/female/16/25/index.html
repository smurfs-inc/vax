                                                On 4/8/2021 I developed a headache after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I took the next few days easy, and laid in bed for the majority of the weekend. On 4/10/2021 I left my residence to get dinner and noticed I was short of breath just walking from the building to my car. The shortness of breath worsened over the next few days. On 4/13/2021 I called a clinic and told them I had been short of breath and they directed me to the ER. I arrived to the ER around 2:30 in the afternoon. They ordered a chest x-ray and ran a test to determine if I could have a blood clot. The test came back with results indicating I could have a blood clot, so they did a chest CT and an MRI. The chest CT showed a blood clot in my left pulmonary artery. They prescribed a blood thinner, told me to stop taking oral birth control, and discharged me.

She was unconscious, not breathing for a few seconds as her head fell to her chest, but resumed breathing when we opened her airways.  Her body seized upon taking in air and 911 was called.  She regained consciousness before the paramedics arrived and her vitals were within normal limits when they checked her.  Pt went home on her own  with mom.

                                                Two days after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson  vaccine, the patient (myself) awoke in the middle of the night with painful cramps in the lower abdomen. She got up in the morning to some blood in her underwear. The next day, she awoke to an immense of amount of blood coming out of her vagina to the point it was dripping down her leg. For context, the patient received the Mirena IUD several months ago and had not had a period since receiving the IUD, besides spotting. This is why these events were startling since she had not had a period in several months and this immense bleeding and cramping  was abnormal to her. As of today (4/15/2021), she has been experiencing heavy bleeding for 5 days. Again, this is very abnormal to her since she has not experienced a period for several months.

                                                For thirty-six hours after the vaccine. I had body aches and chills and my eye sockets were sore and it hurt to look up. Ten days after the vaccine I was in the shower and a large blood clot came out of my nose. It was a large clot about the size of a quarter and there was no other blood with it. The clot came out of my left nostril but it was not like a nose bleed. I went to the Urgent Care but they did not do tests.

                                                A couple hours after getting the J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced extreme cramping and a light/medium flow of blood from my vagina. The cramps were very painful - on a scale of 1 to 10, an 8. I have been bleeding ever since. Sometimes there will be only be a drop or two of blood that comes out for a couple hours but usually it is much more than that. It&#39;s like I&#39;m on my period, but I am not. I have an IUD and also am on the birth control pill (Junel). I am not on the placebo week on my birth control pill pack, so I should not be experiencing a period right now, but ever since the shot, I have been bleeding and experiencing intense cramps and pain since.

Fever and chills went away after 24 hours. Joint pain and stabbing headache remained for about 48. Currently still bleeding on day 5 and getting occasional sharp headache pains that last around 5 minutes and go away for hours. Joints still feel a lingering ?soreness? almost. Last night, day 4 the cramps that accompanied the bleeding intensified greatly and were very painful. Today I have much more ?period like? cramping still. Previously cramps were there but minimal and occasional.

Will also get HIT antibodies to evaluate for possibility of Vaccine induced thrombocytopenia(VIT). - Will plan on treating with Dexamethasone 40mg Daily x 4 days to increase platelet count.  D/w hematologist, and he will see the patient and run the test for HIT antibodies (PF-4) and initiate IVIG treatment, which would help treat the low platelets either from exacerbation of ITP or VIT. If these come back positive, will likely transfer patient to HN for admission and delivery to be followed by therapeutic anticoagulation with non-heparin based therapy, consistent with usual therapy for HIT.
