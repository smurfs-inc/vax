Her symptoms included dizziness, syncope, stomach ache, foaming at the mouth, vision disturbances.  911 was called and paramedics arrived..  Her vital signs were all normal.  Patient did not wish to go to hospital, and her mother took her home.  Other pertinent information is that patient has a history of seizures and had been off of her seizure medication for 4 weeks.  I believe that I understood her mother to say that her neurologist knew she was getting the vaccine today.  Patient reported no allergies to any other vaccine, medication, or other.

                                                Patient was given the injection and then she started feeling dizzy right after administration.  She sat with her head against the wall and dropped her phone and passed out for just a moment.  She had a slight tremor/shake for a few seconds. (I did not witness, unsure exactly what happened or how long)   She came too fairly quickly after being yelled at, are you ok?  When she regained consciousness she complained of being hot all over for a bit.  We gave her ice packs to cool down.  She felt hot for maybe 10-15 minutes, but felt relief with the ice packs.  She also drank some sips of cool water which seemed to help her cool down.

The next morning, I was still dizzy when I walked around but the fever was gone. I was still very fatigued which made me unable to go to class or work. Day 3 I was back to my normal self.

I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                Patient received her Janssen COVID vaccine and was sitting in a chair in the conference room when she slumped over in her chair and became unresponsive. Patient had just received her one dose Janssen vaccine and was sitting in a chair approximately 3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She began to slump over in her chair and was unresponsive. Two RNs responded to assess the patient. Patients feet were elevated and ice packs applied to her neck and axillary areas. Patient was breathing and had a pulse. Patient responded to her name once and then passed out again. Patient was unable to respond after this.  Her eyes were open.  Patient was lifted into a wheelchair by three nurses and brought to a private area.  Patient was warm and sweat was running down her face.  Her sweater was removed and ice packs again were applied to her neck and axillary area.  Patient continued to have a pulse and was breathing.  EMS was called.  Patient slowly began to come around and could answer questions after about 5 minutes of being unresponsive. She was confused and had no memory of what had occurred. She reported feeling light headed and seeing spots in her vision.  She continued to feel light headed. EMS assessed patient.  Vitals were stable and blood sugar was WDL.  Patient reported feeling much better. She denied feeling light headed or dizzy any longer.  She was able to answer all questions asked.  Patient did not want to go to the hospital and refused transport to the hospital via ambulance. She was observed for an additional 20-30 minutes at which time her boss arrived to pick her up. She was educated on calling 911 if she began to feel light headed or dizzy again. Patient verbalized understanding. She was walked to the car by an RN.

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine I began to feel slightly dizzy. By the time I walked across the room to the observation table I was feeling lightheaded. They sat me down, gave me water and a cookie, but about 2min after the injection the dizziness was so intense that I began to black out. I was unconscious for about 1-2min, then came to but my vision was still unclear. I was taken via wheelchair to the paramedics on the opposite end of the gymnasium, and at this point I was heavily perspiring and very pale but still coherent. I felt my vision and dizziness significantly improve after being able to lay down. I was transported to the hospital for observation but had much improved by the time I arrived. An EKG, bloodwork, and cardiac tests were recommended to discern possible underlying heart related conditions, but I declined because I already had a PAT for thyroid surgery scheduled the next day that would be running those same tests. This reaction was likely due to not having eaten  for several hours prior to the vaccine. After about an hour I felt well enough to drive myself back home and dealt with mild aches and pains that evening, chills, and a low grade fever all of which resolved themselves by the next morning.

She became unconscious and began to stumble unto the floor but was caught and held by her mother. After 1 minutes, the patient regained consciousness. She was given cold water and rubbing alcohol to forehead to help her. Her mother reported that the patient has a fear of needles and was anxious. The ambulance arrived but was refused by patient. The fire department arrived and monitored patient&#39;s blood pressure.

                                                After vaccination the patient looked to be doing well, good color in the face and communicating freely. After providing the same immunization to her spouse she lost color in her face, began sweating, and became faint. She did not lose consciousness but was drowsy, diaphoretic, pale and stated she lost hearing for a couple minutes. I kept her awake and asked her questions to assess for alertness. She was aware of date, location, name, year. She was not improving after 5 minutes so paramedics were called to evaluate her. She was cared for by the paramedic team and recovered after 40 minutes. She was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the vaccine. She refused transport to the ER and left of her own accord.

When I attempted to take a shower, I fainted for a few seconds and it was a struggle to move. Only felt comfortable when I was laying down. My muscles all felt painful and sore, had a painful headache, felt very disoriented and woozy. It was a struggle to walk or move, and couldn&#39;t talk loud or for a long time at once. Had to go home from work and spent the rest of the day sleeping. Around 4pm, 24 hours after the injection, my muscles felt less sore and was feeling better. The next morning, I was back to being completely normal.

                                                I walked up the stairs to go to bed at 10:45pm and started feeling very dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.
