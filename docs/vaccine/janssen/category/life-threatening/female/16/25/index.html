The next morning at the breakfast table she began crying and shouting that she had lost her vision and everything went dark.  Within minutes she stopped breathing and her eyes rolled back in her head.  Her body went rigid and her mother caught her as she was falling backward in her chair. Her skin was white and her lips blue.  I administered CPR and after approximately 4 mouth to mouth breathes she began breathing again.  When she regained conciousness she said she could not hear.  The paramedics arrived and tended to her.

                                                On 4/8/2021 I developed a headache after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I took the next few days easy, and laid in bed for the majority of the weekend. On 4/10/2021 I left my residence to get dinner and noticed I was short of breath just walking from the building to my car. The shortness of breath worsened over the next few days. On 4/13/2021 I called a clinic and told them I had been short of breath and they directed me to the ER. I arrived to the ER around 2:30 in the afternoon. They ordered a chest x-ray and ran a test to determine if I could have a blood clot. The test came back with results indicating I could have a blood clot, so they did a chest CT and an MRI. The chest CT showed a blood clot in my left pulmonary artery. They prescribed a blood thinner, told me to stop taking oral birth control, and discharged me.

                                                Two days after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson  vaccine, the patient (myself) awoke in the middle of the night with painful cramps in the lower abdomen. She got up in the morning to some blood in her underwear. The next day, she awoke to an immense of amount of blood coming out of her vagina to the point it was dripping down her leg. For context, the patient received the Mirena IUD several months ago and had not had a period since receiving the IUD, besides spotting. This is why these events were startling since she had not had a period in several months and this immense bleeding and cramping  was abnormal to her. As of today (4/15/2021), she has been experiencing heavy bleeding for 5 days. Again, this is very abnormal to her since she has not experienced a period for several months.

                                                For thirty-six hours after the vaccine. I had body aches and chills and my eye sockets were sore and it hurt to look up. Ten days after the vaccine I was in the shower and a large blood clot came out of my nose. It was a large clot about the size of a quarter and there was no other blood with it. The clot came out of my left nostril but it was not like a nose bleed. I went to the Urgent Care but they did not do tests.

                                                Myalgias for 17 hours on day of vaccination that completely resolved.  Myalgias and weakness started 4/15 and continued progressively for a week before presenting to the clinic.  Lab results showed rhabdomyolysis with CPK of 204,900 U/L and elevated transaminases (see levels below).  Referred to Emergency Department where she was admitted to the hospital for IV fluids.  Creatinine never increased and CPK/transaminases trended downward until release from hospital.   At clinic follow up visit on 5/6, patient reported resolution of pain and weakness although she doesn&#39;t quite feel 100%.

                                                Vaccine received 4/7/2020. On Wednesday 4/14/2020, pt went to the gym and did high intensity interval training involving body weight exercises, specifically an exercise called &#34;v-ups&#34;. Exercise was not more strenuous than usual, and pt was well hydrated. Pt reports that she exercises often and this was not a new exercise. Soon after workout, pt began having muscular pain in the hip, radiating into her inner thighs bilaterally with associated tingling. On 4/15, pain worsened and pt had difficulty ambulating. Denies any edema, erythema in her legs or unilateral leg swelling. Presented to the ED on 4/16 and found to have elevated CK of 127,768 with UA significant for large blood and protein, without RBC, indicative of rhabdomyolysis. Pt did not have any known risk factors that may precipitate rhabdomyolysis. On admission, fluids were initiated with downtrending CK, LFTs, and renal function remained stable.   er D&amp;C was done at on 4/2 and she reports there were no complications during or after the procedure. Her BHCG was elevated at the time and she tried an oral abortion pill but still had some fetal remnants so went for a D&amp;C. She had the J&amp;J vaccine shortly after on 4/7 and she reports no complications around and shortly after getting the vaccine. Denies vaginal bleeding or odor. Denies fevers, chills, abd pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting.

She had the J&amp;J vaccine yesterday and went into anaphylactic shock.   She pretty much always been allergic to everything.   They put her on a high does of steroids but was just wondering if you had heard any reactions like that.   Said it could take up to 6 weeks to settle in her system.  She&#39;s fine now.

                                                A couple hours after getting the J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced extreme cramping and a light/medium flow of blood from my vagina. The cramps were very painful - on a scale of 1 to 10, an 8. I have been bleeding ever since. Sometimes there will be only be a drop or two of blood that comes out for a couple hours but usually it is much more than that. It&#39;s like I&#39;m on my period, but I am not. I have an IUD and also am on the birth control pill (Junel). I am not on the placebo week on my birth control pill pack, so I should not be experiencing a period right now, but ever since the shot, I have been bleeding and experiencing intense cramps and pain since.

Had J&amp;J vaccine on 4/9.    - Lab repeated and confirmed - D/w MFM and Hematologist.  In an abundance of caution, will get coags, CMP, and P/cr urine ratio to evaluate for HELLP.  Will also get HIT antibodies to evaluate for possibility of Vaccine induced thrombocytopenia(VIT). - Will plan on treating with Dexamethasone 40mg Daily x 4 days to increase platelet count.  D/w hematologist, and he will see the patient and run the test for HIT antibodies (PF-4) and initiate IVIG treatment, which would help treat the low platelets either from exacerbation of ITP or VIT. If these come back positive, will likely transfer patient to HN for admission and delivery to be followed by therapeutic anticoagulation with non-heparin based therapy, consistent with usual therapy for HIT.

                                                About a week and a half after receiving the first and only dose of the Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, I developed small bruises (Petechiae) on my chest and arm. I decided to consult my doctor just in case. My doctor did a blood draw and ran a CBC panel. The next day I was rushed to the ER as my platelet count was reported at 7. By the time I got to the ER my platelets had dropped even further to a count of 2. I was treated inpatient for 3 days 2 nights. At this time I was diagnosed with IPT (Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura). It was treated with two rounds of IVIG (Intravenous immunoglobulin) and 75 mg of Prednisone daily (which I have been slowly tapering off of since). My platelets restored to a non-critical level and have continued to hold steady ever since.

                                                The morning after I received my vaccine I began to have unexpected vaginal bleeding. The Jolessa birth control that I am taking allows me to skip my periods by continuing to take the active pills nonstop and skip the placebo pills, so this bleeding was unexpected, as I do not have a regular period or ?withdrawal bleed? on a regular basis. The bleeding has not stopped and has been consistently a moderate-heavy flow, going on 20 days straight now.
