At the physician&#39;s office, the physician told the patient that there was a small blood clot in her eye. The patient stated she didn&#39;t think anything of it at the time, but now that the CDC came out with the statement about the Janssen vaccination, she decided to report to the pharmacy.

She hit her left eye and left temple resulting in a bump and a bruise.  Patient opened her eyes when I called her name and she was not aware of were she was. Her blood pressure was 95/64 65 bpm laying down and 70/54 114 bpm when sitting. We laid her back down because she was feeling dizzy and the Ambulance arrives 45 mins after called. Because of her bump and her low BP she was taken to the hospital.

We DO NOT KNOW if the J&amp;J vaccine caused this death, but are reporting it due to the close proximity of the vaccination to the death itself.

Visited primary doctor who urged her to visit ED. On ED visit on 3/4/21, she was found to be in afib RVR (heart rate to 170s) that was refractory initially to dilt push, dilt oral, dilt gtt. On 3/7/21, stroke alert was called because of new right arm dis-coordination, and on 3/8/21, MR brain showed an acute right cerebellar artery infarct (which did not leave deficits). Prior to the vaccine, pt had absolutely no symptoms of heart failure or cardiac diagnoses. She was hospitalized from 3/4/21-3/13/21, 3/18/21-3/23/21 for afib RVR, congestive heart failure, and acute kidney injury which required dilt and diuretics. However, she was later hospitalized on 4/8/21-4/11/21 again for afib RVR, congestive heart failure and acute kidney injury. Finally after continued outpatient amiodarone, she returned to normal sinus rhythm. Patient has shared that she has never experienced such drastic health changes in her life and these frequent hospitalizations occurred after her Janssen shot.
