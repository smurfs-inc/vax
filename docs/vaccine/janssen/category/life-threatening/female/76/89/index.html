The family is concerned that the decedent was doing &#34;fine&#34; until she took the J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccine on April 9, 2021.  We DO NOT KNOW if the J&amp;J vaccine caused this death, but are reporting it due to the close proximity of the vaccination to the death itself.

                                                Patient died approx. 5 hours after shot was administered. Cause of death reported is Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease. The death certificate was signed by the county coroner without autopsy, based on the report by the onsite deputy coroner. No doctors or hospitals were involved. This report is FYI only; there has been no direct connection made between my mother&#39;s death and the  vaccine other than one followed shorty after the other.
