That evening, patient with increasing SOB and increasing oxygen requirement and was admitted for hypoxia &#43; LE swelling.  Although SNF where vaccination took place denied symptoms at time of vaccination, per H&amp;P, increasing oxygen requirements were noted 3 days prior to vaccination.   See H&amp;P below  He is currently residing in a rehab facility following a hospitalization detailed below, but essentially he noted some shortness of breath about 4-5 days ago. They checked his oxygen saturation and noted that he was hypoxic, so started him on oxygen (reportedly 4L NC?). He reports a worsened productive cough; sputum is dark but not bloody in color. He has been fatigued and chilled; he thinks he&#39;s been intermittently febrile. No nausea, vomiting, or constipation. He endorses twice daily diarrhea, but he associates this with his bowel regimen. He also has a fair amount of lower extremity swelling which is bothersome to him; he says this has been ongoing since his MVA in January.[KE.4] He was recently seen in Nephrology clinic, where he was started on lasix 40mg daily and started on a low sodium diet[KE.3]. He is unsure if the lasix is helping his swelling, but does have robust urine output after he takes it

                                                abdominal aches and cramps gradually increasing in severity; walking and other core body movement provided temporary cessation of increasing severe pain;  the peak of severe pain was accompanied by a bowel movement, followed within about 5 minutes by body temperature increase, sweating, and profuse salivation such that saliva was swallowed every 2-3 seconds for a few minutes.   Treatment was a focus on breathing while practicing the turtle yoga position (forehead on floor with knees folded under abdomen) and then laying flat on back with one or both knees bent.  After 10-15 minutes of this treatment the symptoms (abdominal pain, high temp, profuse salivation) subsided.

                                                On Monday March 8th I went to the Pharmacy to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine under the new 1b guidelines. I am a 62 year old white male with type 1 diabetes, insulin dependent for the past 49 years. I filled out the question form I was presented by the staff and then was given a dose of the J&amp;J vaccine. This vaccine was administered at approx. 1:30 p.m. I was asked to wait 15 minutes to see if I had and acute reaction, following none, I was told I could leave. There rest of the day I was fine. I went to bed at 11:00 p.m. and within 15 minutes I was cold, shaking and sick on my stomach. I took my temp and it was 100.2 F My O2 sat was 95% and heart rate was 120 with feelings of palpitations from time to time. I went to the bathroom and stayed there the rest of the night with frequent vomiting and loose stool. Stomach cramps all night long. Several BGL were taken and even with an insulin pump I was not able to lower my 299 level for over the next 24 hours of repeated bolus. I was finally able to stop dry heaves and fall asleep for moments at a time around 5:00 a.m. My temp finally broke around 11:00 a.m. the next day Tuesday. I had a headache this entire time. I called hospital ( Ask a Nurse ) on Tuesday morning around 8:00 a.m.and enquired about side effects for this vaccine and effects on a type 1, they basically told me to go to the ER or Clinic and be seen by a Physician. I choose not to do either, but to monitor myself and see how the rest of the day went. The first time, other than a headache and complete body soreness my vitals and BGL, were WNL,  was late Tuesday evening around 7:00 p.m. This was a horrible set of side effects. Onset was within 11 hours from injection. No warning for type 1 people to be careful for the possibilities of increased BGL. Today is Wednesday March 10th, and my vitals have remained WNL, but I still have a mild headache and body soreness, some maybe from the vaccine but I believe mostly from the throwing up. Today is March 11th, my vitals are still WNL and BGL is in target. BGL control is responsive to pump therapy now. The past 2 nights I have awoken in a cold soaking sweat that cannot be tied to a low BGL. My body is somewhat still soreness.

Also blurry vision and inability to read words on a page. Sensing something wrong, my sister drove me to emergency room at Hospital where I was admitted. I was later told I suffered a stroke. I was in the hospital for 5 days, receiving various tests. (Hospital has all info on record).  I am awaiting surgery to remove blockage from carotid artery. Doctor has all my information and should be reporting the event also to VAERS.

                                                I spoke to patient by phone on Saturday morning around 9:20am. He was concerned about the fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, and muscle aches he had the night before. He felt better when I spoke to him. He wanted to know when those side effects would go away finally. Since I had the Moderna vaccine I said 24 to 36 hours. But I didn&#39;t know about the J&amp;J vaccine. We disconnect the call at 9:40am Saturday morning. After the call at some point he fixed lunch or dinner and stopped eating before finishing his meal. He had left the food on the table and in the pans he fixed it in. Very unusual for him.  The patient then went to his room where is was found Monday 3/22/21 around noon in his bed laying on his chest (he hated to lie on his chest) by the police and the HR officer from his work.   The HR officer had called my other brother around 11:15am on 3/22 /21 to ask if we had heard from the patient because he had not reported to work or phoned in. He has passed sometime between noon on Saturday till Sunday evening alone at his residence. He had towels and a trash can beside his bed when he was found.  The coroner call it death by natural causes and would not do an autopsy when even asked by his PCP.

During the night I woke up overheated and bathed in sweat. Got up to go to the bathroom for BM but was nauseous, feeling need to vomit at the same time. After BM I stood and still felt need to  do one or the other or both when I passed out. Wife came upstairs and found me sitting up against the corner wall. She was able to shake me awake while calling 911. I was groggy but aware I was still nauseous and  stayed down next to toilet until stomach settled. I came downstairs and EMTs arrived. Took blood pressure. Result was it was low. Took EKG and that was normal. Second  blood pressure test  showed that I rebounded.  When offered I felt it unnecessary to go to hospital.

Then waves of oversensitivity with knee and foot joints hurting as if arthritis, and this lasted most of the night. I also experienced strange hallucinations in the night as if I had a high fever but I don&#39;t believe I had a fever, and I also had a migraine and neck pain. The arm where the vaccine was applied is fine and not sore at all.  I also have a slight soreness in my stomach as if I had been coughing for a while, which was not the case.  It is now 11:34 AM the following day and I believe I&#39;m getting back to my normal self but it sure was a rough night and I though you should be aware.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

                                                Suspected pneumonitis.  Patient presented on day following vaccination as shortness of breath, nausea, and diarrhea were not abating with home management. They had started later in the day after the vaccination.  At ER admission - SpO2 = 80% room air. Nasal cannula was applied and SpO2 recovered quickly.  BNP was elevated so acute exacerbation of heart failure was suspected and treated. However, patient did not improve with diuresis.  Viral workup and bacterial cause workup negative. No acute cardiac events discovered. Patient continued to decline. Transferred to ICU on 3-19-21 to use BiPAP with 65% FiO2 and able to take breaks to 15L nasal cannula. Borderline blood pressures at this time.  Infectious disease, pulmonology, cardiology, nephrology, and critical care anesthesia services evaluated and ruled out multiple possible diagnoses and patient continued to decline.  Diagnostic bronchoscopy on 3-22-21 with BAL lead to patient ventilator dependent with profound hypotension.  Aggressive ICU management ensued.  Bronchoscopy very clean with no real secretions - in line with CT evidence of pneumonitis.  Despite aggressive care and maximized pressor support, patient expired on 3-29-21 when family chose to withdraw care as blood pressure declined again.

                                                I didn&#39;t have pain in the arm, after an hour I had a slight headache. The headache lasted about a day. After the 3-4 day I had serve diarrhea and stopped taking my supplements. It stopped for a couple days then came back for a day. I had no headache or pain, just 3 bad episodes of diarrhea. On March 24th I went into the Hospital with severe pain in my lower left back side. I thought I was passing a kidney side, with the pain I was having. When I got there they did a CT scan and blood work and it wasn&#39;t kidney stone but I had a blood clot on the lower left side of lung and the right side as well. They immediate put me on blood thinners. I was there for a day and a night. They released and put me on medication.  I&#39;ve had minor pain but nothing like the pain I had before. I have since followed up with a Pomologist and PCP. Pulmonologist said I had blood clots but couldn&#39;t give me a cause. My PCP said she thought I had or have Covid. I asked to have my blood drawn and she said it was too late for that because I had taken the vaccine already.

                                                My father received his shot on March 13, 2021.  He drove to move home and on March 28th started having his right arm go numb but did not tell us.  He asked to go the ER March 29th at 6:45am saying his chest hurt and was having a hard time breathing, this has happened before since having Covid in September.  I called 911 after he became dizzy and could not walk.  While at the ER suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed him from his nose down over a course of 3 days.  His brain stem was affected and he lost the ability to swallow.  After being on a ventilator for 72 hours he was removed from it and died less then 30 mins later from drowning in his own saliva on April 1, 2021.
