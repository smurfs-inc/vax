                                                COVID infection post vaccination  1 day following vaccination, patient experienced fatigue, myalgia and low grade fever.  RA test positive.  That evening, patient with increasing SOB and increasing oxygen requirement and was admitted for hypoxia &#43; LE swelling.  Although SNF where vaccination took place denied symptoms at time of vaccination, per H&amp;P, increasing oxygen requirements were noted 3 days prior to vaccination.   See H&amp;P below  He is currently residing in a rehab facility following a hospitalization detailed below, but essentially he noted some shortness of breath about 4-5 days ago. They checked his oxygen saturation and noted that he was hypoxic, so started him on oxygen (reportedly 4L NC?). He reports a worsened productive cough; sputum is dark but not bloody in color. He has been fatigued and chilled; he thinks he&#39;s been intermittently febrile. No nausea, vomiting, or constipation. He endorses twice daily diarrhea, but he associates this with his bowel regimen. He also has a fair amount of lower extremity swelling which is bothersome to him; he says this has been ongoing since his MVA in January.[KE.4] He was recently seen in Nephrology clinic, where he was started on lasix 40mg daily and started on a low sodium diet[KE.3]. He is unsure if the lasix is helping his swelling, but does have robust urine output after he takes it

                                                abdominal aches and cramps gradually increasing in severity; walking and other core body movement provided temporary cessation of increasing severe pain;  the peak of severe pain was accompanied by a bowel movement, followed within about 5 minutes by body temperature increase, sweating, and profuse salivation such that saliva was swallowed every 2-3 seconds for a few minutes.   Treatment was a focus on breathing while practicing the turtle yoga position (forehead on floor with knees folded under abdomen) and then laying flat on back with one or both knees bent.  After 10-15 minutes of this treatment the symptoms (abdominal pain, high temp, profuse salivation) subsided.

Symptoms; vomiting and diarrhea, unable to keep food down for a period of 2 &amp;1/2 days each event. At the moment I am symptom free. I am seeing a physician for an issue with similar symptoms that have been under control for months using  Creon DR. The speed at which the symptoms progressed and the dissimilarity in what I typically experience is what is prompting my VAERS notification.  I cannot say with certainty that the symptoms experienced were wholly or remotely caused by the vaccine.

                                                Saturday evening May 1 I met with nine friends (all vaccinated) and ate a lot of food, drank moderately, and then did not sleep well. Approximately noon the next afternoon (Sunday, May2) while driving I noticed a developing dry-cough, chest congestion, and general fatigue. While camping that night I had some chills, thought I might have a bit of a fever, and had little appetite. I arrived home Tuesday, May 4 coughing a lot and very fatigued. Wednesday morning I went in for a Covid test. My cough and fatigue continued to increase along with muscle pain and headache. Wednesday night my fever topped out near 104. It broke and I felt much better but for the next few days (until around May 11) it fluctuated between normal and around 100-102. The Covid test came back negative but I went back for another just in case. It too came back negative. My temperature has now stabilized, the cough and congestion are mostly gone. I&#39;m still a bit tired but feeling much better. It seemed like a case of Covid without the Covid. I am glad I got vaccinated but that was rough.

                                                On Monday March 8th I went to the Pharmacy to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine under the new 1b guidelines. I am a 62 year old white male with type 1 diabetes, insulin dependent for the past 49 years. I filled out the question form I was presented by the staff and then was given a dose of the J&amp;J vaccine. This vaccine was administered at approx. 1:30 p.m. I was asked to wait 15 minutes to see if I had and acute reaction, following none, I was told I could leave. There rest of the day I was fine. I went to bed at 11:00 p.m. and within 15 minutes I was cold, shaking and sick on my stomach. I took my temp and it was 100.2 F My O2 sat was 95% and heart rate was 120 with feelings of palpitations from time to time. I went to the bathroom and stayed there the rest of the night with frequent vomiting and loose stool. Stomach cramps all night long. Several BGL were taken and even with an insulin pump I was not able to lower my 299 level for over the next 24 hours of repeated bolus. I was finally able to stop dry heaves and fall asleep for moments at a time around 5:00 a.m. My temp finally broke around 11:00 a.m. the next day Tuesday. I had a headache this entire time. I called hospital ( Ask a Nurse ) on Tuesday morning around 8:00 a.m.and enquired about side effects for this vaccine and effects on a type 1, they basically told me to go to the ER or Clinic and be seen by a Physician. I choose not to do either, but to monitor myself and see how the rest of the day went. The first time, other than a headache and complete body soreness my vitals and BGL, were WNL,  was late Tuesday evening around 7:00 p.m. This was a horrible set of side effects. Onset was within 11 hours from injection. No warning for type 1 people to be careful for the possibilities of increased BGL. Today is Wednesday March 10th, and my vitals have remained WNL, but I still have a mild headache and body soreness, some maybe from the vaccine but I believe mostly from the throwing up. Today is March 11th, my vitals are still WNL and BGL is in target. BGL control is responsive to pump therapy now. The past 2 nights I have awoken in a cold soaking sweat that cannot be tied to a low BGL. My body is somewhat still soreness.

                                                On 04/12/21 I had just eaten and sat down at the computer. I started feeling disoriented, light headed and my vision started to become affected. I could not focus my vision and tried to vomit also also but immediately went to bed. Throughout the day/night when i got up I was unable to walk/see as normal and required my hand on the wall for balance. I also felt nauseated and could not eat anything during this time. I was able to sleep mostly and as of this submittal(04/13/21 7:51 pm CT) i have been symptom free for several hours. No medical treatment was sought due to no health insurance. All symptoms indicate stroke .

Beginning at 2:30 am on 3/18/21 the patient began to experience dizziness, vertigo, shaking, tremors, nausea, and vomiting. The shaking and tremors occurs all over but is most significant in the hands and arms leaving the patient unable to do simple daily tasks or return to work.  These symptoms began 3/17 and have persisted every day since in varying severity. Sometimes the tremors last for more than 20 minutes straight. The patient was seen in the emergency department on 3/26/21 but the hospital notes are unavailable to the pharmacy at this time. Per patient, he had an MRI and no other tests and was given a prescription for ondansetron for nausea and discharged. The patient believes he was not adequately assessed and is still suffering from symptoms. He has a follow up with a primary physician 5/28/21 which is the soonest he was able to be referred.

A few days after that (on 4/13) he felt numbness and pain in his legs, in addition to ?decreased sensation in his inner thighs. These sensations were migratory and intermittent. Also noted in his upper extremities as well. He also had issues with temperature sensation in his lower extremities. On 4/14 he had slight haziness in vision while driving which resolved after 30-60min and has not recurred. He also had slight difficulty walking. On 4/15 he had an appointment with his PMD; had L-spine XR which revealed moderate lower lumbar facet arthritis, and was thought that change in sensation was likely d/t radiculopathy - was prescribed ibuprofen, muscle relaxant, oxycodone (took oxy x1, ibuprofen for a few days). Since then he has also had intermittent stabbing pains in various parts of his body which resolved spontaneously. On 4/17-4/18 his back pain resolved. On 4/18 at 4:30am he woke up with R-sided facial weakness. He has not had focal weakness aside from the face.  Was seen in ED that morning for this R-sided facial droop involving the forehead, diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy and given prednisone/valacyclovir. Yesterday 4/19 around mid-day he started having L-sided facial weakness and slurred speech. This has progressed since yesterday. Reports ability to swallow, though a little difficult d/t cheek weakness. Low back pain has returned as well. Does report constipation and possible poor bladder emptying for the last few days.  He was seen by a Doctor and referred to ED to rule out AIDP and other diseases after J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                Started at 430 am on the 13th of April, my stomach started hurting. It does not matter if or what I eat, it still hurts. I got headaches, those have also continued since the 13th.  The following week my mouth began to hurt, I started coughing more than normal. First a dry cough, now I&#39;m coughing up phlegm with specks of blood. And I can not stop itching, and I&#39;m getting tired of taking benadryl for it. I contacted my doctor, all I got was these are normal reactions to the vaccine. They last 2 to 4 weeks. I already get migraines, my gut is picky since that shot. I used to eat hot peppers, now if I use pepper on my dinner my stomach is in pain. These side effects should be gone by now. I am one pissed off person.

It was low ~90/55. Asked again how he was doing, stated okay but feeling chills/cold. Started to shake uncontrollably. Ask pt if he thought a hospital visit was necessary; he stated no at that time.

                                                Janssen shot on Mar 12, 2021. On Mar 25,2021 at 10 AM, I woke up with a headache, sore joints, nausea. Also blurry vision and inability to read words on a page. Sensing something wrong, my sister drove me to emergency room at Hospital where I was admitted. I was later told I suffered a stroke. I was in the hospital for 5 days, receiving various tests. (Hospital has all info on record).  I am awaiting surgery to remove blockage from carotid artery. Doctor has all my information and should be reporting the event also to VAERS.

I returned his call and he verbalized all issues above and also said his legs, arms and hands were cramping up and having ringing in the ears.  I recommended him to go to the ER now, he said he had called his PCP and was told the same thing.  He stated he is single and lives alone and does not drive.  I told him to call 911 and he verbalized he is too embarrassed to do that and states he will wait for his daughter to call him.  I offered to call his daughter for him and he declined.   Addendum: Created by RN. 04/16/2021 02:01 PM 04/16/2021 Client called reporting the same symptoms as in 4/13 message -- I told him to go to the ER immediately. He stated he could not drive due to muscle spasms and feet and leg pain. Asked if he would please call 911 and stated that was not necessary. He verbalized he understood my directions and stated he would go to urgent Care. Called Sheriff office to make a well person check.

                                                I started getting a headache about an hour along with pain in the back of my neck and a mild headache after my shot (maybe an hour or so).  Around 1100 hours, about the time I got back from the Facility, I began to feel a tightness in my throat and got a little raspy.  When I drank water and ate a little, it hurt similar a hangover as if dehydrated, but went away after a minute or so. About 1400 hours began to develop chills, causing me to get into bed, and then the chills, overall muscular pains, very tired, moderate headache and some nausea ensued as well along with an initial low grade fever.    Fever went up to 102.1 degrees and had fever till about 2130 hours and broken only after I took two (1) Tylenols. Still had a very low grade fever till about 2300 hours or so (99-100), but finally went away.    I awoke next day (13 APR) about 0800 feeling a bit better, but with a moderate headache and touch of diarrhea.  Headache lasted all day.  This prompted me to contact my treatment facility and a telecall was conducted giving them my symptoms.  They recommended Rizatriptan should my headache continue and Tylenol not enough to relieve.  I cannot take any analgesics due to my liver disease and Thrombocytopenia.  Finally  my headache went away (with a slight hint it might come back), but no more fever, chills etc.    On 14 APR, no more headache but still felt a little tired.  From 15 APR through today (16 APR), no further symptoms and feel great, but prepared to report anything that may develop laer.

                                                I spoke to patient by phone on Saturday morning around 9:20am. He was concerned about the fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, and muscle aches he had the night before. He felt better when I spoke to him. He wanted to know when those side effects would go away finally. Since I had the Moderna vaccine I said 24 to 36 hours. But I didn&#39;t know about the J&amp;J vaccine. We disconnect the call at 9:40am Saturday morning. After the call at some point he fixed lunch or dinner and stopped eating before finishing his meal. He had left the food on the table and in the pans he fixed it in. Very unusual for him.  The patient then went to his room where is was found Monday 3/22/21 around noon in his bed laying on his chest (he hated to lie on his chest) by the police and the HR officer from his work.   The HR officer had called my other brother around 11:15am on 3/22 /21 to ask if we had heard from the patient because he had not reported to work or phoned in. He has passed sometime between noon on Saturday till Sunday evening alone at his residence. He had towels and a trash can beside his bed when he was found.  The coroner call it death by natural causes and would not do an autopsy when even asked by his PCP.

His eyes were rolling in the back of his head, which this symptom would come and go.  He would have hallucinations.  On unspecified date Pt woke up screaming the house was on fire and there was a dog by the bed and a person in the closet, talking out of his head.  An ambulance came and brought him to ER.  Pt coded in the ambulance and brought back. Pt was coherent upon arriving to the ER.  He had to be intubated and bagged and died about 15 minutes later.  Pt had blood work which was totally out of whack.   Family was told they did not understand what had happened to him.  The only thing the family could think of that was different was he had recently been vaccinated.

                                                2 weeks  ago on April 17th,  I woke up feeling very dizzy and nauseous. The room was spinning. My left ear was ringing, My balance was off.  Every time I bent over it was worse. I vomited after I ate.  Spent the day and the next day in bed. On Monday I called my doctors office and explained how I was feeling  and a tele visit was scheduled later in the day. During the tele visit,  the doctor diagnosed my symptoms as vertigo. I never had vertigo in the past. She couldn&#39;t tell me if it was from the vaccine or not. She did mention she had patients complaining of vertigo after getting the covid vaccine. Medication and exercises were given to me.  A few days later, my big toe on my right foot was aching terribly.  Each day it seems to be worse and I am at the point where I can barely walk.  Today I did some research online and saw that it could be gout. I never had gout n the past. I read vaccines can cause gout.  So here I am 2 weeks since my symptoms began and I am still dizzy and have the toe pain. Exercises and medication is not helping.

I had Diarrhea and a low grade fever for one day and I couldn&#39;t concentrate. I started to have symptoms of depression that I do not normally have. I felt restless and I had trouble sleeping. I was very aggravated, and I was having repetitive thoughts. I had trouble working and my brain was a little.  It went on for two weeks. I have had a few more episodes since then but it is much better.

During the night I woke up overheated and bathed in sweat. Got up to go to the bathroom for BM but was nauseous, feeling need to vomit at the same time. After BM I stood and still felt need to  do one or the other or both when I passed out. Wife came upstairs and found me sitting up against the corner wall. She was able to shake me awake while calling 911. I was groggy but aware I was still nauseous and  stayed down next to toilet until stomach settled. I came downstairs and EMTs arrived. Took blood pressure. Result was it was low. Took EKG and that was normal. Second  blood pressure test  showed that I rebounded.  When offered I felt it unnecessary to go to hospital.

                                                cold, shivering as if with a fever yet no fever present along with sore leg muscles, a long hot shower relieved the symptoms temporarily but they lasted till approx. 3AM. Then waves of oversensitivity with knee and foot joints hurting as if arthritis, and this lasted most of the night. I also experienced strange hallucinations in the night as if I had a high fever but I don&#39;t believe I had a fever, and I also had a migraine and neck pain. The arm where the vaccine was applied is fine and not sore at all.  I also have a slight soreness in my stomach as if I had been coughing for a while, which was not the case.  It is now 11:34 AM the following day and I believe I&#39;m getting back to my normal self but it sure was a rough night and I though you should be aware.

                                                By 10:00 pm that evening I got Chills, fever, muscle aches, headache, nausea and low back pain.  Stayed home from work for 1 or 2 days.  Felt better in all ways except my low back got very, very painful.  I asked my wife to buy me a walker to take to work because I had difficulty walking the distance from the parking lot to inside my office.  Also used the walker at work.  My boss said to go home, it looks like you&#39;re in  pain.  Saw Dr. on Monday March 15 because the low back was getting worse.  He prescribed muscle relaxors and anti-inflammatory medicine.  Called the next day asked for something stronger for pain because worse.  Nurse responded to continue on existing meds.  Went to Chiropractor on both March 16 and 18 without back pain relief.  On March 19 went to urgent care, got X-ray and pain meds.  MRI done 2 days later on March 21st which revealed a spinal abcess. Admitted to Hospital, surgery done to remove spinal abcess on March 22.  Bacteremia, laminectomies in L3,4,5 S1 to relive spinal cord pressure.  Puss had the filled spinal epidural cavity, cultured out as Strep bacteria.    Remained hospitalized until April 2nd. Sent home for 1 night then returned to hospital via ambulence the next day April 3rd with 103 degree fever.  Discharged April 8th. Readmitted to hospital for 3rd time on April 17 where I remain today with Kidney and liver function problems likely reactions to meds.  Continue to have excruciating low back back which is why continues to be hospitalized at the time of this report.

                                                About 7pm I started feeling terrible chills and headache. by 10pm I had extreme body aches, bones , muscles, etc.  Headache was very intense,eyeballs ached ,face etc. I was dizzy, jaw was stiff but mostly terrible pain. had some wheezing by it went away when I coughed up mucus. Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

                                                Suspected pneumonitis.  Patient presented on day following vaccination as shortness of breath, nausea, and diarrhea were not abating with home management. They had started later in the day after the vaccination.  At ER admission - SpO2 = 80% room air. Nasal cannula was applied and SpO2 recovered quickly.  BNP was elevated so acute exacerbation of heart failure was suspected and treated. However, patient did not improve with diuresis.  Viral workup and bacterial cause workup negative. No acute cardiac events discovered. Patient continued to decline. Transferred to ICU on 3-19-21 to use BiPAP with 65% FiO2 and able to take breaks to 15L nasal cannula. Borderline blood pressures at this time.  Infectious disease, pulmonology, cardiology, nephrology, and critical care anesthesia services evaluated and ruled out multiple possible diagnoses and patient continued to decline.  Diagnostic bronchoscopy on 3-22-21 with BAL lead to patient ventilator dependent with profound hypotension.  Aggressive ICU management ensued.  Bronchoscopy very clean with no real secretions - in line with CT evidence of pneumonitis.  Despite aggressive care and maximized pressor support, patient expired on 3-29-21 when family chose to withdraw care as blood pressure declined again.

After the 3-4 day I had serve diarrhea and stopped taking my supplements. It stopped for a couple days then came back for a day. I had no headache or pain, just 3 bad episodes of diarrhea. On March 24th I went into the Hospital with severe pain in my lower left back side. I thought I was passing a kidney side, with the pain I was having. When I got there they did a CT scan and blood work and it wasn&#39;t kidney stone but I had a blood clot on the lower left side of lung and the right side as well. They immediate put me on blood thinners. I was there for a day and a night. They released and put me on medication.  I&#39;ve had minor pain but nothing like the pain I had before. I have since followed up with a Pomologist and PCP. Pulmonologist said I had blood clots but couldn&#39;t give me a cause. My PCP said she thought I had or have Covid. I asked to have my blood drawn and she said it was too late for that because I had taken the vaccine already.

                                                The patient called the pharmacy on 4/7/2021 and said that he had vomited and had been experiencing an excruciating headache that he said was worse than any headache he had ever had and was concerned about how he was feeling since he had just had his Covid vaccine on Monday.  I told him that headaches were a very common adverse reaction and that many people had experienced headaches after vaccination.  I told him that from my experience it usually didn&#39;t last more than a day for others and I assured him that it should go away soon.  I later talked to him and found out that he had went to the Emergency room that Wednesday evening (4/7/2021) because the headache was so bad.  He was seen in the ER, observed overnight, released the next morning, and then had a follow up appointment with his primary care physician on 4/15/2021.  He also had a very high blood pressure reading he told me in the Emergency room that evening he was evaluated.

                                                My father received his shot on March 13, 2021.  He drove to move home and on March 28th started having his right arm go numb but did not tell us.  He asked to go the ER March 29th at 6:45am saying his chest hurt and was having a hard time breathing, this has happened before since having Covid in September.  I called 911 after he became dizzy and could not walk.  While at the ER suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed him from his nose down over a course of 3 days.  His brain stem was affected and he lost the ability to swallow.  After being on a ventilator for 72 hours he was removed from it and died less then 30 mins later from drowning in his own saliva on April 1, 2021.

                                                13th of April. I had a blood clot in my hand. My index finger on  my left hand was numb and black and blue all around the knuckle area and into my hand area. I went to my primary care - I went to the acute center there. She said the hand was cold and could see the black and blue. They put me on Plavix for 30 days and I haven&#39;t had any reoccurrence of that. I think it was the 21st, I couldn&#39;t sleep all night, I had a kidney stone - the pain was so bad I got nauseous - around my back and side and in my front. I didn&#39;t have a fever. I went to the doctor office and they checked urine - and said there was blood in the urine. I was prescribed - Tamsulosin HCL. They thought I had passed most of it by the time I got there.
