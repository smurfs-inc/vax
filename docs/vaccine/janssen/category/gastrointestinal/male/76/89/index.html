                                                No appetite for days. The smell of food made patient sick. On week two after vaccine, oxygen stayed at 84%, patient couldn?t stand as he had no energy. Patient began to eat after lots of convincing and seemed to be doing at least 20% by week 3, but oxygen was still in mid 80%. On day 20 after vaccine patient had to be rushed to the ER due to sepsis. All vital organs  began to fail and on transport patient suffered a mild heart attack.   Patient was a healthy 78 year old male that lived alone and drove and had no major health issues before the date of the vaccine.

                                                Patient states on Friday, 4/9, he went to the pharmacy to receive his J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine. He states on Saturday morning, his R nostril began to bleed, and continued to bleed until Monday. He states on Wednesday, 4/7, he noticed oral sores that at first were not painful, but large. He was worried about it interfering with his shot, but because he had waited so long to get it, he decided to proceed anyway. He denies any fever or chills, no frank diarrhea, but occasional loose stools, without blood seen. He denies HA, vision changes, or focal neuro deficits. On Sunday, 4/11, the patient ended up going to ED to evaluate his epistaxis, the MD attributed it to his elevated BP, the patient reports it being 160s/90s. They gave him new BP medications, which he took, but when he saw the Dr., he instructed the patient not to keep taking his BP meds. When asking the patient if anything correlates with foods he eats, the only thing he can pinpoint it to, would be pico de gallo. He states it has irritated his mouth before. He also reports recently taking his wife&#39;s supplement (unknown name) but thinks it is for cholesterol. He took that approximately 1 week ago. No new changes in food habits, mouthwash, or toothpaste. He states once his sores began to get a little painful, he went to buy a special mouthwash for oral sores (unsure name). His only reported allergy is to Lisinopril, which his reaction was a whole body rash.    He states they did not pack his nose or do anything for his epistaxis at the ER, but eventually he let the nostril clot with blood. Now he feels fullness in the nare, but does not want to disturb the clot in fear that it will re-bleed. His wife also noticed a petechial rash that began on his BLE, he is unsure when that started.    He presented to  ED on 4/13, due to his PCP  instructing him to be evaluated when he had outpatient labs done and revealed a PLT count of 4,000. In the ED, the patient had normal vital signs.  He was transfused one unit of PLTs. He also had a negative head CT. He was also started on decadron 40mg PO daily by heme/onc. Patient tells me today his sores are less painful and feel smaller than usual. Heme/onc also ordered 2 IVIG 1,000 mg/kg/day x2 doses.

Small right pleural  effusion is seen. Minimal discoid atelectatic changes in the left perihilar  region and left lung base. Elevated right hemidiaphragm suggests eventration.   Admitted to Hospital 4/5/21, per admission diagnosis: Acute pulmonary embolism (*) submassive likely secondary to covid 19  Per hospital course notes:Patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was show to have submassive PE with severe pulmonary hypertension seen on TTE. He should be on lifelong therapy given 2nd VTE and severity.  Iwould consider unprovoked (COVID in 11/20 wouldn&#39;t count I wouldn&#39;t think).  He was started on eliquis 10 mg BID x 7 days than 5 mg bid. Given his severe pulm htn on TTE, left atrial pressure normal.  We would have outpatient sleep study as well He will need VQ scan to assure no CTEPH. Will have outpatient follow up. We discontinued his aspirin on discharge as well.

That night: halucinatory dreams, woke up  and had difficulty with orientation - room spinning, difficulty walking came back to bed, bed spinning.  Got up later room spinning vertically - took several minutes to settle down.  This problem has gotten worse as the days go by.  This morning, dizziness persists longer than before, feeling of strong nausea, near vomiting, cannot walk in a straight line.  Fear of falling.   These are symptoms of vertigo I believe.  Should I go to a doctor?  Feeling that this will get worse.  Difficulty concentrating.  Quite an unsettling and scary experience.

March17, I got sick - I had a bad stomach ache. Friday, I thought the doctors would be gone. March 21st, I went to the clinic and they sent me right to the hospital for a scan and I had emergency surgery to remove my appendix - but it did get put off from when I went in because of all the emergencies in front of me with the ambulances coming in from accidents. He said it had burst  by the time the surgeon got to me with the surgery and they gave me antibiotics and he said he poked three holes in my belly. Still recovering - I have follow up tomorrow. I am doing real well. My stomach doesn&#39;t hurt and I am not taking pain medication any longer.

                                                I received the Johnson and Johnson/Janssen Covid-19 vaccine at the vaccination pod on Thursday, April 8th, 2021 (04-08-2021) at around 12:45 pm.  The next morning, Friday, April 9th, 2021 (04-09-2021), I woke up around 9:30 am and felt fine at first.  But after taking a drink of water, I felt nauseous.  I also had a pressure sensation in the center of my chest below my collarbone.  After contacting my doctor&#39;s office, my family called 911 at around 11:40 am to have the emergency squad take me to the hospital to be evaluated for a heart attack.  At the hospital, I was diagnosed with an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction.  I was taken to the catheterization lab for a heart catheterization and a stent was placed in my left anterior descending artery (LAD).  I was admitted to the hospital on Friday, April 9th, 2021 (04-09-2021) and discharged from the hospital on Saturday, April 10th, 2021 (04-10-2021).

He also reported extreme acid reflux symptoms whenever he attempted to drink any fluids at that time as well as nausea.  This progressed to difficulty breathing at which time the caregiver was alerted and checked his blood pressure.  This reading was 88/55 according to the caregiver and the pulse was very high as well but the actual number could not be remembered.  The difficulty breathing prompted them to alert emergency medical services where he was picked up and transported to the emergency room via ambulance shortly after for evaluation.

No fever or headache observed.  Today he awoke and felt fine, no additional issues to report but will report anything else should it occur.
