                                                Patient states on Friday, 4/9, he went to the pharmacy to receive his J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine. He states on Saturday morning, his R nostril began to bleed, and continued to bleed until Monday. He states on Wednesday, 4/7, he noticed oral sores that at first were not painful, but large. He was worried about it interfering with his shot, but because he had waited so long to get it, he decided to proceed anyway. He denies any fever or chills, no frank diarrhea, but occasional loose stools, without blood seen. He denies HA, vision changes, or focal neuro deficits. On Sunday, 4/11, the patient ended up going to ED to evaluate his epistaxis, the MD attributed it to his elevated BP, the patient reports it being 160s/90s. They gave him new BP medications, which he took, but when he saw the Dr., he instructed the patient not to keep taking his BP meds. When asking the patient if anything correlates with foods he eats, the only thing he can pinpoint it to, would be pico de gallo. He states it has irritated his mouth before. He also reports recently taking his wife&#39;s supplement (unknown name) but thinks it is for cholesterol. He took that approximately 1 week ago. No new changes in food habits, mouthwash, or toothpaste. He states once his sores began to get a little painful, he went to buy a special mouthwash for oral sores (unsure name). His only reported allergy is to Lisinopril, which his reaction was a whole body rash.    He states they did not pack his nose or do anything for his epistaxis at the ER, but eventually he let the nostril clot with blood. Now he feels fullness in the nare, but does not want to disturb the clot in fear that it will re-bleed. His wife also noticed a petechial rash that began on his BLE, he is unsure when that started.    He presented to  ED on 4/13, due to his PCP  instructing him to be evaluated when he had outpatient labs done and revealed a PLT count of 4,000. In the ED, the patient had normal vital signs.  He was transfused one unit of PLTs. He also had a negative head CT. He was also started on decadron 40mg PO daily by heme/onc. Patient tells me today his sores are less painful and feel smaller than usual. Heme/onc also ordered 2 IVIG 1,000 mg/kg/day x2 doses.

That night: halucinatory dreams, woke up  and had difficulty with orientation - room spinning, difficulty walking came back to bed, bed spinning.  Got up later room spinning vertically - took several minutes to settle down.  This problem has gotten worse as the days go by.  This morning, dizziness persists longer than before, feeling of strong nausea, near vomiting, cannot walk in a straight line.  Fear of falling.   These are symptoms of vertigo I believe.  Should I go to a doctor?  Feeling that this will get worse.  Difficulty concentrating.  Quite an unsettling and scary experience.

March17, I got sick - I had a bad stomach ache. Friday, I thought the doctors would be gone. March 21st, I went to the clinic and they sent me right to the hospital for a scan and I had emergency surgery to remove my appendix - but it did get put off from when I went in because of all the emergencies in front of me with the ambulances coming in from accidents. He said it had burst  by the time the surgeon got to me with the surgery and they gave me antibiotics and he said he poked three holes in my belly. Still recovering - I have follow up tomorrow. I am doing real well. My stomach doesn&#39;t hurt and I am not taking pain medication any longer.

The next morning, Friday, April 9th, 2021 (04-09-2021), I woke up around 9:30 am and felt fine at first.  But after taking a drink of water, I felt nauseous.  I also had a pressure sensation in the center of my chest below my collarbone.  After contacting my doctor&#39;s office, my family called 911 at around 11:40 am to have the emergency squad take me to the hospital to be evaluated for a heart attack.  At the hospital, I was diagnosed with an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction.  I was taken to the catheterization lab for a heart catheterization and a stent was placed in my left anterior descending artery (LAD).  I was admitted to the hospital on Friday, April 9th, 2021 (04-09-2021) and discharged from the hospital on Saturday, April 10th, 2021 (04-10-2021).

                                                Patient with history of myasthenia gravis with multiple prior myasthenic crises requiring IVIG and one requiring intubation experienced myasthenia gravis exacerbation with no apparent trigger that began two weeks after receiving J&amp;J vaccine. Daughters noticed he was having progressive difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and generalized weakness. O2 sats were also noted to be lower than normal with pulse oximeter at home (92% compared to baseline of 95%). On day of admission patient had a mechanical fall while carrying a tray with his walker.  Hypoxic to 88% on arrival. Labs notable for leukocytosis (13.68), hyponatremia to 127 and negative infectious workup. CTH with chronic microvascular changes and global atrophy but negative for acute process. He was admitted and continued on prednisone 5mg daily (outpatient regimen). Patient was started on a three day course of IVIG on 5/3/21 due to concern for myasthenia exacerbation with subsequent improvement.

This started out mild and as the week went on got worse.  Symptoms were leg swelling, shortness of breath, persistent stomach pain, headache, and chestpain.  On 6/24 at 3:30 am he went to the ER where they discovered a large (golf ball size) blood clot in his right lung.  He also has been diagnosed with pancreatitis.  We have talked to five different doctors and multiple other hospital staff who all say it is a direct impact of the covid vaccine.

                                                Patient caregiver reports that he woke up at 2 a.m. the morning after the vaccine unable to hold his urine which is unusual for him.  He also reported extreme acid reflux symptoms whenever he attempted to drink any fluids at that time as well as nausea.  This progressed to difficulty breathing at which time the caregiver was alerted and checked his blood pressure.  This reading was 88/55 according to the caregiver and the pulse was very high as well but the actual number could not be remembered.  The difficulty breathing prompted them to alert emergency medical services where he was picked up and transported to the emergency room via ambulance shortly after for evaluation.

                                                He got his vaccine, he had chills that didn&#39;t last too long.   Then two days later he could not move his left shoulder, and could not move his arm.  If he moves it across his chest feels like somebody is stabbing him.  His lower back is also in a lot of pain, the entire back.   It now feels like a ball rolling from left to right, and sometimes it is both, and then perhaps one or the other. It has also affected his bowel movements as well, watery bowel movements.  He now goes 3-4 times a day.  When he relieves himself the pain subsides    He still continues to have the pain.   He went to his PCP and he gave him OTC medicines that helped some but did not get rid of the pain, especially in his lower back as it felt like somebody was stabbing him, as well as his left arm.   His PCP sent him to pain management and that didn&#39;t work.  He gave him 6 shots into his back, 3 on each side which did not relieve the pain.  He went back to that doctor last week, and has a friend who is in charge of an x-ray company and got an  x-ray.  His lower back didn&#39;t show much of anything.  He went back to pain management and told him to come back and went last week and told him that it could be arthritis and gave him some exercises, stretches, and he couldn&#39;t help him.   He gave him some Tylenol with codeine for the pain, but has not taken them all.     He is improving with his symptoms very slowly and is now able to move some and do exercises which are helping him.  He was almost paralyzed before and now able to move some.  He is waiting for the effects to just leave his body.
