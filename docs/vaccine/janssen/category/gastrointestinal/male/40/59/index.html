                                                On March 11th at around 10pm I experienced severe shaking, fever, headache and delirium. The next day I improved but had a fever on and off of 99.1. I felt like I was stable, but felt dizziness increasing, and was lethargic through the weekend.   Then on Monday the 15th, I had a noticeable cramp in my right abdomen. At around 8pm CST I began feeling like I needed to burp and that I had GI problems.   The problems increased that night at around 10pm I had pain where the cramp started. Two hours later I started throwing up because of the pain and feeling of too much air inside of me. I could not stop vomiting after 2 hours so went to the Hospital ED at around 2:30 AM Tuesday the 16th.   I was admitted after a CT scan showed and white cell counts confirmed and infection and drastically enlarged appendix. I was diagnosed with an appendicitis and they immediately scheduled me for surgery.

                                                Experienced moderate debilitating flu symptoms day after vaccination and recovered the following day.  Over one week later (3/25) developed skin sensitivity on the neck which later spread to back, torso, and legs.  Skin sensitivity persists still one week after onset, is a severe chafing feeling when skin comes into contact with clothing.  No rash or any visual signs.  Along with the skin sensitivity, mild to moderate chills from day to day as well as muscle fatigue and upper/lower back pain.  Symptoms varied in severity day to day; used ibuprofen and it seemed to offer limited, temporary relief.  Concurrent with second onset of symptoms, noticed gradual abdominal inflammation and developed sensation similar to UTI but urine dip and lab test results were all normal.  Doctor concluded immune reaction to vaccine as no other allergies or changes in routine as well as no prior medical history of any of these symptoms. Prescribed daily prednisone for three days to calm immune response; after one day symptoms were greatly improved.  Abdominal inflammation has improved and UTI sensation improved.  Still experiencing slight chills and skin sensitivity unchanged.

                                                I started to feel really tired around 7:30pm and got a head ache so I went to bed early. I couldn&#39;t sleep well because I got the chills and a fever. I went to use the bathroom around 3am. All of a sudden I got really nauseous, the room spun, everything went black and I fainted in the middle of my bathroom. My wife woke up and helped me back to bed. The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

These symptoms I anticipated.   What I didn?t anticipate was my abdominal pain.  I still feel as of today (4/14), pain in my abdomen.  The areas of the discomfort are all over my mid-section.  I was so worried that I went to ?Urgency Care? doctor on 4/5/2021 and the nurse had me go for a ?CT Scan?.  I also went to my Primary care physician on 4/13/2021 and described my concern and abdominal pain but didn?t get a diagnosis.

He states that he was just calling to report HA since he has heard the news about the Janssen vaccine.    I informed him that I would take down this information and that most likely he was having side effects to vaccine which is pretty common for those symptoms.  I also informed him of the adverse effects that would require immediate medical attention (severe HA, abd pain, leg pain and SOB).  He states that currently he feels fine and does not have any symptoms.  I informed him that would document this information for him and if he started with any other symptoms to come into clinic.

                                                Unusual exhaustion within an hour of the vaccine.  Had to go to bed and slept into the evening developing a fever of 103, severe thirst and chills. The fever lasted until 10:00 a.m. the following day, but weakness, thirst, chills and body aches continued for 3 more days intermittently. I would feel like I could finally exercise and then be too weak and tired to go back to routine. My appetite declined for 4 to 5 days as food didn&#39;t taste appealing. On Thursday, April 8, I announced to my mom in the morning that I finally felt like I was back at almost 100% and later in the afternoon felt nauseous, incredible pain in my chest and had dry heaves. I finally vomited some and was once again overcome by a fever of 101 and all I could do was sleep from severe exhaustion. I am against medication, but finally agreed to taking ibuprofen and tums. After sleeping into the next day around noon, I finally was able to eat some breakfast but the pain in my chest continued and I could rid it for another day. I intermittently had to sleep and gave up my exercise routine until my body has had time to recuperate. I have not fully recovered, but my appetite is picking up. I still require more sleep than normal.

                                                Got injected, didn?t hurt much. Was told to wait 15 minutes in case of reaction. They walked away and left me sitting in a chair in a public space with everyone else who was waiting. I texted my wife to check in, when I started tearing up and crying for no real reason, then started feeling nauseous so I closed my eyes.   Suddenly I felt like I had been given a shot of adrenaline out of nowhere so I?m just trying to figure out if it?s nerves or a physiological response to something. I?m trying to control my breathing but having a hard time breathing.   Then the fever hit. The most intense flash of heat. I was hyperventilating. I couldn?t open my eyes or move or make a sound, I could just sit there struggling to breathe. My phone was in my hand and I couldn?t lift it. I just simply didn?t have the strength or energy to move.   At some point I legit thought I was about to die. I managed to angle my wrist so I could check my heart rate with my watch. It was 47bpm.   I was fading away but I made myself get control of my breathing and forced myself to take long deep slow breaths. It hurt, and I felt like passing out, but I kept doing it.   Fever turned into chills and then I soaked through my jeans and T-shirt in under a minute. I was finally thinking clearly and breathing and getting oxygen. Everyone else near me was fine.   Nobody checked on me the entire time including the 3 people who sat there and watched me suffer through this.  I told the pharmacist about my reaction and asked if it was normal and didn?t receive any indication that I should be concerned, so I went home since I felt better.   It wasn?t until my friend pointed out that this sounds like anaphylaxis that I thought I should report it. So here I am. Hopefully I?ll be okay.

I have been checking in with that website (V-safe App)  you gave me no one has contacted me. Monday (5/3/21) I missed work due to me not feeling good and still today (5/5/21) I&#39;m at work but feel like I could fall asleep, no energy, nausea still, and like I haven&#39;t slept in weeks even though I get good sleep. My breathing has gotten to the point that it hurts to take a deep breath. I believe this is all due to the shot but didn&#39;t know what you thought.&#34;

The last time I experienced symptoms like this was on the first day I started chemotherapy and had an allergic reaction to one of the chemo drugs (bleomycin). I had a delayed reaction hours later and went to the ER. It was determined it was an allergy. So I took Claritin D 24 H and saw the symptoms I was experiencing last night dissipate.

                                                Around 8pm I became very cold and tired. I took a bath, which is out of character, and tried to sleep. By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

                                                After the initial 12 hour period, I experienced night-time chills followed then by being too warm and night sweats.  This happened both the first and second night.  During the day I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours for aches and pain.  Mainly my neck and back have been what hurts, although my knees, elbows, hips, etc. also were achy.  The third and fourth days I still continued to have chills, no fever throughout as far as I am aware (took my temp 2-3 times).  The fourth day I was very faint and somewhat unbalanced, felt shaky and light headed and I ended up having an anxiety attack.  I mention the last symptom as I have never had an episode like this previously in my life.  Today is day 5, still feel tired, slightly nauseous, neck and back pain, headache, difficulty focusing.

                                                My initial symptoms were light swelling a region around the shoulder of my injection arm and excessive sweating in the armpit on my injection arm side.  Following this, symptoms similar to being on a hallucinogenic gradually manifested over the next several hours, including euphoria, a persistent urge to grind teeth, and some mild-to-moderate visual and physical effects.  Following the date of the injection, the primary symptom has been a bruise/cramp hybrid pain in the upper arm of the injection site that is gradually receding (but still ongoing), along with random light bouts of nausea and headaches, random light pains throughout my injection arm, and occurrences of coldness in my injection arm (lasts about an hour)

                                                Started feeling dizzy and started to respond slowly to things and felt weak around 8pm. Shortly after these symptoms I begin to have uncontrollable chills followed by a fever and Nausea. The whole time starting around 8pm I had pretty bad muscle aches as well. I took a warm shower and bundled up the whole night because I had a fever, aches, chills, and nausea. It was impossible to sleep because of this and sometimes my heart was beating fast as well. The next morning I had a headache that would not go away until I took Tylenol. The whole next day I felt exhausted as well and very weak. I began to feel better on day 3 but still feel somewhat foggy from the shot. I would not recommend this vaccine to anyone and would never get it again and hopefully the foggy sensation goes away.

At that point, started getting chills, which progressed into mix of chills and hot spells, fever, headache, and frequent urination throughout the night (though was also hydrating a lot).  Had fever the next morning still and Diarrhea.  Still feel modest headache and chills the next evening (before bed where I had felt the worst overnight the first night of the vaccine) but feeling better than the first night.  Per the form I received, I was told to include Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA in this section of the form.  I am reporting this on the day after the vaccination, so don&#39;t yet know final outcome, but again, improving and don&#39;t feel like I need medical attention.

                                                I felt fine all day and went to bed at 9:30pm. I woke up to my body shaking uncontrollably and I was freezing at 10:30pm. My wife felt my skin and she said I was burning up. Unfortunately our thermometer wasn&#39;t working so I don&#39;t know my temperature, but I have never in my life shaken so badly with a fever. I couldn&#39;t control myself and I was shaking so hard that my muscles were sore from it, but I still couldn&#39;t stop. I then began vomiting every 45 minutes or so. This happened for nearly 4 hours until 2:18am. Then very suddenly everything just stopped. No more feeling cold (actually I then felt very warm and couldn&#39;t cool off. I was sweating quite a bit). No more shaking. No more vomiting. I did get a wicked headache, but I figured it was due to dehydration and took two Advil. The Advil didn&#39;t do anything and I was awake until 5:59am because my head hurt too badly to sleep. Finally I slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I just felt worn out for most of the day on the 10th, and couldn&#39;t shake the headache. Then on the evening if the 10th, I started getting a sore throat and a slightly runny nose. I went to bed that way. When I woke up on the 11th (today) I still had the sore throat and slight runny nose. The headache was gone, but I felt tightness in my chest. As I went throughout the day, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m short of breath with doing most things. I have two young children, so even taking care of them I feel like at times I&#39;m struggling for breath. I&#39;m not in bad shape and am a runner, so my cardio isn&#39;t bad. So I was surprised by this.

                                                Day 1 after shot: body aches, headache, blurry vision. Day 2 and beyond: excruciating abdominal pains, no appetite, inability to have a bowel movement or even pass gas. Had I known this level of agony would happen, I would have refused the vaccine, and I will NOT take the J&amp;J again.

After sleeping, woke up (about 24 hours after receiving the vaccine) feeling nausea and my head was aching.    After several hours of feeling nausea, I began to vomit.  I had only drank liquids since dinner the night before. Several days after the vaccine, I had a headache for 24 hours, with pain focused above my right eye.

It lasted for about 4 days and I began to take Pepto Bismol to help with the aches.  This was not a normal gassy event from food, the ache was different and not in a normal location.  I never had diarrhea or constipation and my appetite never went away. However, I did cut my food consumption in half.

At the time of arrival to the medical clinic, he had refractory nausea and vomiting after receiving Zofran earlier in the day at another clinical site. Medical treatment consisted of IV Fluid bolus with maintenance fluids, IV Phenergan for the nausea and vomiting, and IV Ketorolac for headache pain. His  symptoms resolved and he started to feel better so a clinical decision was made to discharge him home in the care of a close friend. He declined any other treatment modalities or medications at the time of the discharge.  The patient returned on 03/28/2021 with a right arm DVT proven on U/S. He was then started on anticoagulation therapy after specialist phone consult and will be closely followed.

It has almost been 2 months and I am still having exhaustion and migraines.

Then, after the first week of having the vaccine, I began to have these symptoms about once a week. Last week, it was on 5/6 when I gradually become colder regardless of layers and my stomach was repelling the idea of food (no vomiting or actual nausea). I went to bed and I was better by morning.   Yesterday (5/12), I had the same thing. Chills and the inability to stay warm, loss of appetite, and a sort of sleepy vertigo.

                                                About five hours after I received the vaccine I began to run a fever that averaged 102 degrees fahrenheit. At that time I also developed chills and extreme fatigue. These symptoms persisted until I fell asleep at 10:00 PM 3/13/21.  I was awakened at 1:00 AM with severe muscle spasms in my left bicep and a fever of 102.5 I started taking tylenol to begin reducing the fever. I also lost my appetite around that time. Things were pretty much the same all day 3/14/21. I went to sleep at 10:00 PM I got up every four hours to take tylenol. I woke up at 7:00 AM 3/15/21 to prepare for work my bed sheets and shirt were soaked with sweat but my fever was gone. I ate breakfast and drank a cup of coffee. When I got to work I begin having stomach problems.  When I started working I noticed that I was having a lot of trouble concentrating. I decided to leave early to go home and rest. Things have improved since then but I do have a headache that won&#39;t go away.

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

Took 2 Advil which did not seem to help much. Could not sleep all night and held cold pack on head to try to help headache. At 4:00 am was due to take 2 more Advil, and that finally seemed to help so he finally stopped having chills and could sleep. Woke up in the morning tired, but feeling better, symptoms pretty much gone.

Patient found to have a Hunt Hess 3 Fisher Grade 3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage with hydrocephalus s/p EVD,  s/p cerebral angiogram on 4/18 negative for aneurysm/AVM. On the evening of 4/20, patient became acutely hypoxic with wheezing for which he required oxygen via 10L oxymask. During 4/21, his oxygen requirements continued to increase with increased work of breathing requiring high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 50L/60%  &#43; pulmonary congestion on imaging and he was treated with diuresis. On 4/22, oxygen needs increased requiring 70L/100% with worsening imaging. He was then started on steroids, antibiotics were broadened, epoprostenal started in addition to diuresis. On 4/23, patient reports improved breathing and is on non-rebreather. Antibiotics, steroids, and epoprostenal were discontinued as patient showed improvement of oxygenation without clear signs of infection. Of note,  patient reports vaping in the past 2-3 months.  Patient has also been intermittently febrile. Wife was concerned that these symptoms were possibly related to him getting the J&amp;J vaccine on 4/11. Patient is currently still in hospital on day 6 of admission at this time.

The next morning at 4:45 am I woke with chills and moderate muscle , joint aches and random sharp muscle pains all over my hips, arms, and legs. Chills, aches, and fever continued until 8:30pm the same night. My fever would go to 102.8 as a high to 100.2 depending on how close I was to my next timeframe to take Tylenol.  I took 4 extra strength Tylenol (2000 mg) every 4 hours, give or take 30 minutes. Around 8:30 pm my fever broke and I sweated mildly Until around 10:30pm

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often.

Took 1000 mg of Tylenol and hydrated, another 500 mg 4 hours later. Chills came on and off throughout the day.   Added layers of clothing to stop the chills. Ate breakfast and lunch. Drank G2 to hydrate. Temp bounced between 99.6 and 100.8 throughout the day.  Experienced heartburn for several hours in the afternoon. Took a  nap at 3:30 for 2 hours, ate, rehydrated and removed some layers to clothing and put on a cool towel on my forehead to try to reduce.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol and went to  bed. Slept well. All symptoms were gone by morning.

His headache was getting worse.  All symptoms were getting better except the headache.  He thought he was feeling better but when he woke up today 4/6/2021 he was SOB and diarrhea was back. Pt has taken Pepto Bismol for his symptoms and will probably need to go to the ER since he is having trouble breathing.   He feels like he has had such a bad reaction to this since he possibly has had the covid vax in the past 90 days.

About a week later, I started coughing a lot. My head hurt,but i didn&#39;t run any fever. I thought I was having bad allergies from changing weather, but it lasted longer than usual, over a week. I was sore, tired, not really hungry. I feel better now, but I still have this lingering dry cough and it won&#39;t completely go away. I still feel sore and very tired. I get a headache every now and then. I thought it was allergies, but it falls into the time period that people are having reactions to this JJ Janssen shot. The cough is annoying. I get short breathed and winded rather easily or more easily now. I thought I&#39;d at least report it.

                                                On the day after the injection, a severe stiffness in both legs occurred.  It was a soreness and stiffness similar to the day after running a marathon race .  The soreness and stiffness would not change if I was sitting, walking, standing or kneeling.  It was constant discomfort and irritation.  It was not painful and therefore I originally did not go to medical.  There was no discomfort in my left arm at the injection site.  The discomfort increased for the rest of the day.  A headache started in mid afternoon and kept increasing throughout the rest of day.  I have not had a headache in years.  Around 7:00 PM on Thursday, I had to sleep.  I was extremely tired.  My body had chills and I had to wear a sweatshirt and full set of clothes to bed just to stay warm.  That is very unusual.  I am usually throwing off covers every night throughout the entire year.    I did not eat dinner because there was no appetite.  I slept in bed for at least 12 hours.  Typical night sleep = 8 hours.  The next morning was no issue and therefore I did not go seek medical help because there are supposed to be side effects to vaccines.  Now, I am reporting it because headache and the stiff muscles were identified on the news.  However, it was around 24-36 hours and not the 6 days on the news.

I fell asleep one hour into my arrival and slept for 17 hours. Up to and including today I am having headaches, pain in my legs on left side only, nausea, lack of sleep and a continued smell similar to dried blood after a injury. I have also have and continue to have shortness of breath and chest pains resulting in two panic attacks within the last three days. This has led me to report this and I have doctor visit scheduled for 4/22. I also reported today based on internet search of reactions.

                                                About 1 week after vaccination, I noted sensations of fullness or bloatedness.  It felt like gas trapped in my upper abdomen that could not be relieved by burping.  Within 2 days, I began to have pain in lower, left rib cage akin to side cramps/stitch after strenuous running, but persisted the entire day.  About 2-3 days later,  the pain intensified and spread throughout my diaphragm region (left and right sides).   Breathing was somewhat affected, after semi-strenuous activities, such as walking up/down stairs.  So, I avoided physical exercise, and took Advil for a couple days to minimize the pain.  After another 3-4 days, the pain in the diaphragm region subsided.  I have not experienced further discomfort for the past week (today is 4/21/2021).  No treatments were sought during this period.  I self-researched the symptoms and hypothesize the pain stemmed from a swollen spleen, which might have been caused by an overactive immune system due to the vaccine.

                                                I started sweating profusely within 30 min of the shot. Was light headed and dizzy for approximately 4-5 hrs. Once the sweating stopped I felt severe pain in both knees and ankles. If felt as if you were trying to snap my knees and ankles in half. That lasted 4-5 hrs. After I slept for a few hrs over night I woke up and felt pretty good. Approximately 3-4 hrs after I woke up I felt light headed and nauseated for approximately 3-4 hrs. I felt pretty much back to normal into the third day after the shot. I was slightly light headed and fatigued for approximately 8 days after the shot. After about the 8th day I felt normal again. I said I will never get that shot again. Approximately 25 years ago I had gotten my first flew shot and I was very sick for a week. Never received another flew shot again. Besides the stress and anxiety issues I am a healthy guy. Every 2 years we get full blood work up and my blood levels have always been spot on of where they should be.

                                                I received the shot at 1:11 pm. I felt sorta drunk and not safe to drive by 3 pm. Sorta woozy. By 7 I was  home and fell asleep and did not wake up until 4 pm the next day.   I was sleepy and felt terrible nausea and was sweaty three nights in a row.  By the 2nd night  I had a headache that was unbelievable.  I eventually took Tylenol 48 hrs after the shot and it barely helped the headache. I never ever get sick never have headaches. It was bad. I was also super super irritable and I am generally a happy person. I was so bothered by everyone I was sorta angry at them it was weird. By Sunday night my headache was even worse so bad in my neck on my left side that I had the shot, I could barely move my head. I took Tylenol recommended dose. I finally fell asleep on Sunday night 3 days later midnight sweaty again.   Monday morning I woke up and I never felt better. On top of the world amazing.  I felt not  just good but extra good. Ready to go for it all.  It was a very strange experience for over three days. I typically get the flu shot, I stay healthy and never had an experience like this, I don?t get sick luckily. Any I wanted to share this because it was so strange and no one warned me really. .  I have felt great since and am thankful I had the shot.

                                                Patient received Johnson&amp;Johnson COVID vaccine in the afternoon on 3/31/21. Patient reported having right arm pain, diaphoresis, chills, nausea, and muscle aches/pain in upper leg/lower back at 5:30am the following morning. Patient took 2 tablets of 500mg naproxen in the morning and in the afternoon. Symptoms did not resolve and patient had to leave work early. Upon getting home patient took 2 tablets of 650mg tylenol and symptoms resolved within 48 hours. On 4/3/21 patient reported mild to severe pain in heel of left foot. The following day the patient went to WellNow urgent care to get his heel examined. During examination provider noticed patient&#39;s lesions and patient stated more lesions have appeared since getting the vaccine.  1 on his stomach, 1 on the dorsum of his left foot, 1 on his back, 1 on his left elbow, in between his toes of his left foot, and in between the fingers of his right hand. Patient stated that these lesions cause a burning sensation and can become itchy. Patient was sent to Hopsital ED as provider at urgent care was concerned patient may have purpura. Patient was seen and discharged on 4/4/21 from the ED. The heel pain was determined to be plantar fascitis which was treated with at home exercises with a heel cup. The patient was given clotrimazole for his lesions. The patient had a follow-up visit with his primary care provider at hospital on 4/6/21 in which he explained the clotrimazole only made his lesions worse. Patient was referred to follow up with dermatology on 4/8/21. Primary care provider believes progression of the lesions since getting the vaccine leads to concern of an underlying autoimmune exacerbated by vaccine.

                                                Very bad headache, body aches, high fever and horrible pain in lower left abdominal area that lasted just over two days.  All symptoms have nearly abated aside from the abdominal pain.  However, abdominal pain is lessening each day.  If these are considered normal side effects or adverse effects, i am unclear of.   I just thought it would be best to report any effects to the vaccine.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes and abdominal pain from right him bone down to scrotum. Pain on 4/7 was such that i though i was suffering a hernia.  Couldn&#39;t get out of car or move my right leg across my body. Could put right leg into pants leg.  Hurt to bend over and do much of anything on 4/7.   Initially thought pain was in testicle but doesn&#39;t hurt at all to the touch.  Realized it more a swollen area in the groin between hip bone and scrotum.   Nothing hurts to the touch at all in that area either which lead my to believe it was swollen lymph nodes.  The  Feeling is as if i got hit in the right groin  and my testicle has been hit and discomfort is 8 inches above right testicle in my groin area.    It has been improving every day since then, the more i walk the better it is.  It only hurts when i sit now and it seems to aggravate it pretty well but once i start moving the pain goes away.  It has been 9 days now and the i don&#39;t notice it all day until i come back to the office and sit at my desk and again it gets aggravated and the discomfort feels like my right testicle is near my appendix  Since this all started my legs feel heavier in the calf and have little nerve sensations when i sit too, which concerns me about the blood clot possibility and so i have been emailing with my doctor.  I am going to make appt for Monday 4/19

                                                5 days post vaccination I experienced sudden onset of generalized hives associated with itchiness. After use of benadryl the hives became more red, less raised, and resembled a confluent measles rash. From association with hives I experienced ear pruritus, sore throat, nausea. And fatigue. Hydrocortisone creme was used on the rash.

                                                I received the Johnson and Johnson Covid 19 vaccine on 4/6/21 and the dose code is 041AZ1A. I received it at the Community Center.  I&#39;m writing because beginning with the evening after I received the Johnson and Johnson Covid 19 vaccine I&#39;ve been having abdominal / stomach cramps and stomach pain. Sometimes it is on the top of the abdomen / stomach, other times it&#39;s at the bottom. Sometimes it hurts to the point of waking me up in the middle of the night. This morning it started moving into my chest.  Do you know if this pain will subside shortly or what is known about this potential side effect? Is there anything I can do to mitigate the issue?  I&#39;m contacting my Dr for a visit.

I was also feeling tired and unsteady. 12 days after the shot I became very sick for 10 days with severe diarrhea, no energy,  stomach pains, weak, shaking, no more motivation.  I saw a doctor and was given antibiotics to stop the diarrhea. Now 1 month after I have no diarrhea but still get nausea and shakes . I feel very anxious and will see a therapist and prescribe medication for my anxiety that I have due to the vaccine reaction.  I took the vaccine so I can travel abroad much easier but now afraid to travel because of my symptoms.  I will get blood tested tomorrow to see if all is ok.  This vaccine is very dangerous as it has affected my DNA.

I took 2 Tylenol 650mg but it did not do anything. My temperature was high (reached 101). The whole thing lasted  few hours non stop. After that, I have light to moderate headaches almost every day (till this day)

                                                Around 5:00-5:30 PM (about 2 to 2.5 hours after the vaccination), I started to feel a bit tired.  I took Tylenol, beginning around 5:00 PM.   By 8:00, I was feeling tired enough that I went to bed early.  By 9:00, I had terrible chills and body aches throughout my body.   The aches were worse in my chest / torso -- maybe from so much shaking.  I did not watch any of the men&#39;s championship game that night.  I also felt nauseous but I seemed to lack the strength to vomit.  I can not remember a time when I had so much physical pain in my life.  My hands felt numb / tingling.  I tried to drink some ginger ale but drinking was difficult.  Although I was aware that I was breathing and my heart was beating, I thought that I might die.  The terrible pain continued for a few hours.  Around 10:30 PM, the pain dissipated.  However, after about 10 minutes of relief, the pain returned, perhaps worse than before.  At around 11:30, my wife came to bed.  She suggested that I try relaxing Yoga breathing.   I did that and the pain stopped and I fell asleep.   The next day, I woke up with a typical headache and took more Tylenol.  I continued to improve the remainder of the day.

Went to urgent Care on 4/8 where treated for severe dehydration and stomach aligment.  From 4/9 - 4/14 continued to suffer from same symptoms and then began to have heart taching, feeling as if there was a bubble in my chest.  Went back to Urgent Care on 4/14 and was again treated for dehydration.  Outcome is that no one knows why I have been feeling this way except for that it is a direct result of receiving the vaccine.

Just want to know if he died from Covid or an adverse reaction from Johnson and Johnson vaccine he received in jail. No one wants to test his blood. He&#39;s at the mortuary awaiting cremation, and I thought it best if some government entity drew some blood to determine if he&#39;s a Covid or vaccine reaction fatality.  Before they cremate his body.

                                                Day 15 after covid vaccine I woke up at 12:30am with extreme vertigo and nausea. It woke me up with violent spinning. I could not focus my eyes at all. I felt very ill. I almost threw up multiple times during the day and could not move my head up or down and to the left without spinning out of control. I saw the ENT later that day and he performed the Epley Maneuver on me. I followed his directions for home care but am currently still experiencing vertigo. The doctor told me it should dissipate within one week. It has not. I have never had vertigo in the past.

Fever kept going through the second night, developed several small itchy bumps on body, and also developed pain in lower abdomen.  On the third day went to an urgent clinic because of lower abdomen pain and felt as though my diverticulitis had started.  Was prescribed antibiotics, Flagyl and Cipro, for the diverticulitis.  Fever broke that night I believe.

After a few hours of rest, I felt fine again.

Next morning pain, swelling and nausea persisted. Medium intensity body aches and headache began late morning. By mid afternoon body pain increased to the point that I was no longer able to function and needed to lie down.  Took a 4 hour nap. Side effects persisted after waking up.  At time of writing, 28hrs after vaccine, I am still feeling the side effect although less severe. Ibuprofen and Tylenol  do seem to help.

                                                Early morning woke up with bad headache, diarrhea throughout the day,  vomited early evening all on Friday April 2nd.  Started to feel better in the evening and started to drink a bit of gatorade.  However Saturday morning April 3rd woke up between 6-7am and went to the bathroom and turned around to walk back out and blacked out - most likely dehydrated.   Fortunately did not fall down as my wife caught me slumped up against the wall and got me down to the floor.  After 5-10 minutes was able to get back to bed and after another hour or so was able to start drinking fluids and keep them down through the day.   By late afternoon/early evening had a small meal and was starting to feel better - never did have a fever (checked frequently on Friday and Saturday)

He went home and  laid down and fell asleep.  When he woke up he called his PCP because he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  His heart rate was running from 80-90 and fluctuating like he was about to have a heart attack. He was told to call back if he wasn&#39;t feeling better.  On 4/9  his heart  was running about 90-115.  On 4/10 his heart was running from 139-142.  He called his doctors office and they told him to go to the ER.  He went to hospital.   He was given heart  EKG, labs  and IV.  He was given aspirin.  His INR was at 2.  His heart rate came down to 115.   His blood was low.  His DX was Sinus Tachycardia.  He was admitted to the Heart Floor.  He was treated for 2 days and released.  They told him they thought he was reacting to taking the vaccination and to FU w/ PCP.  He said his heart rate is fluctuating  and is currently at 101.  He doesn&#39;t see a Cardiologist since he cannot have open heart surgery due to his underlying health conditions.

                                                After the Covid-19 Vaccine on Mar 26, 2021 I had an adverse reaction to something that may or may not be related.  On Friday, Apr 2, at 2:00pm I felt a weird case of Vertigo that lasted approximately 3 mins.  The next day, Sat. Apr 3, at around 9:30pm I had a longer very severe case of the vertigo.  I went to bed shortly afterwards.  On Sunday,Easter morning April 4, at 6:30am I woke up with a very severe case of vertigo (Meniere&#39;s Disease).  It lasted about 3 hours of sever heaving and extreme dizziness.  I could not cope and had to just lay there not knowing what was wrong/going on.  It finally went away after about 3 hours.  The next morning, Mon. Apr 5, I called my Dr  to make an appointment and went in 2 days later.  There were no other cases of it and he could not figure what caused it and I either could I.  So far so good that I have not had another reaction and feel fine today after nearly 3 weeks.  :-)

                                                After the injection on Friday 03/12 at 1:50 PM at facility, I started to get a slight temperature, Along with chills as well. This continue throughout the weekend. I remained at home and did not have any energy to go out and be around people. The next day, I also got diarrhea and was very dehydrated.  Immediately, after I left the vaccine shot location, like within 5 minutes, I started to smell fish and my mouth tasted like salt for three days. I also had excruciating headaches that did not go away with advil. So I rested a  lot and had no real big appetite what so ever!.  Today, I am concerned that on my left side below my left clavicle, I feel a big bump what appears to be possibly a lymphatic swelling of node? I am concerned because I did not have this swelling before and do not know if it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine.  Pls contact me via phone, this is urgent.  Thanks

After 48 hours from injection, headache is 90% improved. Took Advil, but that did nothing for headache.  It was the worst headache that I can ever remember having.  Extreme muscle pain in various parts of the body started at same time as onset of headache. This, too, died out as the headache got better.  Slight nausea on day #2.  No fever. Was steady at 96.6 throughout these adverse reactions.

                                                First 4 hours post injection no serious side effects, slight headache was settling in.  At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

Duration of blackout unknown. Woke up on floor not knowing how I got there. Sat up, nausea and lightheadedness returned, then dissipated with no further blackout. Felt rush of blood from head to toe and felt okay after that. Pharmacy staff took blood pressure, readings were close to normal (slightly elevated). Paramedics were called by pharmacy, and their BP readings were also close to normal. After all that, aside from some fatigue, no other appreciable side effects over the next 48 hours. No nausea, flu-like symptoms or fever, and very little soreness at injection site.

(15 Apr 2021) I contacted my healthcare provider at 8:10 am and selected the call-back option.  The healthcare provider called me back at 8:17 am. The healthcare provider will start case file contact patient before the day is over.  I took Imodium at 8:50 am.  Got a call from the doctor&#39;s office (10:19 am) with instructions: Take fiber and plenty of liquids.  I informed them I took an Imodium, directions changed to drink plenty of liquids and let it run its course. There is nothing they can do because the vaccine was already administered.

                                                Received Janssen Lot 1808980 at 10:15AM on 4/1/2021. No symptoms at first other than missing appetite. Around 9:00pm started to feel chills and tired with low grade fever (100 C). Around 1:30am started feeling right side back pain in my kidney area that woke me up. By 2:15am the pain was almost unbearable, and I could no longer lay in bed. At 3:00am I took 2x 500mg Tylenol as I debated whether to call my doctor or go straight to ER. By the 3:45am pain was subsiding and was I able to get back in bed by 4am. Today no pain.

                                                The next day, I woke up with fever 100.5 and chills - it lasted 24 hours - stayed the same temp for those 24 hours. Also at the same time, I  felt like someone was stabbing around the abdomen - felt like my usual stomach chronic pain  only it was worse than my normal chronic pain. My usual &#34;normal&#34; stomach pain is intermittent  - as far as it comes at times and goes and medications always help with it but this is different. It doesn&#39;t go away and it&#39;s all the time and my regular meds don&#39;t help.  And I have had that pain ever since the vaccine and it hasn&#39;t gone away. I&#39;m trying this: Herbal supplement - I started it three days ago - it&#39;s for gas and bloating and it seems to be helping my symptoms of pain a little bit. I have also started CBD oil and I do .50 mg at bedtime under the tongue and when I wake up my symptoms are a bit better.  On April 20th, I will see an IBS doctor.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, about 2-3 days after I developed flu like symptoms, chills and headaches. On the 6th day after my vaccine, I developed a lump on the right side of my throat which progressively got worse. I also experienced diarrhea which lasted three days. I went to see my PCP, Dr. who ordered a CT scan of my neck. The CT scan demonstrated I had an ulcer in my throat located in my larynx box. MY PCP  doctor then referred me to  an ENT doctor, Dr. The ENT doctor gave me antibiotics and a shot in my arm. My throat kept getting worse and the ENT doctor have me reflux medicine and Prednisone and Bactrum medication. Today I woke up feeling much better although the pain and swelling to my left side of my throat and ear has gone down but I still have a sore throat and ulcer and is being treated with medicine.
