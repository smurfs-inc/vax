                                                On March 11th at around 10pm I experienced severe shaking, fever, headache and delirium. The next day I improved but had a fever on and off of 99.1. I felt like I was stable, but felt dizziness increasing, and was lethargic through the weekend.   Then on Monday the 15th, I had a noticeable cramp in my right abdomen. At around 8pm CST I began feeling like I needed to burp and that I had GI problems.   The problems increased that night at around 10pm I had pain where the cramp started. Two hours later I started throwing up because of the pain and feeling of too much air inside of me. I could not stop vomiting after 2 hours so went to the Hospital ED at around 2:30 AM Tuesday the 16th.   I was admitted after a CT scan showed and white cell counts confirmed and infection and drastically enlarged appendix. I was diagnosed with an appendicitis and they immediately scheduled me for surgery.

                                                Experienced moderate debilitating flu symptoms day after vaccination and recovered the following day.  Over one week later (3/25) developed skin sensitivity on the neck which later spread to back, torso, and legs.  Skin sensitivity persists still one week after onset, is a severe chafing feeling when skin comes into contact with clothing.  No rash or any visual signs.  Along with the skin sensitivity, mild to moderate chills from day to day as well as muscle fatigue and upper/lower back pain.  Symptoms varied in severity day to day; used ibuprofen and it seemed to offer limited, temporary relief.  Concurrent with second onset of symptoms, noticed gradual abdominal inflammation and developed sensation similar to UTI but urine dip and lab test results were all normal.  Doctor concluded immune reaction to vaccine as no other allergies or changes in routine as well as no prior medical history of any of these symptoms. Prescribed daily prednisone for three days to calm immune response; after one day symptoms were greatly improved.  Abdominal inflammation has improved and UTI sensation improved.  Still experiencing slight chills and skin sensitivity unchanged.

I couldn&#39;t sleep well because I got the chills and a fever. I went to use the bathroom around 3am. All of a sudden I got really nauseous, the room spun, everything went black and I fainted in the middle of my bathroom. My wife woke up and helped me back to bed. The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after receiving the injection, I experienced extreme chills, nausea, elevated heart rate. The last time I experienced symptoms like this was on the first day I started chemotherapy and had an allergic reaction to one of the chemo drugs (bleomycin). I had a delayed reaction hours later and went to the ER. It was determined it was an allergy. So I took Claritin D 24 H and saw the symptoms I was experiencing last night dissipate.

By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

                                                After the initial 12 hour period, I experienced night-time chills followed then by being too warm and night sweats.  This happened both the first and second night.  During the day I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours for aches and pain.  Mainly my neck and back have been what hurts, although my knees, elbows, hips, etc. also were achy.  The third and fourth days I still continued to have chills, no fever throughout as far as I am aware (took my temp 2-3 times).  The fourth day I was very faint and somewhat unbalanced, felt shaky and light headed and I ended up having an anxiety attack.  I mention the last symptom as I have never had an episode like this previously in my life.  Today is day 5, still feel tired, slightly nauseous, neck and back pain, headache, difficulty focusing.

At that point, started getting chills, which progressed into mix of chills and hot spells, fever, headache, and frequent urination throughout the night (though was also hydrating a lot).  Had fever the next morning still and Diarrhea.  Still feel modest headache and chills the next evening (before bed where I had felt the worst overnight the first night of the vaccine) but feeling better than the first night.  Per the form I received, I was told to include Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA in this section of the form.  I am reporting this on the day after the vaccination, so don&#39;t yet know final outcome, but again, improving and don&#39;t feel like I need medical attention.

                                                About five hours after I received the vaccine I began to run a fever that averaged 102 degrees fahrenheit. At that time I also developed chills and extreme fatigue. These symptoms persisted until I fell asleep at 10:00 PM 3/13/21.  I was awakened at 1:00 AM with severe muscle spasms in my left bicep and a fever of 102.5 I started taking tylenol to begin reducing the fever. I also lost my appetite around that time. Things were pretty much the same all day 3/14/21. I went to sleep at 10:00 PM I got up every four hours to take tylenol. I woke up at 7:00 AM 3/15/21 to prepare for work my bed sheets and shirt were soaked with sweat but my fever was gone. I ate breakfast and drank a cup of coffee. When I got to work I begin having stomach problems.  When I started working I noticed that I was having a lot of trouble concentrating. I decided to leave early to go home and rest. Things have improved since then but I do have a headache that won&#39;t go away.

Within a half an hour I had a 102.5 fever. After 2 hours the chills had dissipated but my fever was at 103.5. I took acetaminophen and slept fitfully all night. The next morning at 6:00 my fever was still 102 and I felt weak. By mid morning the fever was finally gone and I was exhausted and mildly nauseous for the rest of the day.

Took 2 Advil which did not seem to help much. Could not sleep all night and held cold pack on head to try to help headache. At 4:00 am was due to take 2 more Advil, and that finally seemed to help so he finally stopped having chills and could sleep. Woke up in the morning tired, but feeling better, symptoms pretty much gone.

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often.

                                                Runny nose started maybe an hour or so after injection.  Felt slight nausea around 6:30PM until I went to bed. Woke up at about 1:30AM with mild nausea. Within about 30 minutes I experienced chills.  I hydrated and tried to go back to sleep.  In the morning I had a fever of 100.3 degrees.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol and hydrated, another 500 mg 4 hours later. Chills came on and off throughout the day.   Added layers of clothing to stop the chills. Ate breakfast and lunch. Drank G2 to hydrate. Temp bounced between 99.6 and 100.8 throughout the day.  Experienced heartburn for several hours in the afternoon. Took a  nap at 3:30 for 2 hours, ate, rehydrated and removed some layers to clothing and put on a cool towel on my forehead to try to reduce.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol and went to  bed. Slept well. All symptoms were gone by morning.

His headache was getting worse.  All symptoms were getting better except the headache.  He thought he was feeling better but when he woke up today 4/6/2021 he was SOB and diarrhea was back. Pt has taken Pepto Bismol for his symptoms and will probably need to go to the ER since he is having trouble breathing.   He feels like he has had such a bad reaction to this since he possibly has had the covid vax in the past 90 days.

                                                I received the shot at 1:11 pm. I felt sorta drunk and not safe to drive by 3 pm. Sorta woozy. By 7 I was  home and fell asleep and did not wake up until 4 pm the next day.   I was sleepy and felt terrible nausea and was sweaty three nights in a row.  By the 2nd night  I had a headache that was unbelievable.  I eventually took Tylenol 48 hrs after the shot and it barely helped the headache. I never ever get sick never have headaches. It was bad. I was also super super irritable and I am generally a happy person. I was so bothered by everyone I was sorta angry at them it was weird. By Sunday night my headache was even worse so bad in my neck on my left side that I had the shot, I could barely move my head. I took Tylenol recommended dose. I finally fell asleep on Sunday night 3 days later midnight sweaty again.   Monday morning I woke up and I never felt better. On top of the world amazing.  I felt not  just good but extra good. Ready to go for it all.  It was a very strange experience for over three days. I typically get the flu shot, I stay healthy and never had an experience like this, I don?t get sick luckily. Any I wanted to share this because it was so strange and no one warned me really. .  I have felt great since and am thankful I had the shot.

                                                Patient received Johnson&amp;Johnson COVID vaccine in the afternoon on 3/31/21. Patient reported having right arm pain, diaphoresis, chills, nausea, and muscle aches/pain in upper leg/lower back at 5:30am the following morning. Patient took 2 tablets of 500mg naproxen in the morning and in the afternoon. Symptoms did not resolve and patient had to leave work early. Upon getting home patient took 2 tablets of 650mg tylenol and symptoms resolved within 48 hours. On 4/3/21 patient reported mild to severe pain in heel of left foot. The following day the patient went to WellNow urgent care to get his heel examined. During examination provider noticed patient&#39;s lesions and patient stated more lesions have appeared since getting the vaccine.  1 on his stomach, 1 on the dorsum of his left foot, 1 on his back, 1 on his left elbow, in between his toes of his left foot, and in between the fingers of his right hand. Patient stated that these lesions cause a burning sensation and can become itchy. Patient was sent to Hopsital ED as provider at urgent care was concerned patient may have purpura. Patient was seen and discharged on 4/4/21 from the ED. The heel pain was determined to be plantar fascitis which was treated with at home exercises with a heel cup. The patient was given clotrimazole for his lesions. The patient had a follow-up visit with his primary care provider at hospital on 4/6/21 in which he explained the clotrimazole only made his lesions worse. Patient was referred to follow up with dermatology on 4/8/21. Primary care provider believes progression of the lesions since getting the vaccine leads to concern of an underlying autoimmune exacerbated by vaccine.

He went home and  laid down and fell asleep.  When he woke up he called his PCP because he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  His heart rate was running from 80-90 and fluctuating like he was about to have a heart attack. He was told to call back if he wasn&#39;t feeling better.  On 4/9  his heart  was running about 90-115.  On 4/10 his heart was running from 139-142.  He called his doctors office and they told him to go to the ER.  He went to hospital.   He was given heart  EKG, labs  and IV.  He was given aspirin.  His INR was at 2.  His heart rate came down to 115.   His blood was low.  His DX was Sinus Tachycardia.  He was admitted to the Heart Floor.  He was treated for 2 days and released.  They told him they thought he was reacting to taking the vaccination and to FU w/ PCP.  He said his heart rate is fluctuating  and is currently at 101.  He doesn&#39;t see a Cardiologist since he cannot have open heart surgery due to his underlying health conditions.

This was a bad one.  Glad I don&#39;t have to repeat the dose.

                                                After the injection on Friday 03/12 at 1:50 PM at facility, I started to get a slight temperature, Along with chills as well. This continue throughout the weekend. I remained at home and did not have any energy to go out and be around people. The next day, I also got diarrhea and was very dehydrated.  Immediately, after I left the vaccine shot location, like within 5 minutes, I started to smell fish and my mouth tasted like salt for three days. I also had excruciating headaches that did not go away with advil. So I rested a  lot and had no real big appetite what so ever!.  Today, I am concerned that on my left side below my left clavicle, I feel a big bump what appears to be possibly a lymphatic swelling of node? I am concerned because I did not have this swelling before and do not know if it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine.  Pls contact me via phone, this is urgent.  Thanks

After 48 hours from injection, headache is 90% improved. Took Advil, but that did nothing for headache.  It was the worst headache that I can ever remember having.  Extreme muscle pain in various parts of the body started at same time as onset of headache. This, too, died out as the headache got better.  Slight nausea on day #2.  No fever. Was steady at 96.6 throughout these adverse reactions.

                                                First 4 hours post injection no serious side effects, slight headache was settling in.  At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

Around 9:00pm started to feel chills and tired with low grade fever (100 C). Around 1:30am started feeling right side back pain in my kidney area that woke me up. By 2:15am the pain was almost unbearable, and I could no longer lay in bed. At 3:00am I took 2x 500mg Tylenol as I debated whether to call my doctor or go straight to ER. By the 3:45am pain was subsiding and was I able to get back in bed by 4am. Today no pain.
