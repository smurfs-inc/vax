He was cold and clammy. He never lost consciousness.  It took him a couple  minutes to &#34;come back&#34; to alertness and feel better.   Severe headache, chills starting and began asthma symptoms (wheezing) at 11;30pm the night of the injection.. 2 extra strength Tylenol did not help. He was very cold and the headache did not let up after several hours.  Eventually he had a bout of sweats and he reports he was soaked.  In the morning, at 8 am the headache was still severe...was sensitive to noise, light and touch. He was given 2 extra strength Tylenol at 8 and then 2 Advil at 10am, which finally began to reduce symptoms. He was not hungry, felt weak, and finally by late night he was feeling better.  In the morning on Saturday he awoke with a swollen left eye and blood shot in that eye.

I started to shake and took my temperature to find that I had 104.6 fever and took Tylenol 1000mg and tried to go to sleep. About 30 minutes later at 11pm I vomited so I went to talk to my parents. They took my temperature and it spiked to 106.7 knowing I had already taken Tylenol they grabbed ice packs and wrapped them in a towel and placed them under my armpits and behind my neck they also placed a damp cloth on my forehead and monitored my fever. At around 1145  my fever started to come down slowly to 104.2. Around 130am I ate a few crackers and took ibuprofen 600mg and the fever still slowly dropped at around 2am my fever was still at 102.4 at this time my  parents went to bed knowing that my body needed to continue to fight the fever. At 530am my father checked my temperature and it was normal.

                                                Patient received vaccination and immediately felt uneasy (nauseous, lightheaded). The patient leaned over and became quiet and was not responding to questions. Patient then leaned back up and went stiff and had symptoms similar to that of a seizure (arms and legs went stiff and was unresponsive to questions) for about 30-60 seconds (at this time the paramedics had already been called). Patient then regained control and felt awful (a 5 on a scale of 1-10) and then felt even more nauseous and had to spit up into a trash can. Patient was given a water bottle to help them relax and cool off because patient felt warm. Paramedics arrived and checked blood pressure and pulse but found everything within normal ranges except for a slightly low blood pressure. The paramedics did nothing else except offer a scan of the patient&#39;s heart in their ambulance which he was then rolled out on a stretcher.

                                                My son said his arm hurt badly, he then said he needed to go to the bathroom because he needed to vomit. Then he asked for water, then oxygen and then he said he was going to pass out. He reached for my hand and then he was ?gone? like the nurses surrounding us said. He was unconscious, his eyes were open but he wouldn?t speak and he wasn?t there, not breathing no pulse. They came and took his pulse and it was very low, if I can recall correctly it was 94? over 54? ?they brought him back with an ice pack on his neck, shoulders and lifting his legs.   He explained afterwards he felt like a weird sensation in his arm, the. It went up his brain, like electricity? ?and then went towards his ears and that?s when he said he can?t remember, started dreaming everything was black and came back to me saying: ?no, wake up? ? Wake come now??and he realized he had indeed passed out.  They said it was common for young healthy boys to have this side effect, faint.   I still feel I need to report this. It scared the life out of me, he was gone for seconds, seemed way too long!!!

He stated getting warm to the touch and started sweating profusely. About 4-5 minutes after the shot he said he was nauseous. About a minute later he threw up.  He said that throwing up helped a little. RPh asked if he wanted some orange juice. He said he did and he took a few sips. He continued to feel warm to the touch and was sweating quite a bit. He also was quite pale.  RPh continued to monitor him, providing cool compresses to forehead and back of neck and continued to have him sip on orange juice (drank about 20 ounces aver 30 minutes).  He reported feeling better at 10:45am (about 30  minutes after shot.) RPh kept him for observation for another 15 minutes at which time he felt good enough to go home. Girlfriend drove him home. RPh called to check on patient at 6pm. Girlfriend reported he was doing ok and hadn&#39;t had any other reactions. He had just been sleeping all day.

He experienced vertigo as well as nausea. He tried to text and it came out as a jumble of misspelled words and letters. He called me, his mother, and he was extremely hard to understand and couldn&#39;t say a complete sentence without using words that made no sense. Him being in college I was 1.5 hours away. We were able to contact a friend of his and she was able to go to his dorm room and they called the campus on call nurse line. After speaking with her she instructed them to call 911 because she thought he could possibly be having a stroke. Patient was transported by ambulance to ER.

I had a fever of 102 and was constantly switching between chills and sweating through my sheets. The room felt like it was spinning and I felt like I was going to puke. Lastly I started to get chest pain which was by far the most concerning part to me. I still have a headache and chills but the fever is gone, and I am recovering

Random bouts of tinnitus in both ears, switching off, never both ears at once. The arm pain and swelling in shot area lasted about two days,  but the nausea, ;over pain, and fatigue continued for the better part of 4 days after the shot. The tinnitus only happened a couple times about 1-3 hours after the vaccination then ceased. I did not get this verified by a doctor, but I suspect my liver pain was related to an inflammation in the liver associated with the vaccine, as in the past, pain around my liver area has been associated with inflammation of my liver during minor flare ups.

                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

                                                Patient was waiting in chair about 5 minutes after the vaccine when I heard him say he didn&#39;t feel too good. His skin color was pale and when I went up to see how he was he bent over and vomited. After he vomited he said he felt a lot better. I asked him to remain seated and asked for my tech in the pharmacy to call 911, but he then said no and that he was feeling better. He said he felt clammy just before he vomited. I asked him to stay seated and got him some cold water. He remained in the waiting area another 15 minutes after to make sure no further problems. After 15 minutes he was feeling fine and I reassessed and his color returned to his skin and I noticed some redness around inner portion of both thighs, but he said that was from his eczema and that it was there already.  Allowed him to leave at 1:15pm and told him to seek medical attention right away if he felt any issues regarding trouble breathing. I called him an hour later to check up on him at 1:30pm and he was feeling fine. He thanked me over the phone.

This morning, Monday 4/12/2021 I woke up at 4am in a puddle of sweat, and started puking at 530am. I puked at least every hour multiple times. My whole body felt as if it was vibrating, or falling asleep (the worst feeling I&#39;ve ever had.)

                                                It is now the next day, and I feel significantly better. I have pain at the injection site, some muscle fatigue, a little bit of a depleted appetite, tiredness in my eyes and head (likely due to lack of quality sleep), and a bit of sweating, but my pain has reduced to maybe a 2/10 or 1/10 (i.e., not even uncomfortable). I did end up getting decent sleep between 2 AM and 12 PM with only a few interruptions of family members checking on me. The only notable pain that is worrying me is abnormal soreness in my right wrist that is not the result of overuse, overextension, etc., although I was able to take care of that pain with another 3 Advil pills. I am considering scheduling a doctor&#39;s appointment, as I know the J&amp;J vaccine got recalled today for blood clots. My assumption is that because I am a healthy 20-year-old, my immune system overreacted to the vaccine, but I want to check to make sure that it doesn&#39;t cause any additional health problems.

After approx 1 minute patient leaned to his right side, so we decided to place him on the floor. Patient alternated between supine and right side. Patient reported feeling nauseas, so he was given an emesis bag. No vomiting occurred, but there was a fair amount of sputum he expelled. He denied any shortness of breath, heart palpitations, or chest tightness. 911 was called after the patient&#39;s mother requested we do so. EMS responders evaluated patient, and by the time they were done evaluating (approx 30min later) patient was sitting and talking without any further symptoms/complaints. Patient was offered transport for further evaluation via EMS, both patient and his mother declined.  Patient stayed at pharmacy for several minutes (approx 15) after EMS left.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

He then had chills, fever of 101.2.  His pulse stayed at 95-100 beats per minute for 2 hours.  I spoke to a nurse friend of mine who told me to give him Tylenol and Benadryl.  His pulse went down to 80 beats per minute.  His fever went higher during the night but eventually broke.  Next morning he was still running a low grade fever and took Tylenol the rest of day.  He also had diarrhea on 2nd day and exhaustion.  3rd day feeling better but still tired.  No fever or diarrhea today.

Extremely fast acting fever (temperature went from 98.6 to 100.5 in roughly 30 minutes) followed by nausea, pounding headache, and body aches/chills. Remedied by alternating very high doses of ibuprofen (800mg) and acetaminophen (1000mg or 1g) every two to three hours. This did not ever bring down the fever below 100 degrees. 3. Blurred vision around 29 hours after vaccine - advised to go to ER by triage nurse. ER doctor determined not to worry about, likely due to headache but not 100% sure.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Following the shot was the expected soreness. Then pain throughout my arms like pins and needles  began about 8 hours later. I self treated with Tylenol. After going to bed, I woke at 5am nauseous and in pain. I was freezing  even though I would normally be fine. I was shaking which made the pain in all of my limbs and back hurt more. The day following the injection, the pain and nausea didn&#39;t go away. It hurt to pick up and hold things. It is now two days after injection and I keep fighting nausea after eating. I keep stretching and it barely keeps the soreness in my arm at bay. I can feel my hands starting to cramp just from typing this even though I would normally be fine.

                                                12 hours after vaccine I got chills, fever, nausea. Felt better next day with just fatigue and lightheadedness. Tuesday after the vaccine I got diarrhea with constipation along side the fatigue. Those symptoms lasted throughout Thursday. Friday night after the vaccine I got small haves around my head, neck, and upper back that would not away after an hour or two. That continued throughout Saturday and midday trough Sunday. Sunday I had shortness of breath after moving some water bottle cases around and lightheadedness along with the small hives at around 2pm I went to the ER to get checked out. Doctors said it was a reaction caused  by the vaccine. They gave me Benadryl for the reaction and injected me with a &#34;Steroid&#34; to the my upper buttock. I don&#39;t remember the name of what they injected with me. It is now Monday April 19th a day after the ER and I feel much better. The Benadryl made the  hives go away.

Woke up around 11:40 PM and threw up. Ran fever of 102.2 F. To lower fever, took &#34;nimesulida&#34; (Spanish), kept ice bag on head and sprayed alcohol on feet.  Fever lowered around 1:00 AM. Slept the rest of the night. Felt tired and with a slight headache, similar to that of a sinus infection, coming and going throughout the next day (April 11), so stayed in bed. Symptoms were gone by the night. No more symptoms starting on April 12 and after that date.

I had already instructed him to sit on the floor if he started feeling faint  as he stated previous fainting episodes as a kid. He sat on the floor, then laid on the floor. I brought him a garbage can in case he got sick, an ice pack, wet paper towels, and a bottle of water. After 5 minutes or so the color came back to his face and he started feeling much better. He then sat back in the chair, then stood up and stated he was feeling back to normal. I asked him to stay standing an extra minute just to make sure he was good, then he left with the woman who was with him during the vaccine.

Approximately  5 minutes post-vaccination patient&#39;s mother reported that the patient was feeling lightheaded, and shortly after the patient vomited. He stated he felt as though he had a fever coming on. The patient was given a bottle of water while EMS was called. EMS arrived to the scene shortly after the call and assessed the patient. Patient denied going to the hospital and left soon after. Patient reported to EMS that he was feeling anxious/nervous and this likely contributed to his adverse effects. No futher harm to patient.

                                                I gave a 21yo male a Janssen vaccine approximately 508p on 5/15. Vaccination was routine and the patient walked to the observation chair.  Around 520p, an acquaintance of the patient came up asking for a vomit bag.  I went out to the observation chair with a small trash can and paper bag and at 522p the patient stated he felt dizzy and vomited.  My technician stayed with the patient, and I went to the pharmacy to grab paper towels, a new mask, and a bottle of water. I came back and asked the patient how he was feeling (524p). He said that he felt much better after vomiting. I asked if he wanted a cold pack or water, and he took the bottle of water and denied the cold pack. I asked him to continue to stay for observation. At 537p, I went out to see how the patient was feeling.  He stated he was feeling better and was no longer dizzy. At 538p (30 minutes after vaccination) the patient stated he felt comfortable to leave and continue shopping in the store with his acquaintance.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine (LOT#201A21A) in his left arm at approximately 14:43 on 5/25/21. During the 15 minute observation period, he expressed &#34;I don&#39;t feel well&#34; and endorsed dizziness/ lightheadedness, slight tingling feeling in fingers, and nausea. Shortly thereafter at approximately 14:50, he started to slouch and appeared faint while sitting in a chair with eyes closed. He did not fall or hit any part of his body. He was easily aroused with a touch on his arm and responded to verbal questions immediately. He denied trouble breathing, chest pain, palpitations, headache, muscle weakness, vision changes, skin reactions, swelling. He was oriented x3 and not exhibiting verbal or swallowing problems. His vitals were normal- HR 80 bpm and BP 105/80 mmHg. He was offered a receptacle to vomit in if needed; however, he did not vomit. This initial reaction was consistent with potential vasovagal reaction/ near-syncope after vaccination.   Patient was encouraged and instructed to sit on the floor to prevent injury in case of fall but he refused. Staff offered him water, a fan, and opened windows while monitoring.   Later while waiting for a ride at around 15:10, he endorsed headache (first above his eyes and then toward the back of his head) and clarified this did not feel like a typical migraine that he has had before. Then at around 15:20 he endorsed vision changes in his right eye- he could not see a portion of vision out of that eye except peripheral vision and described not being able to see writing on the right side of a whiteboard in front of him in the room. Later he described a resolution of that gap in vision but then had blurry vision out of that eye. He denied any vision changes in the left eye.   Due to alarming symptoms of vision changes and onset of headache, patient was recommended to go to ER for further observation and evaluation. He was not in urgent distress and patient did not wish for EMS to be called but agreed to go to ER when his emergency contact picked him up.    Patient&#39;s emergency contact came to pick up patient at approximately 15:40 and was recommended to take him to the ER. Patient and emergency contact were amenable to this plan. He was able to stand up and walk to the car without issues.

A few minutes later, he started feeling lightheaded and called his father. His father notified me that he was &#34;spazzing out/seizing&#34; with his head jerking backwards &#34;for a couple seconds&#34;. When I saw the patient, he was sitting and unresponsive to verbal and physical stimuli with his father patting his cheek. After a minute or so, the patient was able to respond, but his voice was faint. He reported having a &#34;severe headache&#34; and feeling &#34;sweaty&#34;. He had no fever or difficulty breathing. Father said there was no anaphylaxis, and asked for a bucket since the patient felt very nauseous. I then called 911 for emergency services. When I returned to the patient after the call, the father said he was feeling much better and that the &#34;color had returned&#34;. Patient was unwilling to stand, and remaining symptom(s) was headache. Emergency services came and checked blood pressure, which was normotensive (SBP 111). Father insisted ER visit was not necessary.

                                                Vaccine given at 3:35pm. Asked him how he was feeling at 3:40pm. Patient replied &#34;not too good.&#34; Patients was visibly pale and sweaty, but did not lose consciousness. He was able to walk back into the consultation room for BP monitoring. BP was 105/45 P 54. Patient admitted to a fear of needles and a history of anxiety. Also said he had not eaten today. BP measured again at 3:45pm --106/55 P 58. Gave patient a pack of peanut butter crackers and a water and rechecked BP at 4:00pm--104/57 P 65. Patient did not know the name of his regular doctor, so we called a clinic in town that he went to in May 2020 for a baseline BP reading.  NP clinic reported that his BP at last visit was 120/72. BP at 4:10pm had dropped back to 99/46 P 62. Declined EMS service, but I did make him call a family member to come get him since he had driven himself. Advised family to keep an eye on him and to take to ER if he declines. Patient stated that he felt better, but was hungry. Released to family at 4:20pm.

His brother reports that patient was sitting there and his eyes rolled back in his head and he fell off his chair and hit his head/right eye. Employee got out there and he was a bit combative and saying &#34;whats going on, whats going on&#34;. I asked him to sit down and employee called 911. We put pressure on his eye area to stop the bleeding. He was sweating, shakey, pale, and nauseous. Paramedics arrived quickly and eventually took him away on a strecher. Update: mom came back a couple of hours later to thank us and let us know that he is home and resting. He did get 3 stiches by his eye and the reason they took him via strecher was because his blood pressure was staying so low while they were here.

                                                I first started developing chills and a mild fever about eleven or twelve hours after taking the vaccine. My entire body felt like burning and a headache came up not long after the fever.  I could barely fall asleep at night due to body ache and excessive sweating. The headache and body pain persisted till the next morning, and as of I am writing this response now, I feel extremely weak and I have no appetite at all.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  The vaccine was given at 10:45 AM. At 4:00 PM I began feeling nauseous. At 9:00 or 10:00 PM I began feeling both muscle and joint pain on my upper body which made it somewhat difficult to sleep. After one or two hours of sleep at 1:00 AM I woke up with a fever, headache, and worse muscle and joint pain (upper body only). When I woke up I was sweating profusely that the bed was lightly wet and extremely hot from all the heat my body was letting go. An ice pack can relieve the headache and fever. However, I was still not able to sleep. At 4:00 AM I made the decision to consume 800 mg of ibuprofen and it took 20 minutes for my headache and fever to go away. Yet, after being able to sleep for 30 minutes, I woke up again to the same headache and fever. Around 10:00 AM the symptoms were partly gone and was finally able to get sleep after a long night.

Once I awoke at around 6pm, I had irritated eyes, extreme nausea, extreme dizziness, insatiably low body temperature, extreme shivers, migraine because of my head uncontrollably shaking, and dry mouth. I felt like I was in 20 degree weather and nothing I could do would heat my body up. My body grew so tired from the uncontrollable shaking that I could not get out of bed to get my phone to call 911. Every symptom I was experiencing was not mild and was to the level of extreme. This lasted until around 9am. I have been slowly recovering since then (currently almost 9pm) and feel only 70% back to normal.

It&#39;s been going on for close to over a month and I&#39;m currently taking Acid Reflux medication, Vomiting and Nausea medication after going to the a gastroenterologist to which they didn&#39;t find anything doing an endoscopy that occurred on April 12th, 2021. Still waiting on the biopsy. With medication, current only symptom is painful stool (due to medication most likely) and after eating, burning in the throat (most likely due to acid reflux type symptoms). Only able to eat a certain amount before throwing up again.

About 10 - 15 minutes later the pt was feeling light headed, nauseous, sweaty, and felt like he was going to faint. I attended to the patient, laid him on the ground bein case he fainted (which he did not), put his feet up, and asked him how he was feeling. The pt stated he felt better after laying down for a couple minutes and sat back up in his chair. I gave the pt the pt water and Gatorade and told the pt he would need to hang out for about 15 minutes longer. Pt stated he felt fine and 100% and requested to leave.

                                                After patient received vaccine, another patient shouted that he needed help. Came back out of pharmacy to find patient passed out but he came to quickly. He was very pale, sweating and complaining of nausea. Got patient ice packs, water and Gatorade and after about 20 minutes patient was feeling well enough to leave with his father.

                                                Pt passed out in chair about a minute or so after administration of vaccine. He brought along his girlfriend who was in the consultation room with him. Prior to administration, pt informed me that he was afraid of needles.  After administration, we discussed the type of needle that was used (vanish point syringe) and the mechanism of how it works. He seemd anxious so I advised that it was ok for them to sit in the room for a few minutes instead of getting up to wait in the lobby, I left the door open for them.  I walked back into the pharmacy and his girlfriend alerted me that he had passed out. He regained conscious within a few seconds. I advised he sit with his head between his legs, as he mentioned feeling light headed, feeling hot and sweaty. he threw up a little into the trash. pt sat in room for at least 30 minutes until he felt better. was given a few cups of water while sitting. did not leave until he felt comfortable and no longer light headed. pt mentioned that his last vaccine was about 2 years ago and the same response occured then.

His blood pressure was 118/82 mmHg, pulse 81 bpm, and respirations 16 bpm.  He said he felt like his throat was closing, so we gave him liquid diphenhydramine. At this point, we called 911. The patient was alert and talking the whole time.  The patient went with EMS. The patient came back later after being released from the hospital and said that he didn&#39;t have an allergic reaction, but he had vasovagal syndrome.

                                                12 hours after receiving vaccination I woke up with severe cold chills, heart burn, and body aches. I took Tums, Pepto, and other prescriptions to try and alleviate those pains. None of those worked so around 5:30- 6pm (4/25/2021), I went to ER. When I went in they took blood work, a urine sample, and then gave me Iv fluids, and other medications. The Dr. confirmed that I was dehydrated, and I had a normal reaction to the shot. I was in the ER for about 2-3 hours, and then they let me to go home. I went to work the next day.

                                                After taking the vaccine husband started to feel a bit dizzy then 30 seconds later his whole body when into a shock and no longer control himself and started to shake a little. He had his eyes open but was unconscious for about 1 minute. Then he released his bladder and peed on himself. The pharmacist noticed and came over then he responded and was consious again. Then he began to sweat excessively all over his body. His face turned pale and the pharmacist began taking his blood pressure which dropped very low. He then began to feel nauseated. Then he started to get body chills. We monitored my husband there for another 30min and he slowly was coming back to his normal self. He had a small headache but was fine enough to leave.

Nausea lasted approximately 30 minutes, trembling lasted about 45 minutes.  Important to note that I previously had COVID-19 60-70 days prior to vaccination. The symptoms from the vaccine were significantly worse; however, they appear to have lasted for a much shorter period.

                                                I got th eJassen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at 10:50am. When the needle was removed, blood ran down my arm. That has never happened, but it might have been the nurse. I had nausea for a few minutes afterwards, but I think that was due to the blood. I didn&#39;t feel like eating after the shot. Hours later, around 5pm or so, I started to feel hypersensitive and weak. I also started to have a fever that went up to 102.2 farenheit before decided to take ibuprofen.  I had shakes, a heartbeat of 146, and a headache. It lasted all through the night and into the next day. Around 11:20am, whenever I moved my head, I would feel pain in my head. By the end of this day, I started to feel more like myself. By the start of the third day, all I had was pain in my left arm from the shot. It was strange that the pain got worse from Day 1 to Day 3, but that might be from how the vaccine was given and the blood that ran down my arm at that time. Another thing is my appetite has gone down a lot. I don&#39;t want to eat and when I do, I just want to stop. It&#39;s been a couple days, so I&#39;m hoping my appetite will come back.

I had a fever of 101 all day long, a headache, my body was aching from head to toe, extreme lethargy, and occasional bouts of extreme nausea as well as throwing up twice. As of the following day (March 18), almost two days since receiving the shot, I feel pretty much completely normal again aside from a slight headache and some pain at the injection site still. I experienced some pretty bad side effects that only really lasted a day.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Roughly 1 hour after vaccination I started to experience nausea and fatigue. The fatigue continued for several hours until about 6-8 hours after vaccination. At that point I started to experience chills, muscle aches, and rash on my left arm (at injection site region) and over other parts of my body. Temperature at that time was still within normal range but close to 10 hours after I began to run a fever. Highest temperature at its peak was 100.3F. These symptoms continued into the night but began to considerably subside in the morning, close to 24 hours after vaccination. At this point, 26 hours after, I still feel mild muscle aches and a mild headache.

I gave him some water and a cookie. He said he felt better after consuming the cookie. I had him sit in a chair outside my counseling room and to knock if he continued to feel unwell. After 10 minutes, the patient said he was feeling much improved. I had the patient wait another 20 minutes before leaving. The patient left feeling normal again.

These symptoms lasted all night, but felt better in the morning. These symptoms were like COVID but x5. When I had the COVID-19 virus, my symptoms were not as bad as yesterday?s adverse effects from the vaccine. At 3 AM, I was considering going to the hospital and I have never been hospitalized before. I could barely open my eyes since the headache was so bad.

Upon walking to the subway station, I felt overwhelmed with sudden depressive thoughts and anxiety.   On the Subway, I had a very severe, and disturbing panic attack. My vision became blurred and distorted, my heart rate spiked, and I became nauseous and extremely frightened. I sat down to try to maintain a sense of calm - but got off the subway after a few stops and met with a friend whom I had texted, to take care of me. From the point on, I was very shaken and agitated, and have been since the event.    I have never experienced anxiety, depression, or any such symptoms in my life before, nor was I nervous or anxious about having received the vaccine. The onset of the event was sudden, and seemingly out of nowhere, without real purpose, hence my conviction that it may have been spurred as a side effect from the vaccination.  I went to Urgent Care Sunday morning, April 11th, the morning after the event. My resting pulse was 97 BPM (normally 52-54) - and my blood pressure much higher than normal - 175/110. The doctor insisted I go home &#34;and relax&#34;.    I still feel uneasy and shaken from the event.

                                                At roughly 4pm the day of vaccine I started to feel generally sore in my muscles. At around 7pm I started to become light headed, had a headache, and bad muscle pain. My fever at this point measured 102f. These negative effects increased over the next few hours until I fell on the floor and couldn&#39;t get up without help from my wife. I felt like I was going to pass out every five seconds, threw up twice, my muscles kept contracting and relaxing and were intensely painful. Around 12:30am Saturday morning we went to the emergency department. I needed a wheelchair to get around. The wait at emergency was too long, and by 3am we went back home. I was feeling slightly better, but still not great, and my fever had reduced. I rested on Saturday with less severe but still considerable symptoms, and took paracetamol. Now on Sunday I feel sick and a little sore and very tired, but mostly better.

                                                (Saturday)When I came home after I received the vaccine I didn&#39;t really have anything to do, so I decided to take a nap and rest. I think after I woke up is when I started to feel the side effects. I can&#39;t remember exactly but I started feeling cold. I didn&#39;t think too much of it I just thought it was a cold day (which was quickly turning to night). Later that night I started feelinga bit dizzy and my head was hot but I still had chills. Since I had a had a blanket with me, and I think I was starting to feel what would become muscle aches, I just didn&#39;t want to move from the couch to my room. Feeling chills the rest of the night, I realized it was bad choice, since one of my family members left a window open. The cold air of the night really exacerbated my chills. Despite the cold I was still able to sleep, but the next day (Sunday) I did have a slight cough which I think was from experiencing the cold air of the night and not a side effect from the vaccine. (Sunday) This is when I really felt all the side effects. I felt weak, chills, headache, dizziness, muscle aches,(I&#39;m not sure if I had a fever, I couldn&#39;t think clearly my head felt hot). I haven&#39;t had a hangover but I think that is what it would feel like to have one. I basically slept most of day Sunday ; This time in my room with  3 blankets (light blankets )and heat up (felt like 80°F under blankets). I was sweating under the blankets but it really helped warm me up and alleviate my chills. I woke up later that day to a call to help my sister with some work. I couldn&#39;t drive, felt weak and dehydrated(dark orange/yellow pee), but she insisted so she picked me up and scolded me for not eating anything all day(besides the side effects I mention, I think I may have also lost my appetite because I felt dizzy). I was still feeling my head aching after I woke up, still had muscle aches and a slight cough too. It was raining that day so I put on a winter coat with layers underneath to help with my chills. At her home she gave me a Gatorade (and water) which I think really helped since I was sweating a lot under the blankets when I fell asleep. She also gave me some home cooked meals she made. The combination of drinks, food, and familial concern really helped me recover. By Monday my cough was gone and the side effects had worn off to the point that I could go to work safely.   My mother &amp; father also received vaccine at the same time I got it. My father also experienced side effects but his started later with the most effects felt on Tuesday. My mother did not get any side effects.

The headache went away before the appointment (did not take any medication); however the headache returned about 10 minutes after I got vaccinated. A few hours later the headache converted to a migraine resulting in increased nausea. Overnight I developed a fever. Within 24 hours, all the symptoms were gone. At this time I have fully recovered from all side effects but am monitoring my heath to see if anything else comes up.

                                                A week and a half approximately after the initial vaccination of the J&#43;J covid vaccine I started having a course of strange symptoms. Insomnia, inability to focus on things directly in front of me (a hand in front of my face would go out of focus automatically after a second), blurred vision, short term/long term memory loss, severe emotional issues, difficulty breathing, anxiety. Shortness of breath at a certain point was so bad I thought I was not going to make it. One very troublesome symptom that culminated after weeks of 4 hours of sleep was that my brain started feeling &#34;funny&#34;. The best way to describe it was a brain &#34;orgasm&#34; which I have never experienced before. At the same time I experienced dry heaving for several minutes, and severe shortness of breath. After this experience my symptoms gradually improved over the next week or two. Prior to this it felt like my brain was not getting enough oxygen/blood, which could have been feeding my insomnia. When I would try to sleep, I would wake up at 4 am gasping for air, as I felt like my breathing was labored when sleeping. I could not focus on my computer screen to do my job at home. Large amounts of melatonin seemed to help my brain feel better and get some rest. I took hydroxyzine for unrelated reasons prior to the vaccine injection as needed, however not too often. During  March I did not take it, as I had experienced disruptions in circadian rhythm due to the medication. I feel it is possible I had a blood clot that has been described in the news, although now there may be no way to know for sure. I talked with  my primary care physician about this, and he did not think this was the case because I was male. However I have a BMI of 18.7 and some issues females have such as TMJ and inability gain weight/anorexia diagnosis when younger. I also was recently diagnosed with an only recently described actual medical issue called R-CPD, which is the complete inability to burp or belch. I felt like during the time when I experienced the side effects, that this condition was heightened (bloating/loss of appetite). I lost quite a bit of weight during March, I usually weigh 135-140, and was down to 115 at a certain point. I am now back up to 130.   I now take sertraline at 1/4 pill dosage to treat the anxiety I experienced as a result of these symptoms as well as some other personal issues. I experienced severe side effects from the sertraline taking it at full dosage, and still experience some at 1/4 pill dosage.

Around 9:00 a.m. or so that same morning, I went to  Emergency room because I was so sick I didn&#39;t know what to do. They said I was just having a reaction to the vaccine, and it should go away in a day or so. They gave me Ibuprofen and Tylenol and a shot of toradol. I was then discharged and went back to my living quarters. I had covid already back on January 20th 2021. But the vaccine was five times worse than the virus.

                                                He got his vaccine, he had the fever that evening. Overnight he started vomiting some brown gunk that looked like dried up blood from 1:00-2:00 AM. He did not have much of an appetite. This continued the following night around the same time.  Then he started vomiting again the third day after the vaccine, and he vomited after work and was pretty much vomiting nonstop and started having difficulty in swallowing. Feeling fatigued. On Thursday morning at 2:00 AM he went to the ER on 4/29/21 and they prescribed him some anti-vomiting medication. That worked for about a day. On Friday he started spitting into a cup and spit about 3-5 cups of spit. On Saturday he went to the hospital on 5/1/21 and looked in his throat and said that he had some acidic burns from the vomiting and prescribed him Ondansetron 4 mg for the vomiting, which he did not take much of. They also prescribed him Diphenhydramine elixir to soothe his throat which he took every 6 hours which worked like wonders he said. He started to feel better after that point. He tested negative for COVID in the negative. He did have COVID in November of 2020, and he had vomiting at that time as well.  He was sick with COVID for about a week. He did not have much of an appetite either. He also felt very fatigued and felt better following Thanksgiving and tested negative the Monday after Thanksgiving. The fatigue symptoms lasted about 3 weeks after he tested negative, so he was sick for about a month in total.

Patient was told to remain seated and was monitored by pharmacist and staff. After 20 minutes, he was still not feeling well. He was moved into a different observation area. Based on symptoms it appeared he was having a a vasovagal reaction. He did not want to lie down and elevate his feet. At approximately 1/2 hour, he became nauseous and threw up. We continued to monitor him. He still had a headache and said he felt off. He had no swelling in the face and was speaking without issue. No hives were noticed. Patient said he was having a hard time breathing- I suggested he remove his mask to get more fresh air. After removing the mask, he said it felt better to breathe. In total, patient was monitored for 3 hours. He did not lose conscience, exhibit facial swelling or hives.  Patient went back to work for 1 hour then left to go home.  Prior to receiving the shot, patient showed a lot of anxiety and was hesitant to get vaccine. In the end, he decided he wanted to get it. Per medical staff at his work, he does tend to be high stressed and anxious. I followed up with patient on 6/22/21. He stated that he was feeling a lot better. He did have redness at the injection site- I explained he could ice the area. He still had a headache= I instructed him he could take a pain reliever. He mentioned he had a purple spot on his back. I asked if he had any other spots and said he would have to check. I suggested he contact his PCP and make an appointment to be seen.

OTC fever reducers helped bring the fever down eventually. The entire day (3/20) my fever was on and off and nausea would also be present. Bouts  of feeling well and bouts of fever. Had a minor fever when going to sleep that day and the fever was gone when waking up on 3/21. So ~24 hours of side effects.

                                                Thursday 4/8: 3:20pm: COVID injection given in right arm  Friday 4/9: ~1:00 am: woke up shaking with chills and severely cold; had slight headache. Had insomnia all night.   6:00 am: woke up with bad headache, slight fever.   7:00 am: got out of bed and had vertigo and was running into walls trying to walk to my living room, along with the worst migraine I?ve ever had. Also had dizziness, nausea,  chills, 100&#43;degree fever, aches, skin sensitive to touch, and severe tinnitus. All of the veins were visibly popping out of my head.   As the day went on, everything got worse. Any time I moved, my head would throb so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.   3:45 pm:  the headache started to finally go away. It would only hurt if I moved fast. At this point my fever was only slightly high, about 99 degrees. I was still unstable when I walked and dizzy. I went from being super cold, to being super hot and sweaty. And I was alternating between cold &amp; hot and sweaty for the rest of the night. Was also having some memory issues, repeating things when I was having a conversation with someone over the phone.   I was sweating all night when I was sleeping.   Saturday 4/10: 7:00am: woke up with a slight headache; still out of it and dizzy.   8:00am: after being awake for about an hour or so, I looked in the mirror and my whole face (around the lips, cheeks, and jawline, and under the eyes) was really swollen and puffy. My face was even mis-colored. Under my eyes was purple and yellow, and my cheeks were white.   Some confusion persisted throughout the day as well as dizziness.
