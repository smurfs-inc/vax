                                                Patient reported running a fever last night after getting vaccinated yesterday afternoon. She did not have any rashes on her face till she threw up this afternoon and then she stated that she had rashes all over her face and it was itchy. I advised her to take some antihistamine and she had cetirizine 10mg at home and she took one tablet. And then I advised her to go to the ER.

                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

After approx 1 minute patient leaned to his right side, so we decided to place him on the floor. Patient alternated between supine and right side. Patient reported feeling nauseas, so he was given an emesis bag. No vomiting occurred, but there was a fair amount of sputum he expelled. He denied any shortness of breath, heart palpitations, or chest tightness. 911 was called after the patient&#39;s mother requested we do so. EMS responders evaluated patient, and by the time they were done evaluating (approx 30min later) patient was sitting and talking without any further symptoms/complaints. Patient was offered transport for further evaluation via EMS, both patient and his mother declined.  Patient stayed at pharmacy for several minutes (approx 15) after EMS left.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

At 3 am headache was migraine strength and was having full body aches (except for arms), extreme lower back and lower abdominal pain (he said it must be like what women experience in labor or during their menstrual cycle).   He got up and took temperature (normal) and blood ox (100 %SpO2 on two fingers).  He got a wet rag for eyes and tried to fall asleep.  He said he felt hot with cover on and cold with cover off.   At 5:50 am his father gave him two Motrin (400mg total), applesauce and a ice pack for his head and back.  I checked on him thru-out day and he seemed restless.  He woke up at 3 pm on 4/8/2021 said headache and major back pain/abdominal pains were gone. He still feels slightly achy, but fine otherwise. as of 8:24 pm.

Within 10 more min encountered numbness in his face &amp; his arms began to have sensation of, &#34;dead weight&#34; along w/nausea &amp; unable to move rt. hand.  VERY lightheaded all along. We had to travel due to limited supply.  His symptoms mimiced a stroke; however, it was determined that it was a severe nuerological reaction &amp; not a stroke. After arrival at the hospital his face felt fully numb &amp; he was unable to smile, like normal. Lower extremities were fine. 102.5 fever next a.m. w/headaches, fatigure and aches that week.

I had a fever of 101 all day long, a headache, my body was aching from head to toe, extreme lethargy, and occasional bouts of extreme nausea as well as throwing up twice. As of the following day (March 18), almost two days since receiving the shot, I feel pretty much completely normal again aside from a slight headache and some pain at the injection site still. I experienced some pretty bad side effects that only really lasted a day.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Roughly 1 hour after vaccination I started to experience nausea and fatigue. The fatigue continued for several hours until about 6-8 hours after vaccination. At that point I started to experience chills, muscle aches, and rash on my left arm (at injection site region) and over other parts of my body. Temperature at that time was still within normal range but close to 10 hours after I began to run a fever. Highest temperature at its peak was 100.3F. These symptoms continued into the night but began to considerably subside in the morning, close to 24 hours after vaccination. At this point, 26 hours after, I still feel mild muscle aches and a mild headache.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on 3/19 at 8pm. 7 hours later ~3am I awoke to severe chills, climbing fever, and nausea. OTC fever reducers helped bring the fever down eventually. The entire day (3/20) my fever was on and off and nausea would also be present. Bouts  of feeling well and bouts of fever. Had a minor fever when going to sleep that day and the fever was gone when waking up on 3/21. So ~24 hours of side effects.
