                                                Friday night at about 10ish I suddenly got a terrible migraine, shaking uncontrollably, and my body have stiff. I tried going to bed at 11pm, but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. I got up sometime around 2am and I still had all of these along with extreme nausea. Check my temperature, it was 101.4 F. Got more blankets and tried to get some sleep, but took a while due to the migraine.   At 7:30am, the shaking was gone and the migraine was not as bad, but I still had a temperature of 99.1 F and nausea. After calling my boss and mother, I went back to sleep. Stayed in bed until about 1:45pm Saturday. By then, the migraine was manageable and nausea was not as bad, though still had a temperature of 99.9 F. Took a shower and took 2 pills of  ibuprofen.

I woke up at 2:00 AM with a fever, body aches, headache, and severe nausea.  I proceeded to vomit until 6:00 AM.  The following day (3/13) included mild headache, mild body aches, and slight nausea.  By Sunday (3/14), all negative symptoms had gone away.

                                                Went most of the day with no symptoms. Performed a High Intensity Workout around 7pm for an hour, and ate shortly after. Took a hot shower and relaxed before bed time around 10pm started to have a headache. By 10:45 when I went to sleep it was an intense headache. Under the covers my body was incredibly hot, without covers I was freezing cold. I woke up around midnight in a sweat and again around 2:30am when I called in sick to work. I then sat in my bathroom for 30 minutes, threw up once, and then feeling much better (Still had an intense headache) I drank some water and fell back asleep in my room. Today is the second day, I have a small headache, have not eaten all day, and slept most of the afternoon. I highly recommend not working out the same day of getting the vaccine, I didn&#39;t think to ask about that when I received it. I doubt I would have had this problem if I rested instead.

Hearing came back after 5 minutes, but moderate body shakes began and lasted an hour. Got very cold feeling and began to feel fever like. Took acetaminophen and covered up with blankets and drank water. Took a couple hour nap and woke up sweating with terrible migraine and light body shakes. Fell asleep for a few more hours and woke up not feeling feverish, but migraine and body aches. 22 hours after onset I have a light headache and body aches and am mostly feeling recovered.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

Again I had some food and slept due to severe body pains and even through the sleep also I had severe body pains, fever, nausea and lazyness. As I woke up after my evening nap of 3 hours, i woke up at 6:00 pm and felt chills, body pains., fever and nausea.

                                                I asked the patient how he felt after the injection and he said that he felt a little lightheaded and nauseous.  He said he had a little too much to drink last night because his buddies were moving West.  I asked him to lay on the floor but he refused.  He said, &#34;I just want to sit for a while&#34;.  Within minutes the patient turned pale and started twitching. I asked another pharmacist to help to move him to the ground.  911 was called while patient was on the ground lying sideways because I was afraid that he may choke on his vomit.  In a few minutes, patient sat up and asked for a bucket to throw up in.  The Fire department came and took his blood pressure  (BP120/?) and asked him some questions. They his blood pressure was good and advised him not to drive home.  They helped him to get back on the chair. He stayed in the vaccination booth for us to keep an eye out until his friend showed up to take him home (30 minutes later). We had a male associate escort him out because he said he was still nauseous.

The second day I had blurry vision and all those symptoms so I went to doctor. They said I was having a reaction and also gave me Toradol for the back pain. I started to feel better symptom wise  but the following day I started to poop blood. That only happened for one day then went away after a day. But I?ve had one or two more bloody stools since then. The ER said that it?s likely from the Toradol but to keep an eye on it. I have had 2 episodes since but it?s been random. Haven?t taken any more ibuprofen at all, was told to take omeprazole for a month and see how my body recovers

Within 3 days I developed chronic stomach pain and GI problems.  Bloody stool has been going on now for 3 months.  I weigh 145 lbs and have lost 40 lbs. currently at 105 lbs.  Doctors haven&#39;t been able to diagnose my situation even after several blood tests, colonoscopies and biopsy&#39;s.  I was a perfectly healthy 26 year old with no family issues of GI problems or other complications.  I now can barely stand for a few minutes at a time.  Doctors think I have either Chrons, or Ulcerative Colitis, but the biopsy&#39;s are inconclusive.

He was feeling ok to sit back up in chair. About 5 minutes later he said he was feeling nauseous and wanted to lay down and elevate his legs again. He laid there for about 10 minutes no shortness of breath or nausea. He then wanted to stand up. This made him feel better. He remained in the waiting area for observation. Patient was feeling good to go home. I did follow up with him about an hour later. He did make it home and was feeling better.

                                                Woke up at 12:00am today with headache, lots of discomfort (especially in stomach), and for the most part could only fall back asleep for short intervals while being awake most of the night.   At around 2:30am, could barely walk into the front room. Just very slowly and painfully. Ended up in such a state that I absentmindedly urinated onnthe bathroom floor while pulling pant leg up to scratch an itch while urinating in toilet. Laying on back caused butt and thighs to hurt significantly more. Same for stomach. Getting up from and laying down on my floor mattress was and still is difficult.   Later into the morning at around 6:40am, had to crawl slowly on hands and knees to get back in the front room. By around 8am, I could walk around without it being unbearable. Just slow-ish. Ate breakfast, so stomach is more uncomfortable than in pain. Can lay on it without too much problem, but butt is still hurting. Stretching legs forward caused some pain.  Possible fever.

                                                6-7 hours after receiving, I got a headache, and became very tired &amp; achey all over. I took ibuprofen &amp; acetaminophen and felt reasonably better for a few hours. Then later that night (12-18 hours after vaccine) I became much sicker and was unable to sleep. I had a low fever, upset stomach, severe chills (couldn&#39;t stop shaking/shivering for over an hour) body aches, and an extremely bad headache. I continued to use ibuprofen and acetaminophen but even combined they weren&#39;t nearly enough to relieve my symptoms. Late into the night around 3-4am (15-16 hours after vaccine) nausea became the worst side effect, surpassing the headache. I eventually vomited around 4am, after which point the symptoms became more bearable and I managed to sleep a couple hours. Thursday/Friday (two days after vaccine) I still felt very weak, achey, and tired and had to call out of work both days. I was never again in the severe discomfort I experienced Wednesday night/Thursday morning, but I still felt a little tired, achey, and mildly sour stomach on days 3 &amp;4 (Saturday/Sunday). Monday morning I felt similarly tired &amp; achey, but I do feel essentially back to normal Monday night.

                                                Around 6 pm the same day I received the J&amp;J shot I started to feel chilly and a little nausea. I went for a walk for about 40 mins started to feel worse. I had body aches throughout my back and chest and in both arms, was freezing. Tried to eat dinner but couldn?t, too much pain and increased nausea. Tried to lay down, but began having a fast heartbeat and fast/some difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. Continued feeling horrible with a fever of 100.7, nausea, headache pains throughout chest back and arms, freezing, and my arms and legs felt like they were becoming numb. Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

                                                I gave the vaccine around 6:20pm after counseling on possible adverse reactions and going over the patient&#39;s questions. I then asked them to wait 15min. Within 5-10mins the patient got up and came back to our counter saying he thinks he&#39;s having a reaction. I pulled him back into our vaccination area and had him sit down and explain what he was feeling to me. He looked pale and told me he felt dizzy, sweaty, shaky, &amp; nauseous. He wanted me to grab him a bag incase he puked. I grabbed a bag as well as water and Benadryl. I asked if he was having any issues breathing or if it felt like his tongue was swollen at all. He said no issues breathing and tongue felt fine.  He started to feel better within about 10-15 minutes after onset. He did not puke and his color returned. I had him wait an additional 10-15 minutes after that to make sure we were recovered. I asked him if there was anything else going on and he mentioned that he hadn&#39;t slept well the night before and that he had barely eaten today. He also mentioned he can get anxiety. I told him all of those factors could certainly contribute to what he just experienced but that I would be reporting this on to be safe.

                                                The evening of the shot, I felt a wave of chills through my body. I felt a sore throat begin. I felt light headed and nausea. By the time I went to bed,  my body was extremely sensitive. Entering my bed was painful due to the cold sheets, the cold was contrasted by the occasional heat flash. The night was full of body aches, hot and cold flashes, and loads of sweating. I woke up with a headache and body soreness. That was the worst of it. Spent the remainder of the day resting in bed.  Notes: I rarely get sick, maybe like this once every few years. I probably could have drank more water to flush out my system following the shot.

                                                After like two weeks, before going to bed, I started having SOB and then a full-on chaotic panic attack. Chest pain, stomach was visually twisted and hurt, felt like I had a knot in my throat and full on anxiety. It took about a week for it to start going away after one Urgent Care visit, two ER visits, and a PC visit who prescribed me with clonazepan and Prozac. When I took both of them two weeks later, my symptoms and pain finally got better, but I am still having SOB, a little fatigue, my joints hurt once in a while, digestive problems, weird chest feeling. At least the heart pains went away.

                                                On June 19, 2021 I woke up around 6:00 a.m. having extreme chest pains. I went to the Emergency Room to be treated. They did an EKG, blood work, and an ultrasound of my heart. My EKG was negative for a heart attack, but my blood work was positive because of my Troponins were elevated. They gave me some aspirin and the chest pain went away. I was admitted into the hospital where I stayed until the end of the day on June 21, 2021. On June 20, 2021 they continued to watch my vitals, took tons of blood for blood cultures and for pretty much every virus you can get along with urine samples as well. All of the test for any virus and the blood cultures were negative. The urinalysis and urine culture were negative as well. Once all test came back negative, the cardiologist ordered a Heart cath. The heart cath was performed on June 21, 2021 and there was no blockage in any of my arteries and everything was clear so I was discharged that afternoon from the hospital. I was diagnosed with Myocarditis or Pericarditis. The doctor prescribed me 25MG Captopril to take 3 times daily and 25 MG Metoprolol Tartrate to take 2 times daily. I have only experienced any other affects a few times since being released which was a burning sensation in my check. I spoke with the doctor and they told me it could be indigestion or heart burn.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

                                                I started to get uncontrollable shakes the night of my vaccine for 10-15 minutes. I had chills for about an hour afterwards and a sleepless night. The next morning I woke up with a headache and was achy/sore throughout my body. While I was eating I passed out without any signs. I was unconscious and do not remember the episode. Once I was alert, I felt nauseas and was heading to the restroom when I passed out again and was unconscious. I do not remember the episodes. There were no signs of passing out before I did either time.

Did not have an allergic reaction. Did not need to call 9-1-1. Just worked himself up so much about it. Sent him home as I didn&#39;t want him to complete his shift while vomiting. Was having chills and wasn&#39;t sure how long they were going to last. Left him to go home with girlfriend. Went out front to wait for his ride and get some fresh air. Exchanged numbers so I could keep in contact with him. Knows to contact EMS if symptoms worsen.

He reports this as being one of the worst headaches he has ever had.  He was seen at urgent care and given Toradol, Zofran and Benadryl and still rates his pain an 8 out of 10.  He does feel pressure behind his eyes.  And reports vomiting in the parking lot at urgent care.

Reports that he did receive a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  Patient states he does vape.  He occasionally drinks alcohol he denies any illicit drugs.  Patient denies any head trauma.   Diagnosis management comments: This is a 28-year-old male arrives to the emergency room with reported migraine headache for the last 48 hours.  He did report that he was go to urgent care in which he received a migraine cocktail of Zofran, Benadryl and Toradol.  Patient reported that his headache was not resolved so urgent care sent him on for further evaluation.  Patient upon arrival had a negative neurological exam however he did report that he had pressure behind his eyes.  Was unable to see any papilledema on funduscopic exam.  Check patient&#39;s pressures bilaterally and they were 21 and 18.  Patient did report to me that this was the worst headache of his life.  I did administer IV fluids here as well as Tylenol and morphine.  Patient did report some improvement.  Patient did report in his past medical history had a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  A CBC and CMP was obtained.  Did have thrombocytopenia with a count of 66.  Since my exam was PERRL with normal extraocular movements.  He had no eye redness or eye pain.  Of low concerns for any iritis or uveitis.  Patient&#39;s patient CT of his head did show a abnormal CT that had a dense appearing superior sagittal sinus that was representing a venous thrombosis.  Radiologist did recommend a MRI MRV.  An MRI and MRV was ordered.  Patient MRI MRv did show findings are consistent with a venous thrombosis involving the right jugular right transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus there is also a patchy edematous change within the subcortical white matter areas bilaterally and symmetrically.  There was no CVA.  With patient&#39;s reported migraine headache.  Reported blurred vision, low platelets, recent vaccination I do believe patient has vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.  With this finding I did converse with my overseeing physician Calls were made out to neurology and then a call out did prefer to have patient started on IVIG at 1 g/kg daily for 2 days and blood thinner Xarelto 15 mg p.o. twice daily.  These orders were initiated.  Internal med services was consulted and with conversations of family, internal med services out possible transfer that an interventionalists could be available if patient needed it.  Report was given at 2100 upon my end of shift.

Immediately after regaining composure I began sweating profusely and became very pale/flushed color in face at which point I exited the vehicle and flagged EMS to assist me. EMS monitored blood pressure and blood saturation before releasing me on my own recognizance approximately 25 minutes later. Tingling sensation felt in left arm after fainting approximately 10 minuets after initial injection. Next 48 hours after injection I experienced severe body chills, body aches, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, and night sweats. 72 hours after injection I am close to fully recovered but still experience fatigue and night sweats.

I woke up around 1am on 3/16 with fever/chills/body ache/headaches. Fever was around 103 degrees F at it&#39;s peak and stayed at or above 100 degrees from about 1am until about 5 or 6pm on 3/15. I took tylonel during this time. I also experienced diarrhea and loss of appetite during the day; random periods of feeling nauseous. I seemed to be dehydrated but drank a normal amount of water the day before. It felt like I had the flu, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve felt this sick since I was a kid. It was terrible. I felt incredibly tired on Tuesday but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. 3/17--woke up today feeling mostly fine minus a bit of lingering soreness and feeling very tired still.

                                                12 hours after my shot I developed a severe headache and fever of 102. This persisted for about 7 hours. Then the fever decreased to about 100.5 for the next 24 hours.  After my fever broke, however, I developed a chest cough with some phlegm. This feels like bronchitis and my doctor has prescribed azithromycin. I also feel rolling fatigue, which comes on randomly. The cough and fatigue has persisted so far for 6 days. In addition, though I do not have a fever most of the day, on some nights my fever spikes (last night, reaching 102 for a short period of time while trying to sleep). It has been 8 days since my injection. I have very little appetite (though I can smell and taste fine).

In addition, I noticed (2) bloody stools over days 5 &amp; 6 - 1 each day in the morning.  Both symptoms seemed to have gone away after day 6. However, pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists and headaches has been noticeable intermitately since. No distinct or identified activities or food-related timing during or causing the onset of the pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists or headaches symptoms thus far.

                                                Patient was seated in the passenger seat of the car. We talked for a few minutes prior to administration and I actually administered a vaccine to the person in the driver&#39;s seat first. I walked over to give his shot and he then tells me he &#34;doesn&#39;t do well with vaccines.&#34; He later told me he felt sick to his stomach after getting the shot and had a metallic smell similar to a bloody nose. About 1 minute after administering his vaccine, the patient&#39;s head went back, his muscles went very stiff, and he appeared to convulse. We called 9-1-1. His mom was sitting in the back seat and placed an ice cube on the back of his neck which seems to have pulled him out of it. During the episode, he reports &#34;blacking out&#34; without orientation to time or place. After the episode, he was dizzy and lightheaded for a few minutes. Soon there after he was jovial. I took his BP and HR about 5 minutes later BP 100/62 and HR 48. Paramedics also took vitals which were a bit higher than these. He reported having a small cereal bar for breakfast and 2 cups of coffee.

By the time 11pm came around I was in a full blown fever which lasted until around 5:30 am the next day. The fever was reduced through the taking of two Acetaminophen pills. Throughout the night, I was unable to sleep due to intense headache pain, I felt exhausted and couldn?t move. I had a fever around 102 degrees Fahrenheit at its peak and maintaining usually around 101.4 degrees. I was nauseous and experienced emotional instability. The adverse affects lasted until the morning with some affects such as the headaches and nausea still currently lingering on to present time (10:48am).

The temperature flashes are still occurring 9 hours after injection and do not seem to be getting worse any more; hands and feet cannot warm up and neck and forehead are hot (no thermostat to look at temperature).

No treatment sought at this time.

                                                After receiving the Janssen Covid 19 vaccine, I proceeded to the waiting area and was instructed to wait 15 minutes before leaving the facility. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I started to feel faint, lightheaded, nausea, and clammy. I informed a member of the staff and several medical personnel came to assist. They laid me down on a cot and checked my vitals. I started to feel better after laying down. The staff took my blood pressure and heart rate readings, which were relatively normal. But after sitting me up and taking my vitals again, my blood pressure and heart rate spiked. I was taken to Hospital in an ambulance; however, after waiting in the ER waiting room for about 2.5 hours, I left without seeing a doctor. During those 2.5 hours my original symptoms did not return, so I elected to leave.

                                                CPT administered Janssen COVID-19 vaccine to the pt 4/5. While sitting in the pharmacy area for his 15 minute observation period, he fainted. He said that he was texting on his phone and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground with people around him asking if he was ok. He stated that he was very sweaty, nauseous, and a little dizzy. We called a code white, provided the pt with a cold compress and elevated his feet. Pt did not want us to call 911. Pt did not have PCP and has not been to a doctor in about 5 years. He said he was very nervous getting the shot and is afraid of needles so that may have contributed. Pt stayed in the pharmacy area for about 45 minutes until he started to feel better and his mom came to get him. I tried calling pt again at 7:10pm to check in, but there was no answer and I could not leave a voicemail due to mailbox being full.

About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

                                                After being screened to enter the healthcare facility and completing the intake screening for COVID vaccine, patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine at approximately 11:00am.  Several minutes later while sitting in the observation area, patient stated that he felt like throwing up and that he had a headache.  He said he just started feeling tired.  He denied any shortness of breath, swelling in his mouth or throat, or rashes.  He stated he had not eaten breakfast in the morning.  When his vital signs were checked, his blood pressure was 149/94 and heart rate was 90.  He was alert and oriented.  He was transported to the facility urgent care for further assessment and observation. In urgent care, he appeared to become more lethargic, although his vital signs remained stable.  911 was called.   While waiting for the ambulance, staff spoke to the patient&#39;s brother (who had been waiting outside for patient).  Patient&#39;s brother stated that patient had a fever and stomachache the night before, and that patient had a recent surgery and had not completed his post-op antibiotic course.  Patient&#39;s brother stated that he came to clinic anyways for the vaccine appointment because he wanted to get the COVID vaccine so that he could return to work (as required by his employer).   Patient was transported to  Hospital.  Per nurse report, he was released from the emergency room after a brief observation period.

The following Saturday, I had a migraine and it lasted a full eight days - hanging out in my left eye (it was all in that eye - when I moved that eye from left to right, I would feel it) . I had taken Tylenol and ibuprofen but it didn&#39;t do anything.  Some days it was intense and some days it was in the background. I did see and talk to a  someone at my doctor&#39;s office - over video chat (on April 15th - that was day eight of migraine) and she told me to start taking Tylenol that night and I&#39;ve been taking it one time in the morning since that day and it hasn&#39;t come back. I think the migraine went away on it&#39;s own.  I haven&#39;t had a migraine ever in my entire life so it was very unsettling.

                                                The night/next morning after receiving the vaccine I was awoken by a racing heart rate that I measured at a resting heart rate of 200 bpm. After 5 minutes of trying to assess what was happening, I recognized that my heart rate was not slowing down. I woke my wife because I was worried and had difficulty breathing. It continued to be in the 180-190&#39;s, I called an ambulance. On the way to the hospital my resting heart rate was 180. After I got to the hospital they ran blood work, a CT scan and a chest x-ray. I was in the hospital until 10 am. My heart rate steadily fell to about 110 beats per minute after 9 hours in the hospital. They released me because my tests had come back normal. Upon being released, I came home, had lots of fluids and rest. After 1 week, my heart rate went back up to 160&#39;s. My chest started to feel tight again and I had difficulty breathing again. I called my PCP emergency number and they advised me to go back to the ER at 10 am on 05/15/2021. They did another EKG, a D-Dimer and I received saline. My heart rate dropped to 120 and they released me. I was given an all clear from all tests performed. Sunday-Wed that week, I had a slightly elevated resting heart rate, have had difficulty getting a full breath, general stomach pains and I had felt fatigued. Thurs-Sat, my resting heart rate returned to normal (60 bpm) minimal difficulty breathing, but continued pressure in my abdomen and chest. Saturday I fell asleep because I was having a migraine. I woke up at 10 pm and the cycle started again. My heart rate went back up into the 160&#39;s. I called the emergency line for my PCP and was told to go back to the ER (05/22/2021). They performed a chest x-ray, an EKG and some blood work. My resting heart rate went to 90 bpm around 3 am and was sent back home. The rest of Sunday, I had difficulty getting a full breath and my resting heart was higher than usual. I had an echocardiogram on Wednesday and it came back normal. I wore a heart monitor for 24 hours, but I have not received the results yet from my doctor. I have never experienced any sort of cardiac episode in my life.

I had Covid twice which was not bad either time, and the vaccine is already becoming noticeably worse. I want to make sure I?m tracking as well as possible all negative side effects because I was not able to work without getting the vaccine and I am horribly concerned already because I?ve never got a shot that made me feel this bad.

                                                I experienced normal side effects. Aches, fever, headache, chills, fever for about 5 days. They subsided, but I still don?t have an appetite, and I keep coughing up mucous, some with what looks like blood streaks, like a blood vessel, and blood spots when I blow my nose. And my lungs feel heavy. And it?s almost impossible to breathe deeply with coughing. Although I can go a few hours without coughing. The blood is very rare but it has happened several times in the past 4-5 days. It could have to do with my vaping, but it isn?t normal, only since being vaccined.

Upon standing up from the laying down position, I got lightheaded, started profusely sweating, became nauseous and ultimately lost consciousness. When I regained my consciousness, there was a loud ringing in my ears and my hands were numb. I took some Tylenol, laid down and it subsided shortly after. I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

                                                Patient called on 4/9/21 asking about whether side effects from Janssen vaccine should still be present since he had the vaccine on 4/7/21.  Patient said he had fever within 24 hours of the vaccine and was feeling miserable (severe fatigue, chills, fever, nausea, headaches).  He said he was feeling slightly better than the first 24 hours but still feeling really bad. He has been taking Advil which has help slightly.  I advised him to monitor symptoms and to call dr if symptoms get worst and to keep us posted.    I called patient today to follow up with patient and he said that he was not feeling that much better.  He did have a virtual visit with his doctor and was prescribed azithromycin, prednisone, and an inhaler.  Patient has been on medication for a couple of days.  He will continue meds and call us if things do not improve

                                                Received the shot in left shoulder. Was browsing phone for about 30 seconds to a minute. Felt a rising sensation in the esophagus. Felt as though nausea was impending. Sensation rose into skull in &#34;crawling waves&#34;. Skull felt heavy. Interpreted the sensation as disorientation. Asked pharmacist if dizziness was normal with the vaccine. Woke up a few seconds later picking myself up off the floor.

                                                Rashes and hives on my hands, then feet then legs  exactly 1 week after my vaccination.  Itching started on the back of my hands and then progressed to the tops of my feet and rose up my legs, I took 2 Benadryl and went to urgent care.  The Benadryl started working within a half hour of taking it.   The itching started as o laid in bed where the only food or liquid I consumed before getting out of bed was a bottled water.  The doctor stated that I may be allergic to the pba?s in the water bottle.   I have never been allergic to this before  I was given this vaccine.  Intense itching and  hives have been occurring  ever since that day and without taking Claritin  or Benadryl daily  the itching and hives takes over my whole body.  I fear I could go into anaphylaxis if I do not take this medication.  I have cut out several different foods and different liquids including bottled water and have fasted yet still am getting a allergic reaction.  I saw my family dr and he said it?s likely due to the Johnson and Johnson covid 19 vaccine and I believe that to be true.  Other symptoms include facial flushing and upset stomach

                                                At 23:15 (7 hours after the dose) I started to get cold while under my blankets trying to sleep. My teeth began chattering as I started to shiver. I got up out of bed to put on a sweater. With each step I took towards the sweater my body started to fully shiver and contract. After about 4 or 5 steps I could no longer move and I fell over. I started having full body spasms and full contractions. I felt like I pulled every muscle in my body trying to relax and fight the contractions. It felt like I was being tasered for about 10-15 minutes. Once I had the strength to grab my sweater I slipped it on. As my body warmed up these contraction subsided.  By 01:00 (9 hours after dose) my body temperature had spiked. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to check my temperature but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I spiked a fever. I placed a wet cloth on the back of my neck, forehead and chest to cool down.   At 06:00 (14 hours after dose) I took a cold shower to further drop my body&#39;s temperature. It felt like a full body sun burn where you just radiate heat. I was hot everywhere.  At 08:00 (16 hours after dose) I took three (3) 500mg ibuprofen to help fight a nagging headache. I did not have much appetite for food. I regularly eat breakfast in the morning (bowl of cereal).   From 09:00 to 12:00 (17-20 hours after dose) I felt groggy. Did not seem or act like myself. Was very tired from the lack of sleep the night prior. Seemed very fatigued.  Around 13:00 (21 hours after dose) I took a 45-60 minute nap. Woke up feeling much better. I would say most / if not all symptoms subsided after 22-24 hours.

                                                I got my Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 5/5/21. That night I experienced the typical side effects (Chills, Aches, Pains, Soreness in the injection site on my right arm). By Thursday afternoon I was feeling significantly better. However, on Friday evening I started to feel a tightness and pressure in my chest and left arm and neck. The chest pain felt like I was having a heart attack but my heart rate was mostly normal. I felt shortness of breath  where I couldn&#39;t get a good deep breath in and I was also nauseous and had no appetite. At times I felt lightheaded and weak. These symptoms continued over the next couple days. On Monday 5/10/21 I decided to got to the ER to get checkout since I was still having chest pains and tightness. They ran a series of tests and concluded that I was just experiencing typical aches and pains from the vaccine.  My symptoms continued for another full week and at times the shortness of breath and chest pains felt really severe. By the following week I was starting to feel a little better on and off. I got my appetite back and and I was able to start exercising again. After about 2 full weeks after receiving the vaccine most of chest pain and pressure &#43; shortness of breath has disappeared and I feel better.

                                                On Saturday, I woke up to my right arm - at injection site area - was itching. I woke up to numerous nose bleeds. I&#39;m not prone to nose bleeds. Also - consistent since Saturday, Diarrhea; muscles aches; fatigue; vomiting. Problems with keeping liquid and food down now - just started a couple of days ago. Dr called me on Friday -I was doing okay; On Monday - he called again and I wasn&#39;t doing well. Have spoken to my doctor each day. And now  (since two days ago) it feels like my skin is tearing apart and burning and that the inside of my bones are on fire. At the same time, I couldn&#39;t keep food and liquid down anymore. Autonomic immune system is in fight response since Saturday. Haven&#39;t been able to get out of bed for last two days. Diarrhea has worsened. - Have been taking Zofran - nausea med for the last two days. To subdue the vomiting. Have a new medication that I am starting today to subdue the diarrhea - can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called. Trying to make sure it doesn&#39;t go into an autonomic crisis. Only Telemed visits so far - video appts. Have had several fevers doing this time - currently at 100 but went up to 103. I have gone to low grade too and means I have not been doing well at all - on Saturday to Sunday. (Went to high grade - Mon, Tuesday, Wednesday).

I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

                                                After receiving my Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine I experienced a lack of motor function in my throat. Approximately 40 minutes after having received the shot, I lost the ability swallow. A tingling sensation took the back of my throat and eventually felt as though it moved into my head. The whole experience lasted a couple of minutes. Since that time all other symptoms have been normal, sore, slight fever, etc.

Patient said they felt a little nauseous but then dizzy and things went dark. We kept them laying down on the floor with knees up, took their BP (127/72) and waited for medics to come. Medics arrived within 10 minutes to evaluate the patient, offered to take them to the hospital, patient declined and they released them to take it easy and call them/go to hospital if they felt faint again.

                                                April 9 Morning: woke up with a mild headache. April 9 Afternoon (12 pm): feeling fatigued and headache grew worse. Plus chills. April 9 (5pm): feeling very cold and tired (worse than noon) April 9 (11:30pm): This time was the most severe for me in respect to side effects. I believe my headache woke me up. The headache was so bad that my eyes hurt as well (swollen almost). I think my fever broke. I felt very ?heavy? all over. The main concern was that around midnight I was having sharp pains on the right side of my body, near where my Liver is located. That was one effect that I did not read about. The sharp pains happened once every few minutes. I considered going to the ER but wasn?t sure. I ended up just changing my shirt, got some water, and went back to bed.  April 10: My appetite was not normal, I ate but very little. The sharp pain on my right side went away but I had a minor headache for the rest of the day.

Around 5 hours after injection I was overcome with extreme lethargy and had to sleep. 8 hours after injection I woke up very nauseous and could not stop salivating, however I never puked. I woke up again 18 hours after injection and felt nauseous and my chronic back pain had returned. I also had a weird throbbing pain in the right side of my neck and in the lower left side of my left leg. All symptoms were gone by ~36 hours after the injection.

                                                I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 7 hours post-vaccination. Symptoms started with severe chills, elevated heart rate, fever (~102), and progressed into muscle and joint soreness, severe migraine with sensitivity to light, and strong fatigue, coupled with insomnia. The symptoms were severe enough that I considered going to the hospital, but ultimately did not. Fever, chills, and elevated heart rate subsided by the next morning (~12 hours after onset), but muscle soreness, migraine, and fatigue lasted for another 12-24 hours, along with a loss of appetite.  I am an otherwise healthy, male adult with no outstanding medical conditions whatsoever. This was one of the most severe immune responses I have ever had, including actual illnesses. I have received other vaccinations in the past and never had any response nearly as severe. I was significantly concerned for my overall health during the height of the vaccine response, and I wanted to report this to ensure that is aware of these types of responses, and can help prepare others by informing them adequately of the types of responses to expect from the vaccine. This response very much took me by surprise in terms of severity -- I had to call out of work at a critical time.

                                                Roughly three hours after getting the shot I was very cold and developed a fever of 102.8. I vomited that night. I took an ibuprofen to help reduce the fever then slept. For the next six days I had an on again and off again low grade fever and was nauseas most of the time. Sometime during those 6 days I developed intermitted tingling in my left hand, primarily by index finger. This continues to today happening roughly once a day.  On rare occasion my right had will do the same thing but that is far less often. I never had tingling in either hand prior to my vaccine. I also developed heartburn occurring roughly 1-2 times a day. Prior to the vaccine I rarely (1-2 times a year) had heartburn and I have not changed anything about my diet or lifestyle since my vaccine. Occasionally my head feels &#34;foggy&#34; as well and this began sometime after the vaccine but I can&#39;t recall exactly when it started. It&#39;s not a headache, more of a slight lightheaded, dull feeling. I had none of these symptoms with any regularity until I was administered the vaccine.

Suddenly I began to get tunnel vision and felt as if I was about to pass out. I was transported via ambulance to Medical Center where I was given IV and medication to treat vertigo and massive head pain/migraine. Since that day I have continually dealt with severe neck and head pain leading to migraines causing visual issues (auras and blind spots), vertigo, and nauseau.

                                                7 minutes after the injection of my Janssen injection for COVID-19, a heat enveloped my body from deep in my chest and I went pale (according to the objective findings of my nurse) and I began to feel lightheaded and almost became syncopal. I was asked to remain there for 30-minutes, and began to feel better shortly thereafter. The next several days, the lightheadedness came and went in waves, which became stronger and stronger. Two days post-injection, I developed severe joint pain where I&#39;d otherwise previously had none - for instance, my low back ached with 7/10 pain which only went away after the first week. I had thoracic spinal pain which radiated to my chest, and by day 3 I was having serial panic attacks (which I don&#39;t have), such that I visited the local emergency department to rule out sinister cardiorespiratory sequelae. I was discharged with a ddx of GERD, though I do not believe this to be true. Since then, I have largely recovered, however the lightheaded spells have dissipated only a little but are largely still plaguing me. Thankfully, the panic attacks have decreased to the point of almost being gone altogether.

Prior COVID, I went to martial arts 4 times a week and went to the gym 4-5 times a week still. My awareness was not good, hand dexterity was not as high, concentrating was not easy for long, high blood pressure, pre diabetic now,  fatty liver, gallbladder stones/sludge, have high wbc count, rbc count high, high alt/ast range is 44-88-116-222, skin sensititivty, could only stay awake for 6 hours at a time.  BTold to introduce coffee to help liver/ keep taking baby aspirin/ put back on Dexilant 60mg. When working out, I go to sleep within an hour of running 1 mile,  weight lifting gets me extremely tired now, now its not as bad, can work out longer.  In may, all my allergies disappeared, now they are back but in first month I was no longer allergic to fruits. This is new and started in June, pimples on skull and ears, voice is normal now, may have grown taller, leg shins hurt when touched. Skin still very sensitive, awake longer now  but when I work out I still get tired where I have to stop, sit, or nap.

                                                Right arm became very sore the following day and remained extremely sore for about five days after receiving the first and final dose of the J&amp;J vaccine.  On the day following the injection, I began developing a headache.  I didn&#39;t think twice about it until the headache didn&#39;t go away on the second day, the third, the fourth, but finally the fifth day it seemed to subside.  The intensity was severe and was concerning due to how long it lasted.  I had simply assumed that it was normal side effects.  Yesterday on Monday, 04/12/2021, I developed severe and sharp pains in my stomach/abdomen that actually put me in bed all day.

Felt weak and &#39;off&#39; sense the event, felt tightness in chest and odd limb pain past 72 hours.  Woke up at 3:30am on 4/15 with left arm asleep, went back to bed fine.  Never had these symptoms before.

He received the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/8 and felt well afterwards. Last Friday (4/16) he began to experience constitutional symptoms (fever to 100.4, chills, night sweats feeling drenched, decreased appetite) so decided to get his labs drawn as an outpatient for further evaluation. Symptoms progressed until Tuesday, when they began to subside slightly. At that point, his labs resulted and were notable for thrombocytopenia. He got his labs redrawn the day before admission and it was noted that his thrombocytopenia was worsening, so he was directed to the ED for further evaluation.  Patient seen by hematology, started on dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily as well as IVIG treatment x2. MRV of brain without evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis  ***PATIENT CURRENTLY HOSPITALIZED***

Felt basically normal by the time I left the facility and my arm has not been hurting since.   Approx 8:00 PM onset of headache, progressively worsening thru ~11:00 PM and plateauing. Headache was less by ~8:00 AM, and took Ibuprophin at 9:00 AM to further alleviate.   Approx 9:30-10:00 PM onset of chills and shivering, progressively worsening thru ~11:30 PM. Chills lasted through the night, but shivering stopped around 12:00 AM after turning the heat up and putting on more clothing, beanie, and blankets.   Fatigue is ongoing (as of now, ~22.5 hours after administration), but may be a result of poor sleep due to the chills overnight.

Around 30-40 minutes later, I began experiencing a reaction I&#39;m not prone to.  I had severe heartburn throughout most of the night and my lips began to swell which made me mistakenly assume I have had a cardiac event. While in the morning the pain had subsided, the numbness in the lips hadn&#39;t and I went to the ER thinking it might&#39;ve been a heart issue. No cardiac condition was noted at the hospital which leads me to believe I may have had a severe allergic reaction to foods or environmentals I&#39;ve never had reactions to.

                                                Terrible body aches starting at 8pm on April 1st.  Then had the chills.  Was able to take ibuprofen and slept for a bit.  Next morning April 2, got a migraine where it hurt to open my eyes.  Had that for about 2 hours then got better.  Also, I had trouble eating.  I would take a small bite of crackers and feel like I was going to throw up.  Took me a long time to eat a package of crackers and to drink 1 whole bottle of gatorade.  I took more ibuprofen through the day and that helped.  Around 5pm that night I was able to eat a little more and drink some with out feeling sick to my body.  Around 9pm that night headache came back and I went to bed for the night.  Today April 3 I feel a lot better.  Body still aches a bit and feels like I?ve been sick for 2 days so will probably take today and tomorrow to fully recoup.  No headache today.  Just small aches and tired.

Patient started to feel light headed and nauseous while walking to his car.  About 20 minutes following vaccination, a vaccinator had walked passed his vehicle and noted that he was unconscious.  Patient was still unconscious upon medical response team arrival and unresponsive to stimuli.  Once the patient awoke about 30 seconds later, he continued to state that he was nauseated and ?did not feel good.?  Patient was unaware that he had lost consciousness.  He further disclosed that he had been working in the sun planting trees all day and had not consumed any food or beverage.  He denied allergies to medication, food, and other vaccines.  He relayed that he had passed out from vaccinations in the past as a child.  He affirms lightheadedness and nausea.  He denies chest pain, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/lips/tongue/throat, skin rash/itching, cramping abdominal pain, and vomiting.     Exam (update as needed): GEN: Upon arrival, patient unconscious and not responsive to stimuli HEAD: NCAT EYES: pupils unreactive and mydriatic ENT: Ears normal, Nose normal, OP normal, no evidence of angioedema NECK: Supple, without LAD.

                                                At roughly 8 to 10 hours after injection I started developing a minor fever, fatigue, slight loss of appetite, lack of focus, chills and aches. Signs and symptoms continued to worsen throughout the night and next morning. Unable to sleep due to an increase in chills, fever progressed to 101.3F, developed a severe headache, aches were more prominent, same with fatigue. Loss of appetite went away. Started taking cold medication in the morning which either helped reduce the signs and symptoms or I had already experienced the apex of the adverse events. Fever was reduced, same with the aches and chills. Everything is fairly minor now, but the severe headache continued to to be present untill a second round of cold medication. Still fatigued when writing this at 9:30pm at night despite sleeping the majority of the day.

He then had stated he was feeling dizzy and had an episode of syncope.  He remained in the chair but was not able to respond to me.  His mother was present and I called for assistance and she came into the room at which point the patient was able to respond to me verbally but he reported being confused, feeling nausea and fatigued. He was visibly sweating.  His mother reported that he had previous episodes of syncope when having blood draws or other injections.

                                                I had an intense fever within 5 minutes of the administration of the shot. I was sweating profusely, experience nausea and then fainted and had a mild seizure. After coming to consciousness, I vomited and the pharmacy staff called the paramedics. I was extremely pale and the fever persisted for several minutes while waiting for the paramedics. I recovered and felt mostly normal after being given saline solution and anti-nausea medication. Hours after being released from the hospital, I have waves of cold chills and hot flashes.

Myalgia in legs happened immediately. No fever at this time.  Woke in morning with no fever, but muscle aches, malaise, lethargy, parasthesia were all present. Spent entire day in bed napping occasionally.  Measured temperature in evening at 100.7F.  Painful stomach pain happened in evening. Patient never gets acid pain or similar so this was very abnormal. Antacid helped but stomach pain continued all evening at a lesser degree.  When going to bed most symptoms had subsided. Still some parasthesia and Myalgia. Woke up on 4/9 feeling much better after lots of sleep.  No fever or other symptoms on morning of 4/9.

Day 2 post vaccination (11Apr2021) -  headache like symptoms where there was heavy pressure on the back of the skull (Occipital knob/bone and around the parietal bone), felt clammy and hot/sweaty, shortness of breath, and very fatigued and nauseous. Temperature seemed to fluctuate throughout the day around 100 degrees almost like a low grade fever.   Day 3 two days post vaccine (12Apr2021) - headache like symptoms seem to have settled but still felt clammy / sweaty / hot.   Day 4 (13Apr2021) Injection site in left arm is still swollen and sore.

                                                On the evening of 4/8/2021 at around 8 pm I began experiencing an upset stomach (felt like I might throw up) and then shaking in my stomach started and I got a lot of chills and a headache.  Then I spiked a very high fever and sweat like crazy.  I was shaking like crazy and had to call a doctor on call twice.  I had full body pain and was very sleepy.  The fever and chills lasted a bit over 2 days but unfortunately the pain  in my body had not gone away.  Currently (4/14/2021) I have pain in all my joints and my neck and back and I noticed a rash around my right knee. I have felt very tired. I have felt some mild shortness of breath, which may be seasonal allergies (discussed with a nurse earlier, my oxygen levels are 98 percent today, so I am breathing fine, but there is a sensation of shortness of breath) . I have consulted my primary care office about the above and they are speaking to the doctor.  I am trying to limit my exposure to any hospital setting until the 14 days (2 weeks) is up from the vaccine.  Hopefully these symptoms will go away soon and hopefully none are related to a blood clot issue.  We&#39;ll see if my doctor or you guys may recommend a future platelet test?

                                                For 2 days, typical arm soreness, flu-like symptoms with significant muscle pain and general weakness and malaise. However, on the 5th day, EXTREME abdominal pain, left side. Pain level up to 9. Incapacitating. Two visits to urgent care. This was in March before any info came out about adverse blood clot events for the J&amp;J vaccine, so the doctors were not really interested at the time that I had just gotten my shot. They gave me antibiotics, thinking it may be diverticulitis (diagnosis based on symptoms only - no diagnostics - it was the doctor&#39;s &#34;best guess&#34;). Pain did not subside, only got worse. 4 days later I could barely move, abdominal pain was extreme. Went back to clinic and they did a PET scan to check for diverticulitis. There was none; PET scan revealed nothing out of the ordinary. So they told me they had no idea what it was and sent me home. PET scan reading by the doctor notes specifically that blood/vascular was not able to be observed because no contrast or dyes were used. Bottom line was over 10 days of extreme abdominal pain 5 days after receiving the shot. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like that before.

                                                36 Y male patient from another country with a past medical history significant for mild HTN (on 2.5 mg amlodipine) who was in his usual state of health until approximately 4/17/21 when he developed acute onset left volar forearm tingling sensation. He had received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on 4/2/21 in his left arm and states that he did not experience any noticeable reactions after vaccination. He also recalls having had sustained a minor superficial scrape on his left volar forearm by a trash can lid when he had taken out garbage, which occurred very shortly before the onset of this tingling sensation. The tingling sensation then progressively worsened and became more diffuse across most of his body. He then developed fevers up to 102 at home, chills, neck pain, headache, and pain in all extremities (primarily arms but also in his legs).   He initially went to the Health Care ED on 4/28/21. He was afebrile at the time and his vital signs at that time were unremarkable with the exception of elevated diastolic blood pressures (90-104 mm Hg). WBC 10.1 with normal differential, electrolytes and liver enzymes within normal limits. Influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR were negative. Urinalysis showed few bacteria but no WBCs. Chest x-ray was clear. Blood cultures were drawn and patient was then discharged.   Patient returned to the ED on 4/29/21 and reported fever to 102-103 d F, chills, nausea, weakness, body aches, and bilateral foot paraesthesias. He was afebrile (98.8) and his vital signs were within normal limits. His WBC was slightly elevated to 12.2 with a normal differential. His ESR was 11, CRP 1.5, CMP within normal limits. He was noted to have urinary retention and a foley was placed and he was given tamsulosin.    Patient then returned to the ED again the following day, on 4/30/21, with worsening generalized pain and weakness and difficulty walking.   ED course: temperature 101, heart rate 100s-110s, BP 140s-160s/70s-90s, RR low 20s, SaO2 high 90s. Labs remarkable for WBC 13.1 with 82.4% N, ESR 7, CRP 5.9, lactic acid 2.6, RF 10, urinalysis unremarkable, HIV antigen/antibody negative. Several imaging studies were performed. MRI T spine showed &#34;Extensive cord signal abnormality in the cervical and thoracic cord as detailed above, with associated expansion of the cord (most pronounced in the cervical cord). Differential includes acute transverse myelitis, demyelination, infection (HIV, syphilis, other viruses)/parainfectious phenomenon, subacute combined degeneration, and inflammatory etiologies. An underlying mass or masses are not excluded but less likely given extensive multifocal patchy involvement. Recommend postcontrast imaging at this time for further workup. Consider brain MR as well to assess for systemic white matter disease.&#34;   A lumbar puncture was attempted in the ED but was unable to be performed.   Patient was given empiric IV ceftriaxone 1 g q24h and admitted to the hospitalist service. He was evaluated by neurology and was started on Solumedrol 1000 mg for acute transverse myelitis.   5/1/21 MRI brain showed &#34;Multifocal patchy white matter signal changes, predominantly in the subcortical white matter, also present in the bilateral thalami and bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle, and redemonstration of extensive cervical cord signal abnormality and expansion. No associated restricted diffusion or enhancement. Broad differential, but given pattern of involvement findings are most concerning for ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), other considerations include other demyelinating processes, toxic-metabolic pathology, or potentially atypical viral infection.&#34; Patient was given methylprednisolone for ADEM with transverse myelitis and clinically improved. He was hospitalized from 4/30/21 until being discharged to home in a wheelchair on 5/6/21.

                                                I started to feel extreme fatigue around noon the day after but what I found very concerning is I lost probably 80-90% of the strength in my arms.  I couldn&#39;t palm a ball i had for the kids which i normally can easily.  I had chills and nausea as well.    I can&#39;t really remember much from that day and it feels like a big blur.  I woke up the next day feeling very irritable with brain fog.  Today its gotten better and I am hoping tomorrow I will be back to normal.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received my dose at 3pm on March 12, and experienced no adverse events until about 5 or 6 hours later. Between 8pm and 9pm, I felt a bit tired, though wasn?t sure it was vaccine-related at first. However, I shortly afterwards started feeling much more tired, and experienced chills and shivering. I went to sleep. My wife later said I felt very warm, though we did not measure my temperature.  During the night, at one point, I got up to go to the bathroom, and became very dizzy and nearly fell over, though I was able to catch myself and did not experience any fall or injury.   I went back to bed. At some other point during the night, I started sweating. My wife later said I felt cold at that point.  For most of the following day, Saturday, March 13, I no longer felt dizzy nor overly hot or cold, but had a migraine and mild nausea. I did not vomit, but I also ate very little during the day. I did eat a little in the morning, and had some water throughout the day. For the most part, I laid in bed, drifting in and out of sleep.   At about 7pm on March 13, I took two Tylenol to try to fight the headache. By 8pm I felt almost completely better. I ate more bits of food, and have felt fine since then. Sunday, I woke up and felt back to normal. I ate normally as well.

Several minutes later he started throwing up. I asked the nurse practitioner at the Clinic to help me; she took his vitals about 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine and they were...  HR 70, BP 110/60, RR 18  We gave him some wet paper towels for his head and asked  him to focus on his breathing. We kept him in the observation area for a total of 45 minutes.  He still wasn&#39;t feeling great when he left, but he said he wanted to go home and lie down. He only threw up the one time, but he did have some dry heaving once more after his vitals were taken.

Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

While attempting to go to the bathroom, I must have passed out because I woke up some time later on the floor with a busted face and nose, and a severe headache.  Initially the day after the shot, I had sharp shooting pains down my right leg. I have also had a headache on more days since getting the vaccine.  Mental fog and tiredness is also occurring a few days after the initial shot.

Lifted him out and placed on floor, he was unresponsive - called 911, he came to slightly after 3 minutes.  Ambulance took him to ER and we stayed all day receiving fluids and chest XR (clear).  We were discharged in the afternoon with the doctor saying he has a syncopy episode.  At 4:00 PM PT was going to the bathroom and he stated he didn&#39;t feel good.  I stood in front of him because he turned white and eye rolled up into his head and he blacked out and stopped breathing for approximately 2 minutes while I got him on floor and gave CPR.  Called 911 and he began breathing again .  Back in ambulance to hospital and we stayed in hospital for 2 days.

                                                Around 9, I came down with fever, aches, chills, that lasted through the night so I took and Advil at 1 am, then at noon I took another Advil. The aches and chills without Advil lasted for 2 nights. For a while I was fine but on 04/29/2021 I was having sharp pains in my gut that kept coming and going. I googled it and I thought it was my colitis or a blood clot. I went to the ER they did an CAT scan in my gut and they said it was definitely ulcerative colitis, which I have had for  years but without any flare ups for 21 years. They sent me to a GI doctor and they did a colonoscopy. They confirmed that it was colitis but not that severe and that I should be fine. After that I have been doing ok. I have had like two incidents since then but not as bad as the time I had to go to the ER.

                                                On Saturday 3/20 I experienced the usual symptoms that were noted. On Monday 3/22 I began to get very dizzy with a heart rate of 150bpm. My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

                                                While sitting down during the post-vaccination period, patient asked his wife for water about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Pharmacy staff provided water and pharmacist went over to check on the patient. Patient expressed feeling &#34;hot&#34; and wanted an ice-pack, which was given. Patient expressed feeling &#34;faint,&#34; after which he briefly lost consciousness. Pharmacist immediately started checking for pulse and obtained Emergency Kit. Patient regained consciousness quickly without need of CPR or administration of Emergency Kit medications. At some point patient also released his bladder,  most likely during the syncope episode. Patient expressing feeling &#34;nauseous&#34; and asked for something to throw up in. Pharmacist quickly got a trash can and gave to patient, shortly after which patient started vomiting. Pharmacist was attending to patient and asked patient if he wanted 911 to be called, to which he replied &#34;No&#34; and that he just needed some time to sit. Patient also stated he did not eat much that day. Pharmacist offered Pedialyte, to which patient agreed, in order to replenish fluids/electrolytes lost due to vomiting. Patient also asked for some crackers since he did not eat much earlier. After taking sips of Pedialyte and taking bites of crackers, patient could not hold anything down and continued to vomit. At that time patient&#39;s wife asked pharmacy staff to proceed with calling 911. 911 was called and paramedics took patient&#39;s vitals upon arrival at the scene. Vitals were all stated to be normal. Patient agreed to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. A couple hours later patient&#39;s wife informed pharmacy staff that patient was doing much better and was expected to be released from hospital soon. Before receiving vaccination, patient did share that in the past he had &#34;felt faint&#34; when giving blood but it was not made clear that patient had felt faint or fainted during vaccinations prior. After the incident patient&#39;s wife confirmed that patient had fainted in the past both after giving blood and after receiving vaccinations. Pharmacist called patient at 9:12 AM the following day (4/3/21) to see how patient was doing but was only able to leave a voicemail message.

                                                Approximately ten minutes after receiving the vaccination I got very dizzy and passed out. I was out for 3-4 minutes and came to. Subsequent to passing out I vomited a few times and could not hold anything down. I also urinated on myself at some point when out. I was not getting better so 911 was called and I was transported to the emergency room via ambulance. Once the ambulance arrived at the hospital I vomited again filling about half of the vomit bag. I arrived at the hospital and an IV was not able to be administered so I was given Zofran for nausea and Gatorade to try and hold down. I spent approximately 4 hours in the ER, was able to finally get to the point where the nausea calmed down and I was able to walk around. I was then discharged.

At 1:30am, I woke up needing to urinate. I went into the bathroom and lost consciousness, finding myself with one hand in the toilet and one on the side. I felt nauseous and thought I would vomit, but didn&#39;t and believe I lost consciousness again. I was able to make it to the sink to try to wash my hands, and I fell down on my knees. I knew I was bleeding somewhere but didn&#39;t know from where (my right pinky was cut on an item in the bathroom when I fell). My wife made it to me, and I lost consciousness a couple more times while talking with her. I laid on the bathroom floor for a

By 36 hours after vaccination my symptoms had mostly subsided with just minor dizziness and nausea remaining.

                                                Hi I was vaccinated Thursday April 8th 2021 at approximately 9:15am. I kept a log so I could share my experience with my friends and family. After vaccination I was fine for a few hours but I randomly got a case of  watery eyes that would last about 15 minutes and then clear up. This happened 4 times over a 9 hour period. Around 9 hours after vaccination I started to feel like I had a cold and my skin all over my body ached to touch and my heart started racing. I felt sunburned and nauseous and went to bed. 13 hours exactly after vaccination I was hit hard with intense chills to the point of teeth chattering and full body shivering. 15 hours after injection I woke up intensely hot and I had a massive headache, full body pain, a tickle deep in my lungs that made me cough, nausea, and a fever of 101. I also was having extreme heart palpitations. I have a laser thermometer and I discovered my fever was 101.5 at my forehead but my neck and chest were 103. I took ibuprofen and kept patting myself with cold wet wash cloths to combat the fever. At this point I debated going to the hospital. I had intense fatigue and I was too weak to move but too sick to sleep. This level of fever and symptoms went on for about a day and a half. Since my vaccination I am still fatigued, I get winded very easily, something small like feeding my dog makes me break out in a sweat, and I need to lay down. I am still weak and fatigued but not to the same level as before and it changes every day. I have a sore throat, headaches, occasionally my body will twitch in random places, fever will pop up and go away, I cough gag and get very weak under any physical stress. I did not have injection site pain out of the ordinary until 48 hours after injection and it felt like a shotgun blast to the arm.. I did have very unusual joint pain from the start. I was injected in my upper left arm, but my lower right ankle was painful and my left wrist...    I am a 38 year old male with treated hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea. My mother who is 65 was vaccinated at the same time as myself and her symptoms were slow onset and much milder than mine but she too has headaches, upset stomach, fatigue, watery eyes, fever, chills, twitches, injection pain, etc.

Client&#39;s vital signs taken at 1553 and were BP 148/90, P 99, O2 97% and R 16. Client was given some water and animal crackers. Client was encouraged to drink fluids and stay hydrated. Client continued to report having nausea, dizziness, and a headache. Blood pressure was reassessed at 1610 and was 178/100. PHN questioned if client had high blood pressure and client reported, &#34;It runs in my family.&#34; PHN educated client that his BP was quite elevated, and PHN explained that a diastolic BP of 100 usually occurs over time. PHN advised client to go to walk in if his symptoms do not improve, but PHN strongly recommended client follow up with his primary care provider in regards to his elevated blood pressure. Client told PHN that he would most likely go to the walk in. Client verbalized understanding. Client left clinic with his wife who was giving him a ride. On 6/18/2021 at 1014 PHN placed call to client to see how client was feeling today. Call went straight to voicemail. PHN requested call back.

                                                Started feeling fatigued at about 6:15pm. Developed a headache shortly thereafter, and a fever at about 8:30pm. Fever, headache, body aches, and nausea continued through the night. Finally started taking acetaminophen at about 2:30am. Symptoms lessened after that until acetaminophen dosage started to wear off. Continued with 2 more courses of acetaminophen. All symptoms resolved by about 8pm and use of acetaminophen was discontinued.

Went away after 24 hours. The second began with profound feelings of mania 2 days later (Monday, March 8). This subsided in 24 hours. 4 days later- (Wednesday March 10) I began having difficulty standing upright.  This steadily became worse over the next several days until one week after the vaccination, where I was hugging walls and crawling on the floor to move from place to place.   This continued until Monday, March 15, when I was hospitalized.  Everything cleared up after 3 days in the hospital.

At around 2am April 11 I went to use the bathroom and blacked out. My wife found me on the floor and was able to rouse me. Went to the ER with severe stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, severe headache, fever, high pulse of 120-140bpm. Pulse dropped to 108bpm by the time i got to te hospital. Hospital administered Zofran for my gastro issues and ran an EKG. We waited 3&#43; hours and never saw a doctor and was never even taken back in the ER. We left due to staff and patients in the waiting room not wearing respirators or masks or even basic sanitary precautions or separation of patients with Covid symptoms from other patients.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.

Patient was assisted to the ground and legs were elevated.  It took patient about an hour until he was able to sit up without dizziness.  Juice and snacks given and VS were monitored.  Patient was evaluated by Dr. onsite and instructed not to drive.  Patient was picked up by his in-laws and instructed by Dr. to be checked out further at either Urgent Care or the ER due to prolonged dizziness after vaccination.  Pulse was 86 sitting to 99 standing.  BP stayed the same from sitting to standing.  Blood pressures with manual cuff were 160/80.  BP rechecked 30 minutes later and was 140/80.  Patient was assisted by staff to the car when in-laws arrived to pick him up.

Thursday night/Friday morning I had the most prolonged fever break I&#39;ve ever had; my entire bed was soaked.  Fever was gone by Friday sunrise.   Saturday I experienced a sever headache, stomach ache and in the evening shortness of breath. I felt extremely light headed. All symptoms cleared by Sunday.   I just drank plenty of fluids and rested as much as possible.

                                                This was one of the worst headaches I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Migraine headaches run in my family so I&#39;m no stranger to them, which is why it is particularly surprising. Along with the headache I had severe flu symptoms - body ache from head to toe, legs toward the end. Abdominal pain toward end. I was breathing heavily throughout, except for an hour or two of bad sleep. It was almost certainly a high fever, but I didn&#39;t measure. Chills, sweating. Complete misery. The extremely painful cycle lasted about 10 hours before it started to recede. I felt better close to 100% within 48 hours. I&#39;m reporting this because I&#39;ve realized that most people have &#34;mild flu like symptoms&#34; while my symptoms were extreme. If I had any other health issues (I don&#39;t) it seems obvious that it could have created a bigger problem. I didn&#39;t go to a hospital, but I should have, in hindsight.

                                                Day two  after getting the vaccine, I started feeling vertigo and nauseous. I hydrated extensively, and  day three are started to feel a little bit better.  Day four I took a turn for the worse, and the vertigo and nausea intensified.   In the middle of the night, the vertigo was extreme.  I almost checked myself into the ER, but I decided to try to continue sleeping and hopefully feel better in the morning. In the morning, day five, I went to my primary care doctor.  I told her my symptoms, she said possibly due to the vaccine.  She prescribed me meclizine.  I took it in the evening, and did not feel any symptom relief.  In the middle of the night, extreme vertigo again, it was atrocious.   Day six (Saturday), I checked myself into the ER.  They upped my dose of meclizine (to 50 mg).  This new dose also had zero effect on my vertigo/nausea.  I felt vertigo/nausea all day. Speaking to some doctors in the family, they suggested to me that I had developed BPPV. Day seven, woke up again with vertigo/nausea, and it didn?t subside at all as the day went on.  I spoke with my father, and he told me that he had BPPV before apparently.  He drove to my house and did the Eply maneuver on me 10 times throughout the day.  Felt a little bit better.  Scheduled an appt with ENT for following day. Day eight, feeling a little bit better (after eply maneuvers, possibly related).  Visited ENT, he reassured me that the vestibular system is very efficient and I will eventually get better.  Scheduled appt for me for neurologist and MRI for later that day.  Went to see neuro, did MRI.   Day nine, feeling even more a little bit better. Day ten, which is today, feeling even more a little bit better.  Saw neurologist for follow-up, he told me MRI turned out fine, everything looks good with brain.  Just stay very hydrated and relax, I should get better in a week.  I really went through hell, it was atrocious.  My doctors said could be vaccine-related, impossible to prove one way or the other.  I figured I?d report it, just in case there might be others in the country who went through the same thing.

                                                Monday, April 12th, around 2pm I started to develop extreme stomach pain, as well as noticed some shortness of breath or elevated heart rate. The stomach pain worsened after dinner. I  assumed it was something I ate, which was the same thing I eat every day, and expected it was some type of gas that would resolve itself naturally. I went to bed in lots of pain. I didn&#39;t sleep well due to the issues and woke up still in pain in my mid stomach, mostly on the left side. I called the nurse who did an intake and advised that I go to the ER (Tuesday, April 13th)

I was driving to work and had to keep pulling over because I felt dizzy. I ended up going to the Dr. and had test ran and they said I was extremely dehydrated and I didn&#39;t understand because I drink a lot of water. they hooked me up an IV and gave me fluids. They said I was Healthy just extremely dehydrated it.  My injection site was kind of tender but nothing more. I&#39;m still having issues. I&#39;m just always thirsty no matter how much water I drink.
