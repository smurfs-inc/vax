                                                Friday night at about 10ish I suddenly got a terrible migraine, shaking uncontrollably, and my body have stiff. I tried going to bed at 11pm, but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. I got up sometime around 2am and I still had all of these along with extreme nausea. Check my temperature, it was 101.4 F. Got more blankets and tried to get some sleep, but took a while due to the migraine.   At 7:30am, the shaking was gone and the migraine was not as bad, but I still had a temperature of 99.1 F and nausea. After calling my boss and mother, I went back to sleep. Stayed in bed until about 1:45pm Saturday. By then, the migraine was manageable and nausea was not as bad, though still had a temperature of 99.9 F. Took a shower and took 2 pills of  ibuprofen.

I woke up at 2:00 AM with a fever, body aches, headache, and severe nausea.  I proceeded to vomit until 6:00 AM.  The following day (3/13) included mild headache, mild body aches, and slight nausea.  By Sunday (3/14), all negative symptoms had gone away.

                                                Went most of the day with no symptoms. Performed a High Intensity Workout around 7pm for an hour, and ate shortly after. Took a hot shower and relaxed before bed time around 10pm started to have a headache. By 10:45 when I went to sleep it was an intense headache. Under the covers my body was incredibly hot, without covers I was freezing cold. I woke up around midnight in a sweat and again around 2:30am when I called in sick to work. I then sat in my bathroom for 30 minutes, threw up once, and then feeling much better (Still had an intense headache) I drank some water and fell back asleep in my room. Today is the second day, I have a small headache, have not eaten all day, and slept most of the afternoon. I highly recommend not working out the same day of getting the vaccine, I didn&#39;t think to ask about that when I received it. I doubt I would have had this problem if I rested instead.

Hearing came back after 5 minutes, but moderate body shakes began and lasted an hour. Got very cold feeling and began to feel fever like. Took acetaminophen and covered up with blankets and drank water. Took a couple hour nap and woke up sweating with terrible migraine and light body shakes. Fell asleep for a few more hours and woke up not feeling feverish, but migraine and body aches. 22 hours after onset I have a light headache and body aches and am mostly feeling recovered.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

He was feeling ok to sit back up in chair. About 5 minutes later he said he was feeling nauseous and wanted to lay down and elevate his legs again. He laid there for about 10 minutes no shortness of breath or nausea. He then wanted to stand up. This made him feel better. He remained in the waiting area for observation. Patient was feeling good to go home. I did follow up with him about an hour later. He did make it home and was feeling better.

                                                Woke up at 12:00am today with headache, lots of discomfort (especially in stomach), and for the most part could only fall back asleep for short intervals while being awake most of the night.   At around 2:30am, could barely walk into the front room. Just very slowly and painfully. Ended up in such a state that I absentmindedly urinated onnthe bathroom floor while pulling pant leg up to scratch an itch while urinating in toilet. Laying on back caused butt and thighs to hurt significantly more. Same for stomach. Getting up from and laying down on my floor mattress was and still is difficult.   Later into the morning at around 6:40am, had to crawl slowly on hands and knees to get back in the front room. By around 8am, I could walk around without it being unbearable. Just slow-ish. Ate breakfast, so stomach is more uncomfortable than in pain. Can lay on it without too much problem, but butt is still hurting. Stretching legs forward caused some pain.  Possible fever.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

The next morning I woke up with a headache and was achy/sore throughout my body. While I was eating I passed out without any signs. I was unconscious and do not remember the episode. Once I was alert, I felt nauseas and was heading to the restroom when I passed out again and was unconscious. I do not remember the episodes. There were no signs of passing out before I did either time.

                                                12 hours after my shot I developed a severe headache and fever of 102. This persisted for about 7 hours. Then the fever decreased to about 100.5 for the next 24 hours.  After my fever broke, however, I developed a chest cough with some phlegm. This feels like bronchitis and my doctor has prescribed azithromycin. I also feel rolling fatigue, which comes on randomly. The cough and fatigue has persisted so far for 6 days. In addition, though I do not have a fever most of the day, on some nights my fever spikes (last night, reaching 102 for a short period of time while trying to sleep). It has been 8 days since my injection. I have very little appetite (though I can smell and taste fine).

I woke up around 1am on 3/16 with fever/chills/body ache/headaches. Fever was around 103 degrees F at it&#39;s peak and stayed at or above 100 degrees from about 1am until about 5 or 6pm on 3/15. I took tylonel during this time. I also experienced diarrhea and loss of appetite during the day; random periods of feeling nauseous. I seemed to be dehydrated but drank a normal amount of water the day before. It felt like I had the flu, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve felt this sick since I was a kid. It was terrible. I felt incredibly tired on Tuesday but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. 3/17--woke up today feeling mostly fine minus a bit of lingering soreness and feeling very tired still.

                                                Towards the evening of the same day as receipt of the vaccine, I began to experience a growing fever, aches, and headache. By the time 11pm came around I was in a full blown fever which lasted until around 5:30 am the next day. The fever was reduced through the taking of two Acetaminophen pills. Throughout the night, I was unable to sleep due to intense headache pain, I felt exhausted and couldn?t move. I had a fever around 102 degrees Fahrenheit at its peak and maintaining usually around 101.4 degrees. I was nauseous and experienced emotional instability. The adverse affects lasted until the morning with some affects such as the headaches and nausea still currently lingering on to present time (10:48am).

The temperature flashes are still occurring 9 hours after injection and do not seem to be getting worse any more; hands and feet cannot warm up and neck and forehead are hot (no thermostat to look at temperature).

No treatment sought at this time.

                                                After receiving the Janssen Covid 19 vaccine, I proceeded to the waiting area and was instructed to wait 15 minutes before leaving the facility. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I started to feel faint, lightheaded, nausea, and clammy. I informed a member of the staff and several medical personnel came to assist. They laid me down on a cot and checked my vitals. I started to feel better after laying down. The staff took my blood pressure and heart rate readings, which were relatively normal. But after sitting me up and taking my vitals again, my blood pressure and heart rate spiked. I was taken to Hospital in an ambulance; however, after waiting in the ER waiting room for about 2.5 hours, I left without seeing a doctor. During those 2.5 hours my original symptoms did not return, so I elected to leave.

                                                CPT administered Janssen COVID-19 vaccine to the pt 4/5. While sitting in the pharmacy area for his 15 minute observation period, he fainted. He said that he was texting on his phone and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground with people around him asking if he was ok. He stated that he was very sweaty, nauseous, and a little dizzy. We called a code white, provided the pt with a cold compress and elevated his feet. Pt did not want us to call 911. Pt did not have PCP and has not been to a doctor in about 5 years. He said he was very nervous getting the shot and is afraid of needles so that may have contributed. Pt stayed in the pharmacy area for about 45 minutes until he started to feel better and his mom came to get him. I tried calling pt again at 7:10pm to check in, but there was no answer and I could not leave a voicemail due to mailbox being full.

About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

                                                After receiving my Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine I experienced a lack of motor function in my throat. Approximately 40 minutes after having received the shot, I lost the ability swallow. A tingling sensation took the back of my throat and eventually felt as though it moved into my head. The whole experience lasted a couple of minutes. Since that time all other symptoms have been normal, sore, slight fever, etc.

Felt basically normal by the time I left the facility and my arm has not been hurting since.   Approx 8:00 PM onset of headache, progressively worsening thru ~11:00 PM and plateauing. Headache was less by ~8:00 AM, and took Ibuprophin at 9:00 AM to further alleviate.   Approx 9:30-10:00 PM onset of chills and shivering, progressively worsening thru ~11:30 PM. Chills lasted through the night, but shivering stopped around 12:00 AM after turning the heat up and putting on more clothing, beanie, and blankets.   Fatigue is ongoing (as of now, ~22.5 hours after administration), but may be a result of poor sleep due to the chills overnight.

                                                **Uncertain if it this is related to the vaccine** On 3/14/21, a week after vaccine was administered, I had a fast food meal I&#39;ve had several times before. Around 30-40 minutes later, I began experiencing a reaction I&#39;m not prone to.  I had severe heartburn throughout most of the night and my lips began to swell which made me mistakenly assume I have had a cardiac event. While in the morning the pain had subsided, the numbness in the lips hadn&#39;t and I went to the ER thinking it might&#39;ve been a heart issue. No cardiac condition was noted at the hospital which leads me to believe I may have had a severe allergic reaction to foods or environmentals I&#39;ve never had reactions to.

                                                Terrible body aches starting at 8pm on April 1st.  Then had the chills.  Was able to take ibuprofen and slept for a bit.  Next morning April 2, got a migraine where it hurt to open my eyes.  Had that for about 2 hours then got better.  Also, I had trouble eating.  I would take a small bite of crackers and feel like I was going to throw up.  Took me a long time to eat a package of crackers and to drink 1 whole bottle of gatorade.  I took more ibuprofen through the day and that helped.  Around 5pm that night I was able to eat a little more and drink some with out feeling sick to my body.  Around 9pm that night headache came back and I went to bed for the night.  Today April 3 I feel a lot better.  Body still aches a bit and feels like I?ve been sick for 2 days so will probably take today and tomorrow to fully recoup.  No headache today.  Just small aches and tired.

By March 30th my heart start beating out of my chest and I felt like I was having a heart attack.  I could barely breath.  Went to get something to eat, walked half way and felt like I would fall on the ground, and returned to my room.  Called my parents because I wasn&#39;t sure if I would wake up the next morning. My team leader gave me a ride to the emergency room. They drew my blood and it was dark and thick.  They sent me home.  Still feel fatigue.

I was sweating profusely, experience nausea and then fainted and had a mild seizure. After coming to consciousness, I vomited and the pharmacy staff called the paramedics. I was extremely pale and the fever persisted for several minutes while waiting for the paramedics. I recovered and felt mostly normal after being given saline solution and anti-nausea medication. Hours after being released from the hospital, I have waves of cold chills and hot flashes.

Myalgia in legs happened immediately. No fever at this time.  Woke in morning with no fever, but muscle aches, malaise, lethargy, parasthesia were all present. Spent entire day in bed napping occasionally.  Measured temperature in evening at 100.7F.  Painful stomach pain happened in evening. Patient never gets acid pain or similar so this was very abnormal. Antacid helped but stomach pain continued all evening at a lesser degree.  When going to bed most symptoms had subsided. Still some parasthesia and Myalgia. Woke up on 4/9 feeling much better after lots of sleep.  No fever or other symptoms on morning of 4/9.

                                                I started to feel extreme fatigue around noon the day after but what I found very concerning is I lost probably 80-90% of the strength in my arms.  I couldn&#39;t palm a ball i had for the kids which i normally can easily.  I had chills and nausea as well.    I can&#39;t really remember much from that day and it feels like a big blur.  I woke up the next day feeling very irritable with brain fog.  Today its gotten better and I am hoping tomorrow I will be back to normal.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received my dose at 3pm on March 12, and experienced no adverse events until about 5 or 6 hours later. Between 8pm and 9pm, I felt a bit tired, though wasn?t sure it was vaccine-related at first. However, I shortly afterwards started feeling much more tired, and experienced chills and shivering. I went to sleep. My wife later said I felt very warm, though we did not measure my temperature.  During the night, at one point, I got up to go to the bathroom, and became very dizzy and nearly fell over, though I was able to catch myself and did not experience any fall or injury.   I went back to bed. At some other point during the night, I started sweating. My wife later said I felt cold at that point.  For most of the following day, Saturday, March 13, I no longer felt dizzy nor overly hot or cold, but had a migraine and mild nausea. I did not vomit, but I also ate very little during the day. I did eat a little in the morning, and had some water throughout the day. For the most part, I laid in bed, drifting in and out of sleep.   At about 7pm on March 13, I took two Tylenol to try to fight the headache. By 8pm I felt almost completely better. I ate more bits of food, and have felt fine since then. Sunday, I woke up and felt back to normal. I ate normally as well.

Several minutes later he started throwing up. I asked the nurse practitioner at the Clinic to help me; she took his vitals about 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine and they were...  HR 70, BP 110/60, RR 18  We gave him some wet paper towels for his head and asked  him to focus on his breathing. We kept him in the observation area for a total of 45 minutes.  He still wasn&#39;t feeling great when he left, but he said he wanted to go home and lie down. He only threw up the one time, but he did have some dry heaving once more after his vitals were taken.

Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

                                                Starting at 11 PM (roughly 7 hours after injection), I developed severe flu-like symptoms.  Fever, nausea, chills, and headache.  I was unable to sleep for most of the night.  I had a fever of over 100 degrees.  The symptoms were the worst from 11 PM - 4 AM.  They persisted throughout the next day (thus far), but have lessened in severity.  They are still present, however, 28 hours after initial injection - although roughly 50% less severe.  Acetaminophen seems to help.

                                                On Saturday 3/20 I experienced the usual symptoms that were noted. On Monday 3/22 I began to get very dizzy with a heart rate of 150bpm. My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

                                                Approximately ten minutes after receiving the vaccination I got very dizzy and passed out. I was out for 3-4 minutes and came to. Subsequent to passing out I vomited a few times and could not hold anything down. I also urinated on myself at some point when out. I was not getting better so 911 was called and I was transported to the emergency room via ambulance. Once the ambulance arrived at the hospital I vomited again filling about half of the vomit bag. I arrived at the hospital and an IV was not able to be administered so I was given Zofran for nausea and Gatorade to try and hold down. I spent approximately 4 hours in the ER, was able to finally get to the point where the nausea calmed down and I was able to walk around. I was then discharged.

                                                While sitting down during the post-vaccination period, patient asked his wife for water about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Pharmacy staff provided water and pharmacist went over to check on the patient. Patient expressed feeling &#34;hot&#34; and wanted an ice-pack, which was given. Patient expressed feeling &#34;faint,&#34; after which he briefly lost consciousness. Pharmacist immediately started checking for pulse and obtained Emergency Kit. Patient regained consciousness quickly without need of CPR or administration of Emergency Kit medications. At some point patient also released his bladder,  most likely during the syncope episode. Patient expressing feeling &#34;nauseous&#34; and asked for something to throw up in. Pharmacist quickly got a trash can and gave to patient, shortly after which patient started vomiting. Pharmacist was attending to patient and asked patient if he wanted 911 to be called, to which he replied &#34;No&#34; and that he just needed some time to sit. Patient also stated he did not eat much that day. Pharmacist offered Pedialyte, to which patient agreed, in order to replenish fluids/electrolytes lost due to vomiting. Patient also asked for some crackers since he did not eat much earlier. After taking sips of Pedialyte and taking bites of crackers, patient could not hold anything down and continued to vomit. At that time patient&#39;s wife asked pharmacy staff to proceed with calling 911. 911 was called and paramedics took patient&#39;s vitals upon arrival at the scene. Vitals were all stated to be normal. Patient agreed to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. A couple hours later patient&#39;s wife informed pharmacy staff that patient was doing much better and was expected to be released from hospital soon. Before receiving vaccination, patient did share that in the past he had &#34;felt faint&#34; when giving blood but it was not made clear that patient had felt faint or fainted during vaccinations prior. After the incident patient&#39;s wife confirmed that patient had fainted in the past both after giving blood and after receiving vaccinations. Pharmacist called patient at 9:12 AM the following day (4/3/21) to see how patient was doing but was only able to leave a voicemail message.

At 1:30am, I woke up needing to urinate. I went into the bathroom and lost consciousness, finding myself with one hand in the toilet and one on the side. I felt nauseous and thought I would vomit, but didn&#39;t and believe I lost consciousness again. I was able to make it to the sink to try to wash my hands, and I fell down on my knees. I knew I was bleeding somewhere but didn&#39;t know from where (my right pinky was cut on an item in the bathroom when I fell). My wife made it to me, and I lost consciousness a couple more times while talking with her. I laid on the bathroom floor for a

By 12 hours after vaccination my symptoms were more severe and included fevers 101.5, headaches, severe body aches, chills, dizziness, nausea, and hearing sensitivity. By 36 hours after vaccination my symptoms had mostly subsided with just minor dizziness and nausea remaining.

I went to an urgent care facility around 11AM and was sent for a CT scan which diagnosed appendicitis. I had my appendix removed at 11pm on Friday night.   I do not know if it was related to the vaccine, but thought I should report it just in case.

Continued with 2 more courses of acetaminophen. All symptoms resolved by about 8pm and use of acetaminophen was discontinued.

                                                2 noticable issues-  The first started 12 hours after the vaccination - (Saturday, March 6) Fever, chills, aches, headaches, nausea.  Went away after 24 hours. The second began with profound feelings of mania 2 days later (Monday, March 8). This subsided in 24 hours. 4 days later- (Wednesday March 10) I began having difficulty standing upright.  This steadily became worse over the next several days until one week after the vaccination, where I was hugging walls and crawling on the floor to move from place to place.   This continued until Monday, March 15, when I was hospitalized.  Everything cleared up after 3 days in the hospital.
