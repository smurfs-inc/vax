                                                Dizzy, run down two hours after injection. Woke up 4 am then off and on with extreme body pain, sore neck , lower back, right hand and arm. Headache and fatigue at 6:45 am got up with two children (2 yrs and 10 months) ate small breakfast by 9 am I couldn?t get off the couch or stay awake. My head started aching and my eyes hurt, I felt extreme chills two thick blankets weren?t enough to warm me. Extreme fatigue, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I fell asleep and didnt have the energy to walk to my bed until 2:30 pm.  It set off my stomach and I was vomiting off and on until around 9 pm. By then I could keep little bits of fluid and food down. Then I was hot. I felt flushed but had no fever. My usual heart rate is 52-54 bpm via Watch while laying down. My heart rate during this hot period laying in bed was 102 -101 bpm. Which is consistent for my workout heart rate. I went to sleep and woke up 7 am with my kids and was well enough to take care of them but not do all my usual chores. I couldn?t bend down or put my head lower than chest or the extreme throbbing headache was back. Still had body aches and fatigue but nowhere near yesterday. It is 11:22 pm Sunday and I feel spent.

She had been waiting less than 10 minutes.  I went to her and she said she was feeling very strange and was nauseous. I tried to get her up but she couldn&#39;t walk so I let her sit back down. She was not able to communicate with me but was conscious. She said her vision was distorted. her lips started to turn blue and I continued to monitor her. I called 911 and she said she was having difficulty catching her breath so I went for the epipen and gave her 0.3 mg in the outer thigh of her right leg. her color started to improve and she was able to comunicate better. I followed EMS instructions and continued to monitor her until they arrived.

(I have migraines, but this pain was on the left side of my head, not my right like usual, and was even more intense than usual.)  I had chills and sweats, and body aches.  I checked several times and had no fever.  By the next morning (Saturday, March 13 at 7 am) I was feeling fine.

                                                Head ache and fever started the evening of March. Severe vertigo and nausea began sometime overnight or early the next morning. I was bed-ridden most of the day. I took zofran and ibuprofen. From then on the severe vertigo happened only while changing positions such as laying down and getting up. I saw a nurse practitioner on March 16th who told me it was due to ear wax. I received a prescription (meclizine) for the nausea and dizziness and bought an ear wax kit. The next a friend said her husband had the exact same symptoms as I was experiencing and that it was called facility. My husband assisted me with the epley maneuver twice on March 17th. By March 18th the vertigo was gone, with just slight dizziness during the day.

The day after the shot, on Tuesday 3/23 at 7:30am, about 30 minutes after waking up, I felt nausea for a brief instant and immediately the need to vomit; I then had one episode of throwing up, pretty intense. After that I felt weak and cancelled my fitness class I was going to teach in the afternoon. I spent the rest of the day resting and taking care of myself because I felt exhausted.

                                                I felt light headedness right away. The night that I got the injection, I felt kind of drunk. I felt like I had too much alcohol. I am very sensitive to things. I felt silly - loose - tired.  In the night, I had aches and chills - no fever. The next day I felt achy and really really tired. I had a pain at the injection site. That evolved into a left side migraine (the achiness and fatigue and pain from shot) It created tension up my arm and up my neck - and I did get nausea with the headache - on Saturday. Sunday, I felt a little bit better but energy was still low - unusual tiredness; couldn&#39;t exercise as I felt a heavy fatigue. On Sunday, I went to a dance class but it was difficult as I was tired. On Monday, I felt a tiny bit better but still fatigued and did another dance class which went a little better. On Monday evening, I felt like I did the night of the injection - a little loopy and &#34;drunk like.&#34; Monday night, I woke up with a Fiery, achy, itchy, burning rash on both of my arms and the tops of my legs. If I would itch it, it would exaggerate it. When I woke up the next day - the rash went everywhere in my body - it would come and go in different places - neck, face, down and up my legs and feet and on my butt. Pretty much every spot had the rash at one time or another. It was really bad on Tuesday morning, I called the doctor. Was treated with Benadryl and cortisone cream which helped with the symptoms. Tuesday night, it was excruciating - it was all up and down my legs, arms, neck and face and stomach and rear end and feet. It was very achy, burning and itchy - very intense. It would hurt if I scratched it. Accompanied with really intense fatigue. Wednesday, after taking Benadryl, I woke up and it was a tiny bit better. It was still on my legs, neck and face. Sometimes my arms would flare up and sometimes they wouldn&#39;t. Any kind of exertion - like my dance class - would trigger the rash - so I took a break from exercising that week.  It started getting incrementally better - very slowly. Still there on Thursday - still fatigued and I was still taking Benadryl. Friday, also. Saturday, it was pretty much gone but it would threaten to come back and I felt itchiness in my legs when I went for a walk. It still feels a little lingering - my legs are itchy. I&#39;m still building back my energy. Incrementally my energy is increasing. Still not 100% there but it&#39;s getting better day by day.  Note: My history with my skin: I do get flare ups when I get bug bites and when I get poison ivy - I have very sensitive skin.

Administered Toradol and IV fluids, discharged me with good vitals, but still tachycardia, headache, and vomiting. The next day (3/20), I still had a bad headache and could  not keep liquids down. I vomited perhaps 12 times, then called the doctor. She sent me to Urgent Care to receive injections of Toradol and Phenergan. Within the hour, I  could drink. Then shortly after, I  could eat. I  felt better for one day. The next day (3/22), my heart started pounding, and I was unable to sleep horizontally. I  needed to sleep on 3 pillows due to chest discomfort. My chest still feels very uncomfortable. Abdominal breathing is helping to an extent. I have had to stay in bed and greatly reduce my activities since receiving the vaccine.  Today is one week, and I am still in bed.

The injection site and arm never hurt besides joint pain.

                                                She got the vaccine she was fine, had a mild cramping in her stomach.  She wakes up at 5:00 AM in the morning for work and on Friday she could not put her feet on the ground for pain in her legs.  She also had a bad headache on the left side and took Advil for that, and then the headache switched to the right side.  She then took another Advil, and that was all she took that day and was that way the whole weekend.  She had pain all weekend and could not touch herself as the pain was so bad.  She also had chills, nauseated, her vision was going in and out as if she was at the eye doctors office.  Her uncle brought her mother over to her as she could not take care of herself or drive to take care of her cousin who she takes care of.  She went to go work on Monday 3/26/21  then she started having difficulty breathing  and her employer called the EMT&#39;s, they checked her heart rate which was high and did her oxygen level which was fine, and were afraid she may have gone into cardiac arrest, and told her to rest.  She called her doctor who told her that it was a bad reaction to the vaccine.   She is still having difficulty breathing after walking so far, she weighs 115# and has always been a small person.  She was not given any medications by her doctor and told her to rest and if it worsened to call her back.    She had been seen two weeks prior by her doctor for a sinus infection and was given an allergy shot and some other injection of which she does not know what it was, possibly a steroid.

With history of panic attacks we observed closely.  After 25 minutes, and symptoms getting worse, we decided it was best to administer epi-pen and called 911.  Symptoms got a bit better after a minute. After about 7 minutes another epi-pen was administered as symptoms were starting to get worse again.

Fiancé said she was breathing better but there was a rash and itching at injection site which was being treated with Benadryl and Prednisone.

                                                I experienced slight nausea, awake all night, felt like a stimulant to me, fever, chills, sweating, migraines. I felt super tired but my body would not let me sleep. I also had muscle aches and cramps with lower back and leg with a throbbing sensation. This was within 12 hours. About 5 days later, my eye started to hurt, went to se my eye doctor and they found out I have ocular herpes. I am on now on some antiviral eye medication. I could tell after the vaccine I had a viral type infection. I still have not recovered and I will see my eye doctor tomorrow.

                                                On 4-8-21 at approx 2:30am I woke up with chills, nausea and severe diarrhea. I began experiencing severe abdominal pain in belly button as if it were on fire. Hurt to take deep breaths. Developed hives all over body and very itchy. Scheduled phone call with triage nurse at 11:15am and then a follow up call again with my primary care doctor immediately following. At approx 1:22pm my primary care doctor told me to go to urgent care or ER due to concern of me going into anaphylactic shock. Immediately went to Emergency Room and admitted after waiting in waiting room for over 5 hrs. After bloodwork and CT Scan of abdomen my appendix was perforated and needed to be removed immediately. Immediately sent to OR for surgery at 11pm.

As I walked out of the pharmacy to see what her reaction was her muscles tensed up and she became completely rigid and stared sliding out of her chair. By appearances it looked like she was shaving a mild seizure, with a blank stare. By the time I got her down on the floor and got her coat off to see if there was an allergic reaction to the site the patient came too and asked me why she was in the floor. At that time she was clamy but knew who she was and where she was. Paramedics were called and while they were here she stated that she was dizzy and nauseous so they ended up taking her to a location hospital to be seen. While there they drew blood as a precaution.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approx 7 p.m.,  I noticed moderate pain in my lower back, hips, and legs. Around 7 30, I felt very cold and began covering up with several blankets and turning up the heat. Husband and kids reported the house was not cold at all. Within 15 minutes, chills began and increased quickly to an almost violent state. I was shivering so badly, it became painful and scary. My husband added three blankets on top of our down comforter and sent me to bed. It took approx 15 minutes to warm up, stop shivering, and slow teeth chattering enough to relax and fall asleep. Awoke around 1:30am feeling incredibly thirsty and in desperate need of water. Upon standing, the pain in my body was excruciating which made it extremely difficult to walk. Finally in the kitchen, I took Ibuprofen 800mg and filled a large bottle with water. I began to feel incredibly dizzy and needed help from my husband to get to the couch. It took approximately 2 hours before I began to feel any relief from the ibuprofen. Around 6:30 a.m., about 60 to 65% of the pain had abated and I had finished around 100oz of water. The remainder of the day was spent feeling extreme fatigue and a general sense of unwell. Appetite was poor throughout entire event. This all continued into the evening until bedtime at 11pm. Experienced moderate insomnia overnight, falling asleep around 2:30am. Could not fall asleep due to constantly thinking about the stress of the previous 24&#43; hours. Upon waking this morning, I feel almost back up to 100%.

                                                About 7 hours after the vaccine injection I started to feel flu-like symptoms: aches, chills, woozy and slightly nauseous. Within the next few hours the symptoms became increasingly worse, but not different other than the addition of a headache. I took 2 Tylenol to help with the headache and fever. Overnight sleep was difficult due to chills, sweats, fever dreams and aches. The symptoms lessened the next day (24-hours post injection), but still included muscle/body aches, headache, and extreme fatigue. Again took 2 Tylenol to help. Today (48-hours post injection) I&#39;m feeling quite a bit better although still not 100%. Soreness at injection site persists, especially when lifting my arm.

                                                Patient received her vaccine at 11:30 AM.  Immediately after receiving the Jansen vaccine, the patient reported feeling lightheaded as she stood up.  She sat in our waiting area for about 10 minutes, and reported that she felt as though her tongue was swelling.  We contacted EMS at this point, and provided a dose of Benadryl to the patient at her request.  We brought the patient into our vaccine room where she began to break out into hives.  She vomited several times.  EMS arrived shortly thereafter and checked to see if the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction.  EMS took the patient to the hospital.  At about 2 PM, the patient called the pharmacy to let us know that she was okay.  She said that it was confirmed as an allergic reaction at the hospital.  She indicated that she had received a steroid injection at the hospital and was feeling much better.  We encouraged the patient to call us at any time if she had any further problems or questions.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid in January 2021 and have not regained my taste or smell.  I was in bed for 2 weeks and had a prolonged fever up to 105 degrees--so high that I had visual and auditory hallucinations.  I had hair loss in the following months and I also continue to be fatigued.    I received the vaccination on 4/6/21 around 11am; a slight headache and face flushing occurred about 30 minutes after shot, but generally felt ok.  Woke up at 4am on 4/7/21 with chills, extreme joint pain, body aches, migraine headache, and a fever of 101.5 degrees.  Took Tylenol around 6am and went back to bed.  The migraine headache, chills, body aches, and extreme joint pain continued.  I was dizzy and extremely fatigued.  Woke up around 9 am and fever was at 102.7 degrees.  Joint pain and headache were almost unbearable at this point and I took a hydrocodone.  Took temperature around 12 pm and it was 103.5 degrees.  Fever continued rising to 104.4 degrees at 2:30 pm.  Took another Tylenol and went to sleep.  The next day, my fever had fallen back down to 102.5 degrees.  I continued with Tylenol to control me fever to around 101 degrees.   My fever persisted for 3 days.  I still have extreme fatigue, joint pain, burning scalp (which will likely mean more hair loss), zero appetite and weight loss, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.  The side effects are exactly how i felt when I got Covid in January.

                                                At 5:30 pm, I started to have a headache, so I took some Tylenol.  I started to feel a little better.  From about 7:00 pm to about midnight, I felt awful.  I couldn&#39;t walk down a short hall without assistance.  I was so sore and achy I couldn&#39;t really sleep.  I felt insanely hot, yet had chills and I had a terrible headache.  I am type 1 diabetic, and my blood sugar spiked to over 200, where it hovered between 200 &amp; 300 most of the night, despite the fact that I used insulin to try and lower it.  From 10 pm to midnight, I felt nauseous.  Overnight was ok.  I still had some of those symptoms, but could sleep off and on.  I probably woke up every couple of hours.  I was till very sore and hot, but not as hot, and still had a headache.  Today, I took Tylenol this morning.  I still have a mild headache, sore body, tired and a little slow, but significantly better than last night.

Patient stated she started feeling nauseous and light headed so asked if she can wait outside for some fresh air. When she went outside, she sat on the edge of the stairs and fell backwards and passed out. The store manager was there to catch her before her head hit the pavement. Patient wasn&#39;t alert for about 2 minutes. Pharmacist came out and assessed the patient and she was communicative. She was in and out but was able to tell us her name, DOB and where she was. We sat her up,  gave her some water, and waited with her. She requested not to call the ambulance. I checked her pulse at 1:15pm and it was 92. I checked her pulse again at 1:30pm and it went down to 72. Patient was fully alert and speaking in full sentences by 1:35pm. She called her mom and was able to stand up without feeling dizzy. She walked to the car with assistance and was driven home by her mother.

                                                Dizziness immediately following vaccine. Slight headache, moderate muscle aches, severe pain at injection site. It was also swollen with redness, itching, and it was hot. . Never had a fever. I immediately started taking Benadryl every 4 hours. I had really bad nausea (no vomiting)  to the point I was unable to eat and lost 7 lbs. I had really bad cold sweats so bad I was drenched with sweat multiple times a day for over a week. I ended up going to the walk in clinic about 5 days after the injection and was given Zofran for nausea.  I was also told I had a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine and any other time they would start me on steroids but they said if I took steroids it would make the vaccine not work. So I was told to continue Benadryl and deal with it.  To this day which will be two weeks tomorrow since I received the shot I still have a hard hot lump in my arm, I still break out in cold sweats, and still have a little nausea.  Never had wheezing or issues breathing though.

Woke up with headache and chills at 3:15am.  Took temperature - no fever (98.0).  Went back to sleep until 6am.  Woke up with a headache and chills again and took temperature again - no fever (98.6).  Could only stomach ginger tea.  Attended a computer work meeting at 7am, and couldn&#39;t stay awake after that.  Was back in bed before 8am.  Slept until 10:45am (24 hours after injection) and woke up feeling OK and hungry.  It&#39;s now 1:45 pm April 8, and I feel mostly fine but still unusually tired.

Most symptoms lasted three full days.  One week after the vaccination and I still have confusion, dizziness, and vertigo like symptoms. If I look up or down or side to side too quickly, I feel extremely dizzy and nauseated. I can?t stand for more than about 5 minutes without feeling dizziness and nausea set in, even getting on my bike causes nausea and dizziness, driving, walking, anything related to movement. **Only had one vaccine - the form added a second set of boxes above and won?t let me remove it on this form.

Couldn&#39;t walk was shaking so much.  Speaking was difficult.  Breath was labored.  It was so scary my husband called the doctor.  Shook violently with teeth chattering for 45 minutes then would break for a few minutes before shaking again.  The shaking was probably 60 minutes total.  Then fever set in.  Fever hit 102.4 at 6:15pm.  102.9 at 6:40pm.  103.8 at 8:15pm.  Fever ranged between 102.3 and 103.8 for 8 hours after starting then finally broke 1:45am (8 1/2 hours after the shaking started).  Was able to get out of bed 8:00am today.  Massive headache for the morning but no fever today.  26 1/2 hours post vaccine new and I just feel very tired and drained.

I sat on the floor and started vomiting. I kept gagging nonstop for several minutes. During that time I urinated on myself, I felt strong stomach aches, headache, and my body felt extremely fatigued.  I was dizzy and sweating. All these symptoms came back again a few minutes later. I do not remember how long everything lasted. I woke up the next day with a slightly upset stomach and headache.

I took 400 mg of ibuprofen and was able to sleep.  The following day I had intense body aches and extreme exhaustion all day long.  I managed it through doses of ibuprofen.  I was able to sleep all night the following night with some NyQuil.  The second day, I woke up feeling still a little weak and tired, but the body aches have subsided significantly.  It&#39;s nothing crazy, but it felt like I should report so there is more information for the researchers and public.  I did have COVID March/April 2020.  I had body aches, fatigue, chest tightness, loss of taste and smell, but NO FEVER.  It was undiagnosed at the time (no fever), but in October 2020, I gave blood and I did have COVID antibodies.  I gave again in January 2021 and I still had the COVID antibodies.  I received the vaccine March 10.  Thank you!

                                                So I reacted pretty severely to the vaccine. It&#39;s almost been 24 hours now, and my symptoms are almost gone. I had, in this order, compounded, with the peak happening about 12 hours afterwards: immediate dizziness about 10 minutes after the shot, nausea started about 30 min, at 4 hours a strong headache that didn?t go away until now, took Tylenol at 7pm, stiffness in the joints, hands, and feet started about 6 hours of shot, at 8 hours pain in the shoulders and neck, at 12 hours cramping all down my back and my hips and low fever. Fever continued until around 6am despite taking more tilt at 2am. Finally got to sleep at 6am. Woke with remaining stiffness and headache at 7:30am. Nausea continued for another 6 hours. Headache continued for another 6 hours. Muscles remained sore due to severe cramping last night.

Clinical Presentation and Course: 1 week after receiving Janssen COVID19 vaccination, patient developed gradually worsening headache. On March 17th, patient presented to Hospital with dry heaving, sudden worsening of headache and  L sided weakness.  Evaluation with head CT revealed a large R temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 1.3cm midline shift.  She ended up getting intubated for worsening mental status. On evaluation at arrival in Medical Center, she was noted to have extensor posturing.  Repeat imaging revealed worsening midline shift to 1.6cm.  CTA showed cortical vein thrombosis involving the right transverse and sigmoid sigmoid sinus with tentorial herniation. Patient developed brain herniation and brain death was pronounced on March 18th, 2021.

                                                I had burning with the actual injection.  It burned as it went in and went down a small ways into my left arm.  The rest of the day I had the normal symptoms- Pounding headache, nausea, horrible body aches (couldn?t lay down or stand to be comfortable).  That night around 11:45pm I got up to let my dog in and I started seeing small black dots- blurry vision.  I felt nauseas.  I ended up falling on the floor.  I was able to get up.  I then ended up waking up in the bathroom on the floor and had no idea how I had gotten there.  My hands were vibrating.  I called my husband from work to come help me up.  I was able to sleep and didn?t seek medical attention.  I am not sure if it was low blood pressure or what could have happened I have never experienced that before.  I did contact my doctor?s office this afternoon via (online) but haven?t had a response yet.  I have been in bed all day today.  - Body aches, nausea, pounding headache

                                                Event took place at an off-site event, in a detention facility. Pt received Janssen COVID vaccine around 4:00 pm. Pt immediately reported nausea. Nurse accompanied pt to the restroom about 2 minutes after receiving vaccine, where she gagged into the sink and spit up a little clear fluid. Pt reported feeling hot and sat down in a chair available in the restroom. Pt and nurse joined by a second nurse. Shortly after sitting down pt complained of feeling dizzy and was moved to the floor to lay down. When laying down, pt appeared flushed under her chin and complained of chest tightness. She requested to sit up to help with breathing. Called 911 and first dose of epinephrine (0.5 mL of 1mg/1mL) administered, both at 4:10 pm. Pt reported no change in chest tightness following epi, but continued to respond to questions. She said she felt tired and wanted to go to sleep. Pt continued to report difficulty breathing, and another dose of epinephrine administered at 4:15 pm. A physician at GEO arrived and administered oxygen. He listened to pt&#39;s heart and lungs and reported that there was air movement in her lungs. Pt ceased to respond coherently to questions, slurring and moaning, but did not lose consciousness. Pt started tapping her lips and, upon questioning, said they felt numb. Third dose of epinephrine administered at 4:20 pm. Nurse continued to jostle patient and ask her questions, and patient continued to respond with short, slurred answers. EMS arrived at 4:23 pm and transported patient to the hospital.

I was laid on the pharmacy floor immediately after reactions with a cold pack under my neck and my feet elevated. Within 5 minutes I was able to open my eyes and able to stand. I left with some dizziness and a headache that remained for a few days. I also had severe body aches for a couple of days and fatigue. Only thing is the arm pain and a little tiredness today.

This continued so she visited the ER on Wednesday, March 24, 2021, where she suffered a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.  She was pronounced brain dead on March 27, 2021, which is also the same day she was pronounced dead.

                                                Around four hours later began with a head, heart beat really fast, small fever, extreme nausea and IBS-like symptoms (gas pains and diarrhea), fatigue. The later lasted for nearly a week, but the rest were gone by day 3. I did not see a dr as my fever never got very high and only occurred the first night. The nausea last maybe a day and a half. I am about two weeks out and I seem to be having a gluten skin reaction (dermatitis herpetiformis) and given most of the symptoms I listed could also be celiac symptoms, I was curious if there was gluten in the shot as it was very much like an extreme reaction to gluten that I normally get with celiac. I usually see gluten rashes a couple of weeks to a month after being exposed and I was not exposed to anything during the last few weeks that could be causing it (that I know of). The nurse who gave me the shot did not know if there was gluten in the shot. Hence, I know the first symptoms were definitely related to the shot, but not if the current rash is from the shot (because gluten, this is definitely DH and not an allergy rash). I hope this helps, if other celiacs have also had a hard time.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

                                                Starting on morning of Day after vaccine, experienced very SEVERE fatigue, headache, and nausea. Also low grade fever with sweats and mild sore throat.  Arm was mildly sore at injection site for several days.  Headache and fatigue continued for three full days. On 5th and 6th day after vaccine, had diarrhea.  Was told by doctor at vaccine event not to take any anti-inflammatories for 3 to 5 days.  He said Tylenol was ok.  Took Tylenol day after vaccine when adverse effects were the worst and it did not help at all.  Finally took Advil on day 4 and it relieved headache.  Now 7 days after vaccine still have intermittent headache.

The flu-like symptoms included muscle aches, nausea, stomach pain including more significant pain in the upper left stomach area, headache and fatigue with difficulty sleeping.  I needed to take time off from work due to these side effects and had difficulty performing daily activities.  Also experienced pain at injection site that got worse in the first 12 hours and lasted also approximately 36 hours.  Minor nausea, stomach pain and injection site pain have continued after 36 hours with ability to return to daily living activities.

                                                I received the vaccine on March 27, 2021. Seconds after the injection was completed my vision went blurry, but it only lasted a few seconds. On March 28, 2021 I felt like my body was going to explode. My blood in the back of my head was thumping. I tried to take a nap to calm my body down but my body felt comp!eye unrest and thumping. My urine made the whole inside of the toilet water look like a white thick cloud.  I have never seen my urine look like that in my life. I used my husbands blood pressure monitor and my blood pressure was 152/104!  I arrived at urgent care about 5:30 PM. They gave me a blood pressure pill. I have never had a blood pressure pill my entire life. They also took a urine sample since I told them about the my very strange looking urine. They found protein and blood in my urine. The culture days later showed no infection. I am still having issues with the high blood pressure.

NO FEVER but major body aches and soreness. AFter the chills wore off I was in a sweat..this pattern of chills, vs soaking sweats continued throughout the night. Add to that dry heaves due to nausea but no vomiting. The dry heaves just added to the muscle pains that I already had. I was in bed until 5 pm the next day, no energy, sore body aches to the point that my skin hurt. still no soreness in my arm at all. I finally had the strength to get out of bed at 5pm took a shower and ate 2 pieces of toast to combat the nausea. Fast forward next day, felt fine and arm was mildly sore at injection sight. SO glad J and J is only one dose.. I would have dreaded a second day like that.

I took two Advil&#39;s and went down to 100. Around 10am the next morning it broke. I went to see my Doctor thought that my immune system over reacted to the vaccine as I haven&#39;t been out in a year or been sick, she wasn&#39;t too concerned about it. I&#39;ve had some stomach issues- mild diarrhea and stomach pain. Not sure it has to do with the vaccine.

                                                At time of shot, burning in arm as serum was being injected, and extreme dizziness where I almost fell off the chair. Dizziness lasted for a few minutes which created nausea. Sat at site for approximately 25 minutes after shot. Left arm was sore between shoulder and elbow, which was to be expected. Later in the evening, experienced fatigue. When trying to go to bed around 11pm,  my left are was throbbing. I did take Tylenol at about 6pm. Throughout the AM hours, sever body aches started, extreme fatigue throughout the following day. Flu like symptoms continued the next day.  I had heard of these symptoms for the other shots but not for Johnson and Johnson. Hungry but too weak to actually cook.

I only had children?s Tylenol so I took that but it did not treat the symptoms. Thirteen hours later I took extra strength Tylenol and that helped with the treatment of most of the symptoms. About eighteen hours later I started to feel better. I had residual hot flashes 48 hours later.

It felt like my bones were made out of glass and someone had taken a hammer to my bones.  My face was swollen and red.  Unable to sit up.  Walk from bed to toilet only.  Overall, I would say extreme flu-like symptoms.  Temperature 99.6 all day.   I could not take the pain any further at 4:20 pm and took 1,000 mg of Tylenol.  I finally fell asleep and woke up at 8:30pm and could walk again and my fever had broken.  I still don&#39;t feel great, but I think the worst is behind me.

I rested a lot because I couldn&#39;t move because I was so tired, achy, really cold and I threw up everything I happened. I waited to contact my doctor in hopes that it would go away, but I couldn&#39;t stop vomiting. By that Monday, I decided to get help. I was told to go to the hospital to get rehydrated. They did a CT Scan and they didn&#39;t find anything. I am waiting to follow up with my doctor since I am still throwing up.

Went to the ER the next day to be treated for the stomach upset and migraine. Found out I had a fever of 101 degrees. Was treated with a few medications. Migraine subsided a little bit and then I was sent home. It is now almost 48 hours post-covid vaccine and I still have a headache.

Because of this, I was getting nauseous and fever spikes. Then about 3:30am, I had water like diarrhea. After that, I started to feel dizzy (I was fine as long as I still) with cold chills along with being very tired.  When I got home, I took some Ibuprofen and took a nap (4 hour nap). Began to feel much better. When I woke up, I felt better but still had a stiffness in my shoulder blade area and left side neck.

                                                Moments after the vaccine my arm and hands started tingling and becoming numb in various spots which continued all over my entire face.  I was monitored and was given a shot of benedryl and was sent home after a while.   The next day I felt really groggy, latargic and had diarreah.  That monday the numbness went up to my ear and I reached out to my PCP who prescribed a steroid.   Later that evening I got a really bad headache and the tingling and numbness hit my feet then went up my legs, my arms and up and down my body.  Its a feeling as if my body has fallen asleep.

Over the next 10 minutes, I noticed swelling in my throat (swallowing felt somewhat obstructed).  These persisted for an hour or so until I took Benedryl which seemed to ease the numbness but the swollen throat persisted..

I had a severe migraine and also vomiting but most of all is the spinning of y head like when people have vertigo. I havent been able to eat food because it comes out both ways, either i vomit or constant diarrhea. i made a call to my doctor waiting for her response. this symptos started around 6pm on 03/06/21 and still until today 03/08/21

Chills and fever intensified, and fever rose to 103  by 10pm, with headache and body aches (mainly legs). I had very mild nausea &amp; loss of appetite. Over the course of the night, I tried to stay hydrated with water and apple juice. By about 11pm, I took 200mg of Advil. I took another 200mg Advil several hours later. Throughout the next day, Sunday, my fever subsided gradually, significant fatigue persisted as did loss of appetite. By Monday, I was left feeling mostly weak and worn out, but on the road to recovery. By Tuesday morning (now), I feel that the I will be recovered by tomorrow.

Arm was sore but no more than any other vaccine. close to 4 hours later, headache started, felt hot and cold. Hard to sleep, sweating a lot during the night. Headache was so bad it felt like a combination of a bad flu with a hangover. felt very thirty. In the morning I was dizzy, hot, cold, temp 99.8, sick to my stomach, coudn&#39;t taste food very well, just like when you have the flu, nothing taste good. I spend the following day in and out of sleep, very tired, hard to focus. The sensation for being hot and cold continued. Took Imitrex to alleviate the headache/migraine . I did help, but not much. Hard to eat due to an upset stomach. Today is the first full day. I hope I&#39;m better tomorrow

I can stay awake for longer periods of time, but if I get up for anything for any more than a few minutes, I feel weak and dizzy again.

All over body aches, no appetite, weakness, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, burning eyes, ataxia, lightheadedness. Took my AM meds including hydrocodone-APAP which caused the fever to break but stayed low grade until the following afternoon around 2 PM. Helped with the body aches somewhat as well. Appetite started to return this morning, 3 days after the vaccine but the fatigue, weakness, muscular pain and a general unwell feeling continues.

When I got out of bed I was lightheaded and passed out in the bathroom as I was getting Tylenol.  I took 2 Tylenol and had diarrhea about 10 mins later.  I went to get some gatorade and passed out again in the hallway on the way to the kitchen.  About an hour after taking Tylenol symptoms began to improve but became nauseous and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  As of 2pm Sunday current symptoms are extreme nausea and extreme exhaustion.

I had vomiting and diarrhea for seven hours. I had hives about an hour and a half after the shot all over especially and my feet. The hives were extremely itchy, and my skin felt like it was on fire. The next morning, I went to urgent care and gave me an anti-itch medicine/antihistamine Hydroxyzine. The prescribed medicine knocked me out, but it only helped a little with the itching. The hives stayed for another four days. I have also had severe joint pain that is still lingering in my feet and hands. I don?t normally have joint pain, but it started the day after the shot.

                                                Approximately a half hour after the Janssen vaccine was administered on Monday, March 15, 2021 at 2:00pm, I felt a dull ache/sensation in the back, lower part of my head. No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

The fatigue and the time frame it has lasted is what concerns me, that it is 3/29 and still happening.  I had my annual blood work just weeks ago and everything was in normal range except my cholesterol was elevated.

At 2 pm I started feeling warm, not feverish. 12 hours after the shot I started feeling achy and cold. When I woke up on March 25th, I was achy, with chills and internal heat, no fever though. Basically every muscle hurt and I really couldn&#39;t move.  I spent the entire day in bed unable to eat or even move. I had to take the day off from work.   I think I had Covid in Feb 2020 before testing began. The symptoms I felt in February 2020 were exactly the same beginning 12 hours after the vaccine.

Shortly after sitting down for observation she began to feel extremely dizzy.  observed her condition and immediately attended to her. Fanning her to give her air and allowing her to lay her head back. informed of the need for someone to assist. After 15 minutes of the woman still not feeling better we decided to call for paramedics.  Paramedics arrived in 10 minute took vitals. Glucose 132. O2 sat 100%. BP 120/80.

                                                Minor headache, moderate nausea, dizziness occurred the evening of the injection.  Those symptoms continue the following day, along with vomiting and fatigue.  Vomiting occurred late in the evening after bending over to clean up cat vomit, which always sets off my gag reflex, but I was feeling like I could vomit before that anyway.  Also, I had just started taking Hydrochorothyozide the day of the injection and some of the things I experienced can be side effects of the medicine as well.

                                                About 5 or 6 hours after the shot , I developed body aches and chills and had a fever of 101. This lasted through the night, along with a sharp pain in my chest that developed in the night and radiated from front to back, which made it difficult to sleep. During the night, I took some rolaids and moved the couch to sleep more upright, because I think the pain may have been heartburn or some other GI thing (I rarely get this feeling, but I have had it before, and my last meal of the day was several hours before i went to bed and before my symptoms started). By morning the next day (Sunday), my whole left arm was achy, down to my hand and fingers, and my right arm also but not as severe. My left armpit felt tender (and still does today, but not as bad).  By mid-day, I started to feel better, the fever was gone, and by late afternoon, the body aches were gone. My left arm and hand was still tender, but not as bad. By Sunday night i would say I was back to about 80%, and by Monday morning, 95%, and by late Monday morning, back to normal, other than the slight tenderness I still feel (today being Tuesday) in my left armpit.

She did not have any other symptoms until 8 days later when she had 104 fever, could not walk, had stiffness in all of her muscles and aching, diarrhea.  They went to the doctor office and he did a COVID test that came back negative.  The fever still continued and her husband took her to the hospital on Tuesday 3/16/21.  They ran fluids on her and at the end of the day they said she was okay to go home.  The next day the fever started again and he ended up calling an ambulance to take her to the hospital.  She went to Hospital on 3/16, who took her to another Hospital.  They sent her home about 4 days later and said that her symptoms were from the vaccine.   He called and he filed a report with them.  They sent her home the next day, got another high fever, and her husband took her to the ER at again that evening.  She had high fever, extremes aches and pains and headaches.

Was able to roll down my window and honk horn for emt in parking lot before fainting. Woke up to emt checking blood pressure, pulse and putting oxygen mask on. Then had to throw up, continue oxygen, sat and waited about 45 minutes until I felt like I could safely drive home.  Had mild flu like symptoms starting about 3 hours later, became more moderate symptoms about 8 hours after injection - headache, fatigue, fever, body aches, nausea. Slept all next day, only remained. Still feel fatigue on Wednesday

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

Emergency Department Attending Attestation Note   See resident/PA/student note for further details of HPI, history, exam, ED course, and diagnoses.   Briefly, this is a 51 y.o. female with PMH reviewed in chart and w/ patient notable for insulin dependent diabetes, depression, prothrombin mutation, migraine, p/w concern for allergic reaction.  Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.

                                                I began vomitting in the middle of the night. This continued every 15 minutes for 13 hours straight. I was seen in the ED and was treated with IV fluids and nausea medication.

                                                Ongoing nausea - started two days after vaccine. Similar to &#34;morning sickness&#34; - starts the moment I rise in the morning (4:30 / 5:00am) and continues to approximately 11:00 am each day.  Some days are worse than others.  Enough of a feeling of queasiness to keep a small vial of peppermint oil with me at all times to quell the nausea (oil placed under nose helps).  I need to pace myself , a banana will take me over an hour to finish.  I did NOT have this prior to receiving vaccine and pray this will eventually go away.  It has been 2 weeks since vaccine.

                                                Day of shot (April 1): Immediately after shot, left arm was sore. Developed fatigue at 2pm. A few hours later, I had a 101 fever, chills, stronger fatigue, strong headache, muscle aches. Around 6pm, I began vomiting continuously. I spoke with an advice nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room. I continued to vomit until about 11:30pm, I was weak and felt like passing out a few times. Later in the evening, I took a Tylenol and finally went to sleep. On April 2nd (day after shot), I woke up with fatigue and headache, but fever was gone and I no longer vomited. I took another Tylenol and headache went away.

                                                Upon waking up the following morning, I experienced leg cramps and nausea.  As the day progressed I had an overall achiness and fatigue, often had chills, and had periodic leg cramps and head aches.   This continued into the early morning the next day, when I broke out into sweats in my sleep, and then the symptoms passed.  Total time from onset to resolution was approximately 18 hours.

I was experiencing headaches all day. The following morning on Sunday I woke up and passed out, I guess my blood pressure dropped and I don?t know why and this is never happened.  Had no appetite since Friday and maybe that?s why but my BP is 120/60 as of 10:08am AFTER I passed out at around 8:30am. I?m now feeling better all of a sudden, can drink coffee and hopefully I?ll get a shower....... oh and my joints are sore, I think whatever could go wrong , did!

                                                I felt fine until I woke up at 1am. I had extreme chills from 1am-4am. I felt really sick, nauseous. The chills broke in the morning at some point, then I just had a severe migraine and body aches. My migraine finally broke at 11pm. The following day 1/2/2021 I was back to normal and felt no more symptoms. The first day after the shot 1/1/2021 however was very bad.

                                                Slight pain and swelling at injection site.  Body ache and slight nausea and exhaustion.  Worth noting that I was so excited about getting the vaccination that I could not sleep the night before.  I blame the exhaustion and later headache on lack of sleep, food, and caffeine.  I went to bed early and took acetaminophen and slept well.  In the morning a shower, coffee and breakfast and more acetaminophen makes me almost as good as new.

By 11 hours post, I was shivering uncontrollably and had migraine-like headache.  By 13 hours post I had to shed blankets for the fever and sweating. Even taking ibuprofen the fever was high.  The next day I kept taking pain medication for severe body aches. This morning, second morning post injection, I let the pain meds wear off.  I discovered I still had body aches, occasional stabbing head pain, and tingling down my left arm and into my 3rd and 4th fingers.  Currently, third evening post injection, I?m still aching but everything is noticeably improved. I don?t need pain meds anymore.

                                                By 9 a.m. I was running a temperature of 100.1. Over the next few hours, it rose to 104.1. I had chills, a headache, a ringing in my ears, nausea and body aches. Tylenol reduced the fever, somewhat.  I still ran a fever on Tuesday. Since Wednesday, it has been between 99.8 and 100.1 and feel mostly better.

                                                Bad headache, arm and neck pain, dizziness, fatigue body aches, chills, nausea, stomachache. Did not sleep well much Friday night due to these symptoms.  Sudden pain in left side of my head about 40 min after the vaccine after I walked to the car and sat down after the 30 min wait. Pain starts as a slow dull ache, increases rather sharply, then goes away quickly. Have this pain several times or so yesterday and today even after taking ibuprofen.   Also pain in my neck with what feels like stress headaches with ibuprofen relieving it.

Took tylenol every 4-6 hours which helped only slightly.  Still felt all the same symptoms by next day as well as nauseous and light headed.  Symptoms started to improve by noon and pretty much resolved by that evening.  Total time of adverse symptoms about 24-28 hours.

Continued to feel unwell throughout the night and very nauseous and body aches.  I forced myself to vomit to relieve the nausea.  Fever spiked to 102.5 overnight and in the morning.  By noon on 3-13-21 I was able to bring the fever down but still had a horrible headache and body aches that remained until 3-14-21 morning.

Rph caught her as she started to lean forward and she almost fell but I was able to get her to turn sideways and instead lay down on bench rather than fall forward.  So she basically fainted for a minute and then laid for awhile while 911 was called. Ambulance arrived and patient remained conscious.

Three days after the injections, I came down with flu-like symptoms (achy, brain fog, headache, fatique, chills) This lasted for three days. I started to feel better for a day and then came down with upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat, fatique , stuffy nose, slight cough, brain fog, no energy, loss of appetite)  As of today over two weeks from injection, I&#39;m STILL feeling off.  Symptoms are like having a mild cold with no energy.

                                                Very painful injection! I felt this going in immediately. Probably 30 minutes after I also felt a little dizzy but I also have a chronic condition called vestibular migraine. I was fatigued later in the evening. Had full day on day after vax  because I already had things on my calendar but was dragging by the time I got home. Aches all over especially joints, head and injection site was warm to touch and somewhat swollen. Also started running fever one day after. Highest temp 101.9 . I also started having diarrhea, full on three days after. My taste and smell had been off since having covid in august, but I swear they are since taking vax. Today is Tuesday so I&#39;m now five days in and temps normal today. My body aches are also improved but my head is still a bit achy.

I used the wall to lean on to get down on the floor. Lasted  about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes with nausea. I never had vertigo.  When I went to bed I had an ache under my left breast. It eventually subsided.

                                                I woke up the day after my vaccine feeling slightly nauseous and with chills, which I expected. However, by 8:00 am I had a headache equal to the worst migraine I&#39;ve ever had. I laid in bed all day trying not to move as any movement caused intense nausea. At times, I felt that my heart was fluttering or irregular.  I vomited 3 times, but despite having eaten dinner the night before, I seemed to have nothing to throw up. I vomited clear liquid, if anything at all, which had a strong metallic taste. The vomiting was very intense, leaving me sweating and exhausted.  I fell asleep around 8:00 pm, and when my husband woke me at 9:15 to check on me, I could tell that the sharpness and intensity of the headache was gone. I still had a headache, but it was a normal headache. Today, the 10th, I woke up feeling mostly normal, just weak.

                                                Fever, muscle aches, extreme back pain, nausea.  Fever lasted one day;  muscle aches &amp; back pain lasted 3 days.  Nausea lasted 3 days, but indigestion lasted 5 days.  On day two I went for a short walk and it felt like there was a brick on my chest...I could breathe ok, but heavy feeling in my back and chest.   I walked on day 3 with no issues.  I also developed 4-5  hives on my stomach on day three which were gone on day 4. I took tylenol for the fever and aches after talking with the nurse at my doctors office. After speaking with a few female friends who had the same vaccine, they experienced similar side effects, however their husbands who received the same shot had no issues.  I am wondering if the shot is affecting women differently.

Worsening fatigue as day progressed, developed runny nose and watery eyes, pain in my arm at injection site then spreading to the rest of my body.  Took Sudafed for the cold like symptoms that evening and then in the morning. Went to sleep woke in the morning with severe fatigue, nausea, headache. At 11:00 noted that a bitter taste in my mouth that lead to loosing my sense of taste for 6 hours.  I started getting a fever, which got up to 102 degrees, took Tylenol for this. At the same time my lips started swelling, then my hands, and approximately around 1900 my buccal lining of my mouth.  Took 50mg of Benadryl which helped with swelling and went sleep.  Woke up 6 to 7 hours later and took 50mg of Benadryl for good effect. Continue to have mild fatigue, headache and nausea this morning.

                                                Same day I received the shot, I experienced naseau, fever, and chills.   On Sunday (2 days later), I awoke covered in a raised, itchy rash all over my body.   It lasted until Tuesday.   On Wednesday, I had severe muscle tightening in both calves, originating in the muscle behind my knees.  It was so painful, I couldn?t stand in one spot for longer than 10-15 seconds.   I had to either sit or walk.  I finally have relief from that pain today (Friday).

Awoke after midnight, 03.16.21 with severe headache; it persisted for about 36 hours. Slight nausea the next day (03.16.21). Slightly elevated temperature two days later (03.17.21).

Around 11:00pm, I began to feel nauseous. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep, my heart was racing. By 3:30 am I had vomited at least 5 times. Throughout the day on Monday, I was still very cold, nauseous (without vomiting) and somewhat lightheaded. It is now Tuesday and my stomach is still upset. I have not contacted my physician at this time. I have been treating myself with ginger ale, Pepto Bismol, saltines and rest. I&#39;m not 100%, but feeling much better.

She also stated that since she was asthmatic if the shortness of breath would have gotten worse she would have gone to the ER (luckily this wasn&#39;t necessary).

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 5 minutes after receiving the shot, I was sitting in my car waiting for the 15 minute monitoring period, and I passed out.  Help responded and I came out of it, and proceeded to vomit 4-5 times.  Felt weak, dizzy, nauseous.  My mom came to drive me home.  Slept the rest of the morning and had some feeling of tightness in my chest in the late afternoon and evening.  Thursday morning when I woke up, my arm was sore but I felt mostly better (still a bit of tightness in the chest).  Did not seek medical attention at this time - just monitoring symptoms as of Thursday, 4/8/21.

By around 8:45 had a temp of 99.2 aching, chills, and very hot feverish, and then began experiencing fast heart rate and feeling like I was going to pass out or vomit, wave of nausea and broke out in a cold sweat, chest tightness.  I had taken two 500 mg acetaminophen tablets from 8:45 to 9:30 p.m.  My heart rate would not slow down so 911 was called and I was taken the ER.  I was given IV fluids and Toradol.  Blood work was done and EKG showing sinus tachycardia.  After receiving the IV fluids and Toradol, felt better and was released.

In the morning around 7 am took 2 more Tylenol.  I continued to have sore throat and cough.  By Tuesday the 16th the body aches were gone but I could hardly swallow and coughing a lot so I checked online and they said I should be checked for strep throat. Went everyday care and test was negative. They could see how raw my throat was and starting of ear infection and cough so they gave me a RX for antibiotic and cough meds.

                                                I had awful nausea, loud ringing in the ears, I fainted.  The medics provided help, gave me oxygen.  I started having convulsions.   After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

                                                I got the vaccine around 3:45 PM.  I felt completely fine all day until around 10PM that night. I started feeling really cold, then suddenly my whole body started shaking uncontrollably.     I also got a fever (close to 102). I paged my dr to let  her know what was going on.    She told me to take tylenol (and advil a few hours later IF needed).  After taking  2Tylenol, the shaking stopped after a few minutes and the fever went down.   During the night i felt slightly nauseous, but i did not throw up.   I also had some stomach pain.    By the next morning, my temperature was around 99-100 throughout the day, but no more shaking.   I still had some intermittent stomach pain but it wasn&#39;t severe enough to keep me down. I was able to shower, get my kids ready for school and go about my day for the most part.   By later that day, the temperate was normal .  I am getting some headaches now, but it&#39;s been a week since the vaccine and I do periodically get headaches, so i would not say for certain it&#39;s from the vaccine.  I am also still very intermittently getting some stomach pain. I can go for hours with no pain and then some random pains that come and go.

I was really sick for the next few days. I was tired, too. The reflux made me go to the doctor - a couple weeks after vaccine. Increased symptoms of it real bad. They increased my Omeprazole dose from 20-40 mg. I have loose stools. They added a nose spray as well.  I had had my allergy shots the same week as I had my vaccine.

By 11pm when I went to bed, I felt like I had the coronavirus again. I slept with my night gown, heavy bathrobe, my sheets, comforter and another blanket and I was still freezing and achy. When I woke up the next morning, I was sweating so profusely the it was dripping off of me and getting my gown wet like I had been working out and then got in the sauna. All I did was drink hot tea. I had no appetite or energy.

So I have an uncontrollable migraine almost to the point of going to the ER. What?s stopping me going is that I do t know what else they can do that I?m not already doing.   2. Low grade fever and chills: not a big deal  3. Severe fatigue to the point that it feels like my brain is ?shutting down?; I feel like I?m passing out. Eventually fave up midday, went back to bed and been sleeping for 8 hours so far   4. Dizziness  5. Extreme nausea - keep thinking I?m going to throw up

These lasted a couple of days.  However, since the day after the vaccine, I have developed severe acid reflux and heartburn.  This occurs every time I eat anything.  I have NEVER in my life had heartburn or acid reflux; only after taking the vaccine.  I also have a heaviness in my chest and cough frequently.

Then my blood pressure went up and my heart started beating faster. I had tightness in my chest and I got a tickle like feeling at the top of my chest. I got nauseous. BP was elevated (140/85) normal 107/65.  I stayed for an hour. I was very very sleepy the whole time.  3/5/21 I still have the tickle and tightness and pressure on my chest and I am having vertigo attacks. I got a headache and pain and stiffness in my neck where I have had nerve pain injections and ablations.

As time went on, the pain spread.  My entire stomach muscles tighten up (feels like I&#39;m recovering from abdominal surgery) and then spread to the rest of my body.  Couldn&#39;t move without feeling pain.   Fatigue =  I dozed off around 7 pm and slept like I was in a coma.  Woke up around 2 am and was very confused. Muscle Fatigue = March 9th - The pain has subsided considerably Muscle Fatigue - March 10th - Still just a little sore - Can&#39;t laugh or cough without feeling pain and my back is killing me

This lasted for approximately 36 hours.  The evening of the day one day after (March 12), felt symptoms of a minor cold in the nose (itchy, drippy, tangy taste) which moved to chest cold symptoms the following morning (March 13), also minor.  Those symptoms lasted about 24 hours then subsided.

I got headachey, alternating between hot and cold chills, a little bit of nausea and extreme tiredness.   This continued for the next 5 days which seemed like they were considered mild reactions according to the CDC website.  Most concerning though, is on day 5, (3/14/21) in the evening as I was getting into bed, I started getting a red, extremely itchy rash on both my arms, my lower back and my upper legs, to the point that I could not sleep because it was so itchy and had to take Benedryl.  I have not changed anything in my diet or in the products I use on my body, so I can only attribute this reaction to this vaccine.  I am still a little itchy on my arms today 3/15/21.   I am also still getting the hot and cold chills and still have a little bit of nausea, not bad, but enough to be &#34;off&#34; certain foods.

                                                The patient was screened and was found to have multiple medical allergies but no allergies to any of the components to the Janssen vaccine.  As a precaution, the nurses advised a 30 minute observation.  She received the vaccine without complication and then was being observed and they called me over and the paramedics were also with the patient.  About 17 minutes into observation, the patient started developing chest pressure (4/10), lightheadedness, and nausea.  No shortness of breath, stridor, diaphoresis, back pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, neurologic changes, and any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis.  She was very anxious.  Further history revealed that the patient had been discharged from the hospital 6 week prior.  She initially went in for an abdominal laproscopic surgery and woke up to having 32 staples closing an abdominal incision.  They had to change from a laproscopic approach to an open abdomen approach due to complications.  She ended up with sepsis and a colostomy and was hospitalized for 2 weeks getting antibiotics.  She lives by herself and was overwhelmed before coming into the clinic for her vaccine.   The paramedics did a 12-lead ECG that showed sinus rhythm.  Vital signs and blood glucose were within normal limits.  The paramedics recommended that she go to the hospital to be checked out but she was very resistant and was tearful because she was traumatized from her previous hospitalization.  After some time, the paramedics convinced her to go to the hospital.  The paramedics hung around the emergency department and then came back once they found out that she was fine.

                                                I became very tired around 5pm, but had some things to do that evening, so I went on as normal. However, around 7pm, I began having cold chills &amp; feverlike symptoms. I knew there would be side effects, so I wasn&#39;t worried.  Later, around 8:45pm, it was everything I could do to stand up right and all I wanted to do was go to bed with ALOT of blankets on. I felt like I was going to vomit throughout the next several hours. Around 3am, I was throwing up and had diarhea. I had a massive headache as well. I had several rounds of extreme vomiting for the rest of that morning, but they were just dry heaves by then.  My head hurt so bad, I was worried.  I continued to vomit several more times that day and slept on &amp; off

Day three - Tired after walking the dog, napped and then tightness/ache in chest/lung area which continued throughout the night. I could not lie on my side or it would trigger the ache in my chest. I could breathe deeply but that also triggered the tightness. Day four (Monday) - Chest ache continued. Contacted doctor&#39;s office. Took a Tylenol that seemed to help a little and watching my blood pressure.

I had the headache and nausea throughout the night and into the morning, the chills and cramps stopped sometime during the night.  I took Tylenol at 11am.  It helped the headache a little but the nausea continued.  I took Tylenol again at 3:30pm and 9:30pm.  Went to bed at 9:30 and slept until 5:00 am this morning.  I still have a slight headache and a little nausea but feel much better today.

                                                I started experiencing chills and body aches approximately 12 hours after getting the injection.  I took my temperature (it was 99) and an Aleve. After the first 24 hours, my breathing became more shallow, and I had an increased hunger to add to the body aches.  I felt as if I had the flu.   At 36 hours after injection, I started having a head ache that caused me to be dizzy upon standing. I am making this report 46 hours after and I still have a slight headache and some nausea/excess saliva.

                                                Received injection on Sunday. Monday was nauseated and had chest pressure.  Nausea and CP came in waves and occurred about 10 times. Then stopped.   Felt &#34;off&#34; for 4 days.  Felt fine on Friday and through Wed 3/23/21 until 9:10 PM.  Developed visual changes in left peripheral bilat.  Appeared like waves in an arc.  Then began to not be able to breathe.  I had to tell myself to breathe.  Called squad, arrived 9:45pm.  BP 170/110, HR 118. By 10pm, the visual changes disappeared BUT developed chest pressure in same area as the MOnday after the vaccine.  Then became extremely nauseated, almost vomiting.  Nause came in waves for next 6 hours until it calmed down.  Then returned Wed am for several hours, again in waves along with hollow chest feeling and pain. Continued with headache off and on with brain fog the remainder of Wednseday 3/23/21.  Discussed with hospitalist at Hospital and was told to report it to the CDC as likely an adverse effect to the vaccine.  Was still in the 14 day window.     Thank you,  RN, PhD, MSN, MS, BSN

Crushing pain all over body, joints and muscles. Stabbing headache similar to a migraine. Dizziness. Diarrhea for 1 day; abdominal pain for nearly two weeks. Intermittent nausea for nearly two weeks. Felt like I had a fever, although the thermometer said 99.7. The feverish feeling lasted for 3 days. The crushing pain lasted for nearly two weeks. The dizziness was intermittent for two weeks. Got a full-blown migraine headache 4 days after vaccine. Please note: I did NOT take my nightly aspirin dose for 2 days prior to vaccine so as to not affect the immune response. I restarted my nightly dose at 11 PM,  6 hours following the vaccine. Still had all the above-mentioned symptoms.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, my right arm felt hot and was red and I also ended up with an upset stomach, had diarrhea and felt sick to my stomach. I also experienced chills, low grade fever of 99.8 and had swelling to my joints in my fingers and toes. My right arm pain radiated upwards to my neck. These symptoms lasted 12 hours and as of today I still have pain in my neck. Since 03-15-2021, I have been seeing a chiropractor for my neck pain. I see him on a weekly basis. At the chiropractor&#39;s office they apply ice, heat and do a muscle rub help with my neck pain that still is present.

                                                Difficulty taking deep breaths, dizziness that felt more like vertigo (the floor and ceiling spinning whenever I stood or sat up), exhausted to the point that I could not sit up without falling asleep.  I slept 14hrs straight for two days after the shot.  Tired after walking down the driveway and back.  Entire body aching with excruciating pain but not the left arm where the shot was taken.  Headaches were bad as well.  No appetite.  The 3rd day afterwards I felt better but still very tired.  The 4th day still tired but better.  Tylenol, caffeinated coffee and lots of water seem to help me get through this.  The fifth day afterward, I am almost 100%  but dealing with running nose and eyes which may not be related to the shot.

                                                The most concerning was hallucinations.  I saw the tooth fairy and cried for santa.  I had a fever, chills so violent that I made the bed shake - lasted for hours; severe headache that triggered a migraine, exhaustion, and nausea.  It&#39;s 2 days later and I still feel terrible.  My husband gave me a tylenol PM that night and the next day as the headache was a full blown migraine, I took naratriptain.   I still have a slight headache but want to avoid taking additional medicine if possible.

                                                I felt fatigued all week. On the fifth day I felt like I had been kicked below the belly button. I had the same type of pain as Diverticulitis below the belly button on the left side.  My doctor suggested warm compresses and Tylenol for the pain and that helped a little.  Starting around day nine I have had some Diarrhea for two days so far.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection - just a little pain in the arm where I got the injection and when raising my arm. By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

I felt so bad all day that by 9pm I went to the ER and was advised my intestines were inflamed and diagnosed with Colitis.  I was prescribed Augumentin to take for 7 days and tylenol for pain and to follow up with my PCP.

                                                My left arm started to sting immediately after getting the shot, then the stinging subsided.  My left arm started to hurt later in the day and I had pain all the way down my left arm and left side of my chest. This pain throughout my left side was not helped by Ibuprofen and  made sleep very hard.  I had intermittent sharp pain in my neck, shoulder, and left arm for days.  The injection site turned red, hot, and a raised area the size of a silver dollar appeared  and was med-red in color for about 8 days.  The color is better/ almost normal as of today, but still a hard lump under the skin and a bit itchy.  This has caused pain throughout my back and shoulders since I got the shot....but it has not been activity limiting.  I had a slight bit of nausea for a couple of days as well.  My husband had his shot just after mine and experienced  Chills , headache, and nausea at about 9:00 P.M.  His chills subsided at about 3:00 A.M.  He continued with the headache for another day/ fatigue for 2 days/ and nausea for about 5 days.  He has also had tingling in his left arm (about 7 days)  and a funny tingling on his tongue for about a week.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine (LOT#1802068) at approximately 12:00 pm on 3/16/21. During the 15 minute observation period, she expressed &#34;I don&#39;t feel good&#34; and endorsed nausea. Shortly thereafter at approximately 12:10 pm, she started to slouch and nearly fainted while sitting in a chair. She did not fall or hit any part of her body. She was easily aroused with a touch on her arm and responded to verbal questions within seconds (less than a minute). She denied trouble breathing or chest pain. She then reported nausea again and was offered a receptacle to vomit in if needed; however, she did not vomit. Patient was encouraged and instructed to sit on the floor to prevent injury in case of fall but she refused stating that she didn&#39;t think she would be able to get back up given her preexisting knee problems. Pharmacy staff offered her water, a fan, and opened windows. Her jacket was removed in order to monitor blood pressure/ pulse, which was not abnormal. Patient did not have any trouble breathing, rash, swelling, abdominal cramps, or mental status changes. She was contacted via phone a few hours later for follow up on the incident, at which time she denied any issues and reported feeling well.

I got up and walked back over to my waiting chair and my Husband got up and received his vaccine.    Besides the pain in my left arm,  I started feeling weird tingling sensations and spaced out.  When my Husband sat back down next to me,  my stomach had a burning sensation and I felt slightly nauseated.  Then I felt like I was about to faint.  My Husband and the Staff kept me from falling, The Staff brought ice packs to put on my neck.  They said I turned white and profusely sweat.   I don&#39;t remember all of it, my Husband filled in the blanks.  I started feeling better and we left @4:30.

I got the vaccine at 9am.  around 4pm that afternoon i started feeling sick.  by 7:30pm I was in bed thinking I was going die!   By midnight, I got up and tried to walk to the stairs but i was to weak to walk.  I could not sleep.  I was up for 36 hours!  I was nauseous, dizzy, weak, exhausted.  Every inch of my body had pain!!!  I was tingling all over.  I  had the chills until midnight.  My heart would race and then stop... then race again... I was having difficulty breathing!  I tried standing up but I couldn&#39;t.  I would have driven myself to the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t walk.  by noon the next day, my heart regulated, I was able to breath easier.  I was still exhausted and full of pain and tingling.  Today, I still have some pain, but no tingling.

The major fatigue, headache, and major nausea have continued from the date of receipt to today&#39;s date of 3/31/21 (13 days). The primary complaint is edema (swelling) which has made it so her shoes do not fit at this time and has been very discouraging to the patient. She has had similar responses to a Shingrix and Hepatitis A per the patient&#39;s statement as received from another pharmacy, but had recently recovered after months of diuretic (water-pill) therapy and appropriate electrolytes such as potassium.

The headache lasted a solid 24 hours almost to the point of vomiting even while taking 4 tylenol every 4 hours then my stomach was empty so I ate a few crackers, but that next night it was hard to go to sleep.  At night I suddently realized my forehead seemed larger than normal!  It really felt bigger and swollen  so I massaged it and could feel my layers of skin/dermis moving around I beleived it was the serum from the shot from all the prone position I was in for so long laying in bed.  Thankfully the next day all syptoms went away gradually and by the third day I was back to normal....at least I THINK my forehead has returned to normal so far as I can see or feel.
